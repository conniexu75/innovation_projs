https://openalex.org/W1905806846,"When accumulation of a malfolded protein in the endoplastic reticulum (ER) is induced by various adverse conditions, such as hypoxia, glucose starvation, and perturbation of calcium homeostasis, cells respond to the stress by increasing transcription of genes encoding ER molecular chaperones, a process known as unfolded protein response. The signaling is initiated by IRE1s, ER stress sensors. Alternatively, excessive stress to the ER results in apoptosis. Caspase-12 is known to be essential for this ER stress-induced apoptosis. In this study, we analyzed the detailed regulatory mechanisms of IRE1s during ER stress. We identified c-Jun N-terminal inhibitory kinase (JIK) as a binding partner of IRE1α, and JIK was seen to modulate IRE1α-TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2) complex formation and the resultant alteration to c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling from IRE1s in response to ER stress. We also demonstrated that TRAF2 interacts with procaspase-12 and promotes the clustering of procaspase-12 and its activation by cleavage in response to ER stress. These results indicate that TRAF2 plays crucial roles not only in the signaling of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway but also in activation of caspase-12 to transduce signals from IRE1s. Thus, we provide a missing link in the ER stress-induced apoptosis-signaling pathway, one which connects the stress sensor molecule IRE1 and the activation of caspase-12.

Thus, we provide a missing link in the ER stress-induced apoptosis-signaling pathway, one which connects the stress sensor molecule IRE1 and the activation of caspase-12. The endoplastic reticulum (ER)1 is sensitive to alterations in homeostasis from a variety of different stimuli, such as glucose deprivation, perturbation of calcium homeostasis, and exposure to free radicals. Under such conditions, perturbation of protein folding and the accumulation of malfolded proteins in the ER induce ER stress (1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 1211-1233Google Scholar). ER stress elicits two major cellular-protecting responses. One is the attenuation of protein synthesis, and the other is the up-regulation of genes encoding chaperones that facilitate the protein folding process in the ER known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Both responses reduce the accumulation and aggregation of malfolded proteins in the compartments of the cells (1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev... 1999; 13: 1211-1233Google Scholar). IRE1α (2Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 1812-1824Google Scholar) and IRE1β (3Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 5708-5717Google Scholar) are believed to be ER stress sensor proteins and play important roles in transducing the stress signals initiated by the accumulation of malfolded proteins from the ER to the cytoplasm and nucleus. IRE1s are known to participate in the UPR and control the expression of ER molecular chaperones. When cells are exposed to excess levels of stimuli causing ER stress, apoptotic signals are transduced from the ER and promote apoptotic cell death. It is reported that c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are activated by the accumulation of malfolded proteins in the ER (4Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science.. 2000; 287: 664-666Google Scholar). JNKs constitute a family of signal transducers that are activated by a variety of exogenous stimuli, such as growth factor deprivation, Fas or Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF α) treatments (5Latinis K.M. Koretzky G.A. Blood.. 1996; 87: 871-875Google Scholar, 6Westwick J.K. Weitzel C. Minden A. Karin M. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 26396-26401Google Scholar), anticancer drug treatments, and UV light irradiation. JNKs regulate gene expression through the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors such as cJUN or the activator protein-1 family (7Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science.. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar). The activation of JNK requires TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), a member of the TRAF family of proteins, which transduce signals from IREs. In addition, dominant-negative TRAF2, which is truncated in the N-terminal RING effector domain of TRAF2, inhibits the activation of JNK by signals from IRE1s (4Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science.. 2000; 287: 664-666Google Scholar). During apoptosis induced by ER stress, caspase-12 is localized to the ER and is activated (8Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature.. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). The activation of caspase-12 is not mediated by other stimuli. Furthermore, it has also been reported that caspase-12-deficient mice are resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis, but their cells are led to apoptosis in response to other stimuli (8Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature.. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that caspase-12 is activated during ER stress-induced apoptosis, the mechanisms of its activation by ER apoptotic signals are still unknown, and even less is known about how TRAF2 can transduce ER stress signals from IRE1s to its downstream signaling events. To address these issues in this study, we describe the identification and the characterization of interactions among the ER stress-associated molecules, and we present a picture of how they are coupled to the activation of this apoptotic signal cascade. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and were used in all experiments. cDNA plasmids encoding human IRE1α and human IRE1β were kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Kaufman and Dr. D. Ron, respectively. Human JNK inhibitory kinase (JIK), human TRAF2, and mouse procaspase-12 expression vector were obtained by reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction in our laboratory. The procaspase-12 expression vector-fused HA or FLAG tag in its C-terminal were also engineered. Rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-12 antibody was originally raised against recombinant polypeptide. The other antibodies were purchased from manufacturers, such as anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-HA epitope antibody, phosphospecific anti-JNK antibody, anti-JNK1 antibody, and anti-TRAF2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In all of the experiments, typical results from at least three repeated experiments are shown. To analyze the function of the IRE1 cytosolic domain in the apoptotic pathway, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins that interact with IRE1. Yeast cells, strain Y190, were transformed with an expression vector encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain combined with the IRE1 kinase domain. Then the yeast-expressing bait protein was transformed with an expression vector containing the cDNA library fused to its DNA activation domain. We used Matchmaker cDNA library (mRNA sources: normal whole brain pooled from nine spontaneously aborted male/female Caucasian fetuses aged 20–25 weeks, 3.5 × 106independent transformants, CLONTECH). Screenings were performed according to the manufacturer protocol. As positive and negative controls, we used packaged transformants supplied with a screening system. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer protocols. The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was adjusted to the same levels within each individual experiment. Cells were harvested at 24 h after transfection and lysed with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, 1 mg of soluble protein was incubated with 1 μg/ml antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, and proteins captured with this antibody were coprecipitated with G protein agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). Immunoprecipitates or cell lysates were loaded onto appropriate SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and immunoblotted with antibodies for detections. The activations of JNK in HEK293T cells transfected with mock vector or various expression vectors were examined at 3 h after treatment with or without stimulations. These experiments were performed using a stress-activated protein kinase/JNK assay kit (New England Biolabs). The detections of phosphorylated JNK under various conditions were also examined using cells transfected with JNK and various expression vectors. The immunoprecipitation was performed with a phosphospecific anti-JNK antibody followed by Western blotting with an anti-JNK1 antibody. Transfection, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were performed essentially as described above. Metabolic labeling with32Pi was performed as described in our previous paper (9Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Maeda M. Yui D. Manabe T. Katayama T. Sato N. Gomi F. Morihara T. Mori Y. Miyoshi K. Hitomi J. Ugawa S. Yamada S. Okabe M. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 11114-11120Google Scholar). HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with or without ER stress after the addition of32Pi. Radiolabeled lysates from each sample were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody or anti-TRAF2 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore). The filters were then exposed to x-ray film for the detection of 32P. To control for loading in this procedure, the filters were stained with the specific antibody after autoradiography. It is believed that IRE1s sense ER stress through their lumenal domains (10Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell.. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Google Scholar, 11Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Cell.. 1993; 74: 743-756Google Scholar). The cytosolic parts of IRE1s, the kinase domains and RNaseL domains, are reported to transduce ER stress signals to the downstream events to promote the transcription of ER molecular chaperones. These transduced signals are known to mediate the increase of gene expressions, such as ER molecular chaperones, prolyl peptidyl isomerases, and disulfide exchange proteins (12Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature.. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar, 13Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature.. 1988; 332: 462-464Google Scholar). In contrast, excess levels of stress in the ER result in apoptosis (14Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J. Morihara T. Yoneda T. Gomi F. Mori Y. Nakano Y. Takeda J. Tsuda T. Itoyama Y. Murayama O. Takashima A. St. George-Hyslop P. Takeda M. Tohyama M. Nat. Cell Biol... 1999; 1: 479-485Google Scholar, 15Liu H. Bowes III, R.C. van de Water B. Sillence C. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 21751-21759Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the cytosolic portion of ER stress sensor molecules can activate not only the UPR pathway but also the apoptotic-signaling pathway. To examine this hypothesis, the yeast two-hybrid systems were employed to search for genes that interact with the cytosolic kinase domain of IRE1α. As a result of screening the human fetus brain cDNA library, JIK was identified as a possible binding partner of IRE1α (data not shown). It has been reported that JIK is a human STE20-related serine/threonine kinase and that JIK activity is decreased upon epidermal growth factor receptor activation, but it is not modulated by other exogenous stimuli, such as UV irradiation, TNF-α, NaCl, H2O2, and anisomycin treatments (16Tassi E. Biesova Z. Di Fiore P.P. Gutkind J.S. Wong W.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 33287-33295Google Scholar). However, there is no information about JIK in the ER stress signaling. Because JIK is implicated in the JNK signaling, we suspected that JIK also interacts with TRAF2 and forms complexes with both IRE1s and TRAF2. To demonstrate the interactions of these molecules in mammalian cells, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells cotransfected with various combinations of expression plasmids for IRE1α-FLAG, JIK-HA, TRAF2, and mock control. Immunoprecipitations of full-length JIK-HA with the anti-HA antibody and Western blot analyses with anti-FLAG or anti-TRAF2 antibodies revealed that JIK could be coimmunoprecipitated with both IRE1α-FLAG and TRAF2 (Fig.1, A and B). The results suggested that IRE1α, TRAF2, and JIK form complexes and might influence the functions of one another. The same results were obtained when the order of precipitation was reversed (Fig. 1, A andB). During ER stress condition, it was reported that activated IRE1s could recruit TRAF2 to the ER (4Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science.. 2000; 287: 664-666Google Scholar). We also characterized the complex both in normal and the UPR-induced states. Treatments of 1.0 μg/ml and 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 3 h resulted in no significant alteration of the bindings between JIK and IRE1α compared with that of no treated control. On the other hand, the complex formation between JIK and TRAF2 was facilitated by the same stimulations as described above (data not shown). These observations mean that TRAF2 is recruited to the JIK-IRE1α complex in response to the ER stress. It is well known that ER stress activates JNKs (4Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science.. 2000; 287: 664-666Google Scholar). We speculated that JIK might play regulatory roles in JNK activation under ER stress conditions. Therefore, we measured the relative levels of JNK activity in cells that were treated with various manipulations by using an immune complex kinase activity assay. After treatments with 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 3 h, JNK was activated in 293T cells transfected with mock vectors. Overexpression of JIK resulted in the acceleration of JNK activation induced by treatment with tunicamycin. Alternatively, transfection of catalytically inactive mutant JIK(A181F183) (16Tassi E. Biesova Z. Di Fiore P.P. Gutkind J.S. Wong W.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 33287-33295Google Scholar) inhibited the activation of JNK by the same stress (Fig. 2(a)). The cell lysates were also immunoprecipitated with phosphospecific anti-JNK antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting analysis using anti-JNK1 antibody. Transfection of wild JIK caused increases in the amounts of phospho-JNK, which is known as an active form of JNK during ER stress, but mutant JIK did not increase the amounts compared with the controls (Fig. 2(b)). The results were consistent with those of the JNK kinase activity assay as described above. It has been reported that the cytoplasmic portion of IRE1s binds to TRAF2 that couples the ER stress sensor to JNK activation, and dominant-negative TRAF2 inhibits ER stress-induced c-Jun/JNK activation (4Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science.. 2000; 287: 664-666Google Scholar). As described above, we revealed that JIK activates the JNK pathway under the ER stress conditions and interacts with IRE1α. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that JIK affects the function of TRAF2 through phosphorylation to regulate the signal transduction from IRE1s to JNKs during ER stress. To investigate whether JIK influences TRAF2, we examined the phosphorylation levels of TRAF2 with or without JIK coexpression by the metabolic-labeling method using32Pi. As a result, transfection of wild JIK did not alter the expression levels of TRAF2, but the amounts of phosphorylated TRAF2 were significantly increased (Fig.3 A). At the same time in another coimmunoprecipitation experiment, we found that the overexpression of JIK also promoted interactions between TRAF2 and IRE1α (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results suggested that JIK alters the status of TRAF2 phosphorylation and that the resultant-altered TRAF2 phosphorylation may change the interactions between IRE1α and TRAF2 themselves that might regulate the activity of JNK signaling under ER stress conditions. It is still unknown whether the activation of JNK signaling by TRAF2 during ER stress is directly implicated in apoptosis. On the other hand, another group reported that ER resident caspase-12, which is one of the cystein-protease family, plays an essential role in ER stress-induced cell death (8Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature.. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). Procaspase-12 contains the caspase recruitment domain in its N-terminal region, which is known as a predicted prodomain (8Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature.. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). Because caspase recruitment domain is known as the domain that interacts with apoptosis-associated proteins, such as TRAF2, Apaf1, and other caspases (17Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1997; 22: 155-156Google Scholar), we tried to examine whether procaspase-12 is able to interact with TRAF2. Total cell lysates from HEK293T cells transfected with procaspase-12 and/or TRAF2 expression vectors were immunoprecipitated using anti-TRAF2 antibody and were immunoblotted by anti-caspase-12 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, procaspase-12 immunoreactive 60-kDa protein was detected only in TRAF2 and procaspase-12-cotransfected cells (Fig. 4, lane 3). No bands were detected in the cells transfected with either vector alone (Fig.4, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that TRAF2 directly associates with procaspase-12 under normal conditions. On the other hand, treatments of TRAF2 and procaspase-12-cotransfected cells with 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 3 h inhibited the interactions between these molecules (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and5). The same findings, such as the reduction of the coprecipitated procaspase-12 by TRAF2 during ER stress, were observed when IRE1β was overexpressed (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and7). Reverse experiments also showed similar consistent results. We ascertained that the results documented above were not attributed to the reduction of protein expression by using direct Western blotting (Fig. 4, each lower panel). It is known that procaspase-12 is cleaved in response to ER stress (8Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature.. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). We examined whether TRAF2 overexpression affected the cleavage of procaspase-12. Our results showed that the coexpression of TRAF2 with procaspase-12, in fact, emphasized the cleavage of procaspase-12 (Fig. 4(a)). This acceleration of the cleavage seems to be based on the activations of procaspase-12 as initiated by TRAF2. Overexpression of procaspase-12 in cells encouraged the cleavage of caspase-12 itself (data not shown). We hypothesized that after procaspase-12 was recruited to the ER stress signal transducer in response to ER stress, this protease was activated through homodimerization and cleavage by some protein such as calpain (18Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol... 2000; 150: 887-894Google Scholar). Initially, we tried to demonstrate procaspase-12 dimerization through coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Procaspase-12-tagged HA epitope at its C-terminal was coexpressed in 293T cells with procaspase-12-tagged FLAG at its C-terminal. After immunoprecipitation of procaspase-12 with a FLAG antibody, coprecipitating HA-tagged procaspase-12 was detected by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. As we expected, procaspase-12-tagged HA was coprecipitated only from the lysates expressing both the HA-tagged procaspase-12 and the FLAG-tagged procaspase-12 (Fig. 5,lane 3). The same results were obtained when the order of precipitation was reversed (data not shown). This procaspase-12 homodimerization was increased by both tunicamycin treatment and IRE1β expression (Fig. 5, lanes 4–7). Moreover, the overexpressions of TRAF2 also reinforced this complex formation (Fig.5, lanes 8 and 9). In addition, we found that TRAF2 increased the level of phosphorylated procaspase-12 in metabolic-labeling experiments (data not shown). These results revealed that TRAF2 plays a significant function in the oligomerization and phosphorylation of procaspase-12. TRAF2 can be divided into four subdomains. The N-terminal RING finger and the adjacent zinc finger motifs of TRAF2 are known to be required for nuclear factor κB and JNK activation (19Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 19935-19942Google Scholar). The TRAFN, which forms α-helical coiled-coil structures, and the TRAFC subdomains independently interact with TRAF2 and TRAF2-associated proteins such as TNF-R2 and TRADD (20Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science.. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Google Scholar, 21Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell.. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar). It is reported that the binding domain of TRAF2 with IRE1s is the TRAFC domain (4Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science.. 2000; 287: 664-666Google Scholar). Thus, the distinct domains of TRAF2 are involved in the recruitment of signaling molecules and in the activation of downstream effectors. The dominant-negative TRAF2 (RING finger deletion mutant, TRAF2-dR) was reported to be able to inhibit the activation of JNK signaling in response to ER stress (4Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science.. 2000; 287: 664-666Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, the nuclear factor κB activation ability of TRAF2 was also found to reside within its N-terminal half (19Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 19935-19942Google Scholar). In contrast, the self-association of procaspase-12 and its cleavage during ER stress was increased by TRAF2-dR in comparison with the mock control but not as much as by the full-length TRAF2 (Fig. 5). We also found that TRAF2 binds with procaspase-12dependent TRAFN domain by deletion mutant analysis (Fig. 6). The results suggested that the structure of TRAFN domain plays an important part for the ER stress signal transduction to caspase-12 activation. They also revealed that the ER stress signal transductions to activate the caspase-12 and to activate JNK pathway were mediated by distinct TRAF2 subdomains. However, against our expectations, none of the TRAF2 deletion mutants could get dominant-negative effects on the procaspase-12 activation (data not shown). IRE1s are known as ER stress transducers transmitting ER stress signals from the ER to cytosol and to nuclei to fold malfolded proteins. In addition, IRE1s are also reported to activate the JNK-signaling pathway mediated by TRAF2 functions in response to the perturbation of protein folding in the ER (4Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Science.. 2000; 287: 664-666Google Scholar). Also, JNK has been extensively demonstrated to be associated with apoptosis (22Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene.. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Google Scholar). Therefore, different types of signals are thought to be transduced from IRE1s, one a cell survival signal and another a death signal mediated by TRAF2. In this study, we demonstrated that TRAF2 plays crucial roles not only in the signaling of the JNK pathway, which is controlled by JIK, but also in the activation of caspase-12 to transduce signals from IRE1s under ER stress conditions. We identified JIK as a binding partner of IRE1α using a two-hybrid system. In mammalian cells, JIK had the potential to bind to both IRE1 and TRAF2, and the expression of JIK caused increases in the binding amounts of IRE1 and TRAF2 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that JIK is implicated in the modification of IRE1s-TRAF2 complex formation to regulate the transduction of the signals that are initiated by perturbation of protein folding in the ER. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that overexpression of JIK increased JNK phosphorylation and JNK activities during ER stress and that the catalytically overexpressed inactive mutated JIK inhibited the activation of JNK in response to ER stress as much as the dominant-negative form of TRAF2. As phosphorylated TRAF2 was up-regulated in synchrony with the activation of JNK when JIK was overexpressed, this JIK action on JNK signaling was possibly because of increased phosphorylated forms of TRAF2. However, it is not known whether TRAF2 is phosphorylated directly or indirectly by JIK. Previously, JIK was reported to inhibit the JNK activation induced by epidermal growth factor receptor (16Tassi E. Biesova Z. Di Fiore P.P. Gutkind J.S. Wong W.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 33287-33295Google Scholar). This finding is not consistent with our present data that JIK promoted the activation of the JNK-signaling pathway in response to ER stress. According to Tassiet al. (16Tassi E. Biesova Z. Di Fiore P.P. Gutkind J.S. Wong W.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 33287-33295Google Scholar), any stimuli except treatment with epidermal growth factor did not affect the JNK pathway, indicating that JIK may play diverse roles in modulating the signaling upstream of JNK pathway in response to various stimuli. However, at present the reasons for the discrepancy in the function of JIK are unclear. To clarify the mechanisms of the activation of JNK through JIK under ER stress conditions, further analyses are needed including identification of specific substrate(s) for JIK. Caspase-12 is known to be essential for cell death induced by ER stress. Indeed, procaspase-12 is cleaved, and the activated forms are accumulated under ER stress conditions (8Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature.. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). However to date, the mechanisms of the activation of caspase-12 in response to ER stress have not been demonstrated. This study showed that TRAF2 plays an essential role in the activation of caspase-12. In unstressed cells, TRAF2 formed a stable complex with procaspase-12. The stimuli that induce ER stress led to the dissociation of procaspase-12 from TRAF2, and simultaneously dimerization (or oligomerization) of procaspase-12 was promoted. These findings raise the possible mechanisms that the dissociation of TRAF2 from caspase-12 is a trigger for the activation of caspase-12 during ER stress and that the resultant-free procaspase-12 is clustered to the ER. Several recent studies demonstrate that procaspases, such as caspase-2, -8, and -10, can be activated through dimerization/oligomerization mediated through their prodomains. Specific adapter molecules are reported to be able to interact with these procaspases. For example, the prodomains of caspase-8 and -10 interact with the adapter molecule Fas-associated death domain protein (23Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell.. 1996; 85: 803-815Google Scholar, 24Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 26566-26570Google Scholar, 25Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell.. 1998; 1: 319-325Google Scholar). In a similar manner, caspase-2 is thought to bind the death receptor through the adapter RAIDD (24Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 26566-26570Google Scholar). It is suggested that the primary role of these adapter molecules may be to bring procaspase molecules into close proximity with each other to enable dimerization. The mechanism regarding the activation of procaspase-12 might be similar to these recent reports. Although we could not show the recruitment of procaspase-12 to IRE1s during ER stress in the present study, we cannot negate the possibility that procaspase-12 is recruited to IRE1s before oligomerization and that TRAF2 plays a role as an adapter molecule that recruit procaspase-12. Further studies are needed to elucidate the more detailed mechanisms responsible for the activation of caspase-12 focusing on the recruitment of procaspase-12 to IRE1s under ER stress conditions. In conclusion, in this study we provide a missing link in the ER stress-induced apoptosis-signaling pathway, which connects between the stress sensor molecule IRE1 and the caspase-12. We demonstrate that TRAF2 is a key mediator that transduces the signals from the ER to cytosol during ER stress. Therefore, TRAF2 might become a target molecule with which we can try to control ER stress-induced apoptosis. We thank our colleague, Akemi Arakawa, and Sachiyo Funai for participating in this work. endoplastic reticulum unfolded protein response c-Jun N-terminal kinase tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor-associated factor 2 human embryonic kidney 293T JNK inhibitory kinase hemagglutinin"

Deletion of the murine Cox-2 gene inMin mice reduced the incidence of intestinal tumors, suggesting that it is required for tumorigenesis. However, it is not known if overexpression of Cox-2 is sufficient to induce tumorigenic transformation. We have derived transgenic mice that overexpress the human COX-2 gene in the mammary glands using the murine mammary tumor virus promoter. The human Cox-2 mRNA and protein are expressed in mammary glands of female transgenic mice and were strongly induced during pregnancy and lactation. Female virgin Cox-2 transgenic mice showed precocious lobuloalveolar differentiation and enhanced expression of the β-casein gene, which was inhibited by the Cox inhibitor indomethacin. Mammary gland involution was delayed in Cox-2 transgenic mice with a decrease in apoptotic index of mammary epithelial cells. Multiparous but not virgin females exhibited a greatly exaggerated incidence of focal mammary gland hyperplasia, dysplasia, and transformation into metastatic tumors. Cox-2-induced tumor tissue expressed reduced levels of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl-xL and an increase in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, suggesting that decreased apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells contributes to tumorigenesis. These data indicate that enhanced Cox-2 expression is sufficient to induce mammary gland tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibition of Cox-2 may represent a mechanism-based chemopreventive approach for carcinogenesis.

Regulation of expression of Cox-1 and -2 is distinct; Cox-1 is expressed ubiquitously, whereas Cox-2 is induced as an immediate-early gene in most cells (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu.

Although transcriptional regulation of Cox-2 has been studied extensively, post-transcriptional mechanisms are also important for Cox-2 expression (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev.

A strong correlation has been established between the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the decreased incidence of colorectal, breast, and lung cancers (4Prescott S.M.

Cox-1 is expressed in both normal and malignant cells; however, Cox-2 is up-regulated in a high percentage of tumors (4Prescott S.M. Fitzpatrick F.A. Biochim. Biophys.

This finding was established originally in gastrointestinal tumors but has been extended to carcinomas of diverse origins (4Prescott S.M. Fitzpatrick F.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Dannenberg A.J. Rush D. Woerner B.M. Khan K.N. Masferrer J. Koki A.T. Cancer. 2000; 89: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies have indicated that high levels of Cox-2 are expressed in human mammary tumor tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissue (13Hwang D. Scollard D. Byrne J. Levine E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 14Soslow R.A. Dannenberg A.J. Rush D. Woerner B.M. Khan K.N. Masferrer J. Koki A.T. Cancer. 2000; 89: 2637-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Gene deletion studies support the concept that Cox-2 plays a critical role in the development of intestinal tumors (15Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). This work has been confirmed not only in intestinal tumors but also in carcinogen-induced model of skin cancer (16Chulada P.C. Thompson M.B. Mahler J.F. Doyle C.M. Gaul B.W. Lee C. Tiano H.F. Morham S.G. Smithies O. Langenbach R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4705-4708PubMed Google Scholar, 17Langenbach R. Loftin C.D. Lee C. Tiano H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 889: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Surprisingly however, deletion of the murine Cox-1 gene also reduced the incidence of both intestinal and skin tumors (16Chulada P.C. Thompson M.B. Mahler J.F. Doyle C.M. Gaul B.W. Lee C. Tiano H.F. Morham S.G. Smithies O. Langenbach R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4705-4708PubMed Google Scholar, 17Langenbach R. Loftin C.D. Lee C. Tiano H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 889: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The Cox-2 gene was expressed in the mesenchymal compartment in the neoplastic tissue in the mice, which is in contrast with both mesenchymal and epithelial expression in human tumors (15Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). These genetic loss-of-function studies suggest that expression of Cox-1 and -2 at the site of transformation or at some distal site is necessary for tumorigenesis. In contrast, other studies show that inhibition of Cox-2 by NSAIDs cannot account for their anti-tumor effects. For example, sulindac sulfone, a derivative of sulindac which lacks Cox-1 or -2 enzymatic inhibitory activity, induced epithelial cell apoptosis and inhibited carcinogenesis in animal models (18Piazza G.A. Rahm A.K. Finn T.S. Fryer B.H. Li H. Stoumen A.L. Pamukcu R. Ahnen D.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2452-2459PubMed Google Scholar, 19Boolbol S.K. Dannenberg A.J. Chadburn A. Martucci C. Guo X.J. Ramonetti J.T. Abreu-Goris M. Newmark H.L. Lipkin M.L. DeCosse J.J. Bertagnolli M.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2260-2556Google Scholar). Furthermore, various NSAIDs, albeit at high concentrations, inhibited growth and tumorigenicity of transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both Cox-1 and Cox-2 (20Zhang X. Morham S.G. Langenbach R. Young D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Several other targets of NSAID action have also been proposed. First, the nuclear receptor peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)∂ was induced by the APC mutation, which resulted in the transcriptional enhancement of PPAR∂ via the β-catenin pathway. High doses of NSAIDs inhibited the action of PPAR∂ on transcriptional regulation of downstream genes, suggesting that it might be one of the targets for NSAID inhibition of carcinogenesis (21He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Second, NSAIDs at high doses inhibited the activity of the nuclear factor κB pathway and thus may promote cell death in a prostanoid independent manner (22Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). These studies have raised questions about the causal role of Cox-2 in tumorigenesis and have identified potential non-Cox-2 targets of NSAID action. The question of whether Cox-2 overexpression is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis has not been addressed. In this report, we describe a genetic gain-of-function approach to examine the direct role of Cox-2 in tumorigenesis. The human COX-2gene (23Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) was cloned behind the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter (24Lane T.F. Leder P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The linearized construct was used to derive transgenic CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) in the UCHC transgenic core facility. Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA using a human Cox-2 3′-untranslated region specific probe. Three founder animals (two males and one female) were used to derive F1 and F2 hemizygotic transgenic mice. Gene expression and phenotypic analysis were done on female F1 and F2 mice derived from all three founders. For the analysis of mammary glands during involution, lactating mice at 7 days postpartum were used, and the pups were removed to induce mammary gland involution. Mammary glands were dissected, total RNA was purified, and Northern analysis for human Cox-2 (25Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar) and mouse β-casein (26Sympson C.J. Talhouk R.S. Alexander C.M. Chin J.R. Clift S.M. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. J.

A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). For analysis of Cox-2 polypeptide expression, mammary glands were homogenized in the extraction buffer containing 1% Tween 20, and Western analysis was conducted as described previously (25Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). The Cox-2 monoclonal antibody was described previously (27Jang B.C. Sanchez T.

Polyclonal antibodies for Bax, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Mammary glands were dissected, cut into 1-mm3 sections, washed extensively, and incubated with 12 μm[1-14C]arachidonic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. Medium was acidified, extracted, and prostanoids were separated and identified by TLC/autoradiography procedures as described previously (25Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cold arachidonic acid was used, and medium was analyzed for PGE2 synthesis by radioimmunoassay as described (25Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Some glands were fixed and analyzed by histological methods (28Narko K. Ristimaki A. MacPhee M. Smith E. Haudenschild C.C. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21455-21460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry for human Cox-2 was conducted as described (12Sano H. Kawahito Y.

Specificity of immunostaining was confirmed by competition with excess peptide antigen as described (12Sano H. Kawahito Y. Wilder R.L. Hashiramoto A. Mukai S. Asai K. Kimura S. Kato H. Kondo M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21455-21460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Terminal nucleotidyl transferase staining was performed as described (29Iizuka T. Sasaki M. Koike M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 478: 369-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on formallin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm) with a in situ cell death detection kit (Roche, Indianapolis) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were counterstained with methyl green (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from randomly selected fields (total of 4,000 cells/section) at a magnification of ×60). Statistical analysis was done using Student'st test. The MMTV promoter (24Lane T.F. Leder P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used to direct expression of the humanCOX-2 gene in transgenic mice (Fig.1 A). Three independent founder lines, obtained after pronuclear microinjection of the linearized construct, were bred with CD1 mice, and the hemizygous F1 and F2 mice were characterized for the studies described below. By Northern analysis, human Cox-2 transgenic mRNA was detected only in mammary glands and not in liver, lung, heart, brain, spleen, or muscle tissues (data not shown). RNA samples were isolated from the mammary gland during progressive stages of maturation. Northern blot analysis was conducted to determine the expression of endogenous murine Cox-1 and Cox-2 as well as transgenic human Cox-2 mRNA. High stringency hybridization conditions (20% formamide, 65 °C) were used to discriminate between mouse and human Cox-2 mRNAs. Only endogenous murine Cox-1 mRNA was expressed in the mammary glands of virgin mice. During lactation, Cox-1 expression was induced and returned to base line after the involution of the mammary gland in weaned mothers (Fig. 1 B). Murine Cox-2 mRNA was not detected by Northern analysis of total RNA preparations, suggesting that endogenous Cox-2 is expressed at extremely low levels during the development and involution of the mammary gland. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis for murine Cox-2 confirmed the Northern data and suggests that it is expressed at extremely low levels in normal mammary tissue (data not shown). In the human Cox-2 transgenic mice, a low level of Cox-2 mRNA was detected in mature virgin mice, but significantly higher levels were induced during pregnancy and lactation. Concomitant with the regression of the mammary gland in weaning females, the transgenic Cox-2 expression was attenuated after removal of nursing young (Fig. 1 B). The highest level of Cox-2 expression was achieved during lactation, which is consistent with the activity of the MMTV promoter (24Lane T.F. Leder P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The Cox-2 transcript was not detected by Northern analysis in non-transgenic normal mice. Expression of the human Cox-2 mRNA did not alter the expression of endogenous murine Cox-1 and -2. Immunoblot analysis of mammary tissues indicates that the human Cox-2 polypeptide accumulates concomitantly with the transcript (Fig.1 C). Immunohistochemistry of mammary tissue sections was conducted using the human Cox-2-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig.1 D). The expression of the Cox-2 transgene was observed in the mammary epithelial cells of developing alveoli. In contrast, stromal cells in the mammary gland do not express the transgenic Cox-2. Prominent perinuclear immunostaining was observed, consistent with previous studies that demonstrated endoplasmic reticulum localization of the Cox-2 polypeptide (30Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The functionality of the transgenic Cox-2 polypeptide was demonstrated by thin layer chromatorgraphic analysis of radioactive arachidonic acid metabolites secreted from mammary gland explants. As shown in Fig.1 E, enhanced synthesis of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1α, PGD2, and PGF2αwas observed in Cox-2 transgenic mammary glands compared with the age-matched normal counterparts. Quantitative analysis of PGE2 synthesis by mammary gland explants (Fig.1 F) was conducted next in mammary glands from normal as well as Cox-2 transgenic mice. Mammary glands from non-transgenic mice also exhibited an increase in Cox activity during lactation, which is consistent with the induction of endogenous Cox-1 mRNA expression. The human Cox-2 transgenic mice exhibited a higher level of PGE2 synthesis, which correlated with the expression of the Cox-2 mRNA and polypeptide. These data suggest that overexpression of Cox-2 was achieved in the mammary glands of transgenic mice, particularly during pregnancy and lactation. The mammary glands of Cox-2 transgenic mice were analyzed by morphological methods. Analysis of whole mount preparations of virgin mammary glands demonstrated abnormal and hyperplastic alveolar development (Fig. 2 A). Histological analysis of mammary sections confirmed precocious development of alveolar glands in Cox-2 transgenic mice (Fig.2 B). Northern blot analysis indicated that the expression of the β-casein, a gene normally expressed during late pregnancy and lactation, was markedly up-regulated in virgin mammary glands of Cox-2 transgenic mice (Fig. 2 C). To determine if secreted prostanoids are involved in this phenomenon, virgin mice were treated with indomethacin, a potent inhibitor of prostanoid synthesis (2Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A, C, and D, indomethacin treatment suppressed PGE2 synthesis, β-casein gene expression, and precocious alveolar differentiation. These data strongly suggest that enhanced Cox-2 expression and the concomitant secretion of prostanoids mediate the precocious mammary gland differentiation in Cox-2 transgenic mice. The Cox-2 transgenic mice lactated normally and were able to nurse their young. Histological and whole mount analysis of mammary glands from pregnant and lactating animals showed no gross abnormalities (Fig.3 A). These data suggest that exaggerated Cox-2 expression did not interfere with the physiological functions of the mammary gland. We next studied the effect of Cox-2 on mammary gland involution after weaning. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the expression of Cox-2 polypeptide decayed rapidly after weaning in Cox-2 transgenic mice. Histological analysis of mammary tissue (Fig.3 B) indicates that a delay in mammary gland involution occurred in Cox-2 transgenic mice. Mammary glands from control mice showed expected rates of epithelial cell death and collapse of the alveolar glands at 1–2 days postweaning, resulting in the regression of the mammary gland. Although mammary glands from Cox-2 transgenic mice regressed at 7 days, the rate was delayed at early stages (days 1–2), no signs of involution were apparent (Fig. 3 B). 2 weeks after weaning, the mammary glands appeared similar in both Cox-2 transgenic and normal mice. Thus enhanced Cox-2 expression at 0–2 days postweaning may have maintained the viability and function of the mammary epithelial cells. Because cellular apoptosis contributes to the involution of the mammary gland, we measured the rates of apoptosis in mammary glands of normal and Cox-2 transgenic mice after weaning using the terminal nucleotidyl transferase method (29Iizuka T. Sasaki M. Koike M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 478: 369-370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 C, significant decreases in apoptotic cells were observed in Cox-2 transgenic mice compared with non-transgenic normal mice at 2 days after weaning. These observations are consistent with the previous findings that enhanced Cox-2 expression inhibits cellular apoptosis in transfected epithelial cells (31Tsujii M. DuBois R.N.

Because pregnancy and lactation induced the Cox-2 transgene to very high levels, we compared the mammary glands from multiparous females. Focal areas of hyperplasia, also known as hyperplastic alveolar nodules, are present with high frequency in human Cox-2 transgenic mice that have undergone three or four cycles of pregnancy and lactation (Fig. 4 A). Histologic analyses of such sections indicate that alveolar hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and adenomatous carcinomas of the mammary epithelial cells contributed to these lesions. In contrast, age-matched, multiparous non-transgenic female mice did not show such tumors (Fig.4 A). The incidence of mammary tumors in Cox-2 transgenic mice and non-transgenic mice were analyzed by a combination of whole mount analysis and histological sections. As shown in Fig. 4 B, > 85% of Cox-2 transgenic mice that have undergone multiple cycles of pregnancy and lactation show the presence of tumors in mammary glands. In contrast, a very low incidence of tumors was seen in non-transgenic mice with similar age and multiparosity. Transgenic female mice derived from all three founders showed this phenomenon, suggesting that the effects are caused by the expression of the human COX-2 gene rather than integration-dependent events. Cox-2 transgenic mice that did not undergo pregnancy and lactation did not show the increased mammary tumorigenesis. Three female Cox-2 transgenic mice (the founder female and two F1 females from a different founder) developed large mammary tumors with metastatic spread. One such animal at necropsy is shown in Fig. 4 C, as an example of the presence of large metastatic tumors in and outside of the mammary glands. Histological analyses of mammary tissue from non-transgenic mice and from Cox-2-induced tumors are shown in Fig.5, A and B, respectively. In Fig. 5 B, one can observe numerous hyperplastic glandular structures, keratinizing squamous cells (indicating metaplasia), stromal proliferation, and numerous blood vessels. In Fig. 5 C, adenomatous carcinoma was observed in the peripheral lymph node. Well differentiated tumors appeared to have metastasized into the lymph nodes of the Cox-2 transgenic mice. In Fig.5 D, an example of a mammary tumor with squamous metaplasia is shown. In Fig. 5 E, an example of a hyperplastic and invasive ductal structure with hemosiderin (indicating bleeding into the ducts) is shown. These data suggest that Cox-2 overexpression induced various types of invasive mammary tumors, including ductal and lobuloalveolar carcinomas. Mammary tumors in the Cox-2 transgenic mice were stained with the Cox-2 antibody using immunohistochemical procedures (Fig. 5 F). Numerous epithelial cells in glandular structures exhibited strong immunoreactivity in the perinuclear locale. Immunoreactivity was competed by coincubation of the antibody with the Cox-2 antigenic peptide (data not shown). These data suggest that Cox-2 is expressed in the mammary tumors of Cox-2 transgenic mice. To determine if decreased apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells contributed to the Cox-2-induced tumorigenesis, we analyzed the expression of apoptotic regulatory proteins Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-xL. Expression of Bcl-2 was induced by Cox-2 overexpression in intestinal epithelial cells (31Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar), and Bax is known to regulate NSAID-induced apoptosis (32Zhang L., Yu, J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, high levels of Cox-2 polypeptide were observed in the mammary tumors and lower levels were seen in the adjacent normal tissue. In contrast, Cox-2 polypeptide was not expressed in mammary glands of multiparous, non-transgenic mice. Interestingly, expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bcl-xL was reduced in Cox-2-expressing tumors. In contrast, Bcl-2 expression was up-regulated in the tumor tissue. These data suggest that regulation of expression of apoptosis regulatory factors Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-XL may be a mechanism via which Cox-2 overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis. Together, these observations support the concept that overexpression of Cox-2 alone is sufficient to transform the mammary epithelium into a tumorigenic state. In this report, we describe a gain-of-function approach to evaluate the direct role for Cox-2 in tumorigenesis. Although studies utilizing various approaches, namely, epidemiologic, expression studies and genetic loss-of-function approaches, have implicated the functional role of Cox-2 in tumorigenesis, questions remain regarding the requirement and sufficiency of Cox-2 (4Prescott S.M.

In this study we provide evidence that overexpression of Cox-2 alone is sufficient to induce tumorigenic transformation in a tissue-specific manner. Overexpression of Cox-2 expression was achieved using the entire humanCOX-2 gene (23Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) under the control of the MMTV promoter (24Lane T.F. Leder P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Previously, we attempted to derive transgenic mice using the keratin K14- driven human Cox-2 cDNA (33Byrne C. Tainsky M. Fuchs E. Development. 1994; 120: 2369-2383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cytomegalovirus promoter-driven human Cox-2 cDNA in a tetracycline-regulated system (34Shockett P.E. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5173-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both approaches were unsuccessful. In the former case, embryonic lethality appears to be induced by the developmental expression of the transgene. In the second case, the Cox-2 cDNA was not expressed after induction in two independent lines of transgenic mice. Therefore, we used the MMTV promoter, which is known to be induced postpartum in a mammary gland-enriched manner (24Lane T.F. Leder P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2133-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, we utilized the entire human COX-2 gene to include all of the post-transcriptional signals required for efficient expression of the gene (23Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 25Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, MMTV-hCox-2 transgenic mice expressed high levels of Cox-2 transcript, protein, and enzymatic activity in the mammary glands. Specifically, expression of the transgenic Cox-2 polypeptide was induced during mammary gland development, achieved very high levels during pregnancy, and was maximal during lactation. Although the expression of Cox-2 is low in normal mammary glands, it can be induced by a high fat diet and carcinogen exposure (35Badawi A.F. Archer M.C. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 1998; 56: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Badawi A.F. El-Sohemy A. Stephen L.L. Ghoshal A.K. Archer M.C. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, significant expression of Cox-1 was observed in murine mammary tissue during all phases of mammary gland development. In addition, Cox-1 activity was induced during lactation. Cox-2 enzymatic activity followed a kinetics of induction similar to that of the mRNA and the protein, resulting in the production of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1α, PGD2, and PGF2α in the human Cox-2 transgenic mammary glands. After weaning, Cox-2 expression decayed rapidly, consistent with the short half-life of the mRNA and the protein (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar, 2Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus the MMTV-hCox-2 transgenic mouse model provides an animal model in which persistent low level expression of Cox-2 is achieved in mammary epithelial cells, and exaggerated expression of Cox-2 can be induced during pregnancy and lactation. Interestingly, MMTV-hCox-2 mice exhibited precocious development of the mammary glands as virgins. This is most likely the result of the secretion of prostanoids because indomethacin treatment reversed the changes. Mammary development is controlled by hormonal factors as well as by local signals (37Cardiff R.D. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is known that PGE2 induces mammary epithelial cell proliferation (38Imagawa W. Bandyopadhyay G.K. Wallace D. Nandi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 135: 509-515Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, PGE2 is known to induce aromatase, an enzyme involved in the local biosynthesis of estrogen, a potent inducer of mammary gland development (39Zhao Y. Agarwal V.R. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5739-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, low level persistent expression of Cox-2 may induce precocious mammary gland development via the secretion of PGE2. MMTV-hCox-2 transgenic mice exhibited a delayed mammary gland involution after weaning. Mammary gland involution is accompanied by rapid decay of Cox-2 expression, consistent with the knowledge that Cox-2 mRNA has a rapid turnover rate (23Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 27Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Liu C.H. Creminon C. Huang C.K. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39507-39515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cox-2 expression in epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract is associated with inhibition of apoptosis (31Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). Mammary gland involution is brought about in part by apoptosis of epithelial cells (40Furth P.A. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, analysis of apoptotic rates by terminal nucleotidyl transferase assay indicates that Cox-2 overexpression resulted in decreased apoptotic cells. However, the effect on inhibition of mammary gland involution was transient because the Cox-2 expression decayed rapidly. These data suggest that Cox-2 overexpression may dysregulate the normal homeostatic mechanisms in the mammary gland by inhibition of apoptosis. Mammary tumorigenesis occurred with high frequency in MMTV-hCox-2 transgenic mice after multiple rounds of pregnancy. The tumor incidence was high in all three lines of mice, suggesting that Cox-2 overexpression, rather than integration-dependent effects, were involved. The tumors were invasive and malignant, and secondary metastases were observed. The lag period of tumorigenesis may suggest the requirement for exaggerated induction of Cox-2, which occurred only during pregnancy and lactation. Indeed, low level expression of Cox-2 in virgin mammary gland did not result in spontaneous development of tumors. Alternatively, it is possible that a high level of Cox-2 induction and a second mutation are required to transform the mammary epithelium completely. Indeed, proliferating epithelial cells in the pregnant mammary gland may be more susceptible to mutagenic events of critical tumor suppressor genes. This observation is similar to the phenotype of other transgenes such as MMTV-cyclin D1 and MMTV-stromelysin (41Sternlicht M.D. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 42Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these findings point out that overexpression of Cox-2 alone is sufficient to induce tumorigenic transformation. The molecular mechanisms responsible for Cox-2 induction of tumorigenesis are unclear at present. Secreted prostanoids may interact with plasma membrane-localized G protein-coupled receptors to induce mitogenic or anti-apoptotic signals (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar, 2Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Alternatively, nuclear receptors such as PPARγ and PPARδ, which are activated by prostanoids, may be involved (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar, 2Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). The possibility that the peroxidase action of Cox-2 is involved in tumorigenesis also cannot be ruled out at present (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar, 2Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The animal model described in this study may provide a useful system to begin to address these issues. However, Cox-2-induced tumors expressed high levels of Cox-2, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and reduced levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and Bax. This suggests that Cox-2 may regulate expression of these death-regulatory proteins and thus inhibit apoptosis and contribute to tumorigenesis. In agreement, the Cox-2 transgenic mice exhibit reduced apoptotic rates after mammary gland involution. Many risk factors for human breast cancer induce Cox-2 expression. For example, dietary n-6 fatty acids, activation of HER/Neu signaling, Wnt signaling, as well as carcinogen exposure induceCox-2 gene expression (5Taketo M.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1529-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 8Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N.

In addition, data from carcinogen-induced rodent models of mammary cancer suggest that Cox-2 inhibition reduces the incidence of mammary tumors (10Nakatsugi S. Ohta T. Kawamori T. Mutoh M. Tanigawa T. Watanabe K. Sugie S. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2000; 91: 886-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Harris R.E. Alshafie G.A. Abou-Issa H. Seibert K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2101-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the concept that overexpression of Cox-2 in the mammary epithelium is sufficient to induce mammary carcinogenesis. Coupled with the strong epidemiological evidence of NSAID usage and cancer incidence in humans (7Thun M.J. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1996; 25: 333-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), these findings strongly support the notion that dysregulated and exaggerated expression of Cox-2 are strong carcinogenic risk factors. Whether inhibition of Cox-2 in high risk populations would confer an anti-cancer benefit in human breast cancer warrants further study. However, efforts to define chemopreventive agents that work via Cox-2 inhibition will be greatly facilitated by this human Cox-2 transgenic model. Furthermore, mechanistic studies and identification of downstream genetic targets of Cox-2 action may be readily approached in this model. We thank M. Keough for help with mouse procedures, Dr. D. DeWitt for the gift of mouse Cox probes, Dr. Steven Clark for transgenesis protocols, Dr. Cristophe Creminon for the Cox-2 antibody, and Dr. Gilbert Jay for helpful comments."

During tumor growth PTN can serve as an angiogenic factor and drive tumor invasion and metastasis. To identify a receptor for PTN, we panned a phage display human cDNA library against immobilized PTN protein as a bait. From this we isolated a phage insert that was homologous to an amino acid sequence stretch in the extracellular domain (ECD) of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In parallel with PTN, ALK is highly expressed during perinatal development of the nervous system and down-modulated in the adult. Here we show in cell-free assays as well as in radioligand receptor binding studies in intact cells that PTN binds to the ALK ECD with an apparentKd of 32 ± 9 pm. This receptor binding is inhibited by an excess of PTN, by the ALK ECD, and by anti-PTN and anti-ECD antibodies. PTN added to ALK-expressing cells induces phosphorylation of both ALK and of the downstream effector molecules IRS-1, Shc, phospholipase C-γ, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Furthermore, the growth stimulatory effect of PTN on different cell lines in culture coincides with the endogenous expression of ALK mRNA, and the effect of PTN is enhanced by ALK overexpression. From this we conclude that ALK is a receptor that transduces PTN-mediated signals and propose that the PTN-ALK axis can play a significant role during development and during disease processes.

Obviously, understanding of PTN-mediated signal transduction as well as identification of a receptor for PTN would enhance studies on the biology and pathology of this growth factor family.Our previous studies have shown that the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI 3-kinase pathways is required for mitogenic activity of PTN, and we had found that the adaptor molecule Shc participated in signal transduction (15Souttou B.

More recently, several cell membrane-located proteins were shown to bind PTN at low affinity and serve as potential coreceptors or modulators of signal transduction (18Kojima T. Katsumi A.

Because of the high levels of expression of PTN during the perinatal development of the nervous system, we hypothesized that fetal brain would most likely also express a PTN receptor. We therefore panned a human fetal brain cDNA phage display library over several rounds against purified PTN that had been tested for biological activity (15Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). From this we isolated a phage insert homologous to an amino acid sequence stretch in the ECD of the receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a recently described orphan receptor with an apparent molecular mass of 200–220 kDa (22Iwahara T.

Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Similar to PTN, ALK is highly expressed during perinatal development of the nervous system and down-modulated in the adult (3Li Y.S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K. Watson M.A. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).The ALK tyrosine kinase domain was originally discovered because of its oncogenic activity resulting from a t(2,5) translocation and fusion of the ALK intracellular domain with nucleophosmin (24Morris S.W.

More recently, the full-length ALK protooncogene was cloned as a transmembrane receptor (22Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 23Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) of an apparent molecular mass of ∼220 kDa. The closest homologue of ALK is leukocyte-tyrosine kinase (LTK) (25Krolewski J.J. Dalla-Favera R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2911-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a smaller (100 kDa) transmembrane protein that lacks 60% of the N terminus of the ECD of ALK. We now describe PTN as an activating ligand for the ALK orphan tyrosine kinase and show in receptor binding studies in intact cells as well as in cell-free binding studies with PTN and the ALK ECD that ALK is a receptor for PTN.DISCUSSIONA number of laboratories have been studying the signal transduction of the PTN growth factor family (reviewed in Ref. 14Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Bicknell R. Lewis C.M. Ferrara N. Tumour Angiogenesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 273-289Google Scholar) and have sought after a receptor for this growth factor. Our current studies provide evidence that PTN is a ligand for the orphan receptor ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase). The receptor binding and signal transduction studies reported here were initiated after a phage display screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library with the PTN protein as the bait. This screen resulted in the isolation of a phage containing an insert homologous to a small fragment in the ECD of the protooncogene ALK. The oncogenic ALK kinase was originally discovered in a chromosomal (2Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar, 5Fang W.J. Hartmann N. Chow D. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) translocation associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. In this translocation the 3′-half of the ALK gene (i.e. the intracellular portion of ALK with the kinase domain) is fused to the 5′-portion of the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene (Fig. 1 a and Ref. 24Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). This fusion generates a constitutively active ALK kinase because of the dimerization of NPM-ALK via the NPM region (32Fujimoto J. Shiota M. Iwahara T. Seki N. Satoh H. Mori S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4181-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 33Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Several more recent studies have suggested that genes other than NPM can be fused to the ALK kinase and may serve as dimerization and activation domains (34Hernandez L. Pinyol M. Hernandez S. Bea S. Pulford K. Rosenwald A. Lamant L. Falini B. Ott G. Mason D.Y. Delsol G. Campo E. Blood. 1999; 94: 3265-3268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lamant L. Dastugue N. Pulford K. Delsol G. Mariame B. Blood. 1999; 93: 3088-3095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activated ALK kinase can act as an oncogene in different cell systems and induce malignant transformation of fibroblasts (32Fujimoto J. Shiota M. Iwahara T. Seki N. Satoh H. Mori S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4181-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 36Bai R.Y. Dieter P. Peschel C. Morris S.W.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as well as Ba/F3 murine pro-B lymphoid cells (36Bai R.Y. Dieter P. Peschel C. Morris S.W. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6951-6961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, retroviral transduction of murine bone marrow with an expression vector for NPM-ALK resulted in B-cell lymphoma in animals transplanted with the transduced bone marrow (38Kuefer M.U. Look A.T. Pulford K. Behm F.G. Pattengale P.K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Blood. 1997; 90: 2901-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the ALK kinase sequence from the NPM-ALK oncogene was used by two different laboratories to clone the full-length ALK receptor (22Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 23Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This work showed that this receptor contains a transmembrane region and a large ECD that comprises over 60% of the protein (Fig. 1a).A number of independent studies showed that PTN is expressed in a tightly regulated manner during perinatal organ development and in selective populations of neurons and glia in the adult (reviewed in Ref.14). Northern blot analysis of different tissues showed that the ALK mRNA is mostly expressed in the brain and spinal cord. In situ hybridization studies revealed that ALK expression in mice initiates late during embryonic development (around embryonic day 11), peaks during the neonatal period, but persists into adulthood in a few select portions of the nervous system such as the thalamus, mid-brain, and ganglionic cells of the gut. Immunoblotting with anti-ALK antibodies corroborated the tissue expression and developmental regulation of ALK at the protein level (22Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 23Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Interestingly, more recent immunohistochemistry studies with human tissues showed that the ALK protein is expressed in the normal central nervous system, in particular in some neurons as well as glial cells and is also found in endothelial cells in these tissues (39Pulford K. Lamant L. Morris S.W. Butler L.H. Wood K.M. Stroud D. Delsol G. Mason D.Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression profiles of ALK and PTN suggest that this growth factor/receptor pair may play an important role in the normal development and function of the nervous system. However, the expression of ALK in endothelial cells in tissues (39Pulford K. Lamant L. Morris S.W. Butler L.H. Wood K.M. Stroud D. Delsol G. Mason D.Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in cell culture (Table I) suggests a potentially broader role of PTN/ALK.A comparison of ALK mRNA expression and PTN response of 10 different cultured cell lines indicates that cells that lack ALK expression also fail to show a growth response to PTN and vice versa (Table I). Based on the lack of a PTN response of ALK-negative cells, it is tempting to speculate that there are only few distinct ALK-related receptors for PTN. To find potential ALK homologues in addition to the known LTK (22Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 23Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), we used the ALK ECD protein sequence for a search of currently available data bases. From this search only sequences coding for ALK (in different vertebrate and invertebrate species) and LTK were identified. This search was done in different modes against the protein data bases as well as with the broader “tblastn” algorithm that searches the nucleotide data bases (nr, EST, htgs, and Drosophila) and reveals any DNA sequences that code for homologous protein fragments. Interestingly, the Drosophila ALK contains the putative ligand binding region in the human ALK ECD and also shows the same signature sequence (MAM domains; Fig. 1 a) in the vicinity of this region. In contrast to ALK, the human and murine LTK proteins only comprise short ECDs and lack this putative receptor binding portion present in the ALK ECD, and we speculate that LTK might act as a coreceptor for ALK. TheDrosophila genome contains at least one gene homologous to the PTN growth factor family (“miple”; GenBankTM accession number AF149800), suggesting that a PTN/ALK interaction is also possible in invertebrates.In our studies we have mostly focused on the role of PTN and ALK in human cancers. We and others demonstrated that PTN can be a rate-limiting factor for tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (8Chauhan A.K. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21358-21363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Czubayko F.

ALK could be involved in the activity of PTN as an angiogenic factor, because ALK was found expressed in endothelial cells in culture (Table I) as well as by immunohistochemistry in the endothelium of human tissues (39Pulford K. Lamant L. Morris S.W. Butler L.H. Wood K.M. Stroud D. Delsol G. Mason D.Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, ALK might be a target for the stimulation of stromal and mesenchymal responses to tumor-derived PTN because of its expression in fibroblasts as well as glial cells (Table I and Ref. 22Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 23Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, and 39Pulford K. Lamant L. Morris S.W. Butler L.H. Wood K.M. Stroud D. Delsol G. Mason D.Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 1394-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, coexpression of PTN and of ALK in cancer cell lines (e.g. Colo357 pancreatic cancer, Hs578T breast cancer, and U87 glioblastoma; Refs. 14Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Bicknell R. Lewis C.M. Ferrara N. Tumour Angiogenesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 273-289Google Scholar and40Weber D. Klomp H.J. Czubayko F. Wellstein A. Juhl H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5284-5288PubMed Google Scholar)2 indicates that PTN and ALK could form an autocrine loop of growth stimulation (41Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Nature. 1985; 313: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) of the tumor cells.The intracellular domain of ALK is highly homologous to the LTK kinase and to the protooncogene ros as well as the insulin receptor/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor kinases (22Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Furthermore, earlier studies have demonstrated that IRS-1 associates with NPM-ALK (32Fujimoto J. Shiota M. Iwahara T. Seki N. Satoh H. Mori S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4181-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) as well as with LTK (42Ueno H. Hirano N. Kozutsumi H. Saski K. Tanaka T. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20135-20142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 43Ueno H. Sasaki K. Kozutsumi H. Miyagawa K. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and appears to be required for growth simulatory or transforming activity. Finally, our finding that IRS-1 is one of the signal transduction molecules that is phosphorylated in response to PTN (Fig. 3d) also assigns the ALK receptor more to the insulin receptor family. Although the phenotypic significance of IRS-1 for PTN/ALK-mediated signal transduction remains to be tested, it is likely that the IRS-1 docking protein will play a role in PTN growth or survival signals. This would add the PTN/ALK receptor to the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1/interleukin-4 group of receptors that utilize IRS-1 as a major docking protein (for a recent review see Ref. 2Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar).In addition to IRS-1, the docking protein Shc was shown to be utilized by LTK for signaling through the Ras pathway (44Ueno H. Honda H. Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Sasaki K. Miyagawa K. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that Shc is phosphorylated by PTN signaling through ALK (Fig. 3c), and we showed earlier that Shc is phosphorylated in response to PTN (15Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast to Shc, IRS-1 not only mediates Ras signaling initiated by LTK activation via a chimeric EGF-R/LTK receptor but also cell survival through PI 3-kinase (44Ueno H. Honda H. Nakamoto T. Yamagata T. Sasaki K. Miyagawa K. Mitani K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3067-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This finding coincides with our earlier studies on the signal transduction of PTN through PI 3-kinase (15Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as the PTN/ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3c). Finally, we demonstrate phosphorylation of PLC-γ in response to PTN stimulation of SW-13/ALK cells (Fig. 3c). This finding corroborates PLC-γ binding to the activated NPM-ALK kinase in Ba/F3 and Rat-1 cells (36Bai R.Y. Dieter P. Peschel C. Morris S.W. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6951-6961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PLC-γ activation was suggested as a crucial step for mitogenic activity of the ALK and potentially the LTK kinase (36Bai R.Y. Dieter P. Peschel C. Morris S.W. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6951-6961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Kozutsumi H. Toyoshima H. Hagiwara K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2991-2998PubMed Google Scholar). Typically PLC-γ is activated by fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor in a variety of cell lines (46Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Although the sequence homology of the kinase domain and IRS-1 signaling assigns the ALK/LTK kinases to the insulin receptor family, a role of PLC-γ suggests an overlap with other growth factor receptors and would be in line with an effect of PTN on cell lines of distinct germ layer origin (Table I; reviewed in Refs. 2Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar and 47Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the identification of ALK as a receptor for PTN will be the basis for studies into the physiological as well as pathological functions attributed to this growth factor. PTN can induce neurite outgrowth and is thought to play a role during neonatal brain development and maintenance of neuronal function (Ref. 4Rauvala H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 14Schulte A.M. Wellstein A. Bicknell R. Lewis C.M. Ferrara N. Tumour Angiogenesis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 273-289Google Scholar). Furthermore, dysregulation of PTN has been described in neurodegenerative disease processes (48Yeh H.J. He Y.Y. Xu J. Hsu C.Y. Deuel T.F. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is conceivable that studies of ALK in conjunction with PTN will generate novel insights into the mechanisms underlying these diseases. Beyond a role in the nervous system, PTN plays a significant role for tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in some of the most aggressive human cancer types, e.g. melanoma and pancreatic cancer (10Czubayko F. Schulte A.M. Berchem G.J. Wellstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,11Schulte A.M. Lai S. Kurtz A. Czubayko F. Riegel A.T.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5284-5288PubMed Google Scholar). Also, ALK is expressed in a significant portion of human cancer cell lines, and it is tempting to speculate that blockade of ALK could be of therapeutic benefit in cancers or other diseases in which PTN plays a pathological role. Polypeptide growth factors induce their effects by interacting with cell surface receptors. Frequently these receptors are composed of an extracellular ligand-binding domain (ECD),1 a single transmembrane region and may contain an intracellular kinase domain. Upon binding, ligands induce protein kinase activity and signal via intracellular adaptor or effector molecules that are recruited to the intracellular domain and modulate phosphorylation of downstream targets (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 2Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). Here we identify a receptor for pleiotrophin (PTN), a growth factor initially described a decade ago and shown to induce mitogenesis in cultured cells of epithelial, endothelial, and mesenchymal origin as well as neurite outgrowth in n"

In this study, we show that the survival role of GR activation extends to protecting human breast cancer cells undergoing apoptosis after growth factor deprivation. Serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (sgk), a gene previously identified as a direct transcriptional target of the activated GR in a rat mammary tumor cell line, was rapidly induced after GR activation in human mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, in the absence of all growth factors, ectopic sgk expression inhibited apoptosis, suggesting that SGK is a survival kinase. Finally, kinase-dead SGK expression inhibited the protection from apoptosis usually seen after GR activation. These findings suggest that SGK is an important downstream target of GR-mediated survival signaling and that it is distinct from other survival kinases because it can be primarily regulated at the level of transcription.

Furthermore, studies in both breast and liver epithelial cells have demonstrated that RU486, a potent GR antagonist that inhibits GR-mediated transcriptional activation, reverses the survival effect of glucocorticoids (3Moran T. Gray S. Mikosz C. Conzen S. Cancer Research. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar, 4Evans-Storms R. Cidlowski J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The antagonistic effects of RU486 on cell survival suggest that glucocorticoid-mediated survival is regulated specifically through GR-induced transactivation of downstream genes. Previous studies using glucocorticoid concomitantly with or without the GR antagonist RU486 have suggested that the identification of genes directly induced or repressed by GR activation might reveal important pathways relevant to epithelial cell survival signaling. One such GR-inducible gene, serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (sgk), encodes a serine/threonine kinase with 54% homology in its catalytic domain to the well described antiapoptotic kinase AKT.sgk was originally identified through subtractive cloning of a serum and glucocorticoid-induced mammary tumor cell cDNA library (5Webster M. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). More recently, sgk was found to be part of a larger gene family and was designated sgk-1 (6Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Interestingly,sgk has also been shown to be transcriptionally induced after activation of a variety of steroid receptors including the mineralocorticoid receptor in kidney epithelial cells (7Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Canessa C. Cleaveland E. Aldrich G. Fejes-Toth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16973-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor in ovarian granulosa cells (8Alliston T. Maiyar A. Buse P. Firestone G. Richards J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1934-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).sgk transcripts have also been shown to be induced after changes in cell volume (9Waldegger S. Barth P. Raber G. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4440-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and under conditions of extracellular hyperosmotic stress (10Bell L. Leong M. Kim B. Wang E. Park J. Hemmings B. Firestone G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25262-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this report, we have extended our original investigation of GR-mediated survival signaling from the nontumorigenic MEC cell line MCF10A to breast cancer cell lines. Although only a subset of commonly studied human breast tumor cell lines undergo significant apoptosis after growth factor deprivation, most of these growth factor-dependent cell lines were protected from apoptosis after treatment with physiological concentrations of glucocorticoid. Furthermore, the effect of glucocorticoid appears to be GR-mediated because it can be out-competed by high affinity GR antagonists. We also demonstrate that the GR survival signal is likely to be transmitted at least in part as a consequence of the transcriptional activation ofsgk since (i) sgk mRNA is induced in a GR-dependent fashion immediately after glucocorticoid treatment of human MECs, (ii) ectopic SGK expression protects MECs from apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal, and (iii) expression of a kinase-dead SGK inhibits protection from apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest the existence of a novel GR-initiated antiapoptotic pathway that operates, at least in part, through transcriptional induction of the survival kinase gene,sgk. pOG-hSGK was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Siegfried Waldegger (University of Hamburg, Germany). The human sgk cDNA fragment was amplified from pOG and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the retroviral vector pLPCX (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by applying a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy that incorporated a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in-frame in the amino terminus of wild type SGK using the following primer (Life Technologies, Inc.): wild type HA-SGK, 5′-TAATACTCGAGGCTCCATCATGTACCCATATGACGTTCCAGACTACGCTACGGTGAAAACT-3′. ΔN60 HA-SGK was similarly constructed by inserting an HA tag in-frame 5′ to the coding sequence for amino acid 61 of SGK: ΔN60 HA-SGK, 5′-GGAATTCCTAAGCGTAGTCTGGAACGTCATATGGGTATACCCCTGCATCAGT-3′. The carboxyl-terminal primer for both constructs was 5′-GGAATTCCTCAGAGGAAAGAGTC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction mixtures were supplemented with 10% Me2SO and run withPfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) with an initial 95 °C, 5 min denaturation followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min, and a final 72 °C for 5 min elongation. Mutations were confirmed using primers provided with the pLPCX vector by overlapping bidirectional sequencing using an ABI776 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All parental cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). MCF10A and MCF10A-Myc cells (as described in Moran et al. (3Moran T. Gray S. Mikosz C. Conzen S. Cancer Research. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar)) were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), human recombinant EGF (10 ng/ml), and bovine insulin (5 μg/ml; Sigma). BT-20, Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SK-BR-3, and T-47D cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA). MCF7 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, and HCC1937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. Retroviruses were made by transient transfection of retroviral vectors into amphotropic Phoenix cells (a gift of Dr. Gary Nolan, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA) using either standard calcium phosphate precipitation or Effectene transfection reagent per manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). MECs were infected as described previously (3Moran T. Gray S. Mikosz C. Conzen S. Cancer Research. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar) with HA-SGK-expressing retroviruses, and clones were selected with puromycin (400 ng/ml). Individual colonies were tested for HA-SGK expression by Western analysis using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Cells were trypsinized and seeded subconfluently at 1 × 105 cells/3-cm well in the appropriate media. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight, rinsed twice with PBS, and subsequently cultured for 72 h in serum-free media containing insulin, EGF, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone (10−6m), or combinations of these purified growth factors in the concentrations listed above. In GR antagonist assays, RU486 (5 × 10−7m; Sigma), dexamethasone 21-mesylate (DM, 10−7m; Steraloids Inc, Newport, RI), and dexamethasone oxetanone (10−5m; a gift of Dr. Stoney Simons, National Institutes of Health) were added to media containing glucocorticoid. In some experiments, cells were pre-treated for 30 min with serum-free media and 50 μm LY294002 (Calbiochem) or vehicle alone (0.01% Me2SO in PBS) followed by the addition of appropriate growth factors. After a 72-h incubation, media and floating debris were gently aspirated from wells and replaced with 2 ml of fresh serum-free media; cells were then immediately fixed by adding 500 μl of 37% formaldehyde to each well in a dropwise fashion and incubating at room temperature for 30 min. The fixative solution was subsequently aspirated, and fixed cells were allowed to dry overnight. To score for apoptosis, cells were then stained with a 1 μm4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/PBS solution as described previously (11Kennedy S. Wagner A. Conzen S. Jordan J. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). A Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with UV illumination at 600× magnification was used to count at least 200 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol -stained cells per well to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells per experimental condition. All apoptosis assays were repeated a minimum of three separate times to calculate averages and S.E. Equal numbers of cells (1 × 105) were cultured in 3-cm dishes overnight. The following morning, cells were washed twice on ice with ice-cold PBS and lysed directly in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Whole cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells with a rubber spatula, passing lysates 10 times through an 18-gauge needle, and then boiling for 5 min. Samples were then electrophoresed in 8 or 9% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Osmonics, Minnetonka, MN). Equal protein loading was confirmed by visual inspection of Ponceau S staining of the nitrocellulose membrane. Nitrocellulose was then rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween and incubated with one of the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-GR (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) or rat monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). After primary antibody incubation and extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, the appropriate secondary antibody, either anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-rat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), was added at a 1:5000 dilution. The nitrocellulose was washed again with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, incubated in ECL substrate according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), exposed to film, and developed. Blots were subsequently probed with a mouse β-actin antibody (Sigma) or a mouse GAPDH antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) as a loading control. MCF10A-Myc cells stably expressing various SGK constructs (see above) were lysed as described in Park et al. (12Park J. Leong M. Buse P. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Two mgs of lysate, measured by Bradford assay, were then used to immunoprecipitate SGK. Specifically, lysates were incubated with rat monoclonal HA antibody-coated 4B Fast Flow protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated SGK was then used in a kinase assay as described in Park et al. (12Park J. Leong M. Buse P. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Incorporation of [α-32P]dATP into SGK-tide was counted on a Packard 2200CA γ counter, and the assay was repeated to obtain average [α-32P]dATP incorporation. MCF10A-Myc and MDA-MB-231 cells were trypsinized, seeded in equal numbers in 10-cm dishes, and allowed to grow in the appropriate media. When cells reached ∼80% confluency, media was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in serum-deprived (0.5% FCS) media for 72 or 96 h. After serum deprivation, cells were stimulated for 30 min with either vehicle alone (ETOH), dexamethasone, dexamethasone/RU486, or 20% FCS. Total RNA was harvested using the RNeasy mini kit per manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry, and 20 μg of RNA per experimental group was electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose, 17% formaldehyde gel and then transferred onto Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were then sequentially hybridized with a full-length human sgk cDNA probe and a rat gapdh cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). Membranes were then washed and exposed to film. Bands were quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer so that the relative ratio ofsgk:gapdh signal could be determined. Experiments were repeated at least two times to calculate average ratios ofsgk:gapdh mRNA intensities and S.E. The kinase-dead mutation (K127M HA-SGK) and the phosphorylation site mutations (T256A and S422A HA-SGK) of HA-tagged hSGK were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) per the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were synthesized to alter either the hSGK ATP-binding site, lysine 127, to methionine or the putative phosphorylation sites threonine 256 or serine 422 of hSGK to alanine. Primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) consisted of the following sequences: K127M HA-SGK, 5′-TTCTATGCAGTCATGGTTTTAAAGAAGAAAGCAATC-3′; T256A HA-SGK, 5′-CACAACAGCACAACATCCGCATTCTGTGGCACGCCGGAG-3′; S422A HA-SGK, 5′-GCCGAGGCTTTCCTGGGCTTTGCCTATGCGCCTCCC-3′ (the mutated codons are underlined). The template DNA used was HA-tagged pLPCX-hSGK. Mutations were confirmed using primers provided with the pLPCX vector by bidirectional sequencing using an ABI776 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mutant pLPCX-SGK vectors were then used to generate retroviruses and infect MECs as described above. We previously demonstrated that GR activation initiates a potent antiapoptotic signal in the nontumorigenic MEC line MCF10A and its derivative line MCF10A-Myc. In the current study, we wished to determine whether GR activation might also inhibit apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. We therefore selected eight commonly studied breast cancer cell lines (BT-20, HCC1937, Hs578T, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SK-BR-3, and T-47D) and evaluated them for GR expression. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts using affinity-purified anti-human GR antibodies revealed that all eight cell lines expressed the GR protein (Fig.1 A), although as previously reported, the T-47D line had relatively little GR expression (13Horwitz K. Zava D. Thilagar A. Jensen E. McGuire W. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 2434-2437PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu K. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1294-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Nordeen S. Kuhnel B. Lawler-Heavner J. Barber D. Edwards D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To examine whether glucocorticoid treatment can mediate a survival pathway in these tumor cell lines, apoptosis was measured after 72 h in the absence of all growth factors (including glucocorticoid) and in the presence of a physiological concentration (10−6m) of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. In the absence of all growth factors, the average percentage of apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines varied from 10.6% in MDA-MB-231 cells to only 0.6% in MCF7 cells (Fig.1 B). In four of the eight tumor cell lines tested, MDA-MB-231, BT-20, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-468, treatment with dexamethasone significantly inhibited apoptosis when compared with complete growth factor deprivation (p < 0.05). To determine whether glucocorticoid-mediated survival was functioning specifically through activation of the GR, MCF10A-Myc and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated concomitantly with dexamethasone and one of three known antagonists of GR activation and its subsequent transcriptional activity: RU486 (5 × 10−7m) (16Cairns C. Cairns W. Okret S. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), dexamethasone oxetanone (10−5m) (17Lamontagne N. Mercier L. Pons M. Thompson E. Simons S.J. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 2252-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or dexamethasone 21-mesylate (10−7m) (18Richard-Foy H. Sistare F. Riegel A. Simons S.J. Hager G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). All three GR antagonists reversed the antiapoptotic effect of glucocorticoids significantly (p < 0.05), although to varying degrees depending on the cell line examined (Fig. 2 B). In MCF10A-Myc cells, RU486 co-treatment was the most potent antagonist of glucocorticoid-mediated survival, resulting in a 4.5-fold increase in apoptosis. In MDA-MB-231 cells, however, DM was the most potent antagonist of survival signaling by glucocorticoid, resulting in a similar 4.5-fold increase in apoptosis at 72 h compared with cells protected by glucocorticoid alone (Fig. 2 B). As expected for a receptor-mediated mechanism of glucocorticoid activation, the effect of all three GR antagonists could be out-competed in MCF10A-Myc cells (Fig.2 C) and MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown) with increasing concentrations of dexamethasone. Taken together, these results suggest that glucocorticoid-mediated survival in breast cancer cell lines is mediated specifically through the activation of the GR. We next sought to define the survival mechanism downstream of GR activation. Using a commercial human cancer array blot spotted with 1200 genes (CLONTECH), we compared gene expression represented by reverse transcription of mRNA from MCF10A cells treated for 30 min with either vehicle alone (ETOH), dexamethasone (10−6m), or both dexamethasone (10−6m) and RU486 (10−7m). We identified several genes that were induced or repressed at least 2-fold by 30 min of glucocorticoid treatment but whose expression was not changed after concomitant treatment with the GR antagonist RU486 (data not shown). One of the most intriguing GR-induced genes identified from this differential display of MEC transcripts was sgk, encoding a putative serine/threonine kinase previously shown to be 54% homologous in its catalytic domain to the well characterized antiapoptotic serine/threonine kinase AKT (5Webster M. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Although sgk had been shown to be transcriptionally induced by glucocorticoid treatment in rat mammary carcinoma cells (5Webster M. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), another study found that sgktranscripts were not induced by glucocorticoid treatment in human kidney epithelial cells (9Waldegger S. Barth P. Raber G. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4440-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility of a species-specific difference in sgk promoter activation by glucocorticoids. Therefore, we first confirmed our array data using Northern analysis of sgk mRNA transcripts expressed 30 min after glucocorticoid treatment in two glucocorticoid-sensitive human breast cell lines, MCF10A-Myc and MDA-MB-231. Northern blot analysis of total cellular mRNA using an α-32P-labeled full-length human sgk cDNA probe demonstrated that in MCF10A-Myc cells, GR activation significantly induced sgk mRNA (Fig.3 A). The GR antagonist RU486 inhibited sgk mRNA induction, whereas gapdhtranscript expression remained relatively constant under all conditions. MDA-MB-231 cells had a similar, although slightly less robust, induction of sgk transcripts after glucocorticoid treatment that was also abrogated by concomitant RU486 treatment (Fig.3 B). In both cell types, serum stimulation inducedsgk transcripts. These data suggest that glucocorticoid stimulation of human MECs appears to directly induce sgkexpression through a GR-dependent mechanism that can be antagonized by RU486. We next investigated the biological activity of ectopically expressed SGK in MCF10A-Myc cells subjected to apoptotic stress. SGK was ectopically expressed in MCF10A-Myc cells after transduction with retroviruses encoding either an HA-tagged wild type human SGK (HA-SGK) or a truncated HA-tagged SGK containing amino acids 61–431 (ΔN60 HA-SGK). The truncated ΔN60 SGK protein had been previously shown to be more efficiently expressed than wild type SGK in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (6Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Individual clones expressing either wild type HA-SGK or ΔN60 HA-SGK were isolated by puromycin selection, and whole cell lysates were examined for HA-SGK protein expression by Western analysis using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody. Similar to previously reported results in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, ΔN60 HA-SGK was much more efficiently expressed than the full-length, wild type HA-SGK, although both were clearly visible in comparison to cells transduced with the empty retroviral pLPCX vector alone (Fig.4 A). To determine whether wild type and ΔN60 HA-SGK have kinase activity when overexpressed, MCF10A-Myc cells stably expressing these two constructs were deprived of all growth factors overnight, and SGK activity was measured. Fig.4 B presents the kinase activity of SGK immunoprecipitated from wild type HA-SGK, ΔN60 HA-SGK, and a kinase-dead K127M HA-SGK expressed in MCF10A-Myc cells. Since an efficient substrate for SGK kinase activity is not known, we used the previously described SGK-tide as a substrate (12Park J. Leong M. Buse P. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Elevated kinase activity was seen in both wild type and ΔN60 HA-SGK immunoprecipitated from MCF10A-Myc cells when compared with K127M HA-SGK. Immunoprecipitated wild type and ΔN60 HA-SGK both appeared as a doublet in Western analysis, suggesting that phosphorylated forms of SGK exist in MCF10A-Myc cells despite the absence of growth factors in the culture medium. SGK-overexpressing MCF10A-Myc cell lines were then evaluated for apoptosis after various conditions of growth factor deprivation. In the absence of all growth factors (Fig. 4 C), both wild type and ΔN60 HA-SGK-expressing cell lines showed an average of ∼60% inhibition of apoptosis compared with control cells expressing only the empty pLPCX vector. These results suggest that even in the absence of growth factors, expression of either the wild type or truncated ΔN60 HA-SGK can protect MECs from apoptosis. Interestingly, the addition of insulin and EGF (shown previously in MCF10A cells to stimulate the PI 3-kinase pathway sufficiently to induce AKT phosphorylation (3Moran T. Gray S. Mikosz C. Conzen S. Cancer Research. 2000; 60: 867-872PubMed Google Scholar)) did not significantly increase survival in cells expressing ectopic SGK. The antiapoptotic activity of SGK in the absence of EGF or insulin stimulation was somewhat surprising because SGK activation has been shown previously to be dependent on the insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase-signaling pathway (12Park J. Leong M. Buse P. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). To determine whether the survival effect observed after overexpression of wild type SGK in fact requires SGK kinase activity, we examined the antiapoptotic activity of two kinase-dead mutant SGK proteins, K127M HA-SGK and T256A/S422A HA-SGK, a double mutation of the conserved second messenger phosphorylation residues in SGK (12Park J. Leong M. Buse P. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These constructs were used to make stable MCF10A-Myc cell lines (Fig.5 A). Early-passage kinase-dead mutant HA-SGK cell lines were then evaluated in apoptosis assays. In contrast to wild type, neither kinase-dead HA-SGK provided significant protection from apoptosis under conditions of serum withdrawal (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that SGK kinase activity is in fact essential for its antiapoptotic function. We next asked whether kinase-dead SGK could act as a functional dominant negative construct and inhibit survival in MECs treated with glucocorticoid. Cell lines overexpressing K127M HA-SGK were deprived of all growth factors or treated with dexamethasone (10−6m) alone for 72 h. In K127M HA-SGK-expressing cell lines treated with glucocorticoid, a small but consistent increase in apoptosis was seen when compared with the parental cell line (Fig. 5 C). These results suggest that the survival effect seen after glucocorticoid induction of SGK can be partially abrogated by the presence of kinase-dead SGK, implying a possible dominant negative function for kinase-dead SGK. The absence of a requirement for either insulin or EGF stimulation in conjunction with wild type SGK overexpression suggested that in our system either (a) an alternative pathway to PI 3-kinase signaling was upstream of SGK activation or (b) endogenous PI 3-kinase activity was sufficient to activate SGK. To determine whether PI 3-kinase activity was in fact required for SGK antiapoptotic function, we treated SGK-overexpressing cells with LY294002 (50 μm), a PI 3-kinase-specific inhibitor. Pretreatment of MEC lines with LY294002 resulted in a statistically significant increase in the percentage of apoptosis in both wild type HA-SGK and ΔN60 HA-SGK-expressing cells but not in control (pLPCX alone) cells (Fig. 6). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase signaling is indeed required for SGK survival activity and indicate that endogenous PI 3-kinase activity in MECs appears to be sufficient to activate SGK, even in the absence of insulin and EGF stimulation. We have identified a novel pathway of mammary cell survival that operates via GR activation in both nontumorigenic MECs and breast cancer cell lines. The relationship between GR activation and several induced and repressed genes was evaluated by array analysis. One of the GR-induced genes, sgk, encodes a known serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase with strong homology in its catalytic domain to the catalytic domain of the antiapoptotic kinase AKT (5Webster M. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In a panel of MEC cell lines, MCF10A-Myc cells and MDA-MB-231 cells were found to be most sensitive to growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis and also demonstrated the lowest endogenous levels of SGK expression (data not shown). Glucocorticoid treatment of these cell lines significantly induced sgk mRNA and resulted in survival. Furthermore, ectopically expressed SGK blocked cell death after growth factor withdrawal, but overexpression of a kinase-dead SGK did not protect cells from apoptosis. The induction of sgkmRNA resulting from glucocorticoid treatment suggests an important transcriptional control mechanism for the activity of this protein. This finding provides a novel model of kinase activation that appears partially independent of cell surface growth factor receptor signaling. However, the downstream targets of SGK kinase activity remain to be identified. Interestingly, although SGK activity in human embryonic kidney 293 cells has been shown to be regulated by reversible PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation (6Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 12Park J. Leong M. Buse P. Maiyar A. Firestone G. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), our results suggest that endogenous PI 3-kinase activity may be sufficient to activate SGK. One possibility is that endogenous phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 activity, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase, is particularly high in MECs. Alternatively, a parallel phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1-like kinase may be responsible for SGK activation in these cells. A third possible explanation is that human MECs may express mutated or low activity phosphatases that would otherwise reverse endogenous PI 3-kinase activity. The mechanism through which SGK prevents apoptosis remains unknown. However, in kidney epithelium, SGK has been demonstrated to be a target of aldosterone-induced regulation of electrogenic sodium absorption (7Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Canessa C. Cleaveland E. Aldrich G. Fejes-Toth G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16973-16978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,19Chen S. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.

Physiol. 2000; 278: 613-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implicating SGK in the control of intracellular fluid volume. Since cell shrinkage is known to be an early hallmark of apoptosis (21Kerr J. Wyllie A. Currie A. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12874) Google Scholar), SGK expression may counteract the early changes in cell volume that precede apoptosis by controlling intracellular fluid shifts. The possibility that SGK may exert its antiapoptotic effects by regulating cation channels and maintaining intracellular volume is the subject of future investigation. In summary, we have identified GR activation as initiating a potent survival signal in both nonmalignant and malignant human breast epithelial cells. SGK, a novel member of the second-messenger family of serine/threonine protein kinases, has been identified as a probable downstream effector of GR survival signaling. Regulation of SGK's antiapoptotic activity in breast epithelial cells was found to be largely independent of insulin or EGF stimulation, although PI 3-kinase activity is required.

https://openalex.org/W2072109709,"We have previously shown that immunoadsorption of the FKBP52 immunophilin component of steroid receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes is accompanied by coadsorption of cytoplasmic dynein, a motor protein involved in retrograde transport of vesicles toward the nucleus. Coimmunoadsorption of dynein is competed by an expressed fragment of FKBP52 comprising its peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) domain (Silverstein, A. M., Galigniana, M. D., Kanelakis, K. C., Radanyi, C., Renoir, J.-M., and Pratt, W. B. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 52, 36980–36986). Here we show that cotransfection of 3T3 cells with the FKBP52 PPIase domain and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) glucocorticoid receptor (GR) chimera inhibits dexamethasone-dependent movement of the GFP-GR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Cotransfection with FKBP12 does not affect GFP-GR movement. Inhibition of movement by the FKBP52 PPIase domain is abrogated in cells treated with colcemid to eliminate microtubules prior to steroid addition. After withdrawal of colcemid, microtubules reform, and PPIase inhibition of GFP-GR movement is restored. These observations are consistent with the notion that FKBP52 targets retrograde movement of the GFP-GR along microtubules by linking the receptor to the dynein motor. Here, we also show that native GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from L cell cytosol contain dynein and that GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes assembled in reticulocyte lysate contain cytoplasmic dynein in a manner that is competed by the PPIase domain of FKBP52. We have previously shown that immunoadsorption of the FKBP52 immunophilin component of steroid receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes is accompanied by coadsorption of cytoplasmic dynein, a motor protein involved in retrograde transport of vesicles toward the nucleus.

Horm. 1995; 51: 315-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and, depending upon the receptor, the hormone-free, untransformed receptor may have a predominantly nuclear or cytoplasmic localization. The hormone-free glucocorticoid receptor (GR)1 is localized to the cytoplasm of most cells, and after steroid binding and transformation, it translocates to the nucleus (6Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 7Qi M. Hamilton B.J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Czar M.J. Lyons R.H. Welsh M.J. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies with inhibitors suggest that the multiprotein hsp90-based chaperone system and the hsp90-binding immunophilin FKBP52 are involved in movement of the GR along microtubular tracks to the nucleus (for review, see Ref. 9Pratt W.B. Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Assembly of receptors into heterocomplexes with hsp90 is a dynamic process (10Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that the GR and hsp90 can move together from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (11Kang K.I. Devin J. Cadepond F. Jibard N. Guichon-Mantel A. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A couple of observations suggest that the role of hsp90 in receptor movement is likely to involve dynamic assembly and disassembly of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes. For example, Yang and DeFranco (12Yang J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that molybdate, which binds to hsp90 and stabilizes GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes in vivo (13Raaka B.M. Finnerty M. Sun E. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14009-14015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), traps the GR in the cytoplasm of cells continuously exposed to hormone. Molybdate in this case was thought to inhibit reimport of the GR into the nucleus by inhibiting the dynamic cycling of receptors into and out of their complexes with the hsp90 chaperone. Also, geldanamycin, an antibiotic that binds to the nucleotide binding site on hsp90 (14Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar) and prevents formation of normal receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes (15Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), impedes steroid-induced movement of the GR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (16Czar M.J. Galigniana M.D. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Some localization studies have shown the untransformed GR to colocalize with microtubules (for review, see Ref. 18Akner G. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but the evidence supporting movement along microtubular tracks is indirect. Although microtubule disrupting agents, such as colcemid, do not affect the overall rate of steroid-dependent receptor translocation to the nucleus (8Czar M.J. Lyons R.H. Welsh M.J. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar, 19Perrot-Applanat M. Lescop P. Milgrom E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), they eliminate the hsp90-dependent mode of receptor movement (17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Using a fusion protein of murine GR with Aequorea green fluorescent protein (GFP), we found that steroid-dependent GFP-GR translocation to the nucleus is rapid (t12 = ∼5 min) both in cells with intact cytoskeleton and in cells with disrupted cytoskeletal networks (17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, in cells with normal cytoskeleton, the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin slowed translocation of the GFP-GR by an order of magnitude (t12 = ∼45 min), whereas in cells with colcemid-disrupted microtubules, geldanamycin had no effect on the translocation rate (t12 = ∼5 min). This suggests two mechanisms of GR movement. Under physiological conditions where the cytoskeleton is intact, diffusion is limited, and the GFP-GR utilizes a movement machinery in which the hsp90 heterocomplex assembly machinery plays a role. In cells where the microtubules are disrupted with colcemid, movement is still steroid-dependent, but the transformed GR moves through the cytoplasm by diffusion (17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Galigniana M.D. Housley P.R. DeFranco D.B. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16222-16227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In normal cells, the retrograde movement of vesicles toward the nucleus is known to occur on cytoskeletal tracks in a process requiring the molecular motor protein cytoplasmic dynein (for review, see Refs. 21Vallee R.B. Bloom G.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 59-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholarand 22Langford G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, like GFP-GR translocation to the nucleus, short range vesicle movement still occurs by diffusion when microtubules are disrupted (23Bloom G.S. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1277-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Using retrograde vesicular movement as a model, we have looked for potential links between the GR and cytoplasmic dynein. In addition to hsp90, steroid receptor heterocomplexes contain hsp90-binding immunophilins (for review, see Ref. 24Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), and we have shown that cytoplasmic dynein is coimmunoadsorbed from cytosols with FKBP52, one of the major immunophilins in GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes. The immunophilins are proteins possessing peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) domains that bind immunosuppressant drugs of the FK506 group (the FKBPs) or of the cyclosporin A group (the cyclosporin A-binding proteins). Three high molecular weight immunophilins, FKBP52, FKBP51, and cyclosporin A-binding protein-40, exist in receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes (24Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). In addition to their PPIase domains, these high molecular weight immunophilins contain three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which are degenerative sequences of 34 amino acids that determine their binding to a common TPR acceptor site on hsp90 (25Radanyi C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20090-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We have shown that FKBP52 also binds directly to the GR and that a 35-amino acid segment spanning the proto-nuclear localization signals that comprise the NL1 nuclear localization signal of the GR (see Ref. 5DeFranco D.B. Madan A.P. Tang Y. Chandran U.R. Xiao N. Yang J. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 315-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar for NL1 composition) is sufficient for FKBP52 binding (28Silverstein A.M.

FKBP52 binds either directly or via a linker protein with cytoplasmic dynein (29Czar M.J. Owens-Grillo J.K. Yem A.W. Leach K.L. Deibel M.R. Welsh M.J. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1731-1741PubMed Google Scholar), and coimmunoadsorption of dynein is competed by a fragment of FKBP52 comprising its PPIase domain (28Silverstein A.M.

These binding studies support the notion (30Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pratt W.B. Czar M.J. Stancato L.F. Owens J.K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that FKBP52, which itself colocalizes with microtubules (29Czar M.J. Owens-Grillo J.K. Yem A.W. Leach K.L.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2037-2051PubMed Google Scholar), may target receptor movement toward the nucleus by determining its attachment to the retrograde dynein motor protein. To date, the only in vivoobservation linking FKBP52 to GR movement is the demonstration that microinjection of an antibody raised against a conserved negative sequence (6 of 8 amino acids) between domains I (PPIase) and II of FKBP52 (33Callebaut I. Renoir J.-M. Lebeau M.-C. Massol N. Burny A. Baulieu E.-E. Mornon J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6270-6274Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) impedes steroid-dependent cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of the endogenous GR in L cells (8Czar M.J. Lyons R.H. Welsh M.J. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we show that cotransfection of 3T3 fibroblasts with GFP-GR and the PPIase domain of FKBP52 slows subsequent steroid-dependent translocation of the GFP-GR to the nucleus (t12 = ∼45 min) to the same extent as treatment with the hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin. The effect is specific, inasmuch as cotransfection with FKBP12 does not affect GFP-GR movement. If cells are treated with colcemid to disrupt microtubules prior to steroid addition, the presence of competing PPIase domain does not inhibit movement. But, when colcemid is removed and microtubules reform, GFP-GR translocation is again slowed by the presence of the PPIase domain. The observations are consistent with an uncoupling of the receptor from movement along microtubules by competition for the binding of FKBP52 to the dynein motor.

NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown on 11 × 22-mm coverslips placed in 35-mm culture plates in 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum, under a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. When the cells were ∼60% confluent, the medium was replaced by 0.75 ml of DMEM with 5% calf serum, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. Cells were then transfected with 2.4 μg of plasmid encoding GFP-GR and 16 μg of pSG5PL-FKBP52 domain I plus hinge (Met6–Gly148), or pSG5PL-FKBP52 core domain I (Gly32–Lys138), or pSG5PL-FKBP12, or pSG5PL vector alone. The cotransfection mixture was prepared by preincubating plasmids with 4.5 μl of Trans-Fast reagent/μg of total DNA and 0.25 ml of DMEM for 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was then added to the cell cultures and incubated for 1 h, prior to adding 4 ml of DMEM with 10% calf serum without washing out the mixture used for transfection. After 18 h, the medium was removed, cells were washed four times, 2 ml of phenol red-free DMEM with 10% charcoal-stripped calf serum were added, and cells were incubated for an additional 24–30 h. Cells transfected as described above were incubated with 1 μm dexamethasone, and at various times, coverslips were removed, and cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed by immersion in −20 °C methanol for at least 15 min. Cells were rinsed again with phosphate-buffered saline, and the coverslips were inverted onto a slide with 5 μl of mounting solution (1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine in 10% phosphate-buffered saline, 90% glycerol, pH 9.0). Cells were visualized with a Leitz Aristoplan epiillumination microscope. Cells were scored for GFP-GR translocation as we have described previously (17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), using a score of 4 for nuclear fluorescence much greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 3 for nuclear fluorescence greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 2 for nuclear fluorescence equal to cytoplasmic fluorescence, 1 for nuclear fluorescence less than cytoplasmic fluorescence, and 0 for nuclear fluorescence much less than cytoplasmic fluorescence. The translocation scores represent the means ± S.E. from three experiments in which >100 cells per condition per experiment were scored. Significance of differences was measured by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni ttest. For immunoadsorption of FKBP52, aliquots (150 μl) of rabbit reticulocyte lysate were immunoadsorbed for 3 h at 4 °C to 14 μl of protein A-Sepharose with 7 μl of UPJ56 antiserum against FKBP52. Immune pellets were washed three times by suspension in 1 ml of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol) with 20 mm sodium molybdate prior to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using 0.1% EC1 to probe for FKBP52. Mouse GR was overexpressed in Sf9 cells as described (37Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Li D.-P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and cytosol was prepared by Dounce homogenization in 1.5 volumes of buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mix/3 ml of buffer). The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was stored at −70 °C. Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 60-μl aliquots of cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 14 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 7 μl of FiGR ascites, and the immune pellets were washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer. Prior to incubation with reticulocyte lysate, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of hsp90 by incubating for 2 h with 300 μl of TEG buffer containing 0.7m NaCl and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The immune pellets were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEG buffer containing 0.7 mNaCl and twice with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes were assembled by incubating these stripped GR immune pellets with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mmcreatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml of creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mm sodium molybdate), and boiled in SDS sample buffer. To assay GR and associated proteins, immune pellets were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.2 μg/ml BuGR for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, 0.1% UPJ56 for FKBP52, and 0.1% of MAB1618 for dynein. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate125I-conjugated counter antibody to visualize immunoreactive bands. Cytosol was prepared from L929 mouse fibroblasts by Dounce homogenization in 1.5 volumes of buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm molybdate, and 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mix/3 ml of buffer) and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 250-ml aliquots of cytosol by rotation for 2.5 h at 4 °C with 14 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 7 μl of FiGR ascites, and the immune pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of TEG buffer with 20 mm molybdate. pGEX λT plasmid expressing GST-FKBP52 Gly32–Lys138 was used to transform Escherichia coli strain UT5600. The fusion protein was purified by binding to GSH-agarose beads, and the core PPIase domain I of FKBP52 was released by incubation at 4 °C with thrombin. Because the purified FKBP52 domain I (Met6–Gly148) fragment competes for FKBP52 association with cytoplasmic dynein in vitro (28Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.-M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 52: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we asked whether coexpression of domain I would alter the rate of GFP-GR movement from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in vivo. In the absence of steroid, the GFP-GR expressed in 3T3 cells is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1,A, C, and E), and upon exposure to dexamethasone, it moves to the nucleus (Fig. 1 B). As we reported previously (17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), nuclear translocation of the GFP-GR is inhibited when hsp90 function is inhibited by geldanamycin (Fig.1 F). As shown in Fig. 1 D, cotransfection with FKBP52 domain I also inhibits GFP-GR translocation. The bar graphs on the right in Fig. 1 summarize the translocation scores from several hundred cells per condition, where a value of zero reflects a completely cytoplasmic localization and a value of four a completely nuclear localization, a scoring system we have used previously with the GFP-GR (17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L.

After the 20-min interval of steroid treatment, nuclear translocation of the GFP-GR is inhibited to the same extent by coexpression of FKBP52 domain I as it is by treatment with geldanamycin. Geldanamycin slows the rate of GFP-GR translocation, but by 60 min of steroid exposure, essentially all of the receptors have moved to the nucleus (Ref. 17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 A, cotransfection with FKBP52 domain I slows GFP-GR translocation to the same extent as geldanamycin, and geldanamycin treatment of cells coexpressing FKBP52 domain I does not yield a slower rate of translocation than that seen with either condition alone. As shown in Fig. 2 B, neither coexpression of FKBP52 domain I nor treatment with geldanamycin slows GFP-GR translocation in cells that have been treated with colcemid to disrupt microtubules. We have shown previously, that treatment with colcemid under these conditions yields complete disruption of microtubules in 3T3 cells (17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). When colcemid-treated cells are incubated in medium without colcemid for 1 h, the microtubular network is restored, and geldanamycin again inhibits GFP-GR movement (17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 3 A, cells that were treated with colcemid, such that steroid-dependent GFP-GR movement was not inhibited by FKBP52 domain I (condition 3) or geldanamycin (condition 4), were withdrawn from colcemid for 1 h prior to steroid addition. In the colcemid-withdrawn cells, GFP-GR translocation was inhibited by FKBP52 domain I (condition 5) and by geldanamycim (condition 6). These observations strongly suggest that, under normal physiological conditions where the microtubular network is intact, the GFP-GR is linked via an associated immunophilin, such as FKBP52, to a system for movement along microtubular tracks. The FKBP52 domain I (Met6–Gly148) expressed in the experiments of Figs. 1, 2, and 3A contains all of domain I and a short, negatively charged hinge region that connects domains I and II. To be sure that the PPIase domain was responsible for inhibition of receptor movement, we coexpressed the GFP-GR with FKBP52 core domain I (Gly32–Lys138), which does not contain the hinge segment. As shown in Fig. 3 B, GFP-GR translocation is inhibited to the same extent in cells expressing FKBP52 core domain I (condition 4) as in cells expressing FKBP52 domain I plus hinge (condition 3). We determined by immunoblotting that the levels of both FKBP52 domain I (Met6–Gly148) and core domain I (Gly32–Lys138) were 35-fold higher than the endogenous FKBP52 in nontransfected cells (data not shown). Although domain I alone has the same PPIase activity as the full-length FKBP52 (35Chambraud B. Rouviere-Fourmy N. Radanyi C. Hsiao K. Peattie D.A. Livingston D.J. Baulieu E.-E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), that enzymatic activity is not related to inhibition of GFP-GR movement. This is deduced from the fact that the immunosuppressant drug FK506, which binds in the active site and blocks PPIase activity, does not affect either the rate of steroid-dependent GFP-GR translocation or inhibition of the rate of translocation by FKBP52 domain I (data not shown). We have also shown previously that FK506 does not affect FKBP52 binding to cytoplasmic dynein (28Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.-M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 52: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Inhibition of GFP-GR movement by FKBP52 domain I does not reflect an inhibition by PPIase domains in general. We have shown previously that purified FKBP12 does not affect FKBP52 binding to cytoplasmic dynein (28Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.-M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 52: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3 B (condition 5), it is shown that cotransfection of 3T3 cells with human FKBP12 does not affect steroid-dependent GFP-GR translocation. The level of FKBP12 in transfected cells was determined by [3H]FK506 binding to be 40-fold higher than all endogenous [3H]FK506 binding activity in nontransfected cells. The experiment of Fig. 4 presents three treatments that selectively affect the binding of FKBP52 to hsp90 or dynein. In this experiment, aliquots of rabbit reticulocyte lysate were incubated with various additions at 30 °C, and then FKBP52 was immunoadsorbed. Immunoadsorption of FKBP52 is accompanied by coadsorption of both hsp90 and cytoplasmic dynein (lane 2). The TPR domain fragment of rat PP5 markedly reduces FKBP52 binding to hsp90 but not to dynein (lane 3), whereas FKBP52 core domain I eliminates FKBP52 binding to dynein but does not affect its binding to hsp90 (lane 4). FKBP52 binding to dynein is not affected by FK506 (lane 6), which again suggests that the binding is independent of PPIase activity (28Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.-M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 52: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Importantly, pretreatment of reticulocyte lysate with geldanamycin markedly reduces FKBP52 binding to hsp90 (lane 8). Reticulocyte lysate contains the multi-protein hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery that assembles GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes (reviewed in Ref. 24Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig.5 A, we asked whether the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex formed in reticulocyte contained dynein. Immunoimmobilized mouse GR that was stripped of its associated hsp90 was incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and after washing the immunopellet, the GR and associated rabbit proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. As shown inlane 3, the GR is assembled into heterocomplexes containing hsp90, FKBP52, and cytoplasmic dynein. If the lysate is preincubated with geldanamycin before it is incubated with the GR, then there is a marked decrease in hsp90, and there is no FKBP52 or dynein (lane 4). FKBP52 is bound to hsp90 via its TPR domain (25Radanyi C. Chambraud B. Baulieu E.-E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11197-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and preincubation with a TPR domain fragment of PP5 yields a GR·hsp90 complex that does not contain FKBP52 or dynein (lane 5). As shown in Fig. 5 B, preincubation with FKBP52 core domain I, eliminates dynein without affecting the amount of hsp90 or FKBP52 in the GR heterocomplex. These observations are consistent with a model in which the hsp90-bound GR is linked to the motor protein via an immunophilin, such as FKBP52. In Fig. 5 C, the GR was immunoadsorbed from cytosol prepared from mouse L cells. Cytoplasmic dynein was coimmunoadsorbed, showing that it is a component of native GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes formed in the cell. Inhibition of GFP-GR translocation by expression of the PPIase domain of FKBP52 is consistent with a model in which rapid receptor movement in cells with intact cytoskeleton requires participation of one or more of the high molecular weight, hsp90-binding immunophilins (8Czar M.J. Lyons R.H. Welsh M.J. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the rate of GR translocation is inhibited by geldanamycin (16Czar M.J. Galigniana M.D. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which blocks GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, but the way in which dynamic GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly might promote GR movement along cytoskeletal tracts was unknown. FKBP52 provides a link between the receptor heterocomplex and cytoplasmic dynein, a motor protein for retrograde movement along microtubules. Treatment of reticulocyte lysate with geldanamycin inhibits FKBP52 binding to hsp90 (Fig. 4) and inhibits GR·hsp90 assembly, yielding receptors that are not associated with FKBP52 and dynein (Fig. 5 A). A similar effect in vivo could explain why rapid GR movement in normal cells with intact microtubules is inhibited by geldanamycin. The ability of both geldanamycin treatment and FKBP52 domain I expression to disrupt GR linkage to dynein could explain why the two manipulations slow the rate of GFP-GR movement to the same extent and why there is no further slowing with the two manipulations together (Fig. 2 A). In this work, we show that dynein is present in native GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from L cell cytosol and that dynein-containing GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes are formed in reticulocyte lysate. These complexes contain FKBP52 (Fig. 5); however, complexes containing other immunophilins, such as FKBP51, are also formed (39Barent R.L. Nair S.C. Carr D.C. Ruan Y. Rimerman R.A. Fulton J. Zhang Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes in the presence of the TPR domain fragment blocks the binding of all of the immunophilins (26Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffman K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, at this time, we can only say that the presence of dynein in the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex requires a TPR domain immunophilin, with FKBP52 providing at least part, and perhaps all, of that linker function. The common feature of immunophilins is the presence of their PPIase domains, and the PPIase domain of FKBP52 possesses PPIase activity even when it is expressed as a domain fragment (35Chambraud B. Rouviere-Fourmy N. Radanyi C. Hsiao K. Peattie D.A. Livingston D.J. Baulieu E.-E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the PPIase inhibitor FK506 does not affect FKBP52 binding to cytoplasmic dynein (Fig. 4 and Ref. 28Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.-M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 52: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar), or the rate of GFP-GR translocation, or inhibition of translocation by the FKBP52 PPIase domain. Thus, the PPIase activity of FKBP52 does not seem to be involved in the interaction with cytoplasmic dynein or retrograde movement of GFP-GR. The PPIase domain of FKBP52 functions as a dynein interaction domain independent of binding by FK506. In this respect, it differs from the interaction of FKBP12 with calcineurin, where binding requires the FK506-bound immunophilin (40Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar). It is clear that the PPIase domains of immunophilins are involved in different protein-protein interactions and effects. For example, the low molecular weight immunophilin FKBP12 does not affect GFP-GR movement, whereas the PPIase domain of FKBP52 does (Fig.3 B). FKBP12 also does not compete for FKBP52 binding to cytoplasmic dynein, whereas the PPIase domain of FKBP52 does (28Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.-M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 52: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although FK506-bound FKBP12 binds to and inhibits the calcineurin phosphatase (40Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar), neither FK506-bound FKBP52 nor its expressed PPIase domain fragment inhibits calcineurin activity in vitro (41Lebeau M.-C. Myagkikh I. Rouviere-Fourmy N. Baulieu E.-E. Klee C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our impression is that the PPIase domains may constitute a family of protein-protein interaction domains, with no overlap of binding targets between FKBP12 and the high molecular weight, hsp90-binding imunophilins. Because we see the same rate of GFP-GR nuclear translocation in the presence and absence of microtubules (Fig. 2), it may be that nuclear import and not receptor movement through the cytoplasm is rate-limiting for nuclear accumulation under both conditions. When the microtubules are intact, it seems that receptor movement occurs predominantly on a microtubule-based movement system that requires dynamic interaction of the receptor with hsp90 and the immunophilin. When cytoskeleton is disrupted, the GR may move through the cytoplasm by diffusion. Although movement of the receptor through the cytoplasm is not the rate-limiting step in cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation under physiological conditions in cells with intact cytoskeleton, it becomes rate-limiting when geldanamycin or the PPIase domain of FKBP52 are present to uncouple the receptor from the movement system. Thus, in the normal cell, rapid movement of protein solutes by diffusion may be limited by the organized cytoskeleton, and attachment to a movement system permits more rapid delivery to their sites of action. Such a movement system may not be essential for targeted protein movement in non-neuronal cells. But in axons, movement solely by diffusion is not possible, and a movement system, such as that described here, would be essential. In this work, we have provided the first in vivo evidence that the immunophilin PPIase domain links the glucocorticoid receptor to a retrograde movement system. We also show for the first time that GR·hsp90·immunophilin heterocomplexes are bound to the retrograde motor protein cytoplasmic dynein via the PPIase domain of the immunophilin component.

A direct association of HSP70, HSP40, and αB-crystallin with mutant SOD-1 (G93A or G41S), but not wild-type or endogenous mouse SOD-1, was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. Mutant SOD-1·HSP70 complexes were predominantly in the detergent-insoluble fraction.

Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, and about 20% of these familial cases are caused by dominantly inherited mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) (1Rosen D.R.

Evidence indicates that some “toxic gain of function” is responsible for motor neuron loss rather than a decreased ability of mutant SOD-1 to carry out its primary enzymatic function, dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide. Most SOD-1 mutant proteins have significant enzymatic activity, and any impairment relative to wild-type does not correlate with clinical severity of the disease (2Bowling A.C. Barkowski E.E.

The distribution of such a large number of disease-causing mutations throughout all exons of the SOD-1gene suggests that altered protein conformation may contribute to the toxic gain of function. Additional evidence comes from x-ray crystallography showing that conserved interactions within the protein that determine the conformation of the active channel are altered in mutant SOD-1 proteins (9Deng H.-X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Iqbal Z. Cayabyab A. Hung W.-Y. Getzoff E.D. Hu P. Herzfeldt B. Roos R.P. Warner C. Deng G. Soriano E. Smyth C. Parge H.E. Ahmed A. Roses A.D. Hallewell R.A.

Improperly folded SOD-1 enzyme could allow greater access of abnormal substrates to the active site; could enhance other known enzymatic functions of SOD-1, such as catalysis of protein nitration; or could alter metal binding, all of which would ultimately lead to increased oxidative damage (reviewed in Refs. 10Bromberg M.B.

Alternatively, proteins with altered conformation could form insoluble precipitates or participate in abnormal protein-protein interactions unless prevented from doing so by association with chaperone proteins. Thus, depletion of chaperones could result in formation of mutant SOD-1 aggregates, as well as compromising cellular chaperoning function in general (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Mutant SOD-1 proteins appear to be degraded by the proteasome, a pathway generally involved in proteolysis of denatured or misfolded protein (14Hoffman E.K. Wilcox H.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. J. Neurol.

In cultured motor neurons, coexpression of HSP70 and mutant SOD-1 expression vectors considerably reduced formation of SOD-containing aggregates and prolonged viability (13Bruening W. Roy J.

Heat shock proteins could protect cells from mutant SOD-1 by direct interaction, thus preventing aggregation and facilitating degradation, or indirectly by protecting cells from downstream consequences of some other toxic property. In this study, we have demonstrated that mutant SOD-1 coimmunoprecipitates with HSP70, HSP40, and αB-crystallin. Furthermore, a portion of mutant SOD-1 was detergent-insoluble in three different experimental models of familial ALS: NIH3T3 cell lines stably or transiently transfected with mutant SOD-1 constructs, spinal cord cultures derived from G93A transgenic embryonic spinal cords, and lumbar spinal cord from adult G93A transgenic mice. The following primary antibodies were used: Rabbit anti-SOD-1 antibodies (SOD-100 diluted 1:500 and SOD-101 diluted 1:250, Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) (SOD-100 reacts with both human and mouse SOD-1 but favors human SOD-1; SOD-101 also reacts with both human and mouse SOD-1 but favors mouse SOD-1); rabbit anti-αB-crystallin (SPA-223) (1:250) and rabbit anti-HSP40 (SPA-400) (1:1000) antibodies from Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp.; mouse monoclonal HSP70 antibody (W27 catalog number SC-24, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (1:250) (may cross-react with HSC70); mouse monoclonal actin antibody, clone C4 (691001) (1:1000) and rabbit polyclonal tubulin antibody (650951) (1:500) from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Irvine, CA). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (P0399, Dako Corp., Mississauga, ON) (1:3000) and sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (515035062, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Willow Grove, PA) (1:10,000). cDNA encoding human HSP70 was a kind gift from D. Mosser and was subcloned into pcDNA3. NIH3T3 cell lines stably expressing humanSOD-1 gene constructs (wild-type or with G93A or G41S mutations) have been described previously (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained under standard conditions in minimum essential medium supplemented with 3.7 g of NaHCO3, 5 g of dextrose, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable cell lines were supplemented with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) (250 μg/ml for G41S and G93A lines and 700 μg/ml for the wild-type line). For transient transfection, NIH3T3 cells were grown to 80–100% confluency, subcultured at a density of 2 × 105cells/35-mm culture well, and transfected with the G93A-SOD-1/pcDNA3 construct according to the standard protocol for LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein extracts were prepared 43 h after transfection (see below). Two lines of mice transgenic for G93A mutant human SOD-1, B6SJL-TgN(SOD1-G93A)1Gur and B6SJL-TgN(SOD1-G93A)1Gurdl, as well as one line of mice transgenic for wild-type human SOD-1, B6SJL-TgN(SOD-1)2Gur, were maintained in our animal facility (breeding pairs were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). All experiments were approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee and followed the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. B6SJL-TgN(SOD1-G93A)1Gur (fast line) mice develop paralysis in the limbs and die at 4–5 months of age. B6SJL-TgN(SOD1-G93A)1Gurdl (slow line) mice develop paralysis in the limbs and die at 6–7 months of age. Cultures were prepared from 13-day-old mouse embryos as previously described (22Roy J. Minotti S. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. Durham H.D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9673-9684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that spinal cords from transgenic mouse embryos were dissociated and plated individually at a density of 650,000/35-mm culture well. Embryos were genotyped for the presence of human SOD-1 transgenes using the polymerase chain reaction method provided by The Jackson Laboratory. NIH3T3 cell lines and spinal cord cultures were lysed on ice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% digitonin, and 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer) and centrifuged to obtain detergent-soluble supernatant and detergent-insoluble pellet fractions. Pellets were washed three times in lysis buffer and then solubilized in 1× sample buffer (55 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% bromophenol blue). The lumbar region of mouse spinal cord was homogenized in 500 μl of lysis buffer and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After collection of supernatants, pellets were washed five times with lysis buffer and then resuspended in 100 μl of 1× sample buffer. Protein concentrations of supernatants were determined by Bio-Rad DC protein assay. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad Trans-Blot® transfer medium). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in TBST-milk (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% skim milk powder). Incubations in primary and secondary antibodies were for 1 h at room temperature. Labeled proteins were detected using the Renaissance® Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). NIH3T3 cell lines were lysed in 700 μl of lysis buffer containing 9% Me2SO and then incubated for 1 h on ice and for 10 min at room temperature. Following the addition of 70 μl of 50 mm glycine, cells were centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and supernatants were collected. For total cell extracts, the centrifugation step was eliminated. For immunoprecipitation, 3 μl of SOD-1 antibody (SOD-100), 12.5 μl of HSP70 antibody, 5 μl of HSP40 antibody, or 5 μl of αB-crystallin antibody was added to 400 μg of protein and incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotating platform. Immune complexes were captured on 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose, 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubation on a rotating platform at 4 °C for 3 h; the beads were washed with lysis buffer, resuspended in 30 μl of 1× sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The beads were pelleted, half of the supernatant was electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting. The tendency of mutant SOD-1 proteins to form aggregates in cultured cells and spinal cord tissue suggested that they might distribute differently in subcellular compartments compared with wild-type enzyme. NIH3T3 cell lines stably expressing human wild-type, G41S mutant, or G93A mutant SOD-1, established for previous studies (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), were used to compare the solubility of wild-type and mutant SOD-1 in nonionic detergent. Detergent-soluble supernatant and detergent-insoluble pellet fractions were prepared from these cell lines, as well as from untransfected NIH3T3 cells, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The endogenous murine, wild-type human, and mutant human SOD-1 proteins were detected by Western blotting. A blot probed with SOD-1 antibody (SOD-100, which has a higher affinity for human SOD-1 relative to mouse) is shown in Fig.1. Endogenous murine SOD-1 and wild-type human SOD-1 were detected only in the supernatant, not in the pellet fraction. In contrast, G41S and G93A mutant human SOD-1 were present in both fractions. Larger amounts of pellet fraction were loaded on the gel relative to supernatant to demonstrate absence of wild-type and presence of mutant SOD-1 in the pellet. Using NIH Image software to compare relative band densities on Western blots and correcting for differential loading of sample, it was estimated that about 1% of total cellular mutant SOD-1 was detergent-insoluble in this experiment. This estimate was consistent with the relative band intensities observed when equal percentages of the total volume of supernatant and pellet fractions were loaded on the gel (data not shown). Because Ratovitski et al. (3Ratovitski T. Corson L.B. Strain J. Wong P. Cleveland D.W. Culotta V.C. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) reported that several different mutant SOD-1 proteins expressed in COS cells by transient transfection were essentially soluble in nonionic detergent, the experiment was repeated using NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with the G93A mutant SOD-1 construct. As shown in Fig.2 A, mutant human SOD-1, but not murine SOD-1, was detected in the detergent-insoluble pellet by Western blotting with antibody SOD100 and was estimated to correspond to about 10% of total cellular mutant SOD-1. The absence of mouse SOD-1 in the pellet fraction was confirmed using a SOD-1 antibody with greater specificity for mouse SOD-1 (SOD101) (Fig. 2 B). Reprobing the blots shown in Fig. 1 with antibody SOD101 also failed to detect murine SOD-1 in detergent-insoluble fractions of any cell line (not shown). Whereas cell lines are convenient models for biochemical analysis, the properties of mutant protein in these cells do not necessarily reflect properties in primary tissue affected by the disease. We examined the solubility of G93A mutant SOD-1 in primary spinal cord cultures prepared from G93A and wild-type human SOD-1 transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 3) and in lumbar spinal cord isolated from adult, presymptomatic (214-day-old) transgenic mice (Fig. 4). These experiments confirmed our findings in transfected NIH3T3 cells in that both detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble forms of G93A SOD-1 were detected. In extracts of primary cultures, but not lumbar spinal cord, a small amount of transgenic wild-type SOD-1 was detected in the detergent-insoluble pellet fraction, but this amount was considerably less than the amount of mutant protein detected. Endogenous mouse SOD-1 was not detected in the detergent-insoluble pellet.Figure 4A proportion of mutant human SOD-1 isolated from lumbar spinal cord of G93A SOD-1 transgenic mice is detergent-insoluble. Lumbar spinal cords from 190 day-old wild-type (WT) and G93A SOD-1 (slow line) transgenic mice were homogenized in lysis buffer containing nonionic detergent. Shown is the distribution of human (h) and mouse (m) SOD-1 in the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions after electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotting with SOD-100 antibody. To compare protein loading, blots were reprobed with antibody to tubulin, a protein that distributes to both detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In response to different types of stresses, cells up-regulate production of various heat shock/stress proteins. When NIH3T3 cells were transfected with G41S or G93A mutant human SOD-1, many of the cells died; however, those cells that were able to survive and were selected as stable transfectants had elevated levels of heat shock proteins as compared with wild-type-transfected and untransfected cells (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, coexpression of HSP70 and mutant SOD-1 expression vectors protected primary cultured motor neurons from toxicity of several different SOD-1 mutants, reducing formation of SOD-containing aggregates and prolonging viability (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To determine whether heat shock proteins protect cells from mutant SOD-1 by direct protein-protein interaction, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Because NIH3T3 cell lines expressing mutant SOD-1 have elevated endogenous levels of heat shock proteins (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), this model was best suited for this purpose. When total cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibody to SOD-1 (SOD100), HSP70 was coimmunoprecipitated from both G93A and G41S expressing cell lines but not from untransfected NIH3T3 or lines expressing wild-type human SOD-1 (Fig. 5 A). Immunoprecipitation of total cell extracts with antibody to HSP70 (W27) pulled down G93A and G41S mutant SOD-1 but not wild-type human or endogenous murine SOD-1 (Fig. 5 B). The same results were obtained when the cross-linking agent, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), was used to stabilize HSP-SOD interactions (data not shown). HSP70·mutant SOD-1 complexes were distributed mainly in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Regardless of whether anti-SOD-1 or anti-HSP70 antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation, the amount of HSP70 or mutant SOD-1, respectively, coprecipitated from detergent-soluble supernatants was minimal compared with the amount coprecipitated from total cell extracts. This was not due to absence of HSP70 in supernatants of cell lines expressing mutant SOD-1; HSP70 was immunoprecipitated by W27 anti-HSP70 antibody from supernatant fractions of both mutant cell lines (Fig. 5 C) and was detected in both detergent-soluble supernatant and detergent-insoluble pellet fractions of nonimmunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 5 D). Similarly, G41S and G93A mutant SOD-1 were localized to both supernatant and pellet fractions (Fig. 1) and were immunoprecipitated from supernatants by the SOD100 antibody (not shown). The data shown in Fig. 5 D also confirm our previous findings that HSP70 is up-regulated in cell lines expressing mutant SOD-1. Although no association of HSP70 with wild-type human SOD-1 was detected (Fig. 5, A and B), this could have been due to the relatively low level of HSP70 in this cell line. To test this hypothesis, cells stably expressing wild-type human SOD-1 were transiently transfected with HSP70. Despite high level expression of HSP70, verified by Western blotting of total cell lysates with antibody to HSP70, neither wild-type human nor murine SOD-1 coimmunoprecipitated with HSP70 (data not shown). Another important observation from Fig. 5 D is that HSP70 was not detected in pellet fractions of untransfected or wild-type human SOD-1 expressing NIH3T3 cultures. Thus, HSP70 and wild-type SOD-1 proteins are largely detergent-soluble proteins; however, in G41S and G93A-expressing cell lines, a proportion of both HSP70 and mutant SOD-1 are detergent-insoluble. How much of the detergent-insoluble forms represents complexes of HSP70 and mutant SOD-1 cannot be determined from these experiments. The interaction of mutant SOD-1 with stress proteins was not limited to HSP70. Both SOD-1 mutants, but neither wild-type human nor endogenous murine SOD-1, were pulled down when total cell extracts of NIH3T3 cell lines were immunoprecipitated by antibodies to HSP40 (Fig. 6 A). As in experiments with HSP70, failure to detect complexes of HSP40 and wild-type human SOD-1 was not due to lack of HSP expression. Considerable HSP40 was present in both supernatant and pellet fractions of all cell lines (Fig. 6 B). Similar results were obtained when immunoprecipitations were carried out using antibody to αB-crystallin. Both G41S and G93A SOD-1 mutants, but not wild-type human or endogenous murine SOD-1, were coprecipitated (Fig. 6 C). In response to various physiological stresses, including heat shock or exposure to toxic agents, cells up-regulate families of heat shock/stress proteins. Their function is to prevent the accumulation of improperly folded proteins by binding to and promoting proper refolding of the damaged proteins or by facilitating their degradation by proteasomes (23Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar, 24Arrigo A.P. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar, 25Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our studies have provided evidence that heat shock proteins play a role in protecting cells from the toxicity of mutant SOD-1 proteins associated with human familial ALS. Coexpression of HSP70 prolonged viability of cultured motor neurons expressing mutant SOD-1 proteins and reduced the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). 2J. Roy, S. Minotti, D. A. Figlewicz, and H. D. Durham, unpublished observations. Survival of NIH3T3 cells expressing two different SOD-1 mutants, G41S and G93A, correlated with up-regulation of heat shock proteins (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Finally, HSP70, HSP40, and αB-crystallin were coimmunoprecipitated with mutant SOD-1 proteins from mutant SOD-1-transfected cell lines (this study). These data support the hypothesis that heat shock proteins protect cells, at least in part, by direct association with mutant protein. SOD-1, being a cytoplasmic enzyme, is normally soluble in nonionic detergent. However, a small percentage of mutant human SOD-1 protein was consistently detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction of protein extracts from NIH3T3 transfectants, spinal cord cultures prepared from embryos of G93A mutant SOD-1 transgenic mice, and lumbar spinal cord of adult G93A transgenic mice. Although mutant SOD-1 proteins can form homodimers with wild-type protein of different species (26Borchelt D.R. Guarnieri M. Wong P.C. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Xu Z.-S. Sisodia S.S. Price D.L. Cleveland D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3234-3238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the endogenous murine SOD-1 was not found in the detergent-insoluble pellet fraction despite overloading of gels with protein and blotting with antibody preferentially recognizing this species. HSP70 and mutant SOD-1 were coimmunoprecipitated from total cell extracts of the two mutant SOD-1 transfected NIH3T3 cell lines, whereas only trace amounts were detected from the supernatant fractions, indicating that HSP70·mutant SOD-1 complexes were predominantly detergent-insoluble. Distribution of proteins, including heat shock proteins, to the detergent-insoluble pellet occurs under a variety of stressful conditions, including heat shock, oxidative stress, ATP depletion, calcium overload, and treatment with sulfhydryl reagents (27Beckmann R.P. Lovett M. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1137-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Experientia. 1993; 49: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whether all detergent-insoluble mutant SOD-1 was complexed with HSP70 cannot be determined from the present experiments. Future studies will address whether posttranslational modification of mutant SOD-1 is required either to alter solubility or to promote binding of HSPs. That a relatively small fraction of total cellular mutant SOD-1 (estimated at 0.5–10%) was found in the pellet fraction in which the HSP·SOD-1 complexes were localized suggests the possibility that altered conformation conferred by the mutation alone may not be sufficient. Regardless, binding of heat shock proteins would be protective by preventing inappropriate protein-protein interactions and/or facilitating degradation. Although 3T3 cells may be physiologically different from spinal cord cells affected in familial ALS, detergent-insoluble mutant SOD-1 also was detected in spinal cord cultures prepared from embryos of G93A mutant SOD-1 transgenic mice and from lumbar spinal cord of adult G93A transgenic mice. Because significant expression of HSP70 was not detected in spinal cord (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), additional studies are under way to characterize expression of heat shock proteins and their interaction with mutant SOD-1 in these models. Although a proportion of mutant SOD-1 is detergent-insoluble in the transfected NIH3T3 cell lines, no large aggregates are visible by immunocytochemistry in these cells (13Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, in the study by Johnston et al. (15Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), formation of large aggregates of mutant SOD-1 was induced in transfected HEK cells by inhibiting proteasomal activity with lactacystin. The detergent insolubility of mutant SOD-1 and association with heat shock proteins observed in our study could represent an intermediate stage between soluble mutant SOD-1 and protein aggregated into inclusions. Inclusions may form when insufficient heat shock proteins are expressed to sequester mutant protein and facilitate its degradation in proteasomes. This could result from proteasomal inhibition, as in the experiment by Johnsonet al. (15Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), or from an inadequate stress response to increase levels of heat shock proteins. The propensity of mutant SOD-1 proteins to form aggregates differs according to cell type (17Durham H.D. Roy J. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Motor neurons are particularly susceptible, perhaps in part because they have a high threshold for activation of the stress response (30Manzerra P. Brown I.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Manzerra P. Brown I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Morrison-Bogorad M. Pardue S.

Res. 1995; 41: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, when spinal cord cultures are heat shocked, glial cells up-regulate HSP70, but motor neurons do not, even when the level of thermal stress is lethal. 3Z. Batulan, S. Minotti, and H. D. Durham, manuscript in preparation. In cultured motor neurons expressing mutant SOD-1 proteins, formation of aggregates is tightly linked to loss of viability (22Roy J. Minotti S. Dong L. Figlewicz D.A. Durham H.D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9673-9684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this does not necessarily mean that aggregates cause toxicity. The presence of aggregates may reflect the inability of the cell to elicit a sufficient stress response to maintain general chaperoning function in the cell, thus increasing its vulnerability to a variety of other physiological and environmental stresses, which ultimately contribute to cellular dysfunction and death. Similar arguments apply to other motor neuron diseases involving altered protein conformation. Colocalization of heat shock proteins and mutant protein within proteinaceous aggregates occurs in many neurodegenerative disorders, including those caused by expansion of CAG (polyglutamine) repeat sequences (reviewed in Ref. 34Martin J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's disease) is a motor neuron disease resulting from CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene (35La Spada A.R. Wilson E.M. Lubahn D.B. Harding A.E. Fischbeck K.H. Nature. 1991; 352: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Overexpression of heat shock proteins (HSP70, HSP40, and HDJ2/HSDJ) in HeLa or Neuro2A cell culture models of spinal bulbar muscular atrophy reduced both formation of aggregates and toxicity (36Stenoien D.L. Cummings C.J. Adams H.P. Mancini M.G. Patel K. DeMartino G.N. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Mancini M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 37Kobayashi Y. Kume A.

Aberrant distribution and altered ratios of the 20 S proteasomal core and PA700 proteasomal cap proteins, the two major components of 26 S proteasomes, were found in HeLa cells with aggregates of polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor. Thus, both deficiency of chaperones and impaired proteolysis could contribute to pathogenesis (36Stenoien D.L. Cummings C.J. Adams H.P. Mancini M.G. Patel K. DeMartino G.N. Marcelli M. Weigel N.L. Mancini M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that HSP70 may protect cells from mutant SOD-1 proteins at least in part by direct interaction with the mutant protein. This does not exclude other cytoprotective mechanisms for heat shock proteins, such as chaperoning other proteins damaged as a result of mutant SOD-1 expression or a general antiapoptotic effect (38Gabai V.L.

Additional studies are required to assess the feasibility of targeting stress protein pathways to treat motor neuron disease and other neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of aberrant proteins."

InA. thaliana, the major fraction of 12-oxophytodienoic acid occurs esterified at the sn1 position of the plastid-specific glycerolipid, monogalactosyl diglyceride.

Full-Text PDF Open Access Oxylipins are a diverse class of acyclic or cyclic oxidation products of fatty acids, many of which have regulatory functions in the cell (1Hamberg M. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 6: 375-384PubMed Google Scholar). Among the plant oxylipins, the cyclic octadecanoids, collectively called jasmonates, have received much recent interest because of their diverse biological functions as mediators of mechanotransduction, herbivore and pathogen defense reactions, senescence, and male fertility (2Wasternack C.

The oxidation of α-linolenic acid to 13(S)-hydroperoxolinolenic acid catalyzed by 13-lipoxygenase and the conversion of this intermediate to the first cyclic metabolite of the pathway, 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA), occur in plastids and thus, in the shoot, predominantly in the chloroplast (8Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C.

This prompted us to survey plant membrane lipids for the presence of cyclic octadecanoids. As a result of this study, we report here that the major fraction of OPDA in Arabidopsis thaliana occurs esterified in thesn1 position of plastid-specific galactolipids. The implications of this novel class of glycerolipids for octadecanoid physiology and chloroplast membrane biology are discussed. Greenhouse-grown rosettes of 6–8-week-oldA. thaliana C24 were used for all experiments. Plants were raised individually in standard soil at 18 °C (night) and 24 °C (day) (average temperatures) between 50 and 70% relative humidity and no less than 150 μmol of photons m−2s−1 (photosynthetically active radiation; supplementary light, if required, from sodium vapor lamps). Plants were cut above soil and immediately extracted, or they were immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C for minimum amounts of time. Wounding experiments were carried out as previously described (14Laudert D. Weiler E.W. Plant J. 1998; 15: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, all leaves of a rosette were crushed on one half of the leaf blade with a hemostat so that ∼10% of the total leaf area of the plant was wounded. After incubation for the times indicated, 1 g of leaf tissue was collected using the whole leaf blades of wounded leaves and analyzed for OPDA and JA content as described in detail in Ref. 15Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Hennig P. Laudert D. Andert L. Weiler E.W. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, using [2H5]OPDA and [13C2]JA (vide infra) as internal standards. Extraction (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and quantification of lipid-bound OPDA were done as described above. Leaves of A. thaliana were homogenized in a mortar with pestle in 12% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na2S2O4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin using 1 ml of buffer per g of fresh weight. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was used to analyze the enzymatic degradation of OPDA. To do this, to 1 ml of the protein extract (1.5 mg of protein), 1 μg/ml [2H5]OPDA and [13C2]JA were added, and the assay mixture was then incubated at room temperature. Aliquots were taken at the times indicated and worked up for the analysis of OPDA and JA. Initial experiments were carried out using the standard procedure of Bligh and Dyer (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). It was later found that yields and purity of the glycolipid fraction improved when the following preparative procedure was employed. Leaf tissue (500 g) was immersed in 600 ml of boiling methanol containing, as an antioxidant, 200 mg of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (butylated hydroxytoluene). After boiling for 15 min, the hot mixture was homogenized with a Polytron mixer, the homogenate was filtered on a Buechner funnel and then over two sequential paper filters, and the methanol was removed by vacuum distillation (25 mbar, 30 °C). The aqueous phase was adjusted to 70% (v/v) methanol (crude lipid extract). The crude lipid extract was passed over a column of 30 g of LiChroprep RP-18 (Merck). The column was eluted with 150 ml isopropyl alcohol: isohexane (80:55, v/v) and further fractionated on Chromabond NH2 (Macherey-Nagel; aliquots of one-eighth of the LiChroprep RP-18 eluate passed over 3 g of column material that was eluted with 10 ml of the above solvent). The effluents and eluates of the Chromabond NH2 column were pooled, the lipid extract was concentrated in a rotary evaporator (25 mbar, 30 °C), and the crude lipid was finally dried in a stream of N2 (yield, ∼11.3 mg from 500 g of leaf tissue). The residue was stored in 4–6 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) at −28 °C under nitrogen, if not used directly. The dried crude lipid was redissolved in 4–5 ml ofi-propanol:i-hexane (4:3, v/v) and centrifuged to remove particles. Aliquots (1 ml) of the clear solution were injected onto a semipreparative Nucleosil 100 HPLC column (Knauer; 25 mm × 8 mm inner diameter, particle size 15–25 μm) and eluted at a flow rate of 5 ml min−1 as follows: 1 min of eluent A, then a linear gradient in 10 min to 50% eluent B, then 27 min of isocratic flow at 50% solvent B, followed by a linear gradient over 10 min to 100% solvent B (solvent A: isopropyl alcohol: isohexane (4:3, v/v); solvent B: isopropyl alcohol: isohexane:H2O (8:6:1.5, v/v/v)) (17Demandre C. Tremolières A. Justin A.M. Mazliak P. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 481-485Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). UV detection was at 205 nm. The lipid composition was checked in each fraction by TLC according to (17Demandre C. Tremolières A. Justin A.M. Mazliak P. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 481-485Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The presence of esterified OPDA was checked by enzymatic treatment of each lipid fraction with Rhizopus arrhizus lipase (18Williams J.P. Khan M.U. Wong D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1407-1412PubMed Google Scholar). Esterified OPDA-containing fractions (Rt ≈ 15 min) were purified further. To do so, the OPDA-containing lipid from each run on the silica column was pooled, the solvent was removed in a stream of nitrogen, and the residue was redissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile:aqueous 50 mm ammonium acetate (70:30, v/v), centrifuged, and applied to a Dynamax C18 reversed phase HPLC column (Rainin; 250 mm × 21.4 mm inner diameter, 8 μm particle size, 60 Å pore size) at a flow rate of 20 ml min−1 (isocratic elution for 100 min, UV detection at 221 nm). The OPDA-containing fractions (Rt ≈ 52–57 min) were pooled and rechromatographed on the same column to yield a homogenous peak (Rt = 55 min), which was used for all further characterizations. From 1 kg of plant material, ∼1–2 mg of ester-OPDA lipid was obtained. To analyze the isomeric composition, optical purity, and quantity of OPDA, the methods described in detail previously, based on GC-MS, were employed (15, 19, 20,). Pentadeuterated OPDA (17[2H2],18[2H3]-cis-OPDA), synthesized according to Ref. 19Laudert D. Hennig P. Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Andert L. Weiler E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, was used as an internal standard in all experiments. If desired, JA was quantitated by GC-MS concurrently with OPDA using the same procedures and samples and an internal standard of [13C2]jasmonic acid. [13C2]Jasmonic acid was synthesized according to Ref. 21Knöfel H.D. Gross D. Z. Naturforsch. 1988; 43: 29-31Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar as follows. [13C3]Malonic acid (49 mg, >99 atom % 13C, Isotec Inc.) was converted to its dimethyl ester using CH2N2 and dissolved in 50 μl of 2-(2Z pentyl)-2-cyclopenten-1-one (Firmenich SA, Geneva, Switzerland), followed by the addition of 170 μl of 0.2m sodium methanolate. The mixture was stirred for 1.5 h under nitrogen at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with concentrated acetic acid (4 μl), and the sample was dried with nitrogen, redissolved in doubly distilled water (150 μl), and hydrolyzed under nitrogen for 18 h at 225 °C. After cooling, the reaction mixture was diluted into 0.1 mNaHCO3 (2–3 ml) and extracted twice with chloroform, and the reaction product (racemic [13C2]methyljasmonate) recovered from the chloroform phase was treated for about 2 h at 60 °C with 0.5m KOH to release the free acid, which was purified by HPLC as described in Ref. 15Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Hennig P. Laudert D. Andert L. Weiler E.W. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar (yield, ∼30%; purity, >99%; isotopic abundance, >99% as analyzed by GC-MS). Routine analyses of fatty acid and OPDA methyl esters were performed on a Finnigan MAT Magnum ion trap mass spectrometer in chemical ionization (reactant gas, methanol) mode (scan range, 50–398 amu; scan rate, 1 Hz). GC settings were as follows: DB-35 column (J & W Scientific, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm coat), helium carrier gas, splitless injection mode (250 °C), and temperature program of 1 min at 80 °C, 30 °C min−1 to 200 °C, 5 °C min−1 to 250 °C, and 10 min at 250 °C. Typical retention times (methyl esters) were as follows:cis-OPDA, 16.73 min (m/z = 307 [M + H]+); (9Z,12Z,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (α-linolenic acid), 12.07 min (m/z = 293 [M + H]+); (7Z,10Z,13Z)-hexadecatrienoic acid, 9.57 min (m/z = 265 [M + H]+). LC-MS analyses were performed on a triple-quadrupole instrument (TSQ 7000, Finnigan MAT) operated in electrospray (positive or negative ion) mode (4.5 kV; capillary temperature, 200 °C; atmospheric pressure ionization-collision-induced dissociation voltage, 15 V). The compounds to be analyzed were introduced (injection volume, 5 μl) through a Luna C18 HPLC column (Phenomenex; 150 mm × 1 mm inner diameter, 5 μm particle size) using methanol, 20 mm ammonium acetate (90:10, v/v) as eluent (isocratic flow rate of 50 μl min−1obtained with an Applied Biosystems 140 B dual-piston pump). The retention time of the OPDA-lipid was ∼30 min. MS/MS measurements were performed using argon collision gas (2 × 10−3 torr) and a collision energy at quadrupole 2 of 10 V. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed on a PE Biosystems Voyager instrument (matrix, dihydroxybenzoic acid) with positive ion detection (25 kV acceleration voltage, calibrated with human angiotensin I (Sigma)). The purified OPDA-containing lipid (∼20 mg) was dissolved in 0.7 ml of CD3OD. NMR spectra were recorded with Bruker AC 200 and AMX 500 (5-mm inverse TXI probe head) instruments. NMR conditions were as follows: H-H COSY, 450 mixing pulse; HMQC, phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase increment, bilinear rotation decoupling sequence, globally optimized alternating-phase rectangular pulses decoupled; HMBC, phase-sensitive using time-proportional phase increment, delay tuned to long range couplings, 71 ms. MGDG was isolated from Brassica napus according to Bligh and Dyer (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). After drying, the crude lipid was purified as described above using solid phase extraction and semipreparative HPLC (Nucleosil 100, 12–14-min fraction). The identity of the isolated MGDG was verified by electrospray ionization-MS. The presence of the 18:3/16:3 molecular species was indicated by the molecular ion [M + NH4]+; m/z = 764.61. The purified MGDG (10 mg) was treated with soybean lipoxygenase (1 mg of protein) and recombinant allene oxide synthase (2 mg of protein representing total soluble protein from Escherichia coli lysates from cells expressing the A. thalianaenzyme (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43132) Google Scholar, 19Laudert D. Hennig P. Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Andert L. Weiler E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 6 h. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was reextracted (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), and the lipids were hydrolyzed for 1 h in 0.5n KOH (100 °C). The released acyl moieties were analyzed by GC-MS (19Laudert D. Hennig P. Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Andert L. Weiler E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To monitor the functionality of the enzymes used, the reaction mixture contained, in addition to plant MGDG, [2H5]linolenic acid. This allowed us to monitor in parallel by GC-MS the conversion of the esterified α-linolenic acid in the MGDG substrate as well as that of free α-linolenic acid by the two enzymes. The presence and quantity of lipid-bound (esterified) OPDA was determined by lipase treatment of the corresponding fractions using an adaptation of the procedure described in Ref. 18Williams J.P. Khan M.U. Wong D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1407-1412PubMed Google Scholar, followed by GC-MS analysis (see above) of the released metabolites (OPDA, fatty acids) as their methyl esters. OPDA was released by the sn1-selective lipase from R. arrhizus (triacylglycerol lipase, EC 3.1.1.3, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as follows. To each fraction to be analyzed was added an internal standard ofcis-[2H5]OPDA (250 ng), and the sample was dried in a stream of nitrogen. The residue was then redissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris borate (pH 7.5). To this solution were added 25 units of lipase in 50 μl of 100 mmTris buffer (pH 7.5); controls received only buffer. The samples were then incubated at 37 °C (for the times indicated or overnight, if reactions were to go to completion), acidified (20 μl of concentrated HCl), and extracted two times with 2 ml of ethyl acetate followed by standard workup (20Schaller F. Weiler E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28066-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In preparative experiments aimed at purification of the OPDA-lipid, no internal standard ([2H5]OPDA) was used. Additional lipases tested were those from Candida rugosa(Sigma), Mucor javanicus (Sigma), and wheat germ (Sigma), and phospholipases tested were the phospholipases A2(EC 3.1.1.4) from Apis mellifica (Sigma) andNaja mossambica (Sigma). All lipases were assayed at pH 7.5; the two phospholipases A2 were assayed at pH 8.9. Alkaline hydrolysis of lipids was for 1 h at 100 °C in 0.5 m KOH, followed by acidification and further workup as above. During the course of studies on OPDA metabolism inA. thaliana, it was noticed that [2H5]OPDA added to leaf crude extracts was rapidly metabolized, whereas metabolism of endogenous (i.e.unlabeled) free OPDA followed a completely different time course; over at least 1 h, its level actually increased, before it started to decline also (Fig. 1). The pool from which this OPDA was released in crude extracts could be localized to the membrane fraction (100,000 × g pellet), whereas the 100,000 × g supernatant harbored the OPDA-metabolizing activity. When crude lipid from A. thaliana leaves obtained through Bligh and Dyer extraction (16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis (saponification conditions), it released OPDA. Control reactions verified that this OPDA fraction was not just dissolved in the lipid phase but covalently bound in an alkali-labile manner, i.e. most likely esterified (Fig.2).Figure 2Release of OPDA from the crude lipid ofA. thaliana by alkaline treatment. OPDA from nonhydrolyzed (left and middle bars) and hydrolyzed (saponification for 3 h at 25 °C in 1 nKOH, right bar) lipid was quantified by GC-MS.fw, fresh weight.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To scrutinize these initial results, the crude lipid was subjected to treatments with various lipases including phospholipases of the A2 type (Fig. 3). Whereas there was no (or marginal) release of OPDA by phospholipase A2 as well as by the wheat germ lipase, the two lipases that exhibited a preference for the sn1 position of glycerolipids (the fungal enzymes from R. arrhizus andM. javanicus (18Williams J.P. Khan M.U. Wong D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1407-1412PubMed Google Scholar)) efficiently released OPDA from the crude lipid fraction. It was estimated that ∼80–90% of the total OPDA content of A. thaliana shoots occurred covalently bound in the lipid fraction in plants not subjected to any stimulus inducing the jasmonate signaling system. The endogenous activity that released OPDA from the lipid-bound form was associated with the 5,000 ×g pellet but was not detected in the 12,000 ×g supernatant of crude extracts and, thus, most likely represents a membrane-associated system. This activity was not characterized further in the present study. Analysis by chiral GC-MS of the isomeric status of OPDA released from the lipid revealed that the lipase-released metabolite was thecis(+) enantiomer, (9S,13S)-12-oxophytodienoic acid, the same enantiomer that is also extracted in free form from plants (19Laudert D. Hennig P. Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Andert L. Weiler E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Schaller F. Weiler E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28066-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Alkaline hydrolysis, of course, yielded predominantly the trans isomer (9S,13R)-OPDA), which is produced from the cis form by enolization, particularly under alkaline conditions. The method of analysis of OPDA enantiomers has been described in detail elsewhere (19Laudert D. Hennig P. Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Andert L. Weiler E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The solubility of the OPDA-lipid in aqueous methanol proved optimum around 80% (v/v), whereas free OPDA is most soluble around 50% (v/v) methanol. Thus, although less polar than the free acid, the OPDA-lipid turned out to be a remarkably polar metabolite that could be extracted from the plant material more selectively with aqueous methanol (70% v/v) than with conventional, less polar, lipid-solvent mixtures (e.g. see Ref. 16Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Using the procedure detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” from 600 mg of crude lipid (corresponding to 26.5 kg of leaf tissue), 20 mg of an apparently homogenous OPDA-lipid fraction was obtained for structure elucidation. During the course of the purification, the compound, in all steps, behaved most similarly to the plastid lipid MGDG. The OPDA-lipid eluted at Rt ≈ 15 min from the first HPLC column (Nucleosil 100, coeluting with MGDG) and at Rt ≈ 52–57 min from the reversed phase column separating the lipid molecular species. The purified material, upon rechromatography, eluted from the same column as a single peak with Rt = 55 min (Fig. 4). Treatment of the purified lipid fraction with thesn1-specific R. arrhizus lipase (Fig. 4,inset) resulted in the immediate release of two acidic metabolites, which were identified by GC-MS as α-linolenic acid and OPDA. After a lag phase of ∼5 min, when the rates of OPDA and α-linolenic acid release began to level off and the enzyme began to attack the sn2 position, a third acidic metabolite began to accumulate, which was identified as (7Z,10Z,13Z)-hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3). These results indicated that (i) a mixture of two lipids had been obtained by the purification procedures employed (attempts to resolve this further were unsuccessful), and (ii) compound A of that mixture was a diacyl lipid with α-linolenic acid in thesn1 position and 16:3 in the sn2 position, and compound B was a diacyl lipid with OPDA in the sn1 position and 16:3 in the sn2 position. The occurrence of 16:3 in thesn2 position is typical for membrane lipids synthesized in plastids (22Somerville C. Browse J. Science. 1991; 252: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF analysis of the sample (Fig. 5) revealed two masses of m/z 769.5 andm/z 783.4, which were Na+ adducts of metabolites having molecular masses of 746.5 and 760.4 Da, respectively. These masses are in agreement with calculated masses of monogalactosyl-(18:3/16:3)-diacylglycerol (compound A) and of monogalactosyl-(OPDA/16:3)-diacylglycerol (compound B). From the known plastid lipids, no other class could produce these two masses with incorporation of the acyl moieties identified after lipase treatment. The analysis thus confirmed the enzymatic data that the purified lipid was a mixture of two components, differing in the substituent at the sn1 position. LC-MS and LC-MS/MS with electrospray ionization further corroborated the proposed structure of the OPDA-lipid (compound B) in both negative (Fig. 6 A) and positive (Fig.6 B) ion mode. The compound eluted from the LC column atRt = 29.5 min. The mass of the molecular ion was identified from the [M − H]− ion (m/z 759.5), from the acetate adduct [M + Ac − H]− (m/z 819.7), and from the [M + H]+ ion (m/z 761.6) as well as from several positively charged solvent adducts (see Fig.6 B) to be 760.5 Da. MS/MS of the [M + Ac − H]− ion yielded several diagnostic fragments (cf. Fig. 6 A), among them the [OPDA − H]− fragment (m/z 291.1) and the [16:3 − H]− fragment (m/z249.3), most likely representing the carboxylate anions of the two acyl moieties, as has been observed with other monogalactosyl diacylglycerol species (23Kim Y.H. Yoo J.S. Kim M.S. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 968-977Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). No 18:3(linolenic acid)-derived ions were observed in the 29.5-min peak. Likewise, MS/MS of the [M + H]+ ion (m/z 761.1) yielded the α-fragmentation derivatives showing loss of the esterified 16:3 fatty acid (m/z 349.2) and the corresponding loss of OPDA (m/z 307.2). Thus, the mass spectrometric analysis was in agreement with a proposed structure of a MGDG species in which one of the acyl groups is a 16:3 fatty acid, and the other is OPDA. The structure ofsn1-O-(12-oxophytodienoyl)-sn2-O-(hexadecatrienoyl)-monogalactosyl diglyceride could be further supported by two-dimensional NMR experiments such as COSY, HMQC, and HMBC (TableI, Fig. 7). The resonances ofsn1, sn2, and sn3 were assigned by inspection of chemical shifts and multiplicities (Table I). As seen in Fig. 7, the anomeric proton of the sugar moiety at δ 4.22 ppm (J = 7.4 Hz, which proves the β-linkage) couples via HMBC with thesn3 carbon at δ 63.9 ppm. The galactopyranosyl nature of this sugar moiety could be proven by analysis of the spin system, showing e.g. the typical broad doublet of the H-4′ at δ 3.82 ppm (J = 3.2 Hz). The signals C-1“ and C-1‴ of the unsaturated fatty acids appear at δ 174.6 and 175.0 ppm, making it impossible to assign the linkage position at the glycerol skeleton. However, the sn1 linkage of the OPDA has been proven by the enzymatic methods already described above. The chemical shifts of the carbon and proton resonances, as well as the multiplicity, are in agreement with the data reported formerly for OPDA (24Bohlmann F. Jakupovic J. Ahmed M. Schuster A.

The overlapping of the signals of the olefinic protons 7”, 8“, 10”, 11“, 13”, 14“, 15‴, and 16‴ at δ 5.30–5.50 ppm did not allow the determination of the E/Z configuration.

With the exception of stathmin, they are expressed exclusively in the nervous system, where they display different spatio-temporal and functional regulations and hence play at least partially distinct and possibly complementary roles in relation to the control of development, plasticity, and neuronal activities. At the molecular level, each possesses a specific “stathmin-like domain” and, with the exception of stathmin, various combinations of N-terminal extensions involved in their association with intracellular membrane compartments. We show here that each stathmin-like domain also displays specific biochemical and tubulin interaction properties. They are all able to sequester two α/β tubulin heterodimers as revealed by their inhibitory action on tubulin polymerization and by gel filtration. However, they differ in the stabilities of the complexes formed as well as in their interaction kinetics with tubulin followed by surface plasmon resonance as follows: strong stability and slow kinetics for RB3; medium for SCG10, SCLIP, and stathmin; and weak stability and rapid kinetics for RB3′. These results suggest that the fine-tuning of their stathmin-like domains contributes to the specific functional roles of stathmin family proteins in the regulation of microtubule dynamics within the various cell types and subcellular compartments of the developing or mature nervous system.

Intracellular signaling and cytoskeleton dynamics are key processes for these events, in which stathmin family phosphoproteins are good candidates for playing a significant role. The generic element of this phylogenetically conserved family (reviewed in Ref. 1Curmi P. Gavet O. Charbaut E. Ozon S. Lachkar-Colmerauer S. Manceau V. Siavoshian S. Maucuer A. Sobel A. Cell Struct.

The stathmin family further includes SCG10, SCLIP, RB3, and its splice variants RB3′ and RB3“, expressed exclusively in various cell types and populations of the nervous system, and possessing a stathmin-like domain (SLD)1 with various N-terminal extensions (3Ozon S.

Their involvement in signal transduction and regulation of microtubule dynamics, in relation with their different spatio-temporal expression patterns, suggests that stathmin family proteins may play related but distinct and likely complementary roles in the regulation of differentiation, activities, and plasticity of the nervous system.During rat development, expression of stathmin family proteins is highest from late embryogenesis until a week after birth (3Ozon S.

They are likely involved in neural differentiation: SCG10 was shown to be induced in neural crest cells when they differentiate into sympathetic neurons (7Anderson D.J. Axel R.

This role might be in relation with differentiated neural activities or with regeneration or plasticity, as suggested by the induction of SCG10 with neurite regrowth following corticostriatal deafferentiation (10McNeill T.H. Mori N. Cheng H.W. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or the up-regulation of RB3/RB3“ (but not SCG10) after neuronal activation in the hippocampus (8Beilharz E.J.

Interestingly, the various stathmin family proteins are expressed in different but overlapping cell populations (3Ozon S. Byk T. Sobel A. J.

Stathmin family proteins may thus play related but distinct roles in different physiological environments.Stathmin (reviewed in Ref. 16Sobel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 301-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) has been originally identified as a relay protein integrating diverse intracellular signaling pathways (17Sobel A.

Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) is the protein whose interaction with stathmin has been best characterized. Stathmin indeed interacts with two α/β tubulin heterodimers in vitro to form a T2S complex (22Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S.L. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The two tubulin heterodimers bind mostly the predicted α-helical “interaction” domain of stathmin (24Redeker V. Lachkar S.

Interestingly, the activity of stathmin toward tubulin and microtubules is diminished when it is phosphorylated on various site combinations (28Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Horwitz S.B. Shen H.-J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Being phosphorylated during mitosis and in response to numerous extracellular signals, stathmin appears as a phosphorylation-dependent microtubule destabilizing factor, which may play important roles in proliferating as well as postmitotic cell regulations, in particular in the nervous system (1Curmi P. Gavet O. Charbaut E. Ozon S. Lachkar-Colmerauer S. Manceau V. Siavoshian S. Maucuer A. Sobel A. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).The various stathmin-like domains (3Ozon S. Byk T. Sobel A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2386-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Ozon S. Maucuer A. Sobel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 794-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) of the stathmin family proteins display 65–75% amino acid identity with stathmin, including the predicted α-helix, and several of the four stathmin phosphorylation sites. Besides their stathmin-like domain, the neural members of the stathmin family are characterized by additional N-terminal domains. The A domain is common to SCG10, SCLIP, and RB3/RB3′/RB3“ with 56–68% amino acid sequence identity. As demonstrated in the case of SCG10 and very likely in the case of SCLIP and RB3/RB3′/RB3”, it is responsible for the membrane attachment and targeting of the proteins to the Golgi area (33Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.A. Catsicas M. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); the presence of SCG10 is also demonstrated in neuritic processes and in the growth cone (3Ozon S. Byk T. Sobel A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2386-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,6Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 28Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Osen-Sand A. Sobel A. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). RB3/RB3′/RB3“ also possesses a specific additional A′ domain between the A and the stathmin-like domains. RB3” further possesses another additional A“ domain, between A and A′. Finally, RB3′ differs from RB3 within its stathmin-like domain by an alternative splicing thus resulting in a different C terminus. The roles of these specific domains are still unknown, but they likely participate in extending and specifying the properties and functions of the various stathmin family proteins.Like stathmin, the other members of its phosphoprotein family were also shown to destabilize the microtubule network when overexpressed in cultured cells (28Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Antonsson B. Kassel D. Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Riederer B.M. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8439-8446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All these proteins thus form a family involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics in the nervous system, in relation to differentiation, activities, and plasticity. Their diversity, partly originating in their different spatio-temporal expression and in the presence of specific combinations of N-terminal domains, suggests that they play related and likely complementary roles. The stathmin-like domains of stathmin family proteins might also have different contributions to the control of microtubules, especially as they show a molecular variability that could result in different tubulin binding and hence functional properties. This would be particularly relevant in cells of the nervous system and in their subcompartments such as axons, dendrites, or the growth cone, which display specific and distinctive microtubule organization and dynamics. To test this hypothesis, we examined the specific properties of the various stathmin-like domains. We show that they each interfere with microtubule polymerization and interact with two α/β tubulin heterodimers. However, the T2S complexes formed have different stabilities and display distinct tubulin-SLD interaction kinetics, suggesting that each stathmin family protein is involved in microtubule dynamics regulation in a specific, distinctive fashion. The specific functional properties of the various proteins of the stathmin family in the nervous system thus appear to be determined not only by their characteristic N-terminal extensions but also through the fine-tuning of their stathmin-like domains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs for Prokaryote Expression of Stathmin-like DomainsStandard recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of human stathmin (37Maucuer A. Doye V. Sobel A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) within the pET-8c vector (38Curmi P. Maucuer A. Asselin S. Lecourtois M. Chaffotte A. Schmitter J.M. Sobel A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used for stathmin expression. Rat SCG10 (6Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K. Lo L.C. Anderson D.J.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 794-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) cDNA clones were used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the stathmin-like domain coding region. At the 5′ end, the primers (Genset, Paris, France) were designed to introduce a NcoI site including an initiating ATG codon, a following alanine codon, and the appropriate sequence for each stathmin-like domain, starting at the residue corresponding to amino acid 5 in the stathmin sequence. At the 3′ end, aBamHI site was introduced in the non-coding region. Vent DNA-polymerase and restriction enzymes were from Biolabs (Surrey, British Columbia, Canada). The resulting digested polymerase chain reaction fragments were subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pET-8c plasmid (Novagen, Madison WI) (39Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar). For protein expression, the various plasmids were used to transform the Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla CA), which provides an inducible expression system suitable for the pET-8c vector.Recombinant SLD Expression, Characterization, and PurificationProkaryote ExpressionAn overnight preculture was used to seed 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, which was grown at 37 °C. At exponential phase, recombinant protein expression was induced for 3 h by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacteria were then pelleted by sedimentation at 4 °C, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, containing the antiprotease mixture Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and sonicated three times for 1 min on ice.Heat Stability and Protein PurificationBacterial extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 rpm (Optima MAX ultracentrifuge, rotor TLA 100.2, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) for 6 min at 4 °C to yield the S2 supernatants and P2 pellets. The S2 supernatants were then heated to 100 °C for 5 min in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, and the samples were centrifuged again as above to yield the S3 supernatants and P3 pellets (17Sobel A.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3765-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).S3 extracts were adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, using Centriprep 10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA), loaded on a Q-Sepharose FF anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a 0–200 mm NaCl linear gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Stathmin-like domain-positive fractions were pooled, concentrated with Centriprep 10, and loaded on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 FPLC gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EGTA. Stathmin-like domain-positive fractions were pooled and concentrated as above. The precise masses of the purified protein products were checked by MALDI-TOF (see below), and their protein concentrations were accurately determined by amino acid analysis. In the case of RB3SLD and RB3′SLD, purification and subsequent experiments were performed in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol to avoid disulfide bond formation.Mass Spectrometric AnalysisPurified recombinant proteins were analyzed with a matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Work station, PE Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). The spectra of positive ions were recorded in linear mode with an accelerating voltage of 25 kV and a delayed extraction of 400 ns. The samples were mixed with a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxicinnamic acid, Aldrich) in 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. External calibration was performed with horse apomyoglobin using the monoprotonated and biprotonated ions with average mass-to-charge ratios of 16,952.56 and 8476.78, respectively.The tryptic peptide digests of RB3SLD and RB3′SLD were desalted and mixed with a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the peptide mixture were performed in positive ion reflector mode with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a delayed extraction of 200 ns. External calibration was performed using the protonated ions of des-Arg bradykinin, angiotensin, and ACTH-(clip 1–17) with monoisotopic mass-to-charge ratios of 904.468, 1296.685, and 2465.199 respectively.After desalting of the tryptic digests, half of the sample was dried and dissolved in 3 μl of a mixture of water/formic acid/methanol (49:1:50) for tandem mass spectrometry analyses using a nano-electrospray ionization Q-TOF (Q-TOF II, Micromass, Manchester, UK). The samples were loaded into nanoelectrospray capillaries (Protana, Odense, Denmark). The capillary voltage was set at 1000 V, the cone voltage at 45 V, and collision energies were about 20–30 eV. Argon was used as the collision gas. The instrument was calibrated between 150 and 2000 atomic mass units with a solution of NaI.Stokes Radius MeasurementThe Stokes radii (RS) and apparent molecular masses of the various proteins were measured by gel filtration on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 80 mmPipes-KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.5, at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate. The standard proteins used to calibrate the column are as follows: ribonuclease A (RS = 16.4 Å), chymotrypsinogen A (RS = 20.9 Å), ovalbumin (RS = 30.5 Å), bovine serum albumin (RS = 35.5 Å), aldolase (RS = 48.1 Å), catalase (RS = 52.2 Å), and ferritin (RS= 61 Å). The void volume V0 was measured as the blue dextran elution volume and the total volume of the gel bedVt as the acetone elution volume. The data were plotted according to Siegel and Monty (40Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). At least two runs were performed for each protein.Bovine Brain Tubulin PreparationTubulin was purified from bovine brain crude extracts by two cycles of polymerization (41Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F.

Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). Tubulin was stored at −80 °C in either 25 mm Mes-KOH, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm EGTA, 0.125 mm MgCl2, 0.025 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, for short term use, or in 50 mm Mes-KOH, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 3.4 m glycerol, 0.1 m GTP, pH 6.8, for long term storage. In the latter case, an additional cycle of polymerization was performed before use, at the end of which tubulin was resuspended in 12.5 mm Mes-KOH, 0.25 mmEGTA, 0.25 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8. Tubulin concentration was determined by amino acid analysis.In Vitro Tubulin Polymerization AssaySamples containing varying concentrations of either tubulin alone or tubulin plus stathmin-like domain in 50 mmMes-KOH, 30% glycerol, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm GTP, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8, were loaded in 100-μl quartz cuvettes with a 1-cm light path. Tubulin polymerization was turbidimetrically monitored at 350 nm (43Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1908-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) in an Ultrospec 3000 thermostated spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The temperature was raised from 3 to 37 °C, and the increase in turbidity was recorded until a plateau was reached. The temperature was then set back at 3 °C, and the decrease in turbidity recorded until depolymerization was complete. The polymerized stationary state level was defined as the difference between the plateau value at 37 °C and the base line after return at 3 °C.Gel Filtration Assay100-μl samples containing 10 μm tubulin, either alone or with varying concentrations of each stathmin-like domain, were analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 80 mmPipes-KOH, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5, at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate. The elution profile of the samples was recorded either at 278 nm (only tubulin is visible, as the stathmin-like domains have very few aromatic amino acids) or at 226 nm (both species monitored). When necessary, fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a rabbit polyclonal serum against SCG10 (4Ozon S. Maucuer A. Sobel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 794-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)BIAcore 2000 system, CM5 sensorchips, HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, P20 surfactant 0.005% (v/v), pH 7.4), and the Amine Coupling Kit (N-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide, ethanolamine-hypochloride) were from BIAcore AB (Uppsala, Sweden).Sensorchip CouplingThe first flow cell of each CM5 sensor chip was coupled with bovine serum albumin to be used as a reference flow cell, and the three others were coupled with various stathmin-like domains to allow direct comparison. The coupling was performed using the Amine Coupling Kit and the automated Immobilization Application Wizard included in the BIAcore software. The proteins to be coupled were in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and the coupling level was aimed at 1500 resonance units, except for RB3′SLD for which we coupled two flow cells at 1500 and 2500 resonance units.Interaction CyclesTo study the interaction of tubulin on the flow cells coupled with the various stathmin-like domains, SPR experiments were performed at 20 μl/min in 80 mmPipes-KOH, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5. In a single interaction run, a given concentration of tubulin was injected for 720 s to record the association phase on the four flow cells, after which buffer was supplied for 720 s to record the dissociation phase. At last, 10 μl of 20 mm NaOH, 2.5m NaCl were injected to regenerate the flow cells. The whole process was automated, and we performed multiple interaction runs with tubulin concentrations ranging from 0.6 to 20 μm. We checked the absence of mass transfer. For the analysis, the sensorgrams were processed by subtracting the corresponding reference flow cell sensorgram, in order to abolish base-line drift, bulk, and nonspecific interaction contributions. The half-association (dissociation) time was determined as follows: if RM is the maximal signal reached during the association phase, then the half-association (dissociation) time is the time elapsed from the start of the association (dissociation) phase to reach the RM/2 level.RESULTSBiochemical Characterization of Recombinant Stathmin-like DomainsAll stathmin family proteins possess a stathmin-like domain displaying a high (65–75%) amino acid sequence identity with stathmin (Fig. 1).

These genes encode unique isoforms of the a-subunit that have previously been shown to reside in different intracellular compartments in yeast. Vph1p localizes to the central vacuole, whereas Stv1p is present in some other compartment, possibly the Golgi or endosomes. To compare the properties of V-ATPases containing Vph1p or Stv1p, Stv1p was expressed at higher than normal levels in a strain disrupted in both genes, under which conditions V-ATPase complexes containing Stv1p appear in the vacuole. Complexes containing Stv1p showed lower assembly with the peripheral V1 domain than did complexes containing Vph1p. When corrected for this lower degree of assembly, however, V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p and Stv1p had similar kinetic properties. Both exhibited a Km for ATP of about 250 μm, and both showed resistance to sodium azide and vanadate and sensitivity to nanomolar concentrations of concanamycin A. Stv1p-containing complexes, however, showed a 4–5-fold lower ratio of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis than Vph1p-containing complexes. We also compared the ability of V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p or Stv1p to undergo in vivo dissociation in response to glucose depletion. Vph1p-containing complexes present in the vacuole showed dissociation in response to glucose depletion, whereas Stv1p-containing complexes present in their normal intracellular location (Golgi/endosomes) did not. Upon overexpression of Stv1p, Stv1p-containing complexes present in the vacuole showed glucose-dependent dissociation. Blocking delivery of Vph1p-containing complexes to the vacuole in vps21Δ andvps27Δ strains caused partial inhibition of glucose-dependent dissociation. These results suggest that dissociation of the V-ATPase complex in vivo is controlled both by the cellular environment and by the 100-kDa a-subunit isoform present in the complex.

Acidification of these compartments is essential for many cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular targeting, protein processing and degradation, and coupled transport. V-ATPases are also present in the plasma membrane of certain specialized cells, including osteoclasts (9Chatterjee D. Chakraborty M. Leit M. Neff L. Jamsa-Kellokumpu S. Fuchs R. Baron R. Proc. Natl.

The V1domain is a peripheral complex of molecular mass 570 kDa composed of eight different subunits of molecular mass 70–14 kDa (subunits A-H) that is responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The V0 domain is a 260-kDa integral complex composed of five subunits of molecular mass 100–17 kDa (subunits a, d, c, c′, and c′′) that is responsible for proton translocation. This structure is similar to that of the ATP synthases (or F- ATPases) that function in ATP synthesis in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria (12Weber J. Senior A. Biochim. Biophys.

Sequence homology between these classes of ATPase has been identified for both the nucleotide binding subunits (18Zimniak L. Dittrich P. Gogarten J.P. Kibak H. Taiz L. J. Biol.

Bowman B.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 100-kDa a-subunit of the V-ATPase is an integral membrane protein possessing an amino-terminal hydrophilic domain and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain containing multiple putative membrane-spanning segments (23Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3877-3881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, the 100-kDa subunit is encoded by two genes, VPH1 and STV1. Vph1p and Stv1p are homologous proteins displaying 54% identity and 71% similarity (23Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D.

These proteins show distinct intracellular localization, with Vph1p localized to the vacuole and Stv1p normally localized to some other intracellular compartment, possibly Golgi or endosomes (24Manolson M.F.

These results suggest that the 100-kDa a-subunit contains information necessary to target the V-ATPase to the appropriate intracellular site. To compare the properties of V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p and Stv1p, we have taken advantage of the observation that overexpression of Stv1p in a yeast strain deleted in both VPH1 andSTV1 results in mislocalization of Stv1p to the vacuole (24Manolson M.F.

This allowed us to compare the properties of V-ATPase complexes present in the same intracellular compartment (the vacuole) that differed only in the a-subunit isoform present. Zymolyase 100T was obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc. Concanamycin A was purchased from Fluka Chemical Corp. Protease inhibitors were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The monoclonal antibody 3F10 (directed against the HA antigen), which is conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, was also from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 against the yeast V-ATPase A-subunit (26Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the monoclonal antibody 10D7 against the 100-kDa a-subunit (27Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J.

Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and other molecular biology reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc., Promega, and New England Biolabs. ATP, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and most other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Yeast strain MM112 (MATα Δvph1::LEU2Δstv1::LYS2 his3-(Δ200 leu2 lys2 ura3–52) and plasmid MM322 (VPH1 in pRS316) (24Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to generate and study the HA-tagged Vph1p. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium or synthetic dropout (SD) medium (28Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). The STV1 gene was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from yeast strain YPH500 using primers containing the restriction enzyme sites XbaI andBamHI and then cloned into pRS316 using the XbaI and BamHI sites (pRS316-STV1). The sequence of the cloned STV1 gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing using an automated sequencer from Applied Biosystems. The oligonucleotides used for amplification of the STV1 gene were as follows, with the restriction enzyme sites underlined: STV1 forward (XbaI), 5′-GGCCTCTAGATTAGAGGAAATGCAATTTTCTATCATC-3′; STV1 reverse (BamHI), 5′-GGCCGGATCCTATTGGTAGACCACTTGACCGAC-3′. An HpaI site was introduced into VPH1 using polymerase chain reaction, and then the two tandem repeats of the nine-amino acid HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) were ligated into the HpaI site of pRS316-VPH1(pRS316-VPH1::HA) and theBglII site of pRS316-STV1(pRS316-STV1::HA). This resulted in insertion of the tandem HA tags after amino acid residue Asn-185 of Vph1p and the corresponding residue (Leu-227) of Stv1p. AXbaI-BamHI fragment of pRS316-STV1::HA was ligated intoXbaI-BamHI sites of the 2-μm plasmid, YEp352 (YEp352-STV1::HA). Yeast cells (MM112) lacking functional endogenous Vph1p and Stv1p were transformed using the lithium acetate method (29Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar) with the wild-type pRS316-VPH1 as a positive control, pRS316 vector alone as a negative control, pRS316-VPH1::HA, pRS316-STV1::HA, and YEp352-STV1::HA. The transformants were selected on uracil minus (Ura−) plates as described previously (30Ausubel F. M Brent R. Kingston R. E Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. JohnWiley & Sons, Inc, New York1992Google Scholar). Growth phenotypes of the mutants were assessed on YPD plates buffered with 50 mmKH2PO4 or 50 mm succinic acid to either pH 7.5 or pH 5.5. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated using a modification of the protocol described by Uchida et al. (31Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1090-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast were grown overnight at 30 °C to 1 × 107 cells/ml in 1 liter of selective medium. Cells were pelleted, washed once with water, and resuspended in 100 ml of 10 mm dithiothreitol and 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.4. After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, cells were pelleted again, washed once with 100 ml of YPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.5, resuspended in 100 ml of YPD medium containing 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm MES-Tris, pH 7.5, and 2 mg of zymolase 100T and incubated at 30 °C with gentle shaking for 60 min. The resulting spheroplasts were osmotically lysed, and the vacuoles were isolated by flotation on two consecutive Ficoll gradients. Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Yeast were grown to log phase at 30 °C in selective medium, whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (26Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% acrylamide gels. The expression of the 100-kDa subunit was detected by Western blotting using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA, whereas subunit A was detected by monoclonal antibody 8B1-F3 directed against subunit A followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Assembly of the V-ATPase was assessed by measurement of the amount of subunit A present on isolated vacuolar membranes (27Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Leng X.H. Manolson M. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Vacuolar membrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% acrylamide gels, and the 100-kDa subunit, subunit A, and subunit d were detected by Western blotting as described above. Blots were developed using a chemiluminescent detection method obtained from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotomeric assay as described previously (33Forgac M. Cantley L. Wiedenmann B. Altstiel L. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) with some modification. To determine theKmATP and theVmax for V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p or Stv1p, ATPase activity was measured over a range of ATP concentrations from 0.1–2 mm ATP, whereas MgSO4 was maintained at 4 mm. Vacuoles isolated from thevph1Δstv1Δ strain expressing Vph1p (3 μg of protein) or Stv1p (10 μg of protein) were incubated in ATPase assay buffer (50 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.35 mm NADH, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase) with 0.1% Me2SO or 1 μm concanamycin A at room temperature for 10 min. The assay was then started by the addition ATP at the indicated concentrations, and the absorbance at 341 nm was measured continuously using a Kontron UV-visible spectrophotometer. V-ATPase activity was defined as that fraction of the ATPase activity inhibited by 1 μm concanamycin A (typically 90% for Vph1p-containing vacuoles and 50% for Stv1p-containing vacuoles).KmATP and Vmaxwere calculated from double-reciprocal plots of ATP concentrationversus V-ATPase activity expressed in μmol ATP/min/mg of protein. To examine the effect of inhibitors on ATPase activity, isolated vacuolar membranes were incubated in ATPase buffer containing 0.1% Me2SO, 1 μm concanamycin A, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, or 0.5 mm sodium azide at room temperature for 10 min followed by initiation of the assay by the addition of 0.5 mm ATP. ATP-dependent proton transport activity was measured by quenching of ACMA fluorescence using a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorometer as previously described (34Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion was measured as described previously (35Kane P.M. J. Biol.

The vph1Δstv1Δ strain MM112 expressing Vph1p or Stv1p from the single copy plasmid pRS316 or Stv1p using the high copy plasmid YEp352 was grown in selective medium overnight to an absorbance at 600 nm of <1.0. The yeast strains SF838–1D (MATα leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his4–519 ade6 gal2 pep4–3), SGY79 (MATα leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his4–519 ade6 gal2 pep4–3 vps21::Kan r), and SGY73 (MATα leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his4–519 ade6 gal2 pep4–3 vps27::LEU2) (36Gerard S.R. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were grown under the same conditions except using YPD media. The cells were converted to spheroplasts by treatment with zymolase 100T and incubated in YEP media with or without 2% glucose for 40 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were pelleted and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% C12E9, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). An aliquot (corresponding to ∼6 × 105 cells) was removed to allow analysis of proteins present in the whole cell lysate. The V-ATPase complexes were immunoprecipitated from the remainder of the lysate (corresponding to ∼3 × 106 cells) using 8B1-F3 against the A-subunit and protein G-agarose followed by separation on 8% acrylamide gels and transfer to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was then performed separately using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated monoclonal antibodies 3F10 against HA or 10D7-A7 against Vph1p to detect the V0 domain or antibody 8B1-F3 against the A-subunit to detect the V1 domain followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Dissociation of the V-ATPase complex is reflected as a reduction in the amount of the 100-kDa subunit immunoprecipitated using the antibody directed against subunit A (located in the V1 domain). Blots were developed using the chemiluminescent detection system from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories. We wished to compare the properties of V-ATPases containing Vph1p and Stv1p, the two isoforms of the yeast 100-kDa a-subunit. Because these isoforms normally reside in different intracellular compartments, it was necessary to devise a strategy that would allow complexes containing these two isoforms to be targeted to the same intracellular membrane. It has previously been shown that overexpression of Stv1p in a strain disrupted in both VPH1 and STV1 causes a significant amount of Stv1p to appear in the vacuolar membrane (24Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14064-14074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Vph1p normally localizes to the vacuole, this finding allowed us to directly compare the properties of V-ATPase complexes present in the same intracellular compartment that differed only in the a-subunit isoform present. To detect the expression level of each a-subunit isoform, tandem HA epitope tags were inserted in the amino-terminal region of both Vph1p and Stv1p. Expression of the HA-tagged form of either Vph1p or Stv1p using the low copy plasmid pRS316 in thevph1Δstv1Δ double-deletion strain MM112 led to a wild-type growth phenotype. That is, cells showed normal growth at both pH 7.5 and 5.5. This was also true using expression of Stv1p from the high copy plasmid YEp352. Western blotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1) indicated that Stv1p is expressed at a lower level from the single copy plasmid pRS316 than is Vph1p. Expression of Stv1p using the high copy plasmid YEp352 led to a significant increase in expression levels of Stv1p. To confirm previous reports that overexpression of Stv1p led to its presence in the vacuolar membrane, vacuoles were isolated from each of the strains shown in Fig. 1, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig.2, although Vph1p was detectable in the vacuolar membrane using the single copy plasmid, Stv1p was not. By contrast, when Stv1p was expressed at higher levels using the multicopy plasmid, it was detectable in the vacuolar membrane at levels comparable with Vph1p. Overexposure of the gel shown in Fig. 2 revealed very low levels of Stv1p in the vacuolar membrane when expressed using pRS316. Quantitation using densitometric analysis indicated that although the ratio of Vph1p to Stv1p using pRS316 in whole cell lysates was 3:1 (Fig. 1, second and third lanes from the left), the ratio in the vacuolar membrane was 30:1 (Fig. 2, longer exposure, not shown). These results confirmed that although Stv1p is normally not targeted to the vacuole, overexpression results in the appearance of a significant amount of Stv1p in the vacuole. To assess the degree of assembly of V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p and Stv1p, vacuoles isolated from each strain were also probed using an antibody directed against the 70-kDa A-subunit. It has previously been shown that the A-subunit (and other V1 subunits) only associates with the vacuolar membrane if assembly of the V-ATPase complex is normal (27Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Leng X.H. Manolson M. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, although the level of Stv1p in the vacuolar membrane using the high copy plasmid is comparable with that of Vph1p using pRS316, the level of A-subunit associated with Stv1p is much lower than that associated with Vph1p. Quantitation by densitometry indicates an 8-fold reduction in the level of A-subunit associated with vacuoles containing Stv1p relative to vacuoles containing Vph1p. This result indicates that, at least when present in the environment of the central vacuole, V-ATPase complexes containing Stv1p are less assembled than V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p. To determine whether introduction of the HA epitope tags into Vph1p and Stv1p altered assembly of the V-ATPase complex, vacuolar membranes from strains expressing either tagged or untagged versions of Vph1p and Stv1p were probed by Western blot using antibodies against HA, Vph1p, subunit A, and subunit d (a V0 subunit). No antibodies specific for the untagged version of Stv1p are currently available. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the presence of the HA tag had virtually no effect on the amount of Vph1p, subunit A, or subunit d present in the vacuolar membrane, indicating that introduction of the tag did not disrupt assembly of complexes containing Vph1p. Similarly, for Stv1p-containing complexes, the amounts of subunit A and subunit d present in the vacuoles was unchanged by the introduction of the epitope tag. Thus, the presence of the HA tag does not alter the assembly of V-ATPase complexes. Interestingly, the ratio of subunit A to subunit d staining in the vacuoles is almost the same for Vph1p and Stv1p (Fig. 3) despite the much lower ratio of subunit A to 100-kDa subunit for Stv1p than for Vph1p (Fig. 2). This result suggests that the lower assembly of V1 and V0 observed for Stv1p-containing complexes may be the result of reduced association of Stv1p with subunit d, at least in the environment of the vacuolar membrane. To compare the kinetic properties of V-ATPase complexes containing Vph1p and Stv1p, vacuoles were isolated from thevph1Δstv1Δ strain expressing either Vph1p using pRS316 or Stv1p using the high copy plasmid. In this case, the untagged versions of Vph1p and Stv1p were expressed. As indicated in Table I, the Km for ATP was ∼250 μm for complexes containing both Vph1p and Stv1p. Although the Vmax for ATP hydrolysis for Stv1p-containing complexes was lower than for Vph1p-containing complexes, the 8.6-fold reduction in activity could be entirely accounted for by the lower degree of assembly of V-ATPases containing Stv1p (Fig. 2). Measurement of proton transport using ACMA fluorescence quenching (Table I) indicated an even lower level of proton transport for Stv1p-containing vacuoles relative to Vph1p-containing vacuoles (the ratio of Vph1p:Stv1p was 55:1). This result indicates that the ratio of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis is ∼4–5-fold lower for Stv1p-containing complexes compared with Vph1p-containing complexes.Table IKinetic analysis of V-ATPases containing Vph1p and Stv1p100-kDa a-subunit isoformATPase activityaATPase activities were measured on isolated vacuolar membranes containing Vph1p (3 μg of membrane protein) or Stv1p (10 μg of membrane protein) (both untagged) over a range of ATP concentrations from 100 μmto 2 mm ATP, whereas MgSO4 was maintained at 4 mm as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activities were measured in the absence or presence of 1 μm concanamycin A, and the results shown represent the concanamycin-sensitive portion of the activity.

Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), the most studied of the three vertebrate homologs ofDrosophila Hedgehog, is a secreted protein that acts on target cells to increase transcription of several genes, including members of the Wnt and transforming growth factor-β families, and its receptor Patched. Patched (Ptc) is predicted to encode a large transmembrane protein that acts as a negative regulator of the pathway. It associates with a second transmembrane protein, Smoothened (Smo), which is a positive regulator of the pathway. Prior genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the two proteins form an unusual complex at the membrane that is inactive in the absence of the Shh ligand. Once the Shh protein binds to Ptc, this relieves the inhibition of Smo (by unknown mechanisms) and allows transduction of the Hedgehog signal. Little is known about the structure or function of the Hedgehog receptor complex or the possible role of accessory proteins or lipids. The Ptc protein is predicted to have at least 12 transmembrane domains, and although it has little homology to other known receptors, it has been shown to directly bind Shh. The transmembrane domains of Ptc have a high degree of homology to the sterol-sensing domains of several proteins involved in cholesterol processing and trafficking, including NPC-1 (Niemann-Pick Cprotein-1) (1Carstea E.D.

Smo encodes a serpentine, seven-transmembrane protein with characteristics of a G-protein-coupled receptor, including a glycosylated extracellular N terminus. Smo, however, does not directly bind Shh. The interaction with Ptc seems to be mediated through the N-terminal domain and/or the first two transmembrane domains of Smo, 1H. E. Karpen, J. T. Bukowski, and M. R. Gailani, unpublished data.1H. E. Karpen, J. T. Bukowski, and M. R.

Biol. 1999; 9: 76-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism through which Smo transduces the Shh signal remains unclear, but it most probably involves a conformational change in the receptor complex, as the Ptc·Smo·Shh complex can be co-immunoprecipitated (4Stone D.M.

The Shh protein undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage with covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal component of the protein. This modified N-terminal product is responsible for most of the apparent biological activity of the Shh protein. The cholesterol modification is not absolutely required for binding to Ptc or for limited biological activity, as several model systems have shown a response utilizing a bacterially derived Shh-N fusion protein (5Porter J.A.

Caveolae are non-clathrin-coated invaginations of the plasma membrane that are important in endocytosis, cholesterol trafficking, and sequestering various lipid-modified signaling molecules in discrete microdomains. The caveolins, a family of three protein isoforms, are the major coat proteins of caveolae. Caveolin-1 directly binds to and transports cholesterol from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, and this association is required for caveolar formation (7Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol.

Since very little is known about the cellular localization of members of the Shh signaling pathway, we hypothesized that components of the pathway were in caveolae or lipid raft domains of cells. Recent data have shown that Hh is trafficked to lipid rafts inDrosophila, most probably through its association with cholesterol (16Rietveld A. Neutz S. Simons K. Eaton S. J. Biol.

Given these recent data and our preliminary observations of the Ptc trafficking pattern, we hypothesized that the Shh receptor complex is also targeted to these cholesterol-rich microdomains on the plasma membrane through an association between the Shh receptor Ptc and perhaps caveolin-1. In this report, we show that Ptc and caveolin associate with each other in the caveolar/lipid raft fraction of the plasma membrane, and we show data strongly implicating cholesterol as a key player in the transport and, most likely, the function of the Hedgehog receptor."

For the majority of proteins subjected to ectodomain shedding, the proteases responsible have not been identified. Furthermore, in most cases it is not clear whether one or several proteases can target the same protein or whether the same protease mediates shedding in response to distinct stimuli. In this study, we used the TNF family member TRANCE (TNF-relatedactivation-inducedcytokine; also known as osteoprotegrin ligand, OPGL, RANK ligand, RANKL, and osteoclast differentiation factor) as a model to ask whether one or more sheddases are involved in its release from the membrane and to define the properties of this sheddase or these sheddases.

CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and glutamine. COS-7 cells were grown in DME with identical supplements. CHO and COS-7 cells were transfected in six-well tissue culture plates with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were allowed to recover for at least 4 h prior to metabolic labeling. For metabolic labeling, cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in DME lacking cysteine and methionine supplemented with 10% dialyzed calf serum and 200 μCi/ml of [35S] Pro-mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were labeled overnight for 10–14 h. After labeling, the cells were washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and chased for one hour in OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the indicated additives. The conditioned medium was collected. The cells were washed a further two times with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (TBS, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline and protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soy-bean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm iodoacetamide)). In experiments examining the MAP kinase inhibitors U0126 and SB202190, the cells were preincubated in OptiMEM with the indicated concentration of inhibitor for 2 h. The cells were then washed twice in PBS and chased in OptiMEM with additives for 1 h. The medium and lysate were then processed as above. All lysates and supernatants were spun on a tabletop centrifuge (Sorvall) for 15 min at 13,000 rpm to remove nuclei and cellular debris. For immunoprecipitations, the TRANCE receptor Fc fusion protein (TR-Fc) or a rabbit TNFα antiserum, together with protein A-Sepharose, was added to the medium. FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose were used to immunoprecipitate full-length TRANCE and TNFα from the lysates.

Embryonic fibroblasts were either electroporated using a Bio-Rad GenePulser II with a capacitance extender and 0.4-cm cuvettes at 270 V, 960 microfarads, or transfected using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Cells were allowed to recover and metabolically labeled overnight in DME without cysteine and methionine, 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and 100 μCi/ml of [35S] Pro-mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After two washes in PBS, pH 7.4, cells were chased in OptiMEM with the indicated additions. Conditioned medium was collected after 1 h, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer and spun at 13,000 × g for 20 min followed by a further 100,000 × g spin for 45 min. TRANCE was immunoprecipitated from the medium and lysate as above. In experiments utilizing the TACE-deficient fibroblasts, lysates were split into two aliquots; one was used to isolate FLAG-tagged TRANCE, and the other was used to immunoprecipitate TACE utilizing an anti-TACE cytoplasmic domain polyclonal antiserum and protein A-Sepharose. In all cases, immunoprecipitations were incubated at 4 °C for at least 6 h followed by washing as above. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. 15-cm-diameter plates of CHO cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE and the TRANCE-FLAG plasmid or control vector. COS-7 cells were electroporated with the TRANCE-FLAG or control plasmid using an 0.4-cm cuvette in a Bio-Rad GenePulser II with a capacitance extender and 0.4-cm cuvettes at 200 V, 500 microfarads, and plated onto 15-cm diameter plates. Both cell types were cultured in OptiMEM for 2 days. The conditioned medium was collected, supplemented with protease inhibitors, and spun at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with 1.5 μg of TR-Fc and protein A-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times for 10 min in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Bound protein was recovered by boiling the beads in sample loading buffer with dithiothreitol for 5 min, loaded onto a NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris gel (Novex), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and rinsed in double-distilled water. The ∼27-kDa bands representing soluble TRANCE ectodomain were excised, and the N-terminal amino acid residues were analyzed by automated Edman degradation, using an Applied Biosystems 477A sequenator, with instrument and procedure optimized for femtomole level analysis as described (43Tempst P. Geromanos S. Elicone C. Erdjument-Bromage H. METHODS: Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 248-261Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). TNFα and TRANCE both undergo metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding. To compare the properties of the TRANCE and TNFα shedding activities, the release of soluble TRANCE and TNFα ectodomains was examined in CHO cells. Cells were transiently transfected with N-terminally FLAG-tagged TNFα or TRANCE and metabolically labeled. The cells were chased for 1 h with or without the addition of several potential modulators of shedding. Labeled TNFα and TRANCE in the conditioned medium and lysate was then isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In agreement with previously published observations (39Lum L. Wong B.R.

Med. 1995; 181: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), both TRANCE and TNFα ectodomains are released into the medium by a mechanism sensitive to the hydroxamate-based metalloprotease inhibitor BB-94 (Fig. 1, A andB). The release of TRANCE is not further enhanced by treating CHO cells with PMA, a phorbol ester, but is significantly enhanced in the presence of pervanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 1 A, top panel). Pervanadate-stimulated shedding is inhibited by the presence of BB-94. In contrast, TNFα ectodomain release is increased in CHO cells treated with PMA, as previously described (Fig. 1 B,top panel). In addition, we found that pervanadate is also effective at stimulating TNFα processing. In all cases, TNFα release is sensitive to inhibition by BB-94. The inability of PMA to affect the rate of ectodomain shedding of TRANCE is at odds with our previous findings in COS-7 cells (39Lum L. Wong B.R. Josien R. Becherer J.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Schlondorff J. Tempst P. Choi Y. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13613-13618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the shedding of TNFα and TRANCE in COS-7 cells under conditions identical to those used above (Fig. 1, Aand B, lower panels). The release of TNFα in COS-7 cells resembles that seen in CHO cells, with both PMA and pervanadate increasing ectodomain shedding (Fig. 1 B, compareupper and lower panels). As in CHO cells, constitutive and stimulated shedding is inhibited by BB-94. TRANCE processing in COS-7 is also a BB-94-sensitive process but, in contrast to our previous study, is minimally affected by PMA (Fig.1 A, lower panel). We cannot at present explain this discrepancy, which may be due to previous experimental error or may reflect a difference in the COS-7 cells used in this study compared with the previous one. Pervanadate treatment leads to only a marginal increase in TRANCE ectodomain shedding in COS-7 cells, in sharp contrast to its effect on CHO cells. The difference in pervanadate-mediated TRANCE shedding in CHO and COS-7 cells was confirmed by quantifying the TRANCE released from cells treated with either PMA, pervanadate, or carrier as control (Fig. 1 C). Although pervanadate-treated COS-7 cells release more TRANCE than control treated COS-7 cells (172% of control), it was considerably lower than the amount released by CHO cells in response to pervanadate (484% of control). In contrast, PMA and pervanadate induced a similar increase in the release of TNFα in both COS-7 and CHO cells (Fig.1 D). To control for the specificity of pervanadate stimulation, the effect of equal concentrations of sodium vanadate, hydrogen peroxide, and pervanadate on both TNFα and TRANCE shedding was evaluated (Fig.1 E). Neither sodium vanadate nor hydrogen peroxide is able to enhance shedding above that seen in unstimulated cells, whereas pervanadate enhances the shedding of both proteins. Thus, although both TNFα and TRANCE ectodomain shedding is sensitive to BB-94, TNFα processing is stimulated by both PMA and pervanadate, whereas TRANCE shedding is only enhanced in the presence of pervanadate. To further investigate the difference between TRANCE shedding in CHO and COS-7 cells, we compared the soluble TRANCE ectodomain released from these cells as well as the membrane stubs generated by shedding. Interestingly, CHO cells produce at least two forms of TRANCE ectodomain, whereas only the slower migrating form is seen in the medium from COS-7 cells (Fig.2 A).

https://openalex.org/W2069666803,"Activin, a member of the TGFβ family inhibits cell growth in various target tissues. Activin interacts with a complex of two receptors that upon activation phosphorylate specific intracellular mediators, the Smad proteins. The activated Smads interact with diverse DNA binding proteins and co-activators of transcription in a cell-specific manner, thus leading to various activin biological effects. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of action of activin in the human breast cancer T47D cells. We found that activin treatment of T47D cells leads to a dramatic decrease in cell growth. Thus activin appears as a potent cell growth inhibitor of these breast cancer cells. We show that activin induces the Smad pathway in these cells but also activates the p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, further leading to phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2. Finally, specific inhibitors of the p38 kinase (SB202190, SB203580, and PD169316) but not an inactive analogue (SB202474) or the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 completely abolish the activin-mediated cell growth inhibition of T47D cells.

Together, these results define a new role for activin in human breast cancer T47D cells and highlight a new pathway utilized by this growth factor in the mediation of its biological effects in cell growth arrest. transforming growth factor β mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase MAPK kinase kinase TGF-activated kinase 1 extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK/ERK kinase Müllerian inhibiting substance Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide L32 riboprotein phosphorylated form of p38 kinase epidermal growth factor base pair(s) activin receptor-like kinase forkhead activin signal transducer-1 signal transducers and activators of transcription Activin, a member of the TGFβ1 family, regulates cell growth of various cell types. Activin interacts with a complex of two receptors (types I and II), both containing an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a large intracellular domain that contain a serine/threonine kinase domain. The type II receptor, which is constitutively phosphorylated (1Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19013-19018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) transphosphorylates the type I receptor (ALK4) upon ligand stimulation, on serine and threonine residues (2Wrana J.L.

Both Smad3 and Smad4 but not Smad2 can directly bind DNA elements (Smad binding element) and activate the transcription of the target genes (12Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). However, the DNA binding affinity of the Smads is low (13Shi Y. Wang Y.F.

Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), and they usually require the presence of other DNA binding proteins to efficiently interact with the promoters of their responsive target genes. As a result, the Smad binding elements are often found close to the DNA binding element of other transcription factors. Among those are the FAST family members, FAST1 (14Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and FAST2 (15Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol.

The Smad proteins are central elements in the activin receptor signaling pathway but are not the sole pathway activated by this receptor complex. Other members of the TGFβ superfamily have been shown to activate different signaling pathways, in addition to the Smads. TGFβ itself can activate a member of the MAPKKK family of kinases, TAK1 (TGF-activated kinase) (22Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). TAK1 then activates the stress-activated kinase p38 and the transcription factor ATF2, a member of the b-ZIP family of DNA binding proteins (21Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies also suggested that the transcription factor ATF2 could interact with the MH1 domains of two activin responsive Smads, Smad3 and Smad4 (21Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S.

Fujisawa J. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27161-27167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Both TGFβ and the Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) were also shown to mediate some of their biological effects through an NFκB-mediated pathway (24Sovak M.A. Arsura M. Zanieski G. Kavanagh K.T. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar, 25Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M. Harkin P. Jung M. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28371-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that activin also utilizes other signaling pathways to transduce its signals. Activin, its receptors, and the Smads are expressed in myoepithelial cells as well as in a certain number of human breast cancer cell lines (26Liu Q.Y. Niranjan B. Gomes P. Gomm J.J. Davies D. Coombes R.C. Buluwela L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1155-1163PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ying S.Y. Zhang Z. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 37: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this growth factor and its downstream effectors, the Smads, in mammary cell growth and differentiation. Several reports have recently implicated TGFβ family members or their downstream signaling pathways in the regulation of breast cancer cell growth. Indeed, Smad4 can restore cell growth arrest in MDA-MB-468 cells, a breast cancer cell line in which the Smad4 gene is deleted (28de Winter J.P. Roelen B.A. ten Dijke P. van der Burg B. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Genetic mutations or loss of expression of the activin and TGFβ receptors is also found in human breast cancers (29Di Loreto C. Reis F.M. Cataldi P. Zuiani C. Luisi S. Beltrami C.A. Petraglia F. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 141: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Chen T. Carter D. Garrigue-Antar L. Reiss M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4805-4810PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, TGFβ and MIS mediates cell growth arrest in breast cancer by reducing NFκB DNA binding activity (24Sovak M.A. Arsura M. Zanieski G. Kavanagh K.T. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar, 25Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M. Harkin P. Jung M. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28371-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and activin itself can modulate cell growth of the breast cancer cells MCF7 (26Liu Q.Y. Niranjan B. Gomes P. Gomm J.J. Davies D. Coombes R.C. Buluwela L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1155-1163PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role and mechanism of action of activin in breast cancer cells. We show here for the first time that activin strongly inhibits cell growth of the human breast cancer cell line T47D. In addition, our results indicate that activin induces the Smad pathway in these cells but also activates the p38 MAPK pathway. Activation of this pathway further leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2. Furthermore, we show that specific inhibitors of the p38 MAPK pathway antagonize the activin-mediated cell growth arrest in T47D cells. Thus, this highlights for the first time the involvement of this p38 kinase pathway downstream of the activin receptor signal transduction pathways leading to cell growth arrest. T47D cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum. For proliferation assay, cells were plated in triplicates in 96-well dishes, at 5000 cells/100 μl in 2% FCS. Cells were stimulated or not with activin (0.5 nm) and grown over a 5-day period. Cell proliferation was assessed using direct cell counting, and the non-radioactive MTT cell proliferation assay for eukaryotic cells (Cell Titer 96, Promega G 4000). Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a reference wavelength at 450 nm, using a Bio-tek Microplate reader. T47D cells (107cells) were transfected by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II) in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (240 V and 975 microfarads) with 10 μg of each of the indicated cDNAs. Following transfection, cells were plated in 6-well dishes in DMEM (10% FCS) for 24-h recovery. The following day, cells were starved overnight in DMEM without serum and stimulated or not with activin (0.5 nm) for 16 h. Then, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 250 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm glycylglycine) on ice. The luciferase activity of each sample was measured using 45 μl of cell lysate (EG&G Berthold luminometer) and normalized to the relative β-galactosidase activity. RNase protection assay was performed using the hcc-2 template set and RiboQuant kit from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with minor modifications. Radiolabeled antisense RNA probes were prepared byin vitro transcription of the hcc-2 templates with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). After DNase I digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation, the probes were quantified. RNA samples (5 μg) were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 20 μl of hybridization buffer containing 8 × 105cpm of radiolabeled probes. Hybridization (overnight at 56 °C), RNase A/T1 digestion (1 h at 30 °C), proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and gel resolution (5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel) were carried out according to the instructions contained in the RiboQuant RNase protection assay kit. A yeast tRNA-only reaction was included as a negative control to ensure complete RNase digestion. Undigested RNA probes were also resolved on each gel to ensure their integrity and to serve as size markers. The cell cycle genes represented in the assays and the size of corresponding protected probe/mRNA duplexes were as follows: p130, 400 bp; Rb, 352 bp; p107, 317 bp; p53, 283 bp; p57, 252 bp; p27, 227 bp; p21, 202 bp; p19, 182 bp; p16, 163 bp; p14/p15, 133 bp; L32 riboprotein (L32, used as a housekeeping control), 113 bp; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 96 bp. An exposure was made of the dried gel onto x-ray film. The positions of the protected probes were confirmed by plotting on a semi-log graph. T47D cells were plated at 106 cells/ml in 6-well dishes in DMEM (10% FCS). The following day, cells were starved for an overnight period and stimulated or not with activin for different periods of time as indicated. Total cell extracts prepared from these cells were then separated on a polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and incubated with the indicated specific antibody overnight at 4 °C (p38 (New England BioLabs, catalogue no. 9212), phosphop38 (New England BioLabs, catalogue no. 9210), ATF2 (New England BioLabs, catalogue no. 9222), phosphoATF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, catalogue no. 8398), Smad2/3 (Santa Cruz, catalogue no. 8332), phosphoSmad2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., catalogue no. 6829), Smad4 (Santa Cruz, catalogue no. 7966), ERK1/2 (New England BioLabs, catalogue no. 9102), and phosphoERK1/2 (New England BioLabs, catalogue no. 9101)). Following incubation, the membranes were washed twice for 10 min in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 200 mmNaCl; 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with a secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase (from Santa Cruz; at a 1/10,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the membranes were washed four times for 15 min in the washing buffer, and immunoreactivity was normalized by chemiluminescence (Lumi-Light Plus Western blotting substrate, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions and revealed using an Alpha Innotech Fluorochem imaging system (Packard Canberra). Although activin and its receptors are expressed in a number of breast cancer cell lines, the role of activin in the regulation of breast cancer cell growth has not yet been fully investigated. To analyze the role of activin in regulating growth of human breast cancer cells, we utilized the human breast cancer cell line T47D, which endogenously expresses activin-responsive Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 (31Pouliot F. Labrie C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using a cell growth and viability assay (MTT assay), we show that activin treatment of T47D cells leads to a significant inhibition in their growth, apparent as early as day 2 and reaching 40% inhibition at day 3 (Fig.1 A). To verify that activin affects cell growth and not the metabolic rate of the cell, direct cell counting was also performed. As shown in Fig. 1 B, activin stimulation of T47D cells for 3 days also results in clear cell growth inhibition. Therefore, activin appears as a potent cell growth inhibitor for T47D breast cancer cells. TGFβ family members regulate cell growth through different mechanisms. They often mediate cell cycle arrest through up-regulation of the three cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15INK4B, p21CIP1WAF1, and p27 (32Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 33Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 34Zauberman A. Oren M. Zipori D. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1705-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because activin exerts a strong effect on cell growth in T47D (Fig. 1), we analyzed its effects in modulating gene expression levels of different cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors as well as of other cell cycle regulatory genes. For this, we examined the level of mRNA species of different cell cycle regulators, using a highly sensitive and specific ribonuclease protection assay. As shown in Fig.2, T47D cells were stimulated for different periods of time with activin (0.5 nm). Total RNA from unstimulated or stimulated cells were extracted and hybridized with multiple antisense probes for human cell cycle regulators (p15, p16, p18, p19, p21, p27, as well as for p53, p57, p107 p130, the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), and the two housekeeping genes L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). As shown in Fig. 2, a modest but reproducible ligand-dependent increase in the mRNA level of p21CIP1/WAF1 was observed. This is consistent with a microarray analysis of T47D cells treated for 8 h with activin, which shows a 1.7-fold increase in p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA level. 2J.-J. Lebrun, unpublished data. mRNA levels for p15INK4B were also consistently increased upon activin treatment, although at a lower level than p21CIP1/WAF1. This experiment was repeated three times and showed consistent results. None of the other cell cycle regulators (p130, Rb, p107, p53, p57, p27, p19, p18, or p16) or housekeeping genes (L32 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) mRNA levels showed any significant or reproducible difference in response to activin (Fig. 2). Our attempts to detect p15INK4B and p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels in these cells were unsuccessful, probably due to the low level of expression of theses two proteins. This suggests that at least part of the activin effect on cell growth arrest in T47D cells is mediated through up-regulation of p15INK4B and p21CIP1/WAF1. To then analyze the role of the Smad pathway in T47D cells, we first examined the activation state of Smad2, following activin stimulation. Cells were starved for an overnight period and treated with 0.5 nm activin for a different period of time, as indicated in Fig. 3. Total cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting analysis. The membrane was probed with a specific antibody to phospho-Smad2 that recognizes the two phosphorylated serine residues in the C-terminal end of the MH2 domain of Smad2 (SSXS). As shown in Fig.3, upper panel, activin treatment of T47D cells leads to a clear phosphorylation of Smad2, as early as 15 min following ligand stimulation of the cells. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both Smad2 and Smad3 (Fig. 3,middle panel) and subsequently with a monoclonal antibody to Smad4 (Fig. 3, lower panel) and shows equal levels of all Smads in all samples. These data indicate that the Smad pathway is functional in T47D cells and is activated in response to activin stimulation. To further examine the activation of the activin receptor/Smad pathway in T47D cells, we analyzed the ability of activin to induce two activin receptor/Smad-responsive promoter constructs (3TPLux and ARE-Lux). T47D cells were transiently co-transfected as shown under “Materials and Methods” with the promoter construct 3TPLux or ARE-Lux and an expression vector encoding the co-activator Fast1. As shown in Fig.4 A, activin treatment of T47D cells led to a 2.6- and 2.7-fold induction of 3TPLux and ARE-Lux, respectively. Furthermore, T47D cells were also co-transfected with 3TPLux or ARE-Lux/Fast1 and an expression vector encoding a constitutively active form of the activin type I receptor (ALK4 TΔD). This point mutation replaces threonine 206 by an aspartic acid and renders the receptor constitutively active even in the absence of ligand or type II receptor (4Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Montalvo E. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, ALK4 TΔD mimics activin effects on the activation of the two promoter constructs, leading to a 3.2- and 2.7-fold induction of 3TPlux and ARE-Lux/Fast1, respectively. Finally, to confirm the involvement of the Smad pathway, a dominant negative form of Smad3, which lacks the MH2 domain (Smad3ΔC), was transfected in T47D cells together with 3TPLux. Deletion of the C-terminal domain of Smad3 results in the loss of homo- and heterodimerization with the wild type Smad4 as well as in its ability to induce a reporter construct (35Wu R.Y. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated or not with activin and, as seen in Fig. 4 C, overexpression of Smad3ΔC completely blocks activin-induced 3TPLux activity. Together, these results confirm that the activin receptor/Smad pathway is functional in breast cancer cells. Recently, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was shown to regulate gene expression in response to TGFβ (23Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M. Fujisawa J. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27161-27167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). To assess the role of this pathway in activin-mediated cell growth inhibition of breast cancer cells, T47D cells were starved overnight and stimulated with 0.5 nm activin for different periods of time as indicated in Fig.5 A. Total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot using specific antibodies directed against the phosphorylated form of the p38 kinase (pp38) and the normal form of p38 (p38). As shown in Fig. 5 A,upper panel, activin treatment of the T47D cells results in a clear increase in p38 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Activin effect is maximal at 20–40 min and then decreases to return to basal level. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with an antibody directed against p38 and shows an equal amount of the p38 kinase in all lanes (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). We then analyzed the activin effects on the phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2, a downstream target of the p38 kinase. Total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot using specific antibodies directed against the phosphorylated ATF2 (pATF2) or ATF2 (ATF2). As shown in Fig. 5 B (upper panel), there is a time-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2 following activin treatment of the cells. The phosphorylation of ATF2 correlates with the activation of the p38 MAPK and shows a maximum phosphorylation at 40 min. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti-ATF2 antibody and shows an equal amount of the transcription factor in all lanes (Fig. 5 B,lower panel). Together, these data demonstrate that the p38 MAPK/ATF2 pathway is activated in T47D cells in response to activin. To further confirm the involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway downstream of the activin receptor, T47D cells were treated with a specific p38 kinase inhibitor (PD169316) or Me2SO as a control. Cells were then stimulated or not with activin for 30 min, and total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using different antibodies directed against phosphop38 or p38, phospho-ATF2 or ATF2. As shown in Fig.6 A (upper panel), in the presence of Me2SO, activin induces phosphorylation of the kinase p38, confirming the previously seen results (Fig. 5). However, in the presence of the specific p38 kinase inhibitor PD169316, this activin effect on p38 phosphorylation is abolished (Fig.6 A, upper panel). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with an antibody directed against p38 and shows an equal amount of proteins in all lanes (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 6 B, upper panel, activin induces phosphorylation of the transcription factor ATF2 in the presence of Me2SO, but this activin-induced effect is abolished in the presence of the p38 kinase inhibitor PD169316. An equal amount of protein in all lanes was ensured by stripping and reprobing of the membrane with an anti-ATF2 antibody (Fig. 6 B, lower panel). To evaluate the contribution of the p38 kinase pathway in activin-mediated cell growth inhibition in T47D cells, we used different p38 kinase-specific inhibitors (SB202190, SB203580, PD169316) or an inactive analogue (SB202474) and an MEK1/ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059) as controls, in both MTT (Fig.7 A) and direct cell counting assays (Fig. 7 B). T47D cells were cultured in DMEM, 2% serum for 3 days and stimulated or not with 0.5 nm activin in the presence or absence of the different inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, after 3 days cell growth is reduced by 40% in activin-treated cells as compared with untreated cells, similar to that previously observed in Fig. 1, A andB. However, in the presence of each the three specific p38 kinase inhibitors (SB202190, SB203580, PD169316), the inhibitory effect of activin on cell growth is abolished. On the other hand, the activin effect on cell growth inhibition is maintained in samples treated with the inactive form of the p38 kinase inhibitor SB202474 or with the MEK1/ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. Our results indicate that p38 kinase-specific inhibitors nearly completely reverse the activin effect. Because p38 kinase inhibitors could affect TGFβ receptor activity (36Eyers P.A. Craxton M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Goedert M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 321-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we examined their effect on activin-induced Smad2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 7 C, although activin-induced p38 phosphorylation is inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with all three active forms of p38 kinase inhibitors, we observed no significant inhibitory effect on Smad2 phosphorylation under the same conditions. Thus it is likely that the antagonistic effect exerted by the p38 inhibitors on activin-induced cell growth arrest is mediated through inhibition of the p38 kinase pathway downstream of the activin receptor. As activin is potent cell growth inhibitor in many different cell lines, the effect of the p38 kinase inhibitors were also analyzed in several activin-responsive cell lines such as K562, Chinese hamster ovary, and MCF7. Interestingly, the activin inhibitors could reverse the activin effects on cell growth arrest in all cell lines tested (data not shown). This indicates that the contribution of the p38 MAPK pathway to activin-mediated cell growth arrest is critical. The absence of effect of the MEK1/ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 on activin-mediated cell growth arrest (Fig. 7) suggests that activin does not modulate the MAPK MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway to arrest cell growth. The MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway is known to be involved in cell proliferation in response to various growth factors. To confirm that activin does not modulate or inhibit activation of this pathway in response to growth factors, T47D cells were starved overnight and stimulated with EGF (20 ng/ml) for different periods of time in the absence or presence of 1 nm activin (Fig.8). Total cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody directed against phospho-ERK1/2 (α-PERK). As shown in Fig. 8 (upper panel), EGF very rapidly and transiently induces the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p42/p44). However, activin co-stimulation of the cells does not affect EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with an anti-ERK antibody and shows an equal amount of MAPK in all samples. Together this indicates that the activin effect on cell growth arrest in T47D cells is not mediated through the MEK1/ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. Members of the TGFβ family of growth factors are important factors in regulating cell growth inhibition; hence, it is critical to characterize their intracellular signaling mechanisms. Although it is known that activin signals through activation of Smad proteins, the activation of other intracellular signaling pathways and their contribution to activin-mediated cell growth inhibition remain to be characterized. In this paper we have examined the role of activin in mediating cell growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. Our results indicate that activin induces the Smad pathway in T47D cells and emphasize the involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway in activin-induced cell growth inhibition of these breast cancer cells. Abnormalities in the signaling pathways of activin/TGFβ have been clearly linked to various cancers, including breast cancer (37Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). We analyzed activin effects on the regulation of cell growth of human breast cancer cells. Using the human breast cancer cell line T47D, we found that activin has a profound and significant effect on the growth of these cells. We further investigated how activin triggers its effects in this cell line. Activin treatment of T47D cells leads to rapid phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smad2. Furthermore, both activin or the constitutively active form of the activin type I receptor (ALK4TΔD) induce the two promoter constructs 3TPLux and ARE-Lux, and this effect is completely abolished in the presence of an overexpressed dominant negative form of Smad3 (Smad3ΔC). All together, these results suggest that the activin receptor/Smad pathway is activated and can regulate the activin response in breast cancer cells, confirming the central role played by the Smad proteins in the mediation of the activin response. The p38 MAPK is involved in regulating cellular responses to stress and cytokines (38Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R.

TGFβ can induce phosphorylation of both p38 and the transcription factor ATF2 in these cell lines. In addition, p38 and ATF2 can contribute to the activation of the synthetic reporter construct 3TPLux in these cells, but the physiological significance of this pathway in the mediation of the TGFβ effects remains unclear. We show here that activin induces the p38 kinase pathway in T47D cells leading to phosphorylation of both the p38 kinase and the transcription factor ATF2. Furthermore, we show that the p38/ATF2 pathway is required to transduce the activin effects on cell growth inhibition. Indeed, different specific p38 kinase inhibitors, but not their inactive analogue or the MEK inhibitor can totally reverse the activin effect on cell growth inhibition. This highlights a new role for the p38 kinase pathway in the control of cell growth and proliferation downstream of the activin/TGFβ superfamily of growth factors. TGFβ family members often require the presence of parallel or synergistic pathways to the Smads to carry out their full biological effects and diversity of the Smad-interacting partners may contribute to signal specificity (50ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In future studies, it will be interesting to examine the level of interaction between the Smad and the p38 kinase pathways in response to activin in T47D cells, because in vitro studies have suggested that the Smads could physically interact with the transcription factor ATF2 (21Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 23Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J.

Signaling by the MAPK family is organized hierarchically in three different steps. MAPK, such as p38, are phosphorylated by MAPK kinases (MAPKKS), such as MKK3 and MKK6, in the case of p38. The MAPKKs are themselves activated and phosphorylated by the MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs), such as MLK, TAK, and ASK1 kinases, which act as MAPKKKs. Finally, the MAPKKKs are regulated by cell surface receptors or other external stimuli (51Herlaar E. Brown Z. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 439-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 52Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to identify the upstream kinases and other partner proteins involved in the activin-mediated p38 activation that are acting between the activin receptor complex and the p38 kinase in the signaling cascade. Recent reports indicated that TAK1, a member of the MAPKKK family, is activated by several cytokines, including TGFβ (22Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) and bone morphogenetic protein (53Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). TAK1 is a potent activator of p38 kinase (54Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E. Kuroyanagi N. Hagiwara M. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26981-26988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It will be interesting, therefore, to determine whether or not TAK1 also lies downstream of the activin receptor complex signaling cascade. It was also recently shown that the Müllerian Inhibitory substance (MIS) represses the growth of breast cancer cells by regulating the NFκB pathway (25Segev D.L. Ha T.U. Tran T.T. Kenneally M. Harkin P. Jung M. MacLaughlin D.T. Donahoe P.K. Maheswaran S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28371-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The TGFβ effect on cell growth inhibition of breast cancer has also been shown to be associated with a reduced NFκB activity (24Sovak M.A. Arsura M. Zanieski G. Kavanagh K.T. Sonenshein G.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that different members of the TGFβ superfamily may regulate cell growth by utilizing different signaling pathways in the same target tissues. Interestingly, TAK1 was also shown to lead to NFκB activation (55Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role for this factor downstream of the activin receptor. Our results indicate that activin strongly represses the cell growth of T47D breast cancer cells. Further characterization of the downstream target genes that are modulated in T47D cells in response to activin will greatly enhance our understanding of its mechanism of action on cell growth regulation. Our data suggest that at least some of these targets could be the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. However, it will remain to be determined whether other cell cycle regulators as well as apoptosis regulators are also regulated by activin in these cells. Indeed, identification of the target genes, involved in the regulation of cell cycle and/or apoptosis, will be important in shedding light on the activin receptor mechanism of action in breast cancer cells. We are thankful to Wylie Vale and the National Hormone & Pituitary program and Dr. Parlow for providing activin, to Dr. J. Massagué for providing the 3TPLux construct, to Dr. B. Volgestein for the Fast-1 construct, to Dr. Y. Chen for the Smad3ΔC construct, and to Drs. J. Wrana and L. Attisano for ARE-Lux construct."
https://openalex.org/W2092663627,"Hypoxia has been shown to act as a proliferative stimulus for adventitial fibroblasts of the pulmonary artery. The signaling pathways involved in this growth response, however, remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that hypoxia-induced proliferation of fibroblasts would be dependent on distinct (compared with serum) activation and utilization patterns of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases initiated by Galpha(i/o) proteins. We found that hypoxia stimulated increases in DNA synthesis and growth of quiescent fibroblasts in the absence of exogenous mitogens and also markedly augmented serum-stimulated growth responses. Hypoxia caused a transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the time course and pattern of which was somewhat similar to that induced by serum but which was of lesser magnitude. On the other hand, hypoxia-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase was biphasic, whereas serum-stimulated activation of p38 MAP kinase was transient, and the magnitude of activation was greater for hypoxia compared with that of serum stimulation. ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38 MAP kinase but not JNK2 were necessary for hypoxia-induced proliferation because PD98059, SB202190, and JNK1 antisense oligonucleotides nearly ablated the growth response. JNK2 appeared to act as a negative modulator of hypoxia-induced growth because JNK2 antisense oligonucleotides led to an increase in DNA synthesis. In serum-stimulated cells, antisense JNK1 oligonucleotides and PD98059 had inhibitory effects on proliferation, whereas SB202190 led to an increase in DNA synthesis. Pertussis toxin, which blocks Galpha(i/o)-mediated signaling, markedly attenuated hypoxia-induced DNA synthesis and activation of ERK and JNK but not p38 MAP kinase. We conclude that hypoxia itself can act as a growth promoting stimulus for subsets of bovine neonatal adventitial fibroblasts largely through Galpha(i/o)-mediated activation of a complex network of MAP kinases whose specific contributions to hypoxia-induced proliferation differ from traditional serum-induced growth signals."

Expression in cultured cells indicates that both variants affect catalytic properties, without a detectable difference between γa and γb. At least two singular effects are seen, irrespective of whether the variants are expressed in HeLa or rat α1-transfected HeLa cells, i.e. (i) an increase in apparent affinity for ATP, probably secondary to a left shift in E1 ↔E2 conformational equilibrium and (ii) an increase in K+ antagonism of cytoplasmic Na+activation. Antibodies against the C terminus common to both variants (anti-γ) abrogate the first effect but not the second. In contrast, γa and γb show differences in their localization along the kidney tubule.

Expression of γa or γb cDNAs in human embryonic kidney (HEK)1 as well as HeLa cells was analyzed by Western blotting using antiserum raised against a peptide representing the C-terminal 10 residues of the γ subunit. The results showed clearly that the major bands expressed correspond to γa or γb of the renal Na,K-ATPase. Additional minor bands seen after transfection, namely γa′ in HEK and γb′ in HeLa cells imply that these are cell-specific posttranslational modifications (10Kuster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X.

The specific effect of anti-γ on ATP affinity implies a specific structural interaction whereby the γ subunit counteracts short term changes in ATP concentration in kidney cells in which ATP utilization is high. A role of the γ subunit in interactions of the Na,K-ATPase with K+ was suggested on the basis of findings that the γ subunit is a component of the protein complex found in so-called “19-kDa membranes,” the product of tryptic digestion following occlusion of K+ or Rb+ by the enzyme to form E2(K) (17Or E. Goldshleger E.D. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and partial protection by K+ ions against tryptic digestion of the γ subunit in renal microsomes (8Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments on cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes have shown that the γ subunit has an influence on the apparent affinity of the Na,K-ATPase for K+ in a complex Na+- and voltage-dependent fashion (7Béguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), although the interpretation of these results remains unclear. A recent report has attributed modulation of Na+ and K+ affinities to the γa subunit when expressed in kidney cells (9Arystarkova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The γ subunit has also been shown to induce ouabain-independent ion currents in injected Xenopusoocytes and 86Rb+ and22Na+ influx in baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells (18Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Based on the recent structural analysis of Kuster et al.(10Kuster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X.

The study described in this paper addresses two aspects of the role of γ in regulation of Na,K-ATPase. One set of experiments extends the functional studies and examines the question of whether, and to what extent, the two variants have distinct effects on Na,K-ATPase kinetic behavior. The other set of experiments concerns the localization of the two γ variants along the nephron. Rat kidney outer medulla microsomes (3–4 units/mg of protein) or partially purified Na,K-ATPase (10–15 units/mg of protein) were prepared as in Ref. 19Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. Two preparations of anti-γ (C-terminal) were raised in rabbits. One is against both bands of the pig kidney γ subunit excised from a gel. The antibody was purified on an affinity column of the peptide KHRQVNEDEL corresponding to the last 10 residues of the γ subunit; thus, it is referred to as anti-γ (C-terminal). The other is γC33, described in Ref. 8Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar. It was raised against a synthetic peptide consisting of the last 10 residues and used for enzyme assays without further purification. Anti-γa and anti-γb antibodies were raised against N-terminal peptides TELSANHC and MDRWYLC, respectively, after coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-γa was purified on an affinity column of TELSANHC. Attempts to affinity-purify anti-γbwere unsuccessful. For affinity purification, peptides were coupled to Poros activated affinity chromatography columns (epoxide or amino), and the antibodies were purified on a BioCad Perfusion Chromatography apparatus. The antibody was eluted off the column in a solution of 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 2, neutralized immediately with Tris base, and diluted 1:1 with glycerol, and 0.02% sodium azide was added for preservation. Immunocytochemical experiments were performed with affinity-purified anti-γ (C-terminal) diluted 1:200 and anti-γaantibodies (1:100) and anti-γb antiserum (1:200). In addition, the following polyclonal antibodies (as described in Ref. 20Shi H.K. Levy-Holzman R. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Garty H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: 505-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been used for co-localization: (i) anti-aquaporin 2 (AQP2) antiserum, (1:100); (ii) anti-Tamm-Horsfall protein antibody (sheep anti-oromucoid from Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME; 1:50); (iii) antibody against the alpha subunit of Na,K-ATPase (1:50). Rat kidneys were frozen in liquid N2. Immunolocalization was performed as previously described (20Shi H.K. Levy-Holzman R. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Garty H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: 505-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating cryostat sections with the different anti-γ subunit antibodies (γ-C-terminal, γa and γb) and with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit Fab fraction, Jackson; 1:200) coupled to the fluorochrome CY3 (red fluorescence). For colocalization experiments (20Shi H.K. Levy-Holzman R. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Garty H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: 505-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the CY3-labeled sections were incubated with antibodies against different protein markers (see above) and then overlaid with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled (green fluorescence) goat anti-rabbit IgG Fab fraction or donkey anti-sheep antibody. The specificity of the anti-γ antibodies in immunofluorescence studies was established in competition experiments by including their respective peptides in the treatment of the kidney sections (data not shown). The cloning and transfection of rat γa and γb cDNAs were carried out exactly as described for wild-type HeLa cells (10Kuster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R. Mann M. Karlish S.J.D.

Jewell and J. B Lingrel; see Ref. 21Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were cultured for 3 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and selected by including 400 μg/ml hygromycin B and 1 μmouabain (10Kuster B.

Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (8Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) except using antibodies against the C terminus (γC33) and against the N termini of γa and γb. Quantitative PhosphorImaging was carried out using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Membranes were prepared from HeLa cells as in Ref. 21Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Unless indicated otherwise, Na,K-ATPase and Na-ATPase assays were carried out as described previously (11Therien A.G. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Na-ATPase activity refers to activity measured at low (1 or 10 μm) ATP concentration, in the absence of K+. For experiments with HeLa cells expressing the ouabain-resistant rat α1 catalytic subunit (α1-HeLa), the cells are grown in 1 μm ouabain and assayed in medium containing a low (5 μm) ouabain concentration. Activities shown are the differences in ATP hydrolysis measured in the presence of low (5 μm) and high (5 mm) ouabain concentrations. For studies with wild-type HeLa cells, activities shown are differences measured in the absence and presence of 5 mm ouabain. For studies of sensitivity to vanadate, at each concentration of vanadate, Na-ATPase assays were carried out in sets of triplicates, without and with vanadate, with low and high ouabain added to one set of each (cf. Ref. 22Blostein R. Wilczynska A. Karlish S.J.D. Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24987-24993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For practical purposes, either γa- or γb-transfected α1-HeLa were compared, on the same day, with control α1-HeLa membranes. Data for the vanadate sensitivity of Na-ATPase activity, expressed as a percentage of that obtained in the absence of vanadate, were analyzed by fitting the data to a one-site model using a nonlinear least squares fit (Kaleidagraph computer program) to a general logistic function as referred to previously (23Munzer J.S. Daly E.D. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data for Na+ and K+ activation of Na,K-ATPase activity were expressed as percentages of Vmaxusing the Kaleidagraph computer program (Synergy Software) with the noninteractive model of cation binding described by Garay and Garrahan (24Garay R.B. Garrahan P.J. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1973; 231: 297-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar),v=V/(1+Kcat′/[cat])nEquation 1 where v represents the rate of the reaction,V represents the maximal rate, K′catrepresents either K′Na orK′K (the apparent affinity for Na+or K+, respectively), [cat] represents the concentration of cation (either Na+ or K+), and nrepresents the number of binding sites (either three in the case of the Na+ activation experiments or two in the case of K+). Values of Vmax and K′cat were obtained from this fitting procedure. Evaluation of K+ antagonism of Na+ activation at cytoplasmic sites was determined by analyzing Na+activation profiles as a function of K+ concentration. As in our previous study (26Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C891-C898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and based on the Albers-Post model with the assumption that Na+ and K+ bind randomly at three equivalent (noninteractive) cytoplasmic sites, the data were analyzed using the relationship described by Garay and Garrahan (24Garay R.B. Garrahan P.J. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1973; 231: 297-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar),v=V/(1+KNa/[Na](1+[K]/KK))Equation 2 Where [Na] and [K] represent the cytoplasmic concentrations of Na+ and K+, respectively; v andV have their usual meaning; KNa is the affinity for Na+ binding at cytoplasmic activation sites in the absence of K+; andKK is the affinity for K+ acting as an antagonist of Na+ binding at cytoplasmic sites. This equation predicts a linear relationship between the apparent affinity constant for Na+, K′Na, and K+ concentration according to the following relationship.KNa′=KNa(1+[K]/KK)Equation 3 All experiments shown or described are representative of at least three similar experiments, except for experiments summarized in the inset of Fig. 1 and those shown in Fig. 6, in which cases the means of at least three independent experiments are shown. For the representative experiments shown, each data point is the mean ± S.D. of three replicate samples.Figure 6Effects of γa and γb on K+/Na+ antagonism of rat α1-HeLa cells. Lines shown are least squares fits of the values ofK′Na determined at varying Na+concentration as indicated in Fig. 5, with the K+concentration kept constant at either 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 mm. For each concentration of K+, the three types of membranes were assayed concurrently in the same experiment. Each point shown is the mean ± S.D. from at least three separate experiments. KNa andKNa/KK obtained from the least squares fits of the data to Equation 3 and values ofKK calculated from the ratio ofKNa/(KNa/KK) are shown in Table I. ×—×, control, mock-transfected α1-HeLa; ○——○, γa-α1-HeLa; ●——●, γb-α1-HeLa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experiments described below were carried out to extend previous investigations of the functional role of γ and to compare the effects of the two variants, γa and γb. This was done primarily by comparing the kinetic behavior of γa- and γb-transfected cells with mock-transfected HeLa cells and, where indicated, by analyzing the effect of anti-γ antibodies on the renal enzyme. Experiments were initially carried out with γ-transfected wild-type HeLa cells and then repeated with γ-transfected α1-HeLa to assure that effects, or absence thereof, were not specific to the species of α, either rat or human. Similar findings were obtained with both cell lines. Only those from either wild-type or rat α1-transfected HeLa cells are shown. Furthermore, we noted that selection and growth of α1−HeLa cells in a low concentration of ouabain (cf. Ref. 21Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) down-regulates endogenous human α1 such that expressed rat α1 predominates (experiments not shown). We showed recently that expression in cultured human cells (wild-type HeLa cells and HEK cells), of cDNA encoding the two individual γ variants revealed additional bands (see Fig. 5 of Ref.10Kuster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R. Mann M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18441-18446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). That these additional bands, termed γa′ and γb′, are due to posttranslational modifications was evidenced by the cell-specific manner of their appearance following transfection into cultured cells. Thus, γa′ appears primarily in HEK cells, and γb′ appears primarily in HeLa cells. In the present study, identical results were obtained for γa and γb expressed in rat α1-transfected HeLa cells (not shown). As in the case of wild-type HeLa, a conspicuous γb′ is visible in γb-transfected α1-HeLa, and only one band is visible in γa-transfected α1-HeLa cells. Densitometry of the α and γ subunits of membranes from clones of γa-HeLa, γa-α1-HeLa, and γb-HeLa and γb-α1-HeLa, in which expression is relatively high and used for functional analysis, showed that the γ/α ratios are ∼50% that of rat kidney (density of both γ bands). Fig. 1 confirms the earlier finding that γa decreases K′ATP for ATP (low affinity binding) and shows further that a similar (∼2-fold) decrease in K′ATP (low affinity binding) is effected by γb. Furthermore, this effect appears to be independent of the presence (HEK cells; Ref. 11Therien A.G. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or absence (HeLa cells; this study) of γa′. It was also noted earlier that this effect of γ is abrogated by anti-γ antibody as evidenced in the increase in K′ATP following preincubation of either γa-transfected HEK cells or the rat kidney enzyme with the antiserum γC33 raised against the last 10 residues of the C terminus. Similar effects of γa and γb were observed in other experiments (not shown) in which the cDNAs of these variants were transfected into α1-HeLa cells. Although anti-γ (C-terminal) decreases the Vmax of kidney enzyme (8Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), variation in specific activity among different membrane preparations from the HeLa cells (see the legend to Fig. 1) precluded the determination of γ effects on Vmax.

The signaling pathway downstream of PTPμ is unknown; therefore, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify additional PTPμ interacting proteins. The membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPμ was used as bait. Sequencing of two positive clones identified the scaffolding protein RACK1 (receptor for activated proteinCkinase) as a PTPμ interacting protein. We demonstrate that RACK1 interacts with PTPμ when co-expressed in a recombinant baculovirus expression system. RACK1 is known to bind to the src protein-tyrosine kinase. This study demonstrates that PTPμ association with RACK1 is disrupted by the presence of constituitively active src. RACK1 is thought to be a scaffolding protein that recruits proteins to the plasma membrane via an unknown mechanism. We have shown that the association of endogenous PTPμ and RACK1 in a lung cell line is increased at high cell density. We also demonstrate that the recruitment of RACK1 to both the plasma membrane and cell-cell contact sites is dependent upon the presence of the PTPμ protein in these cells. Therefore, PTPμ may be one of the proteins that recruits RACK1 to points of cell-cell contact, which may be important for PTPμ-dependent signaling in response to cell-cell adhesion.

M. Brady-Kalnay Cell Adhesion: Frontiers in Molecular Biology.in: M Beckerle Oxford University Press, Oxford,UK2001Google Scholar). Many of these receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are members of the Ig superfamily, a group of proteins responsible for cell recognition or adhesion. We previously demonstrated that the RPTP PTPμ promotes cell-cell aggregation when expressed in nonadhesive cells (2Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J.

These studies demonstrated that the binding is homophilic (i.e. the “ligand” for PTPμ is an identical PTPμ molecule on an adjacent cell). Interestingly, endogenous levels of the PTPμ adhesion molecule have also been shown to promote neurite outgrowth from retinal neurons (6Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). RPTPs have cell adhesion molecule-like extracellular segments as well as intracellular domains possessing tyrosine phosphatase activity, suggesting they may play a regulatory role in cell adhesion-induced signaling (1S. M. Brady-Kalnay Cell Adhesion: Frontiers in Molecular Biology.in: M Beckerle Oxford University Press, Oxford,UK2001Google Scholar, 7Brady-Kalnay S. Sonderegger P.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). However, the precise signaling pathways utilized by RPTPs are unknown. The juxtamembrane domain of PTPμ contains a region of homology to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins (9Tonks N.K. Yang Q. Flint A.J. Gebbink M. Franza B.R. Hill D.E. Sun H. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules that interact with molecules termed catenins that associate with actin (10Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 20-211Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar,11Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that PTPμ associates with a complex containing classical cadherins, α catenin and β catenin (12Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J.

In addition, we have recently demonstrated that PTPμ is required forN-cadherin-dependent neurite outgrowth (6Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways downstream of the RPTPs and cadherins are not well understood. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that PTPμ interacts with RACK1 and that this protein may be a component of the PTPμ signaling pathway. A recently identified group of cytosolic proteins called RACKs (receptors for activated protein Ckinase) have been shown to bind to PKC only when it is in the activated state (15Mochly-Rosen D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the binding of activated PKC to RACK(s) is necessary for the translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane, a process thought to be required in order for PKC to perform its physiological function (15Mochly-Rosen D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A specific RACK, RACK1, has been cloned and is a homolog of the β subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins as determined by the existence of WD repeats (16Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 43-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). WD repeats are 40-amino acid motifs proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions (17Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). RACK1 is composed of seven WD repeats that are thought to form propeller-like structures (18Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). More recent data suggests that RACK1 is a scaffolding protein that recruits a number of signaling molecules into a complex. Theoretically, the seven propellers of the RACK1 structure (18Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J.

RACK1 has been shown to bind PKC, phospholipase Cγ, the src cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK), cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase-4, the β subunit of integrins, and the β chain of interleukin-5 receptor (19Disatnik M.H.

RACK1 has also been demonstrated to bind select pleckstrin homology domains in vitro including dynamin, β− spectrin, Ras GRF (guanine nucleotide-releasing factor), and oxysterol-binding protein (24Rodriguez M.M. Ron D. Touhara K. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13787-13794Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Some of the interactions between RACK1 and the proteins listed above have been shown to be mutually exclusive (20Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, only a subset of these interactions depend upon PKC stimulation (22Liliental J. Chang D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that RACK1 may form distinct signaling complexes in response to unique cellular stimuli. In this study, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid genetic screen to isolate PTPμ interacting proteins and identified RACK1 as a protein that binds directly to the membrane-proximal catalytic domain in the cytoplasmic segment of PTPμ. We characterized this interaction using a recombinant baculovirus expression system and showed that RACK1 and PTPμ interact only when co-expressed. We also demonstrated that the presence of constituitively active src disrupts the interaction between PTPμ and RACK1. In MvLu cells, which endogenously express both PTPμ and RACK1, we demonstrated that PTPμ and RACK1 associate predominantly at higher cell densities. The association between RACK1 and PTPμ is not affected by activation of PKCs via phorbol esters. PTPμ is up-regulated at high cell density in MvLu cells (25Gebbink M. Zondag G. Koningstein G. Feiken E. Wubbolts R. Moolenaar W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and is primarily found at cell-cell contact sites (12Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We have found that RACK1 is recruited to the plasma membrane and points of cell-cell contact at high cell density. Antisense down-regulation of PTPμ expression results in a cytoplasmic localization of RACK1 even in the presence of cell contacts. Therefore, the recruitment of RACK1 to both the plasma membrane and cell-cell contact sites is dependent upon PTPμ. Localization of RACK1 to points of cell-cell contact may be an important part of the PTPμ-dependent signal transduction process in response to cell-cell adhesion. We used the LexA version of the yeast two-hybrid system to perform an interaction trap assay (26E. A Golemis Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.in: R. Brent Chapter 20. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 20.1.1-20.1.35Google Scholar). This approach detects protein-protein interactions between a protein from a HeLa cell (human) cDNA library and a construct containing the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of human PTPμ (PTPμD1) as the bait. Amino acids 915–1178 (PTPμ-D1) were cloned in frame with the LexA coding sequence of pEG202 (HIS3) to generate a “bait” plasmid. The resulting construct (pEG202-D1) was sequenced for insertion and correct orientation. The pEG202-D1 plasmid and the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pSH18–34) were co-transformed into the yeast strain YPH499. The pSH18–34 (URA3) reporter plasmid contains a LexA-operator-lacZ fusion gene. The pEG202-D1 plasmid did not activate the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid on its own. A HeLa cell human cDNA library (26E. A Golemis Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.in: R. Brent Chapter 20. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 20.1.1-20.1.35Google Scholar) in the pJG4–5 (TRP1) yeast expression vector was introduced into a yeast strain containing a chromosomal copy of the LEU2 gene (EGY48), where the activating sequences of the LEU2 gene are replaced with LexA operator sequences. The two strains (EGY48 and YPH499) were mated, and the resulting colonies containing the three plasmids were processed according to published methods (26E. A Golemis Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.in: R. Brent Chapter 20. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 20.1.1-20.1.35Google Scholar). Potential interactions were detected by growing the mated yeast strain on minimal medium containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose and lacking the appropriate amino acids to ensure selective pressure of the auxotrophic markers (only colonies containing all the plasmids and expressing the leucine reporter gene will grow). We screened 2.4 × 107 colonies and found four strong interactors. We isolated the prey-containing plasmids and sequenced the DNA from these clones. Two independent positive “prey” clones (clones 1 and 2) were identified as full-length RACK1 by DNA sequencing of the library plasmid (pJG4–5). The positive control used in Fig. 1 a is a yeast strain containing a self-activating bait plasmid that grows on both glucose and galactose. The negative control for Fig. 1 bis a yeast strain containing the bait (pEG 202-D1), reporter plasmid (pSH18–34), and an empty prey vector (pJG4–5). The positive control for Fig. 1 b is Etk and HSP70 that interact with one another. 2H. J. Kung and Y. Qiu, personal communication. A constituitively active form of the src protein-tyrosine kinase (Y527F,Y416F double mutant) was obtained from Dr. Jonathan Cooper (27Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). The BTM116 plasmid containing the src gene was restriction digested with BamHI. A partial digest of pSH18–34 was performed with BamHI, and the srcinsert was ligated with this vector. The pSH18–34/src and the pEG202-D1 plasmids were used to transform the YPH499 yeast strain. Then this YPH499 strain was mated to the EGY48 strain containing the RACK1 gene. This allowed us to test whether thesrc interaction with RACK1 could disrupt the RACK1/PTPμ interaction that drove β-galactosidase transcription. Monoclonal antibodies against the intracellular (SK7, SK15, SK18) and extracellular (BK2) domains of PTPμ or polyclonal antibody against the intracellular domain (471) of PTPμ have been described (2Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 5Brady-Kalnay S.M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28472-28477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A control monoclonal antibody directed against L1 (8D9) was generously provided by Dr. Vance Lemmon (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). A monoclonal antibody to the HA tag conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to detect recombinant RACK1. The HA antibody was also purchased in a biotinylated form, and strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase was used for visualization (Covance, Denver, PA). In addition, a specific antibody to RACK1 was purchased from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY). The monoclonal antibody to src was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The baculovirus encoding the intracellular domain of PTPμ (intra-PTPμ) has been described (2Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The src baculovirus, which encodes a constituitively active kinase (Y527F mutant), was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Weber and originally constructed by Dr. David Morgan (28Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D.K. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1995; 268: 1096-1902Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The RACK1-pJG4–5 vector was restriction digested so that the resulting 1800-base pair fragment contained an HA tag (from pJG4–5) in frame with the full-length RACK1 clone. The 1800-base pair fragment was cloned into the pAcHLT-C (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) baculovirus expression vector. The construct was sequenced to confirm orientation and correct insertion of the 1800-base pair fragment. This created a form of RACK1 that contained a poly-histidine tag, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase site, a thrombin cleavage site, and an HA tag, at the N terminus followed by the RACK1 cDNA sequence (amino acids 1–317). Baculoviruses were generated using the BaculoGoldTM system (BD PharMingen). Sf9 cells (CRL 1711; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) derived from the ovary of the Fall army worm Spodoptera frugiperda were maintained at 27 °C in Grace's Insect Medium Supplemented (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. The viral stocks were then used to infect Sf9 cells and express the proteins of interest (PTPμ, RACK1, and src). 48 h post-infection, cells were either lysed or treated with 160 nm PMA (activator of PKC; Calbiochem) (22Liliental J. Chang D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) or PP2 (inhibitor of src family kinases; Calbiochem) for 30 min at 27 °C. Cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 μm okadaic acid, 200 μm phenylarsine oxide, 1 mm vanadate, and 0.1 mm molybdate) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 3 min to remove Triton-insoluble components. Mv 1 Lu (MvLu) mink lung epithelial cells (ATCC number CCL 64) were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μg/ml gentamicin plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The MvLu cells were grown to 50 or 90% confluence prior to lysis. PKC activation of MvLu cells was performed by adding 10 nm PMA (Calbiochem) for 15 min at 37 °C before lysis of the cells. MvLu cells were lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm benzamidine, 200 μm phenyl arsine oxide, 1 mm vanadate, and 0.1 mm molybdate), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min. A replication-defective amphotrophic retrovirus expressing an antisense PTPμ construct and control retrovirus have been described previously (6Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). MvLu cells were incubated in virus-containing medium supplemented with serum (final concentration, 10% final) plus 5 μg/ml polybrene for 4 days. Reduction in endogenous PTPμ expression was verified by immunoblotting lysates from infected cells with antibodies to PTPμ. For immunoprecipitation, antibodies to PTPμ or RACK1 were incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or goat anti-mouse IgG (or IgM) that had been conjugated to Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) for 2 h at room temperature then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (9.5 mm phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mmNaCl, pH 7.5) before addition to cell lysates. Purified monoclonal antibodies were used at 0.6 mg of IgG/ml beads, ascites fluid was used at 1 mg of IgG/ml beads, and polyclonal serum was used at 3 mg of IgG/ml beads. Immunoprecipitates were prepared from 40 μg (Sf9 cells) or 300 μg (MvLu cells) of a Triton-soluble lysate of cells as measured by the Bradford method. The immunoprecipitates were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rocker and centrifuged at 3,000 ×g for 1 min. The supernatant was removed from the beads, the beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, and the bound material eluted by addition of 100 μl of 2× sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. One-fifth of the immunoprecipitate (20 μl) was loaded per lane of the gel, and the proteins were separated by 10% (for analysis of RACK1 and src), 7.5% (for analysis of the intracellular PTPμ), and 6% (for analysis of endogenous PTPμ) SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting as previously described (2Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). All chemicals were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. at room temperature (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). The cells were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin, blocked with 20% normal goat serum plus 1% BSA and incubated with primary antibody for 18 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed with TNT buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 0.5% saponin and incubated with Texas Red, fluorescein, or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR or Cappel Research Products, Durham, NC) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Samples were mounted with Slow fade Light (Molecular Probes). The fluorescent labeling was examined using a 40× objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu cooled CCD camera. The yeast two-hybrid interaction trap assay (26E. A Golemis Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.in: R. Brent Chapter 20. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 20.1.1-20.1.35Google Scholar) was used to identify proteins that were capable of binding directly to the membrane-proximal catalytic domain of PTPμ. Potential interactors were detected by growing the mated yeast strain on minimal medium containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose and lacking the appropriate amino acids (only colonies containing all the plasmids and expressing the leucine reporter gene will grow). We screened 2.4 × 107 colonies. PTPμ interactors were selected by three criteria. First, they were screened for viability on medium lacking leucine. Only interacting clones will be able to grow on medium without leucine. Second, they were screened for formation of blue colonies when grown on medium containing X-gal/galactose compared with X-gal/glucose containing medium. Galactose specifically induces expression of the “prey” protein whereas glucose does not. Third, they were discriminated for the level of transcriptional activation of the lacZ gene based on the blue color of the colonies when grown on medium containing X-gal. Fig. 1illustrates two independent clones (clones 1 and 2) that fulfilled these criteria. The two clones did not grow on glucose but did grow on galactose (Fig. 1 a). These two clones also expressed high levels of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1 b, R&μ). Sequence analysis of these two independent positive clones demonstrated that they both encoded RACK1, a member of the heterotrimeric Gβ superfamily of proteins. To characterize the interaction of PTPμ and RACK1, Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding full-length RACK1 or the intracellular domain of PTPμ, singly or in combination. Lysates from Sf9 cells were immunoprecipitated with RACK1 or PTPμ (471) antibodies and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots of immunoprecipitates probed with an antibody to RACK1 are shown (Fig. 2,a and b). Immunoblots of PTPμ immunoprecipitates probed with an anti-PTPμ (SK15) antibody are shown (Fig. 2 c). Equal amounts of RACK1 were available in the Triton-soluble lysate used for immunoprecipitation based on the ability of RACK1 antibodies to immunoprecipitate RACK1 (Fig. 2 a,lanes 1, 3, and 4). Fig. 2 also illustrates that equal amounts of PTPμ were immunoprecipitated from the PTPμ-infected cell samples (Fig. 2 c, lanes 2–4). PTPμ immunoprecipitates (471 antibody) were immunoblotted with antibody to RACK1 (Fig. 2 b). RACK1 interaction with PTPμ was only detected in cells where both proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 2 b, lanes 3 and 4). The PTPμ antibody did not immunoprecipitate RACK1 from cell lysates in the absence of PTPμ expression (Fig. 2 b, lane 1), thus ruling out the possibility that the antibody recognized RACK1 nonspecifically. Treatment with phorbol esters can stimulate PKC because of their close chemical similarity to diacylglycerol (15Mochly-Rosen D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An endogenous PKC that resembles the nonconventional PKCs is expressed in Sf9 cells and is known to be stimulated 20-fold by phorbol ester treatment (29Geiges D. Meyer T. Marte B. Vanek M. Weissgerber G. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. Fabbro D. Huwiler A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The interaction between RACK1 and PTPμ was unaffected by endogenous PKC stimulation with phorbol esters (Fig. 2 b,lane 4). These data indicate that RACK1 only bound to PTPμ when both proteins were co-expressed in insect cells and the interaction was not affected by phorbol esters. Because RACK1 is known to bind to src (20Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether addition of a constituitively active src to the yeast cells affected binding between RACK1 and PTPμ. β-Galactosidase staining of yeast expressing RACK1 and PTPμ was positive, whereas RACK1/PTPμ/src containing yeast did not turn blue on medium containing X-gal (Fig. 1 b). Therefore, constituitively active src appears to disrupt the interaction between RACK1 and PTPμ in yeast. We then analyzed whether constituitively active src could disrupt the interaction between RACK1 and PTPμ in the Sf9 cell system. We did single, double, or triple infections with RACK1, PTPμ, and constituitively active src. Fig.3 shows that PTPμ (Fig. 3 c) and the src PTK (Fig. 3 d) were expressed in the appropriate samples. RACK1 antibody immunoprecipitated RACK1 from all the appropriate samples (Fig. 3 a, lanes 1–4). PTPμ immunoprecipitated PTPμ in all the appropriate samples (Fig.3 c). Although RACK1 and PTPμ interact when co-infected (Fig.3 b, lane 2), there was no interaction detected when src was added in the triple infection (Fig.3 b, lanes 3 and 4). PP2, the cell-permeable src family kinase inhibitor, had no effect on the ability of src to disrupt the PTPμ/RACK1 interaction (Fig. 3 b, lane 4). PP2 was able to inhibitsrc tyrosine kinase activity as evidenced by a decrease in anti-phosphotyrosine reactivity (Fig. 3 e). These results suggest that the ability of src to disrupt the PTPμ/RACK1 interaction was not dependent upon kinase activity or mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of any of the proteins. Therefore, constituitively active src was able to disrupt the interaction between RACK1 and PTPμ in yeast as well as in the Sf9 cell system. Together, these results suggest that PTPμ andsrc may form mutually exclusive complexes with RACK1. To examine whether endogenous PTPμ associates with endogenous RACK1, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using MvLu cells. Endogenous PTPμ in MvLu cells is proteolytically processed. The full-length form is cleaved into two noncovalently associated fragments, one (P-subunit) comprising the entire intracellular and transmembrane segments and a short stretch of extracellular sequence, the other (E-subunit) containing the remainder of the extracellular segment (5Brady-Kalnay S.M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Both the full-length (200 kDa) and cleaved form (100 kDa) of PTPμ were expressed (Fig.4 a) as expected (12Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). PTPμ expression in MvLu cells is regulated by cell density (25Gebbink M. Zondag G. Koningstein G. Feiken E. Wubbolts R. Moolenaar W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In our studies, the expression of PTPμ also increased with cell density (data not shown). However, at 50 and 90% confluence, PTPμ expression appeared to be approximately the same (Fig. 4 a). MvLu cell cultures were grown at these two densities to control the amount of cell contact. When MvLu cells are grown to 50% confluence there is little cell contact, whereas at 90% confluence the majority of cells adhere to one another. We used a retrovirus encoding antisense PTPμ (6Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) to infect MvLu cells. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the full-length protein (200-kDa band) was substantially reduced in cells infected with PTPμ antisense virus when"
https://openalex.org/W1964199332,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is overexpressed in a variety of fibrotic disorders such as renal fibrosis and atherosclerosis. Fibrosis is a common final pathway of renal diseases of diverse etiology, including inflammation, hemodynamics, and metabolic injury. Mechanical strains such as stretch, shear stress, and static pressure are possible regulatory elements in CTGF expression. In this study, we examined the ability of static pressure to modulate CTGF gene expression in cultured human mesangial cells. Low static pressure (40–80 mm Hg) stimulated cell proliferation via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. In contrast, high static pressure (100–180 mm Hg) induced apoptosis in human mesangial cells. This effect was reversed by treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide but not with transforming growth factor β1-neutralizing antibody or protein kinase C inhibitor. High static pressure not only up-regulated the expression of CTGF, but also the expression of extracellular matrix proteins (collagen I and IV, laminin). This up-regulation of extracellular matrix proteins was also reversed by treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide. As judged by mRNA expression of a total of 1100 genes, including apoptosis-associated genes using DNA microarray techniques, recombinant CTGF protein induced apoptosis by down-regulation of a number of anti-apoptotic genes. Overexpression of CTGF in mesangial cells by transient transfection had similar effects. Taken together, these results suggest that high blood pressure up-regulates CTGF expression in mesangial cells. High levels of CTGF in turn enhance extracellular matrix production and induce apoptosis in mesangial cells, and may contribute to remodeling of mesangium and ultimately glomerulosclerosis.

CTGF mRNA has been shown to be overexpressed in the extracapillary and severe mesangial proliferative lesions of crescentic glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, focal, and segmental glomerulosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy (5Ito Y.

In anti-Thy1 nephritis, an animal model of acute glomerulonephritis, CTGF mRNA was shown to be up-regulated in both mesangial cells and podocytes (6Goldschmeding R. Aten J. Ito Y. Blom I. Rabelink T. Weening J.J. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CTGF mRNA up-regulation in sclerotic glomeruli and fibrotic interstitium was also found in a chronic hypertension model in rats (uninephrectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats) (6Goldschmeding R. Aten J. Ito Y. Blom I. Rabelink T. Weening J.J. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hence, substantial evidence both in human disease as well as in experimental models of kidney disease suggests an important role of CTGF in renal diseases. Nonetheless, we have just begun to understand the regulation of CTGF expression in renal diseases. In particular, the role of high blood pressure in regulating CTGF expression has not yet been elucidated. TGF-β is thought to be the major pathogenic factor in the development of renal fibrotic disorders. However, the development and progression of renal sclerosis is determined by complex interactions of many factors, including growth factors and direct hemodynamic action. In human skin fibroblasts, CTGF mRNA is specifically induced by TGF-β but not by platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or basic fibroblast growth factor (6Goldschmeding R. Aten J. Ito Y. Blom I. Rabelink T. Weening J.J. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent reports also suggest a possible role for hepatic growth factor, interleukin-1β, interleukin-4, tumor necrosis factor-α, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in regulation of CTGF (6Goldschmeding R.

Thus far, TGF-β has been shown to be the strongest inducer of CTGF expression in a variety of cells derived from different organs (8Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, Grotendorst et al. (8Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar) found a unique TGF-β-responsive element within the promoter sequence of the CTGF gene, where point mutation of this responsive element abolished the regulatory effect of TGF-β on CTGF gene expression. More importantly, in anti-Thy1 nephritis, TGF-β and CTGF are expressed in coordinate fashion, suggesting the important role of TGF-β in regulating CTGF expressionin vivo (3Gupta S. Clarkson M.R.

Hypertension has been shown to independently accelerate the progression of chronic renal failure in humans irrespective of the pathogenesis of the renal disease (9Fogo A.B. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: S15-S21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Marcantoni C. Jafar T.H. Oldrizzi L. Levey A.S. Maschio G. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: S44-S48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The potential role of local hemodynamic changes on the progression of glomerulosclerosis and renal fibrosis has also been extensively studied in animal models. In patients with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, the autoregulation of glomerular pressure is impaired, resulting in exposure of the capillary bed to systemic blood pressure fluctuation reaching unphysiologically high levels of local pressure. In normal tissue, this peak level of pressure is absorbed by the elasticity of the mesangium in the kidney glomeruli. The increased capillary pressure causes the mesangial area, including the mesangial cells to spread and expand. At the same time, the increased pressure also compresses the cells in a tangential direction. Chronic exposure to high blood pressure eventually leads to chronic expansion and remodeling of the mesangial area with accumulation of extracellular matrix and finally glomerulosclerosis. Numerous locally produced factors, including TGF-β and PDGF have been implicated in this mechanically induced mesangial expansion and remodeling. However, it is impossible to separate the effect of stretch and tangential compressive strain by pressure, in vivo. Therefore, to study these differential effects of mechanical strain on mesangial cells, we have utilized in this study an in vitro model in which only static pressure was applied to mesangial cells in culture without stretch (11Hishikawa K.

Cyclic stretching increases production and release of various vasoactive substances and growth factors in cultured cells, including TGF-β, which in turn up-regulates CTGF mRNA expression (15Davis M.J.

We now provide direct evidence that high static pressure up-regulates CTGF levels in CTGF-mediated apoptosis. Human renal mesangial cells were obtained from Clonetics (21Amemiya T. Sasamura H. Mifune M. Kitamura Y. Hirahashi J. Hayashi M. Saruta T. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 2055-2063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in MsGM (Clonetics), and cells from passages 2 to 4 from three different isolates were used for experiments. All experiments were performed after 24 h of incubation in 1% fetal bovine serum. TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody was obtained from (R&D Systems). Treatment with TGF-β1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 48 h reduced cell viability of human mesangial cells in a concentration-dependent manner (1–10 ng/ml), and pretreatment with the neutralizing antibody (10 μg/ml) completely prevented it. On the other hand, treatment with PDGF-BB (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (5 ng/ml) stimulated cell proliferation in human mesangial cells, but pretreatment with the neutralizing antibody never prevented it. The specificity and efficacy of the neutralizing antibody is available on the Web from R&D Systems. Chelerythrine was purchased from LC laboratories. Recombinant CTGF protein and polyclonal anti-CTGF antibody were generous gift of Japan Tobacco (Osaka Japan). The pressure-loading apparatus was set up as previously described (11Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Suzuki H. Saruta T. Kato R. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1992; 200 Suppl. 12: S66-S67Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Suzuki H. Saruta T. Kato R. Eur. J.

Hypertension. 1995; 25: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The culture plates and dishes were placed in the pressure chamber containing 5% CO2, and the chamber was completely sealed using clamps. The internal pressure was raised using compressed helium gas, and the chamber was kept at 37 °C in a thermal incubator. Whereas the helium gas was being pumped into the sealed chamber, no air in the sealed chamber was released, so that the partial pressures of the gases contained in the chamber such as oxygen, nitrogen oxide, and carbon dioxide were kept constant in accordance with Boyle-Charles's law. In fact, there were no significant changes in pH and partial pressure of oxygen in culture medium throughout the experiments (up to 48 h). Mesangial cells were grown under confluent conditions to minimize the possibility of stretch and spreading under high static pressure. 16-mer CTGF antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (5′-TACTGGCGGCGGTCAT-3′) containing the initial ATG translation start site was synthesized and purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech as described previously (22Shimo T. Nakanishi T. Kimura Y. Nishida T. Ishizeki K. Matsumura T. Takigawa M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide containing a scrambled nucleotide sequence (5′-GGTCTAGCTTGCGGAC-3′) was used as control. The synthetic oligonucleotides were added directly to the cell culture medium (final concentration, 20 μg/ml). Cell viability was evaluated using an MTT assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instruction (23Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Luscher T.F. Fujii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37461-37466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). After exposure to increased static pressure (40–160 mm Hg), cells were incubated for an additional 4 h in the presence of MTT reagent under atmospheric pressure. Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer provided in the kit, incubated overnight at 37 °C, and absorbance was measured atA550 nm to A690 nm. Both floating and trypsinized adherent mesangial cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with fresh 10% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and incubated in Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min (final concentration, 30 μg/ml) (23Hishikawa K.

Nuclear morphology was examined using fluorescence microscopy with standard excitation filters. To calculate the percentage of apoptotic cells, all cells from four randomly selected microscopic fields were counted at 400× magnification. Tdt-mediated dUTP biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) was performed with the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals according to the manufacturer's instructions (23Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Luscher T.F. Fujii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37461-37466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To calculate the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells, all cells from four randomly selected microscopic fields were counted at 100× magnification. DNA fragmentation was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates (20 μg) were subjected to 12.5% percentage gel SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Ready Gel, Bio-Rad), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated with anti-CTGF antibody at 1:250 dilution for 1 h as previously described (24Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Fujii T. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2108-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein loading were confirmed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining before blotting. The membranes were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Semi-quantitative analyses of the blots were performed using the public domain IMAGE 1.60 program for Apple Macintosh from the National Institutes of Health. To overexpress the CTGF protein in human mesangial cells, a mammalian expression vector (pCMV-CTGF) containing the complete open reading frame of the CTGF gene, driven by the CMV promotor, was constructed (23Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Luscher T.F. Fujii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37461-37466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Fujii T. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2108-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells transfected with pCMV vector alone were used as controls. Transient transfection was performed using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy in cells co-transfected with plasmid containing the green fluorescence protein gene (pEGFP-C1)(CLONTECH). The average transfection efficiency using 1 μg of pEGFP-C1 and 1 μg of pCMV-CTGF in 1 × 105 human mesangial cells was calculated to be about 30%. The DNA microarray hybridization experiments were performed using Intelligene DNA chips (codes X101, X102, X103) (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The protocol and the complete listing of genes on Intelligene DNA chips are available on the Web. The DNA arrays were scanned using ScanArray (GS Lumonics), and the data were analyzed using the Quant Array (BM BIO, Tokyo, Japan). Results of important genes are shown in Figs. 4 and 7, and all results are provided in the supplemental material.Figure 7Recombinant CTGF protein down-regulated the expression of anti-apoptosis genes as judged by DNA microarray analysis. In human mesangial cells treated with recombinant CTGF (10 μg/ml) for 24 h, several extracellular matrix genes were markedly up-regulated (up to 6-fold). The expression of several anti-apoptotic genes was markedly down-regulated (up to 5-fold) and that of several caspases was up-regulated (up to 2-fold). The -fold increase and decrease in mRNA expression was measured as arbitrary units and represents the ratio of mRNA expression exposed to recombinant CTGF versus vehicle control. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = 3–5). Fluorescence intensity was normalized to that of housekeeping genes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Statistical analysis of the data was performed using analysis of variance followed by Fisher's test.p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Exposure of mesangial cells to low static pressure (80 mm Hg) for 48 h significantly increased the number of viable cells as compared with cells exposed to atmospheric pressure (Fig.1 A). This increase was inhibited by chelerythrine (CHE, 0.6 μm), a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, but not by CTGF antisense oligonucleotide (AS, 20 μg/ml), scrambled oligonucleotide (SC, 20 μg/ml), or TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody (nAb, 10 μg/ml) (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, exposure of human mesangial cells to high static pressure (140 and 180 mm Hg) significantly reduced cell viability as compared with cells exposed to atmospheric pressure (Fig. 1 A), and this effect was reversed by treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide but not by scrambled oligonucleotide, protein kinase C inhibitor, or TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody at the same concentrations (Fig. 1 C). To investigate the mechanisms of high static pressure-induced reduction in cell viability, we performed nuclear staining of mesangial cell culture using Hoechst nuclear stain. As shown in Fig.2 A, exposure to high static pressure (140 mm Hg) significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells. DNA fragmentation analysis (Fig. 2 B) and TUNEL staining (Fig. 2 C) confirmed that the reduced cell number is due to the increase in the number of apoptotic cells. This effect was inhibited by treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide (20 μg/ml). Control experiments using scrambled oligonucleotide (20 μg/ml) or TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody (10 μg/ml) had no effect (Fig. 2, A–C), suggesting that CTGF directly mediates the high static pressure-induced apoptosis in these cells. To clarify whether high pressure induced CTGF expression at protein level as well, we performed Western blot analysis of CTGF protein expression in human mesangial cells exposed to 80 or 140 mm Hg static pressure for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 3, exposure to high static pressure (140 mm Hg), but not to low static pressure (80 mm Hg), significantly increased CTGF protein expression. This effect was significantly reduced by treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide (20 μg/ml) but not by scramble oligonucleotide (20 μg/ml) or TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody (10 μg/ml) (Fig. 3 B). Treatment with protein kinase C inhibitor Chelerythrine up to 0.6 μm also had no effect (data not shown). To investigate the effects of pressure-induced CTGF overexpression on matrix production, human mesangial cells were incubated in the presence and absence of CTGF antisense oligonucleotide for 24 h. Again, scrambled oligonucleotide was used as control. The expression of extracellular matrix mRNA was analyzed using Intelligene DNA chips. The signal intensity of the DNA arrays between treated and non-treated samples was adjusted to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or β-actin. The signal intensity of the housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or β-actin was unchanged in treated versusnon-treated samples and was arbitrarily set to 1 for use as a control. As compared with cells exposed to atmospheric pressure, exposure to 140 mm Hg static pressure up-regulated not only CTGF mRNA but also collagen types I and IV and laminin mRNA expression in human mesangial cells (Fig. 4 A). On the other hand, mRNA expression of TGF-α, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3 was never changed by high static pressure (Fig.4 A). Under this condition (140 mm Hg), addition of CTGF antisense oligonucleotide (20 μg/ml) to the culture medium down-regulated CTGF, collagen types I and IV and laminin mRNA but never modulated that of fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (Fig. 4 B). Additional experiments using human mesangial cells treated with recombinant CTGF protein (10 μg/ml) showed similar effects (see Fig. 7 A), suggesting an important and direct effect of CTGF in high static pressure-induced extracellular matrix production in these cells. To investigate the direct effects of CTGF on cell survival, human mesangial cells were treated with recombinant human CTGF (0.05–10 μg/ml) for 48 h. As shown in Fig.5 (A–C), treatment of mesangial cells with recombinant CTGF protein significantly reduced cell viability with increased DNA fragmentation and TUNEL-positive cells. In addition, transient transfection of human mesangial cells with an expression vector containing the complete open reading frame of the human CTGF gene driven by the CMV promoter (pCMV-CTGF) resulted in CTGF overexpression and significant reduction of cell viability, as well as increases in DNA fragmentation and TUNEL-positive cells (Fig.6, A–C). Transfection of human mesangial cells with vector alone (pCMV) had no effect.Figure 6Overexpression of CTGF mRNA induced apoptosis in human mesangial cells. Transient overexpression of CTGF in human mesangial cells significantly decreased the number of viable cells as judged by MTT assay (A). Overexpression of CTGF also increased the number of apoptotic mesangial cells as judged by histone-associated DNA fragmentation (B) and TUNEL staining (C). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with pCMV (control vector)-transfected cells (n = 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the mechanism by which CTGF induces apoptosis in human mesangial cells, we performed DNA microarray experiments using Intelligene DNA chips. Cells grown in atmospheric pressure were treated with recombinant CTGF (10 μg/ml) for 24 h, and mRNA expression of 1100 genes was analyzed. As before, the housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or β-actin were used as control. As shown in Fig.7 A, recombinant CTGF up-regulated mRNA expression of several extracellular matrix protein. Moreover, several anti-apoptotic genes, including BCL2-like2, BCL2A1, DAD1, apoptosis inhibitor 1, apoptosis inhibitor 2, and survivin were considerably down-regulated (up to 5-fold), and several caspase genes (caspases 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9) were up-regulated (up to 1.7-fold) in human mesangial cells treated with recombinant CTGF protein. In the present study, we provide for the first time evidence that high static pressure induces up-regulation of CTGF expression and that this up-regulated CTGF expression is involved in overproduction of extracellular matrix and apoptosis in human mesangial cells. This is based on the following observations: (i) exposure to high static pressure increased CTGF mRNA and protein expression in human mesangial cells; (ii) exposure to high static pressure induced apoptosis in human mesangial cells, and this effect was reversed by treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide; (iii) exposure to high static pressure as well as treatment with recombinant CTGF protein increased mRNA expression of extracellular matrix protein in human mesangial cells, and this effect was inhibited by treatment with CTGF antisense oligonucleotide; (iv) treatment with recombinant CTGF protein or transient overexpression of the CTGF gene induced apoptosis in human mesangial cells; and (v) treatment with recombinant CTGF protein down-regulated anti-apoptotic genes. Circumstantial evidence suggests an important role of CTGF in the development of glomerulosclerosis in patients with diabetic nephropathy (3Gupta S. Clarkson M.R. Duggan J. Brady H.R. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 5Ito Y. Aten J. Bende R.J. Oemar B.S. Rabelink T.J. Weening J.J. Goldschmeding R. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which CTGF affects renal function in vivo is not yet clear, Murphy et al. (22Shimo T. Nakanishi T. Kimura Y. Nishida T. Ishizeki K. Matsumura T. Takigawa M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that high glucose stimulates mesangial CTGF expression and matrix production by inducing TGF-β. Hypertension and hyperglycemia are well known independent pathogenic factors in the development of glomerulosclerosis in diabetes patients. Indeed, the present study provides the evidence that CTGF expression in cultured mesangial cells is regulated by static pressure. Increased CTGF activity in turn increased extracellular matrix production and induced apoptosis in these cells, suggesting the important role of CTGF overexpression induced by high static pressure in mesangial expansion, mesangial matrix accumulation, remodeling, and, ultimately, glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, it is conceivable that high blood pressure may also affect the renal function via CTGF pathway similar to hyperglycemia. The increase in proliferation of human mesangial cells induced by exposure to low static pressure (80 mm Hg) was abolished by treatment with the specific protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine (14Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Marumo T. Suzuki H. Kato R. Saruta T. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These results were in line with recent studies showing the inhibitory effect of protein kinase C inhibitors in proliferation of rat mesangial cells and rat vascular smooth muscle cells (13Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Marumo T. Hayashi M. Suzuki H. Kato R. Saruta T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1975-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Kawata Y. Fujii Z. Sakumura T. Kitano M. Suzuki N. Matsuzaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results showed that increased CTGF expression and apoptosis in human mesangial cells exposed to high static pressure is protein kinase C-independent, contrary to the effect of high glucose-induced CTGF expression in rat mesangial cells, which is protein kinase C-dependent (26Murphy M. Godson C. Cannon S. Kato S. Mackenzie H.S. Martin F. Brady H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5830-5834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fan et al. (27Fan W.H. Karnovsky M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) reported that activation of protein kinase C inhibited CTGF induction. A recent report by Suzumaet al. (7Suzuma K. Naruse K. Suzuma I. Takahara N. Ueki K. Aiello L.P. King G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40725-40731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) indicated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced up-regulation of CTGF expression in bovine retinal capillary cells. This effect was mediated primarily by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, whereas involvement of protein kinase C and ERK pathways were only minimal. These results suggest heterogeneity in the regulation of CTGF by a variety of signaling pathway in different cell types. CTGF has been shown to be mitogenic to NRK cells and chemotactic to NIH3T3 cells (1Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar) and to induce connective tissue cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis in skin fibroblasts (reviewed in Ref.2Oemar B.S. Luscher T.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1483-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CTGF is also expressed at very high levels in non-proliferating proliferating cell nuclear antigen-negative smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions in human (28Oemar B.S. Werner A. Garnier J.M. Do D.D. Godoy N. Nauck M. Marz W. Rupp J. Pech M. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1997; 95: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In human chondrosarcoma, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression is negatively correlated with CTGF expression (29Shakunaga T. Ozaki T. Ohara N. Asaumi K. Doi T. Nishida K. Kawai A. Nakanishi T. Takigawa M. Inoue H. Cancer. 2000; 89: 1466-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support a pro-apoptotic function of CTGF in a variety of human cells. Indeed, we showed that transient overexpression of CTGF in human aortic smooth muscle cells (24Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Fujii T. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2108-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) (23Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Luscher T.F. Fujii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37461-37466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as well as treatment of these cells with recombinant human CTGF protein induced apoptosis (23Hishikawa K.

J. Pharmacol. 2000; 392: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The recombinant CTGF protein used in the present study was able to stimulate cell proliferation of normal rat kidney cells in a dose-dependent manner. 2K. Hishikawa, B. S. Oemar, and T. Nakaki, unpublished data. However, this same CTGF preparation has no mitogenic effect on rat or human mesangial cells, or rat or human vascular smooth muscle cells.2 Thus far, the reasons for these opposite effects of CTGF on different cell type are not clear. In our hands, transient overexpression of CTGF by transfection with the CTGF gene construct appears to be more effective than using purified recombinant CTGF protein in inducing apoptosis. Recently, Kubota et al. (31Kubota S. Hattori T. Shimo T. Nakanishi T. Takigawa M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) found that overexpressed CTGF protein was predominantly localized intracellularly in COS-7 cells transfected with similar construct and that intracellular CTGF acts as an antimitogenic factor in these cells by modulating the cell cycle. Taken together, these observations corroborate our findings and suggest multiple functions for CTGF depending on the location and the cell types where CTGF is found. To gain insight into the biological role of CTGF in human mesangial cells, we used DNA microarrays containing 1100 genes, including apoptosis-associated genes to analyze CTGF-regulated genes in human mesangial cells. As shown in Fig. 7, recombinant CTGF protein failed to up-regulate the 1100 genes contained in the DNA microarrays by more than 2.0-fold except extracellular matrix protein. In contrast, several anti-apoptotic genes were down-regulated by up to 5-fold, and several caspase genes were up-regulated by up to 1.7-fold in human mesangial cells treated with recombinant CTGF. Recombinant CTGF protein used in this study has also been shown to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells and human vascular smooth muscle cells by down-regulating bcl2 expression and increasing caspase 3 activity (24Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Fujii T. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2108-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Fujii T. Eur. J.

A specific inhibitor of caspase 3 such as Z-Asp(Ome)-Glu- (Ome)Val-Asp(Ome)-FMK (32Hirahashi J. Takayanagi A. Hishikawa K. Takase O. Chikaraishi A. Hayashi M. Shimizu N. Saruta T. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was also able to prevent CTGF-induced apoptosis in human mesangial cells.2Hence, down-regulation and diminished inhibitory effect of inhibitor protein and bcl2 in human mesangial cells induced by high static pressure or CTGF overexpression may increase caspase 3 activity and mediate the apoptotic effect of high static pressure via the CTGF-dependent pathway. Recently, Hahn et al. (33Hahn A. Heusinger-Ribeiro J. Lanz T. Zenkel S. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37429-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported that the regulation of CTGF expression in mesangial cells was mediated by changes in actin cytoskeleton. It is conceivable that static pressure may also modulate cytoskeleton and thus modulate CTGF expression. Mechanical stimuli such as shear stress, cyclic stretch, and static pressure could induce different alterations of the cell surface, and activate different signaling pathways, but the precise mechanism remains to be determined. For example, stretch increased 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate concentration only transiently (34Kulik T.J. Bialecki R.A. Colucci W.S. Rothman A. Glennon E.T. Underwood R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 982-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but static pressure induced sustained high levels of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate production (13Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Marumo T. Hayashi M. Suzuki H. Kato R. Saruta T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1975-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Stretch also rapidly increased intracellular calcium concentration, but shear stress and static pressure did not (13Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Marumo T. Hayashi M. Suzuki H. Kato R. Saruta T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1975-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Ando J. Ohtsuka A. Korenaga R. Kamiya A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These differences in response to mechanical stimuli may explain why high static pressure increased sustained high level CTGF mRNA expression and cyclic stretch only induced transient overexpression of CTGF mRNA in rat mesangial cells (20Riser B.L. Denichilo M. Cortes P. Baker C. Grondin J.M. Yee J. Narins R.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In conclusion, high static pressure appears to induce CTGF expression in human mesangial cells. The precise mechanism by which high static pressure regulates CTGF expression and apoptosis remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, our results clearly show that hypertension regulates extracellular matrix production and apoptosis in human mesangial cells via CTGF and thus may play a more substantial role in accelerating the development of glomerulosclerosis than previously thought. Our results also suggest that CTGF could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of hypertension-induced mesangial expansion, remodeling, and sclerotic process in kidney diseases."

In mycobacteria, long chain acyl-CoA products (C14–C26) generated by a type I fatty-acid synthase can be used directly for the α-branch of mycolic acid or can be extended by a type II fatty-acid synthase to make the meromycolic acid (C50–C56))-derived component.

This enzyme, presumed to play a key role in initiating meromycolic acid biosynthesis, was crystallized, and its structure was determined at 2.1-Å resolution. The mtFabH homodimer is closely similar in topology and active-site structure to Escherichia coli FabH (ecFabH), with a CoA/malonyl-ACP-binding channel leading from the enzyme surface to the buried active-site cysteine residue. Unlike ecFabH, mtFabH contains a second hydrophobic channel leading from the active site. In the ecFabH structure, this channel is blocked by a phenylalanine residue, which constrains specificity to acetyl-CoA, whereas in mtFabH, this residue is a threonine, which permits binding of longer acyl chains. This same channel in mtFabH is capped by an α-helix formed adjacent to a 4-amino acid sequence insertion, which limits bound acyl chain length to 16 carbons. These observations offer a molecular basis for understanding the unusual substrate specificity of mtFabH and its probable role in regulating the biosynthesis of the two different length acyl chains required for generation of mycolic acids.

The appearance of drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis and the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic have exacerbated this situation (2Pablos-Mendez A. Raviglione M.C. Laszlo A. Binkin N.

Effective treatment of tuberculosis infections requires the identification of both new drugs and drug targets. Fatty acid biosynthesis in pathogenic microorganisms is essential for cell viability and has recently attracted considerable interest as a target for development of new therapeutic agents (4Kremer L.

In these organisms, de novo fatty acid biosynthesis from an acetyl-CoA or related starter unit is typically catalyzed by a type II or dissociated fatty-acid synthase, composed of discrete enzymes (7Magnusson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in mammals and other higher organisms is catalyzed by a type I or associated fatty-acid synthase, composed of one or more multifunctional polypeptides (8Chang S.I. Hammes G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4387-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mycobacteria are unusual in that they possess both a type I and a type II fatty-acid synthase (Fig. 1) (9Bloch K. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Bloch K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 1-84PubMed Google Scholar). The type I fatty-acid synthase is responsible for formation of 16–24-carbon length fatty acids, which are then elongated to form long chain high molecular mass mycolates (11Barry III, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These acids are high molecular mass α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids with the general structure R-CH(OH)-CH(R′)-COOH (where R is a meromycolate chain (50–56 carbons) and R′ is a significantly shorter chain (22–26 carbons)), which are key components of the mycobacterium cell wall. Triclosan and isoniazid are commonly used antibacterial agents that target mycolate biosynthesis (12Levy C.W. Roujeinikova A. Sedelnikova S. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Rice D.W. Rafferty J.B. Nature. 1999; 398: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In the case of isoniazid, prevention of mycolate biosynthesis results from inhibition of the enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP)1 reductase (InhA) and possibly the ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KasA) (13Mdluli K.

This latter enzyme is apparently responsible for catalyzing the decarboxylative condensation between an acyl-ACP and a malonyl-ACP in the carbon chain extension steps in mycolate biosynthesis and has also been shown to be inhibited by thiolactomycin (4Kremer L. Douglas J.D. Baulard A.R. Morehouse C. Guy M.R. Alland D. Dover L.G. Lakey J.H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Brennan P.J. Minnikin D.E. Besra G.S. J. Biol.

A crystal structure has not been reported for KasA, but a hypothetical structure has been presented as an aid in drug design (4Kremer L. Douglas J.D. Baulard A.R. Morehouse C. Guy M.R. Alland D. Dover L.G. Lakey J.H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Brennan P.J. Minnikin D.E. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16857-16864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A ketoacyl-ACP synthase activity is also presumably needed to initiate the first decarboxylative condensation in mycolate biosynthesis. In other type II systems, this activity is provided by a β-ketoacyl synthase III (FabH, ketoacyl-ACP synthase III), which catalyzes a decarboxylative condensation between an acetyl-CoA or similar substrate and malonyl-ACP (16Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Han L. Lobo S. Reynolds K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy, a ketoacyl-ACP synthase III activity that utilizes longer chain acyl-CoA substrates would be a link between the type I and type II fatty-acid synthases of M. tuberculosis. In this study, we report that we have identified an M. tuberculosis FabH (mtFabH) that is able to preferentially use long chain acyl-CoA substrates such as myristoyl-CoA over acetyl-CoA. We have crystallized and determined the structure of this mtFabH and shown that it has several unique structural features that allow it to utilize longer chain acyl-CoA substrates and that may help in rational design of new drugs. Such drugs may be valuable in the treatment of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis since none of the current therapies target this enzyme, which appears to occupy a significant regulatory role in initiating mycolate biosynthesis. The following reagents were used:N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce); Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein, imidazole, dithiothreitol, and malonyl-CoA (Sigma); [3H]acetyl-CoA (specific activity, of 60 Ci/mmol; Moravek Biochemicals, Inc.); [9,10-3H]myristoyl-CoA (specific activity, 60 Ci/mol; American Radiochemical Chemicals); streptavidin-coated yttrium silicate scintillation proximity fluorospheres (SPA beads; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); microbiological media (Difco); restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs Inc.); pET vector and expression strains (Novagen); Ni2+-agarose resin (QIAGEN Inc.); and crystal screen kits 1 and 2 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 (Hampton Research). The putative fabH gene (Rv0533c) was amplified from M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) chromosomal DNA. The forward primer 5′-CAGATAGGACGCATATGACGGAGATCG-3′ was designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site (underlined) at the start of the 5′-end of fabH. A BamHI site was created (underlined) downstream of the fabH stop codon in the reverse primer 5′-ATCCCTGGCTGGATCCGATCTTCGC-3′. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using the GeneAmp® XL polymerase chain reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was eluted from agarose gel using Qiax (QIAGEN Inc.), digested with NdeI andBamHI, and ligated intoNdeI/BamHI-digested pET15b to create pXH8. The insert coding sequence of FabH was verified by DNA sequence analysis. The pXH8 plasmid was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen), and transformants were grown in LB medium to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.35–0.4, induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −20 °C overnight. Lysis was performed with lysozyme according to the QIAexpressionist protocol, and lysate was then frozen at −70 °C until used. Thawed lysate suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, which was then washed with 50 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol. mtFabH was eluted with 200 mm imidazole in the same buffer and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, and 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol with either 300 or 50 mm NaCl at 4 °C. Purified protein was concentrated in a Centricon tube (Amicon, Inc.) with a molecular mass cutoff of 30,000 Da to 4–8 mg/ml as determined by the Bradford assay. Dithiothreitol was added to protein concentrates to 2 mm, and these concentrates were stored at 4 °C for 3–5 days. For longer storage of the enzyme, glycerol was added to 40–50%, and the aliquoted protein was stored at −20 °C. The purity and molecular mass of His-tagged mtFabH were estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel exclusion chromatography under native conditions using a Sephacryl S-200-HR column. Radioactive FabH assays using an SPA format and biotinylated malonyl-ACP were conducted essentially as described previously (18He X. Mueller J.P. Reynolds K.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using radioactive myristoyl-CoA. The standard reaction mixture contained the following components in a final volume of 20 μl: 0.15 μg of mtFabH or sgFabH (from Streptomyces glaucescens), 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.0), 2.2 μm biotinylated malonyl-ACP, and 0.17 μm[9,10-3H]myristoyl-CoA (0.20 μCi; specific activity, 60 Ci/mmol). The reaction was initiated by the addition of [9,10-3H]myristoyl-CoA and incubated at 37 °C for various time periods. For each assay, 50 μl of the SPA bead solution (10 mg/ml) was added once the reaction was terminated. Nonradioactive assays were carried out by monitoring a loss of malonyl-ACP. Malonyl-ACP (20 μm) was combined individually with different putative substrates (250 μmacetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, lauroyl-CoA, myristoyl-CoA, or palmitoyl-CoA) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100 in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.8 μg of mtFabH, incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and terminated on ice. The reaction mixture was then analyzed on a conformationally sensitive 13–15% polyacrylamide gel containing 2.5 m urea, on which malonyl-ACP and the corresponding 3-ketoacyl-ACP products of a FabH-catalyzed reaction are readily resolved (19Choi K.-H. Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Crystallization trials were performed by the vapor diffusion method, initially using Hampton crystal screen kits (20Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). Quasi-crystalline aggregates were obtained with PEGs as precipitant, and further refinement of conditions yielded two crystal forms suitable for x-ray analysis from PEG 4000, Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl. Form 1 crystals grew after mixing equal volumes of enzyme solution (4 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) with 30% PEG 4000, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 300 mm NaCl and equilibrating against a reservoir containing 17–26% PEG 4000 in the same buffer. Conglomerates, multiples, and some single crystals (0.15 × 0.15 × 0.05 mm) with a rhomboid shape grew in 2–3 days. Form 2 crystals were obtained using the same precipitant, but with the enzyme solution containing up to 40% glycerol and 10 mm CaCl2. These crystals grew as very thin rhomboid plates (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.01 mm) in 3–5 days. Form 1 crystals were flash-cooled in a cryoprotectant solution containing 80% reservoir solution and 20% PEG 400. Diffraction intensity data were collected at −170 °C on a Raxis II image plate detector with osmic confocal optics and a rotating anode source at 50 kV and 100 mA at a detector-to-crystal distance of 80 mm. Oscillation data frames were reduced, integrated, scaled, and merged with the HKL package (21Otwinowski Z. Minor J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). Merged intensity data were converted to structure factor amplitudes using the program Truncate (22Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Form 1 crystals diffracted to 2.2-Å resolution, but were inferred to be twinned upon failure of convergence of refinement of the model obtained by molecular replacement using theE. coli FabH (ecFabH) structure as a search model (see below). Form 2 crystals were cryoprotected in 15% glycerol and 20% PEG 400 in crystallization reservoir solution and flash-frozen, and a half-sphere of data was collected and reduced as described above. These data extended to 2.1-Å resolution; showed no evidence of twinning; and were indexed in space group P21 with unit cell dimensionsa = 64.1, b = 54.8, andc = 89.2 Å and β = 90.3o. The Matthews coefficient was consistent with a dimer of FabH in the asymmetric unit. A polyalanine chain based on residues 1–317 2Sequence numbering of mtFabH is that of ecFabH, with amino-terminal extension residues numbered negatively in reverse beginning with position −1 and carboxyl-terminal extensions added to the terminal sequence number of ecFabH. Internal insertions are denoted by integer suffixes to the preceding residue in sequence. Suffixes A and B to sequence numbers denote the two monomers of the crystallographic and presumed dimer. of a monomer of the refined structure of ecFabH (6Qiu X. Janson C.A. Konstantinidis A.K.

In constructing the search model, the 4-residue insertion following residue 202 and the 1-residue insertion at position 263 of the E. coli sequence were excluded. A cross-rotation search was carried out using data between 15 and 4 Å with the fast direct protocol (24Tong L. Rossman M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 594-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) as implemented in CNS Version 1.0 (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

The solutions corresponding to the 15 highest peaks from the cross-rotation search were used as input in a translation search (26Navaza J. Vernoslova E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1995; 51: 445-450Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) as implemented in CNS Version 1.0. The presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit was confirmed by cross-rotation and translation searches using a polyalanine chain based on the ecFabH dimer structure. In these searches, we noted that the orientations of the best monomer and dimer solutions were nearly identical and that the values of the monitor function in the translation search for the dimer were significantly higher for the best dimer solutions than for the best monomer solutions. All model building was done using O Version 7.0 (27Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). An initial 2.8-Å SIGMAA weighted 2mFo − dFc (28Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Two cycles of real space 2-fold averaging of this map using a mask based on the E. coli monomer with the Ave program (29Kleywegt G. Read R.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1557-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) resulted in significant improvements in the quality of the map. The resulting map was readily interpretable and permitted placement of many side chains that were not present in the initial search model. The model was iteratively refined via simulated annealing based on torsion-angle dynamics and a maximum likelihood target function (30Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 654-668Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar) using CNS Version 1.0. Each refinement cycle was followed by manual rebuilding into mFo − dFc SIGMAA weighted cross-validated maps and mFo −dFc SIGMAA weighted cross-validated composite omit maps (31Bhat T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1998; 21: 279-281Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry was enforced via positional restraints between symmetry-related molecules. These restraints were initially assigned a weight of 300 kcal/mol/Å, which was reduced to 37.5 kcal/mol/Å in the final stages of the refinement. In the final stages of the refinement, non-crystallographic symmetry restraints on temperature factors were omitted from the restrained atomic B-factor refinement. Model phases were iteratively extended in steps to 2.1 Å over several cycles of refinement. During iterative rebuilding, residue geometries were monitored with the programs OOPs (32Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (33Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). In the final stages of the refinement, 278 solvent molecules, 7 glycerol molecules, and a ligand modeled as lauric acid (in monomer A) were added based on the presence of peaks with intensity ≥3ς in a SIGMAA weighted difference Fourier map. In the final stages of iterative rebuilding, SIGMAA weighted cross-validated difference Fourier maps calculated in the absence of solvent molecules contoured at 3ς were used to assist in locating model errors. Coordinate errors in the refined structure were estimated using Cruickshank's diffraction data precision indicator as implemented in the SFCHECK program (34Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wlodak S.J.

The sequence of putative mtFabH contained all of the signature sequences for FabH enzymes, leading to the prediction that the protein would catalyze the condensation of an acyl-CoA substrate with a malonyl-ACP substrate. The phenylalanine residue (Phe87) proposed from the crystal structure of the E. coli ketoacyl-ACP synthase III to be important in restricting the acyl-CoA substrate specificity to carbon chain lengths of 2 or 3 (6Qiu X. Janson C.A. Konstantinidis A.K. Nwagwu S. Silverman C. Smith W.W. Khandekar S. Lonsdale J. Abdel-Meguid S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36465-36471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) is a threonine in both mtFabH and sgFabH. sgFabH has been shown to accept a much greater range of acyl-CoA substrates than ecFabH (17Han L. Lobo S. Reynolds K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4481-4486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that mtFabH might similarly be able to utilize longer acyl-CoA substrates. To test this hypothesis, mtFabH was expressed, purified, and characterized as a recombinant protein with an N-terminal His tag. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the recombinant protein showed a molecular mass of 37,000 Da, and gel exclusion chromatography showed a native molecular mass of 76,600 ± 2500 Da, indicating that, like ecFabH and sgFabH, mtFabH is a homodimer. The recombinant protein was shown in an SPA to be active with the long chain myristoyl-CoA (Fig. 3). This activity appears to be specific for mtFabH since no activity could be detected carrying out the same assay using sgFabH. The ability of the mtFabH enzyme to process a range of acyl-CoA substrates was examined by monitoring the loss of malonyl-ACP substrate over time (Fig.4). No significant loss of malonyl-ACP substrate was observed either with the enzyme alone or in the presence of short chain acyl-CoA substrates (C2–C4). In a control experiment using sgFabH, a loss of malonyl-ACP could be observed using these shorter chain acyl-CoA substrates (data not shown). However, a loss of malonyl-ACP substrate was observed when longer chain substrates (C6–C16) were provided in the mtFabH enzyme assay. An independent analysis recently carried out using a coupled assay methodology has reported a similar substrate range for mtFabH, with the apparent preference for the substrate lauroyl-CoA (36Choi K.-H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28201-28207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the proposed role of this enzyme in initiating mycolate fatty acid biosynthesis and prompted attempts to crystallize and solve the structure of this unique FabH.Figure 4Analysis of acyl-CoA substrate length range for mtFabH. Assays were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No significant loss of malonyl-ACP substrate (lane 2) was observed upon incubation with mtFabH alone (lane 1) or with mtFabH and acetyl-CoA (lane 10), propionyl-CoA (lane 9), or butyryl-CoA (lane 8). The addition of hexanoyl-CoA (lane 7), octanoyl-CoA (lane 6), lauroyl-CoA (lane 5), myristoyl-CoA (lane 4), or palmitoyl-CoA (lane 3) to the incubation led to loss of malonyl-ACP and formation of the appropriate 3-ketoacyl-ACP and related degradation products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The refined electron density map for mtFabH was well resolved and continuous in all regions except for fragmented density in"

Chemokines induce their effects by binding to specific seven-transmembrane-spanning, pertussis toxin-sensitive, G protein-coupled receptors on target cells (10Murphy P.M.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) that are expressed on a wide range of leukocytes, as well as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and smooth muscle cells.RANTES is a CC chemokine that induces both the migration and activation of specific leukocyte subsets by binding to the receptors CCR1, CCR3, CCR5, and CCR9. A number of studies have examined chemokine-induced signal transduction. There is increasing evidence that RANTES may act as an antigen-independent activator of T cells, stimulating protein tyrosine phosphorylation (19Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). RANTES-induced T cell activation is apparently mediated via two distinct signal transduction cascades: one linked to recruitment of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and the other to protein-tyrosine kinase activation. RANTES-induced T cell activation apparently requires CD3 expression (20Dairaghi D.J. Soo K. Oldham E.R. Premack B.A. Kitamura T. Bacon K.B. Schall T.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 426-433PubMed Google Scholar), implying that RANTES may engage the T cell receptor complex as a way of effecting cellular activation. Indeed CCR5 is constitutively associated with membrane raft microdomains (21Manes S. Mira E. Gomez-Mouton C. Lacalle R.A. Keller P. Labrador J.P. Martines-A C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6211-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). RANTES has been show to induce the activation of the tyrosine kinases ζ-associated protein 70 and p125FAK and their association with paxillin as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of the related Pyk2 kinase (22Bacon K.B. Szabo M.C. Yssel H. Bolen J. Schall T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Davis C.B. Dikic I. Unutmaz D. Hill M. Arthos J. Siani M.A. Thompson D.A. Schlessinger J. Littman D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). RANTES-induced activation of phospholipase D is dependent on GTP-binding proteins (ADP-ribosylation factor(s) and RhoA) mediated by interactions with the receptor-coupled G proteins and not protein-tyrosine kinases (24Bacon K.B. Schall T.J. Dairaghi D.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1894-1900PubMed Google Scholar).Many cytokines and growth factors mediate their effects by activation of a common signal transduction pathway, the STAT pathway. Binding of the ligand to its specific transmembrane receptor results in receptor aggregation, which may involve single or multiple receptor chains. Receptor aggregation leads to the catalytic activation of receptor-associated cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases, JAKs, and phosphorylation-activation of latent monomeric STAT proteins. In our earlier investigations of RANTES-mediated signal transduction, we demonstrated the activation of Stat1 and Stat3 by RANTES (25Wong M. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 309-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this study we report that RANTES treatment of human PM1 T cells that express cell surface CCR5 results in the rapid and transient phosphorylation of CCR5 on tyrosine residues and the activation of CCR5-associated Jaks. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the RANTES-dependent association of the Src family kinase, p56lck, with Jak3. Our data reveal that these RANTES-CCR5-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation events are pertussis toxin-insensitive and therefore are not coupled to Gαi protein-mediated events. In comparative experiments we show that the amino-terminally modified RANTES proteins, Met-RANTES and aminooxypentane-RANTES (AOP-RANTES),1 exhibit agonist activity on CCR5 in PM1 cells in the context of tyrosine phosphorylation events with similar kinetics to RANTES.The p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are serine-threonine protein kinases that are activated by diverse stimuli including physical and chemical stresses and by various hemopoietic and pro-inflammatory cytokines (reviewed in Refs. 26Tibbles L.A.

Signal transduction mediated via the p38 MAP kinase pathway seems to play an important role in regulating inflammatory responses including cytokine secretion and apoptosis in a number of different biological systems. p38 MAP kinase activation is regulated by its phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues. Focal adhesion kinase and Pyk2 kinase are nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases that are phosphorylated-activated upon T cell activation and after stimulation of G protein-linked receptors (31Schaller M.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32Maguire J.E. Danahey M. Burkly L.C. van Seventer G.A. J. Exp.

As indicated above RANTES will stimulate the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, the tyrosine kinase ζ-associated protein 70, and the focal adhesion protein paxillin in human T cells (22Bacon K.B. Szabo M.C. Yssel H. Bolen J. Schall T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence that the focal adhesion kinase-related tyrosine kinase, Pyk2, will activate p38 MAP kinase (34Kampen G.T. Stafford S. Adachi T. Jinquan T. Quan S. Grant J.A. Skov P.S. Poulsen L.K. Alam R. Blood. 2000; 95: 1911-1917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the activation of p38 MAP kinase has been implicated in chemokine-induced responses (35Pandey P. Avraham S. Kumar S. Nakazawa A. Place A. Ghanem L. Rana A. Kumar V. Majumder P.K. Avraham H. Davis R.J. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10140-10144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Viewed together, these observations raise the possibility that RANTES activation of CCR5 in T cells may invoke p38 MAP kinase activation. In this report we provide the first evidence that RANTES-CCR5 interactions result in the rapid phosphorylation of p38 and activation of its catalytic activity. Overall, our data establish that RANTES activation of CCR5 leads to the rapid phosphorylation of distinct signaling intermediates on tyrosine residues that invoke discrete signaling pathways.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe CD4+ clonal PM1 cells used in these studies were derived from the human T cell line Hut78 (36Lusso P. Cocchi F. Balotta C. Markham P.D. Louie A. Farci P. Pal R. Gallo R.C. Reitz Jr., M.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3712-3720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the onset we determined that PM1 cells express cell surface CCR5 (Fig. 1). To determine whether RANTES induced the phosphorylation of CCR5 in PM1 cells, CCR5 was immunoprecipitated from lysates from RANTES-treated cells, and the solubilized immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted for tyrosine phosphorylation and CCR5. The data in Fig. 2 A reveal that CCR5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after RANTES treatment of PM1 cells. It is known that the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 triggers Jak2 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of CCR2 in the human monocytic cell line Mono Mac 1 (41Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Aragay A. del Real G. Martin A.M. Vila-Coro A.J. Serrano A. Mayor Jr., F. Marinez-A C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 805-813PubMed Google Scholar) and that RANTES induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CCR5 in CCR5-transfected human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells and association with Jak1 (42Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. Martin A. Nieto M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. Martinez-A C. Mellado M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We therefore examined PM1 cells for RANTES-dependent CCR5 and Jak phosphorylation. In time-course studies when cell lysates from RANTES-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-CCR5 antibodies, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies, phosphorylated bands that were identified subsequently as CCR5 and Jak2 appeared within 1 min of RANTES stimulation (Fig.2 B). Apparently phosphorylated Jak2 rapidly associates with CCR5 in a RANTES-dependent manner.Figure 2RANTES-dependent CCR5 phosphorylation and association with phosphorylated Jak2. PM1 cells were either left untreated (−) or treated (+) with RANTES for the times indicated. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-CCR5 antibody. A and B, immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, then immunoblotted (WB) with an antibody against Tyr(P) (4G10). The blot shown in A was stripped and reprobed with anti-CCR5 antibody. In B, the arrows indicate the positions of CCR5 and Jak2. The blot shown in B was stripped and reprobed with anti-Jak2 antibody. Molecular mass markers (in kDa) are identified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether RANTES-CCR5 interactions result in the activation of other Jaks, we immunoprecipitated RANTES-induced cell extracts with different anti-Jak antibodies, resolved the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. Although we were unable to detect Jak1 activation, the results in Fig.3 show RANTES-inducible Jak 2 and Jak3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the inclusion of pertussis toxin did not affect RANTES-inducible Jak phosphorylation, suggesting that Gαi protein signaling events are not coupled to Jak activation. In subsequent experiments we examined whether the kinase activity of Jak2 and Jak3 is induced by RANTES. PM1 cells were treated with RANTES, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2 or anti-Jak3 antibodies, and in vitro kinase assays were performed on the immunoprecipitates. The data in Fig.4 indicate that RANTES-inducible phosphorylation of Jak2 and Jak 3 results in activation of their catalytic domains. The rapid phosphorylation-activation of Jak2 and Jak3 and the rapid association of Jak2 with CCR5 suggests that these kinases may effect early receptor tyrosine phosphorylation.Figure 3RANTES induction of Jak2 and Jak3 phosphorylation. PM1 cells were either left untreated (−) or treated (+) with RANTES for the times indicated in the presence or absence of pertussis toxin (PTx, 100 ng/ml for 4 h).

Stripping and reprobing the membrane identified this phosphorylated protein as the Src kinase p56lck. Moreover, treatment of PM1 cells with the amino-terminally modified RANTES proteins, AOP-RANTES and Met-RANTES, resulted in similar Jak3 tyrosine phosphorylation and p56lckassociation (Fig. 5). Clearly, despite the fact that both Met-RANTES and AOP-RANTES inhibit RANTES- induced activities bothin vitro (43Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Picard L. Offord R.E. Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. Buser R.

Notably, RANTES-, Met-RANTES-, and AOP-RANTES-dependent association of phosphorylated p56lck with Jak3 follows ligand-stimulated Jak3 activation. Because we observe that Jaks are rapidly associated and activated with ligand-stimulated CCR5, followed by the sequential recruitment of p56lck, the implications are that p56lck is recruited to the activated receptor complex, perhaps via an interaction with Jak3. This may occur through CCR5 interaction with CD4 (48Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Specifically, both Lyn and p59fyn associate via SH2 domains with interferon α-activated Tyk2 in hemopoietic cells (49Ward S.G. Westwick J. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 50Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest that association of p56lck with the activated interferon-receptor complex influences the antiproliferative action of interferon in T cells (51Dubois P.M. Palmer D. Webb M.L. Ledbetter J.A. Shapiro R.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1356-1361PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that Src kinases can associate with the α subunits of heterotrimeric G protein complexes (reviewed in Refs. 52Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev.

Bagnoli M. Tomassetti A. Colnaghi M.I. Canevari S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 349-357PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, RANTES-dependent recruitment of p56lck to CCR5 may result in complex patterns of interactions among signaling molecules that may allow for cross-talk between G protein-coupled signaling cascades and non-G protein-linked cascades.Figure 5RANTES-dependent activation of p56lck and association with Jak3.

The preceding provides compelling evidence for protein-tyrosine kinase involvement in mediating RANTES-CCR5 signal transduction. Apparently, non-CCR5-associated protein-tyrosine kinases such as Jaks and p56lck can be recruited to the activated receptor. The implications are that membrane-localized protein-tyrosine kinases are recruited to the ligand-stimulated receptor where they are activated and act in concert to initiate intracellular signaling cascades. MAP kinases are included among the signaling kinases regulated by chemokines (50Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Recently, we reported that the p38 MAP kinase pathway regulates interferon-dependent gene transcription without affecting DNA binding of Stat proteins, suggesting a cooperation between the p38 MAP kinase pathway and the Jak-Stat pathway in transcriptional regulation (30Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30127-30131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether RANTES activation of CCR5 in PM1 T cells leads to p38 MAP kinase activation. In time-course studies, whole-cell lysates from untreated and RANTES-treated PM1 cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated form of p38 MAP kinase. Maximum phosphorylation of p38 occurred at 15 min post-RANTES treatment (Fig.6 A). In subsequent experiments, we demonstrated that the kinase activity of p38 is inducible by RANTES. In vitro kinase assays were performed on whole-cell lysates, from untreated and RANTES-treated cells that had been immunoprecipitated with an anti-p38 antibody, using a glutathione fusion protein encoding for ATF-2 as an exogenous substrate. Stimulation of PM1 cells resulted in the phosphorylation of ATF-2 with maximal p38 kinase activity exhibited at 30 min after RANTES treatment (Fig. 6 B).Figure 6RANTES-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase and MAPKAP kinase-2. A, cells were either left untreated (−) or treated (+) with RANTES for the times indicated.

Accordingly, lysates from untreated and RANTES-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against MAPKAP kinase-2, and in vitro kinase assays were performed on the immunoprecipitates using Hsp25 as the exogenous substrate. The results in Fig. 6 C indicate that MAPKAP kinase-2 is activated by RANTES treatment. The data reveal a concordance between the kinetics of maximal inducible kinase activity of p38 and MAPKAP kinase-2 at 30 min post-RANTES stimulation. Moreover, using a p38-specific inhibitor, the pyridinyl imidazole compound SB203580, we provide evidence that MAPKAP kinase-2 is indeed a downstream effector of the p38 MAP kinase pathway in RANTES-stimulated T cells (Fig. 6 C).The specific role(s) of p38 MAP kinase in RANTES-inducible biological responses remains unknown. A recent report describes a role for p38 MAP kinase in the serine phosphorylation of paxillin and the concurrent disassembly of focal adhesion complexes (56Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Taluklder A. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7253-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The implications are that p38 MAP kinase signaling may function to negatively regulate RANTES-inducible T cell activation in the context of disassembling T cell focal adhesions (22Bacon K.B.

Using Escherichia coli-expressed human BVR and COS cells, we show that BVR is autophosphorylated and that phosphorylation is required for its activity. An “in blot” autophosphorylation assay showed that BVR is a renaturable phosphoprotein. Controls for the experiments were HO-1 and HO-2; both are phosphoproteins but are not autophosphorylated. Autophosphorylation was pH-dependent, with activity at pH 8.7 being most prominent. In addition, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate fluorescence titration of BVR gave a lower Kd at pH 8.7 than at pH 7.4 (15.5 versus 28.0 μm). Mn2+ was required for binding of the ATP analogue and for autophosphorylation; the autokinase activity was lost when treated at 60 °C for 10 min. The loss of transferred phosphates by alkaline treatment suggested that BVR is a serine/threonine kinase. Potato acid phosphatase treatment reversibly inactivated the enzyme. The enzyme was also inactivated by treatment with the serine/threonine phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A; okadaic acid attenuated the inhibition. Titration of protein phosphatase 2A-released phosphates indicated a 1:6 molar ratio of BVR to phosphate. The BVR immunoprecipitated from COS cell lysates was a phosphoprotein, and its activity and phosphorylation levels increased in response to H2O2. The results define a previously unknown mechanism for regulation of BVR activity and are discussed in the context of their relevance to heme metabolism.

The reductase, which is highly conserved in its primary structure and molecular properties, uses NADH in the acidic range (peak activity at pH ∼6.7), whereas NADPH is utilized in the basic range (peak activity at pH ∼8.7). BVR is encoded by a single copy gene (36McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Cooklis M.A. Maines M.D. Gene. 1995; 160: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and is posttranslationally modified (32Huang T.J. Trakshel G.M. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7844-7849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).This study identifies, for the first time, BVR as a phosphoprotein and finds that phosphorylation is essential to the activity of BVR to reduce biliverdin to bilirubin. Furthermore, it is found that the enzyme is autophosphorylated and that phosphorylation is reversible; the latter criterion defines a kinase. Based on the findings, we suggest that reversible phosphorylation of BVR is a previously unknown mechanism by which biological activities of heme degradation products are regulated in the cell.RESULTSPrevious studies have suggested that BVR is posttranslationally modified (32Huang T.J. Trakshel G.M. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7844-7849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, experiments were carried out to determine whether BVR is a phosphoprotein and, if so, whether phosphorylation of BVR is a reflection of autophosphorylation activity. Autophosphorylation activity was analyzed by two different methods: the in blot and in solution kinase assays. The results of the in blot kinase assay are shown in Fig.1 A. Autophosphorylation activity was assessed, after denaturation of BVR with guanidine-HCl, from phosphate incorporation into the renatured protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Incorporation of [32P]PO4 upon renaturation was detected by autoradiography. As shown when renatured in the presence of ATP, phosphate was transferred to BVR. HO-1 and HO-2, which are phosphoproteins, as indicated by immunoreactivity toward a mixture of anti-serine/anti-threonine/anti-tyrosine (Fig. 1 B), were used as controls for autophosphorylation. As noted in Fig.1 A, neither of the HO isozymes is reversibly phosphorylated under the same conditions that showed incorporation of the γ phosphate of ATP into BVR. The finding suggested that the labeled phosphate signal produced by renatured BVR was not due to nonspecific protein binding of [32P]ATP.Because of the pH dependence of BVR, the effect of pH on phosphotransferase activity was measured at pH 8.7 and 6.7. In addition, experiments were performed to examine whether the32P signal observed in Fig. 1 A is an authentic reflection of its incorporation in BVR in the process of renaturation, rather than a reflection of nonspecific protein binding. For these experiments, the in solution kinase assay was used. The results are shown in Fig. 1 C. Casein, which is not a phosphoprotein and is a commonly used acceptor of phosphate, was used in these experiments as a negative control for autophosphorylation. The stained gel of the same samples for control of sample loading is shown in Fig. 1 D. As noted in Fig. 1 C, BVR autophosphorylation is pH-dependent, with the activity being prominent at pH 8.7 and essentially no phosphotransferase activity occurring at pH 6.7. Moreover, only in lanes that contained BVR was the 32P signal observed. In lanes that contained casein alone, a signal was not observed under the pH conditions. This observation suggested that the autophosphorylation of BVR in this kinase system also is not a reflection of nonspecific ATP binding to the protein. Moreover, it appeared that at pH 8.7 BVR transferred phosphate to casein.To confirm that BVR transfers phosphate to casein in the in solution kinase assay was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of casein (1–20 μg) and a constant concentration of BVR (5 μg). The data suggest that BVR does transfer phosphate to casein, albeit not at an impressive rate, as indicated by the kinetics of the reaction (Km = 1.1 μm;Vmax = 2.8 pmol/mg/min). It is noted that the pattern of casein separation on SDS gel reveals that the commercially obtained casein separates on the gel as multiples of protein bands. When compared with Fig. 1 C, it is evident that not all components that are present in the casein preparation are phosphorylated in the presence of BVR.The phosphotransferase activity of BVR specifically required Mn2+ (Fig. 2). Ca2+ used at the same concentrations as Mn2+(1.0 and 2.0 mm) did not support phosphotransferase activity. As shown in Fig. 2, A versus B, at pH 8.7 in the absence of Mn2+, no incorporation of labeled phosphate in BVR takes place (panel A, lane 1 versus panel B, lane 3). The Mn2+ requirement for BVR phosphotransferase activity was further examined in an assay system containing MBP. As detected on the autoradiograph (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), MBP, a phosphate acceptor, when present with BVR plus Mn2+, also gave three distinct 32P signals. In the absence of Mn2+ the signals were quite subdued (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). MBP is known to nonspecifically bind phosphate in the absence of a kinase, and this was also observed in our hands (Fig.2 A, lane 3); as noted in panel B,lane 1, this interaction can take place in the absence of Mn2+. Commercially available MBP, as is the case with casein, separates in several bands on SDS gel. Because the objective of this experiment was not to characterize MBP phosphorylation, the kinase activity of BVR with MBP was not further examined. The autophosphorylation activity of BVR was thermolabile and was lost by exposure to 60 °C for 10 min prior to use in the kinase assay (Fig.2 C, lane 1).Figure 2Characterization of phosphotransferase activity of human biliverdin reductase. Purified E. coli-expressed BVR was analyzed by an in solution kinase assay in the presence (A) or absence (B) of 2 mm MnCl2 at pH 8.7 as described under “Materials and Methods.” 5 μg of BVR was used in each assay.

The increase in fluorescence of TNP-ATP as the result of binding to BVR was measured. The binding was titrated as an increase in BVR fluorescence at 550 nm as a function of TNP-ATP concentration. As shown in Fig.3, at pH 7.4 and 8.7 there is a TNP-ATP-dependent increase in BVR fluorescence, withKd values of 15.5 μm at pH 8.7 and 28.0 μm at pH 7.4. In the absence of Mn2+ in the assay system, the increase in fluorescence at 550 nm was not detectable. In addition, when measured at pH 6.7 in the presence of Mn2+ and the same concentrations of TNP-ATP, an increase in BVR fluorescence was not detected. The base-line fluorescence of TNP-ATP was not pH-dependent.Figure 3Binding of TNP-ATP to human BVR. Purified E. coli-expressed BVR was titrated with TNP-ATP in an assay system containing 30 mm Tris buffer at pH 7.4 or 8.7, 10 mm Mg2+, 2 mmMn2+, and the indicated concentrations of TNP-ATP. The BVR concentration in the assay system was 1 μm. The increase in fluorescence was measured at 550 nm. ●—●, pH 8.7; ○—○, pH 7.4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The most common amino acid acceptors of phosphate are serine, threonine, and tyrosine, with the latter being the least common among the three. Because in the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B we used a mixture of antibodies to all three phospho amino acids, we sought to identify the amino acids that are acceptors of phosphate. For these experiments, the alkaline treatment, which hydrolyses serine/threonine-bound phosphate (42Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) was used. BVR transfers phosphates to serine/threonine residues, as suggested by results of the experiments shown in Fig. 4. Subsequent to autophosphorylation and autoradiography (Fig. 4 A) (control for protein loading), the membrane was divided in two parts; one part was treated with 1 NKOH (2 h at 55 °C) and again autoradiographed. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the intensity of the 32P signal is reduced to a minimum subsequent to alkaline hydrolysis (lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 3). Fig. 4 A shows that the decrease in intensity is not due to a differential loading of the lanes (lane 1 versus lanes 2 and3).Figure 4Biliverdin reductase is autophosphorylated on serine/threonine residues. Purified E. coli-expressed BVR was subjected to in solution autophosphorylation and electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and was then transferred to an Immobilon membrane. The membrane was autoradiographed for control of loading. Subsequently, the membrane was cut in two, and one section was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis (1 N KOH) before autoradiography.

The first experiment used potato acid phosphatase. For this experiment, a protocol was designed to ensure the removal of the added phosphatase from the BVR preparation, and also only NADH-dependent activity was measured, to ensure that NADPH dephosphorylation by phosphatase did not contribute to the observation. The results are shown in Table I. As noted, treatment with potato acid phosphatase caused a dramatic decrease in BVR activity. The loss of activity was, however, recovered when the phosphatase-treated preparation was incubated with ATP at pH 8.7 under the conditions used for the in solution autophosphorylation assay. It was also noted that in the presence of ATP the reductase activity of the control BVR, as well as of phosphatase-treated samples, was increased over that in the absence of ATP. This observation was reproducible, and we cannot explain it at this time.Table IEffect of phosphorylation state on human biliverdin reductase activitySampleATP (30 μm)Activity%Control BVR−100+139BVR + phosphatase−17+151E. coli-expressed GST-tagged human BVR, as linked to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, was treated with potato acid phosphatase for 2 h at 37 °C and then purified as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the GST tag was removed. The control sample was exposed to the same treatment but minus the phosphatase. The purified preparations were treated with 30 μm unlabeled ATP for 1 h at pH 8.7 under the same conditions used for in solution phosphotransferase activity described under “Materials and Methods.” The activity of the control preparation was 2830 nmol of bilirubin/min/mg. After removal of excess ATP by passing through a gel filtration column, samples were utilized for measuring BVR activity at pH 6.7 with NADH as the cofactor. Experimental procedures are described in the text. Open table in a new tab The next series of experiments using PP2A confirmed that phosphorylation is essential for BVR activity and that BVR is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Treatment of BVR with the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A inhibited the reductase activity. The presence of okadaic acid, the inhibitor of PP2A, for the most part blocked inhibition of BVR. Me2SO, the solvent for PP2A, proved to be an inhibitor of BVR; this may well account for the absence of full recovery of BVR activity in the presence of okadaic acid. The stoichiometry of BVR:phosphate was determined by measuring the number of phosphates released by PP2A treatment of BVR and a phosphate standard curve. The results indicated a 1:6 stoichiometry of BVR:phosphate. The BVR sample after PP2A treatment, when analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine, showed a loss of phosphate signal.Figure 5Effect of protein phosphatase 2A and okadaic acid treatment on BVR activity. Purified human BVR (8 μg) was treated with PP2A (1.0 unit) in Me2SO (DMSO) or with PP2A plus okadaic acid (1 μm, dissolved in Me2SO) at 30 °C for 30 min. Activity was measured from the rate of bilirubin formation at pH 6.7 with NADH. Control BVR was treated with the same concentration of Me2SO as was present in PP2A-treated samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we examined whether phosphorylation of BVR also occurs in the cell and whether it has a bearing on BVR activity. For these experiments BVR was immunoprecipitated from COS cells and analyzed for phosphorylation using a mixture of anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies. The results are shown in Fig.6. As noted in Fig. 6 A(top panel), BVR is phosphorylated in vivo(lane 1), and its phosphorylation is increased in a time-dependent manner in response to H2O2 treatment. BVR phosphorylation did not increase further when assessed after 1 h of H2O2 treatment. The increased phosphorylation was not a reflection of an increase in cellular BVR protein levels, as suggested by the Western blot analysis using anti-BVR antibody (Fig.6 A, bottom panel). The reductase activity was also increased in cells treated with H2O2 (Fig.6 B). As shown, a time-dependent increase in activity was detected in the presence of H2O2, with the rate of bilirubin formation measuring 3–5-fold that of the control when determined at 15 and 60 min, respectively, after treatment with H2O2. The early onset of increasing activity suggests that activation of the protein, rather than increased BVR protein, is responsible for the observation.Figure 6Phosphorylation of biliverdin reductase in COS cells and response to H2O2. A, COS cells were treated with 1 mmH2O2. Control cells were not treated. At the indicated times, cells were lysed, and BVR was immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoresis and blot transfer. For one blot, a mix of anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine was used as the primary antibody (top panel). Anti-BVR antibody was used for the second blot (bottom panel). B, COS cells were treated with 1 mm H2O2 for the indicated periods. After lysis, the cell extract was prepared, and the reductase activity was measured at pH 8.7 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The activity analysis was repeated using two separate preparations of COS cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThis report has identified phosphotransfer and reduction of biliverdin as two types of activities of human BVR and has shown that the reductase activity of the enzyme requires phosphorylation of the protein. Moreover, as with reductase activity, the enzyme shows pH dependence for autophosphorylation. The enzyme appears to be best suited for both autokinase (Fig. 1 and 2) and reductase activity (9Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in an alkaline pH range (7.4 and 8.7). pH 6.7 corresponds to the pH value for peak reductase activity in the acidic range, whereas at this pH, phosphotransferase activity was nearly undetectable (Fig.1 C). A plausible explanation for the observation is a decreased affinity of BVR for adenine nucleotides in the acidic range. This possibility is consistent with BVR activity at pH 6.7 requiring a 10-fold higher concentration of cofactor (9Kutty R.K. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fakhrai H. Maines M.D. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 235: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and with the near doubling of the Kd value for TNP-ATP at pH 7.4 versus pH 8.7 (Fig. 3). The base-line fluorescence of TNP-ATP is prohibitive of using a great excess of the agent in the assay system. The fact that at pH 8.7 the enzyme is an NADPH-dependent reductase and is also most effective in autophosphorylation would suggest that at this pH the electronic environment of the phosphate-interacting domains and/or the structure that BVR assumes at this pH allow for high affinity binding of adenine nucleotides. The biological significance of why BVR is a more effective reductase and autokinase at pH 8.7 than at pH 6.7 is not understood.Hydrolysis of BVR-bound phosphates under alkaline conditions suggests that BVR is a serine/threonine phosphoprotein. Phosphorylated tyrosine residues are resistant to alkaline/acid hydrolysis (42Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Findings with PP2A, which is a serine/threonine phosphatase, supports this conclusion. PP2A studies also suggest a 1:6 molar ratio of BVR:phosphate. At this time it is not known how many of the phosphates are transferred to BVR by autophosphorylation. Also not known is which serine/threonine residues are phosphorylated. Human BVR has 24 serine and 7 threonine residues (34Maines M.D. Polevoda B.V. Huang T.J. McCoubrey Jr., W.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These inquiries are the subject of our future studies.The finding with casein phosphorylation is also consistent with the possibility that BVR is a serine/threonine kinase. Casein, as well as MBP, is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues. It is noteworthy that a predicted BVR sequence, Gly148-Ser-Leu-Arg-Phe-Thr-Ala-Ser-Pro, closely resembles the serine/threonine kinase consensus motif Gly-(Thr/Ser)-X-X-(Tyr/Phe)-X-Ala-Pro-Glu (45Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter S. Science. 1988; 241: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). It is relevant to note that mutation of the Ser149residue in BVR inactivates the enzyme (data not shown).

The aim of the present study was to use immunoaffinity techniques to identify proteins that interact with Syntaxin 7. We reasoned that this would be facilitated by the use of cells producing high levels of Syntaxin 7. Screening of a large number of tissues and cell lines revealed that Syntaxin 7 is expressed at very high levels in B16 melanoma cells. Moreover, the expression of Syntaxin 7 increased in these cells as they underwent melanogenesis. From a large scale Syntaxin 7 immunoprecipitation, we have identified six polypeptides using a combination of electrospray mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. These polypeptides corresponded to Syntaxin 7, Syntaxin 6, mouse Vps10p tail interactor 1b (mVti1b), α-synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP), vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)8, VAMP7, and the protein phosphatase 1M regulatory subunit. We also observed partial colocalization between Syntaxin 6 and Syntaxin 7, between Syntaxin 6 and mVti1b, but not between Syntaxin 6 and the early endosomal t-SNARE Syntaxin 13. Based on these and data reported previously, we propose that Syntaxin 7/mVti1b/Syntaxin 6 may form discrete SNARE complexes with either VAMP7 or VAMP8 to regulate fusion events within the late endosomal pathway and that these events may play a critical role in melanogenesis.

The ability of discrete organelles to fuse in a highly specific way is central to all membrane-trafficking events and relies on a series of molecular events. One event is the formation of a protein complex between sets of molecules found within the transport vesicle (v-SNAREs)1 and the target membrane (t-SNAREs). Much of the work that has led to the formulation of this hypothesis has been performed in the mammalian synapse (1Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Here the R- or v-SNARE, VAMP2, forms a complex with two Q- or t-SNARE proteins, Syntaxin 1a and SNAP25. This ternary complex consists of a four-α-helical bundle containing one helix from both Syntaxin 1a and VAMP2 with the remaining two helices being contributed by SNAP25 (2Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). SNARE complexes that regulate traffic to the cell surface in both mammalian and yeast cells contain three distinct proteins, whereas most intracellular SNARE complexes appear to be comprised of four separate proteins: one v-SNARE and three t-SNAREs (3McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 4Fukuda R. McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Engel T. Nickel W. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For example, inSaccharomyces cerevisiae endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport is regulated by the Sed5p·Bos1p·Sec22p·Bet1p complex, whereas vacuolar transport is regulated by a complex comprising Vam3p·Vam7p·Vti1p·Nyv1p (3McNew J.A.

The Syntaxin isoform, or t-SNARE heavy chain (3McNew J.A. Parlati F. Fukuda R. Johnston R.J. Paz K. Paumet F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 2000; 407: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), associated with each complex appears to be highly specific to a particular vesicle transport step, whereas the light chain t-SNAREs associate with multiple complexes. Vti1p, for example, interacts with Syntaxin homologs involved in Golgi/endosome, intra-Golgi, vacuolar, and prevacuolar transport steps (5Fischer von Mollard G. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sequencing projects are revealing the existence of an ever increasing number of SNARE family members (6Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the yeast S. cerevisiae there are eight different Syntaxin-like proteins, and in mammalian cells, at least 20 have been identified to date (7Pelham H.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Weimbs T. Mostov K. Low S.H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 260-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A major challenge is to establish which transport steps each of these proteins regulates. This will require establishing the intracellular location of these proteins as well as their binding partners. Syntaxins 1, 2, 3, and 4 localize to the plasma membrane (9Bennett M.K.

Syntaxin 7 is localized to compartments within the endosomal system where it regulates transport between the late endosome and the lysosome (14Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M.

Cell. 2000; 11: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that Syntaxin 7 interacts with at least one v-SNARE, VAMP8 (14Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M. Parkinson E.J. Brooks D.A. Parton R.G. James D.E. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3137-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of VAMP8 has demonstrated a requirement for this v-SNARE in the homotypic fusion of both early endosomes and late endosomes (17Antonin W. Holroyd C. Tikkanen R. Honing S. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Another v-SNARE, VAMP7, has also been implicated in late endosomal transport (16Ward D.M. Pevsner J. Scullion M.A. Vaughn M. Kaplan J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Advani R.J. Yang B. Prekeris R. Lee K.C. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), but its relationship to Syntaxin 7 has not yet been explored. This highlights the need for a more thorough characterizaton of Syntaxin 7 binding partners. The aim of the present study was to identify Syntaxin 7-binding proteins using a biochemical approach. To this end, we took advantage of the fact that Syntaxin 7 is expressed at very high levels in the melanoma cell line, B16. Using B16 cells as a source of Syntaxin 7, we used an immunoprecipitation approach combined with mass spectrometry to identify mVti1b, Syntaxin 6, and α-SNAP as Syntaxin 7-binding proteins. In addition, we find that Syntaxin 7 forms a complex with both VAMP7 and VAMP8, suggesting that the t-SNARE Syntaxin 7 may regulate distinct fusion events within the endocytic pathway by associating with distinct subsets of partner SNARE proteins. B16 Melanoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Parsons (QIMR, Brisbane, Australia) and were cultured in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For immunoblot analysis, total membranes were prepared as follows. Cells were lysed by passage through a 27-gauge needle in HES buffer (20 mmHepes, 0.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) before centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in HES buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 1 h, after which insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 10 min. Triton X-100-soluble extracts of rat tissues, obtained from male Wistar rats, were prepared by homogenization of the relevant tissues in HES buffer containing protease inhibitors. Homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, after which insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 17,500 ×g for 10 min. Polyclonal antiserum against mouse Syntaxin 7 was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a chimeric protein consisting of the cytosolic domain of Syntaxin 7 fused to GST (pGST-Syn7a) (14Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M. Parkinson E.J. Brooks D.A. Parton R.G. James D.E. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3137-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against the GST portion of the antigen were removed by passing the antiserum over a column of GST linked to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). The flow-through from this column was subsequently passed over a second column made by coupling the GST-Syn7antigen to Affi-Gel. Syntaxin 7-specific antibodies were eluted from this column with 100 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl (pH 2.8). These affinity-purified antibodies were then titrated to pH 7.5 using Tris-HCl (pH 8). The VAMP8 antibodies have been described previously (14Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M. Parkinson E.J. Brooks D.A. Parton R.G. James D.E. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3137-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Antibodies to VAMP7 were raised against GST fusion protein containing the entire cytosolic portion of VAMP7, which was expressed from pPL815. Similarly, antibodies against Syntaxin 6 were raised by immunizing rabbits with a GST protein containing the entire cytosolic tail of this protein (pGST-Syn6; 14) or were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. A plasmid encoding the cytosolic tail of human Syntaxin 13 fused to GST and an antibody produced against this fusion protein were kindly provided by Dr. R. Teasdale (Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of Queensland). The EEA1 antibody was the generous gift of Dr. Ban Hock Toh (Monash Medical School, University of Melbourne, Australia). Antibodies against mVti1b (19Antonin W. Riedel D. von Mollard G.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5724-5732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. G. Fischer von Mollard (University of Gottingen, Germany). Antibodies against cytosolic domains of Syntaxin 4 and VAMP3 have been described previously (20Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S.

Membrane samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 1% (w/v) non-fat dried milk and then incubated with primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1% (w/v) non-fat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature at dilutions that were optimized for each antibody. Visualization of antibody-labeled bands was achieved with the use of horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and Supersignal Dura chemiluminescent substrate was from Pierce. Immunoblotting competition assays were performed by including the relevant GST fusion protein antigen (100 μg/ml) during incubation with the primary antibody. The GFP-Syn6 plasmid that encodes the full-length murine Syntaxin 6 fused to the C terminus of enhanced GFP (eGFP) was a kind gift from Dr. Jeffrey Pessin (University of Iowa) (21Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 70% confluence on glass coverslips and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. In some cases B16 cells were transiently transfected with the GFP-Syntaxin 6 vector using the LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). This plasmid generated a protein of the expected molecular mass (∼60 kDa) which could be specifically immunoblotted with antibodies specific for either Syntaxin 6 or GFP (data not shown). After fixation, cells were quenched for 5 min in 150 mm glycine, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. After blocking coverslips with 2.5% normal swine serum for 30 min at room temperature primary antibody incubations were performed in 1% normal swine serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, followed by an appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-labeled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were viewed using a 63×/1.4 Ziess oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope, equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal imaging system. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop™ (Adobe Systems Inc.) and assembled as indicated. Affinity matrices were prepared by first binding antibodies (affinity-purified anti-Syn7 antibodies with or without an excess of GST-Syn7 fusion protein and purified rabbit IgG antibodies) to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies were covalently cross-linked to protein A beads using dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce). Triton X-100-soluble membrane extracts prepared from B16 cells, which had been cultured for 7 days, were prepared as outlined above and incubated with antibody-coated beads for 1 h in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, and 0.5 mm EDTA. The beads were washed in the same buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Elution of bound proteins was achieved by boiling for 10 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 4% SDS. Proteins were separated on a 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel and visualized by staining with either silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Individual protein bands were excised and subjected to sequence analysis. In-gel proteolytic digestion (using 0.5 μg of trypsin) of resolved proteins was performed as described previously (22Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) coupled on-line with a capillary HPLC (Hewlett-Packard model 1090A) modified for capillary chromatography was used for peptide sequencing. The column used in this study was a 150 × 0.20-mm (inner diameter) capillary column (Brownlee RP-300, 7 μm C8) manufactured using a polyvinylidene difluoride end frit A 60-min linear gradient (flow rate 1.7 μl/min) was used from 0–100% B, where solvent A was 0.1% v/v aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile. The electrospray ionization parameters were as follows: spray voltage, 4.5 kV; sheath gas and auxiliary gas flow rates, 5 and 30 (arbitrary value), respectively; capillary temperature, 150 °C; capillary voltage, 20 V; and tube lens offset, 16 V. The sheath liquid used was 2-methoxyethanol (99.9% HPLC grade) delivered at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. The electron multiplier was set to −860 V. In both MS and MS/MS modes, the trap was allowed a maximum injection time of up to 200 ms. The automatic gain control parameter was turned on for all experiments, ensuring that the number of ions in the trap was automatically kept to a constant preset value. The range scanned in MS mode was 350–2,000 kDa, and in MS/MS the range varied according to the mass of the ion selected for MS/MS. After acquiring one scan in MS, the most intense ion in that spectrum above a threshold of 1 × 105 was isolated for subsequent zoom scan (to determine charge state), then collision-induced dissociation or MS/MS in the following scans. The dissociation energy for MS/MS was set to 55%. All spectra were recorded in centroid mode. The sequences of individual peptides were identified using the SEQUEST algorithm (incorporated into the Finnigan Xcalibur-Biomass software) (23Yates J.R.D. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Spectra not identified by SEQUEST were interpreted manually using de novo methods. A Syntaxin 7-specific antibody was raised against a bacterial fusion protein containing the cytosolic tail (residues 1–234) of Syntaxin 7 fused to GST. Antibodies that specifically recognize the Syntaxin 7 portion of this fusion protein were affinity purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” This antibody recognizes one band of molecular mass 40 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Immunolabeling of this band was completely inhibited in the presence of an excess of the GST-Syn7 antigen (lane 2). In contrast, a fusion protein consisting of the analogous region of Syntaxin 13 fused to GST had no significant effect on the recognition of this band (lane 3). In addition, the mobility of the polypeptide recognized by the Syntaxin 7 antibody was significantly different from the bands labeled with antibodies specific for either Syntaxin 13 or Syntaxin 6 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5). To validate further the specificity of the Syntaxin 7 antibody we performed immunofluorescence microscopy using B16 melanoma cells. The antibody labeled a tubulovesicular compartment that was concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell (Fig. 1 B). This labeling was not significantly different upon inclusion of excess GST-Syn13 fusion protein. However, in the presence of excess GST-Syn7 the immunolabeling was almost completely absent, consistent with the immunoblotting data (Fig. 1 A). Collectively, these data show that our Syntaxin 7 antibody is specific and does not recognize other closely related Syntaxin isoforms. We have shown previously that Syntaxin 7 is widely expressed in rodent tissues and that it regulates a membrane transport step within the late endosome/lysosomal system of mammalian cells (14Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M. Parkinson E.J. Brooks D.A. Parton R.G. James D.E. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3137-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In view of this function we reasoned that cell types that are specialized for late endosomal/lysosomal biogenesis might up-regulate the machinery that is involved in these transport steps. Melanocytes are a specialized cell type whose primary function is the biogenesis of melanosomes, which represent lysosome-like organelles (24Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion is our finding that the levels of the Syntaxin 7 protein in the B16 melanosome cell line is ∼10-fold higher than in all other tissues and cell lines tested (Fig. 2). In contrast, the level of Syntaxin 4, which localizes to the plasma membrane, was much more uniform across all tissues and cell types, including B16 cells. A similar uniformity was observed for Syntaxin 6 (Fig. 2) and Syntaxin 13 (data not shown) across these tissues and cell types. Intriguingly, VAMP8, a v-SNARE that has also been implicated in late endosomal transport (17Antonin W. Holroyd C. Tikkanen R. Honing S. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), is also expressed at very high levels in B16 cells compared with other tissues and cell lines (Fig. 2). The high levels of Syntaxin 7 which we observed in B16 cells gave us a good opportunity to find interacting proteins using a coimmunoprecipitation approach. The Syntaxin 7-specific antibody (Fig. 1) was covalently linked to protein A-Sepharose, forming an affinity matrix. This was used to immunoprecipitate Syntaxin 7-containing protein complexes from a B16 cell extract. Using a non-ionic detergent solubilized extract of B16 cells we were able to immunoprecipitate Syntaxin 7 with high efficiency and specificity (Fig. 3). Initially, to identify proteins that interact with Syntaxin 7, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 3 B). We were able to detect a number of proteins that coprecipitated with Syntaxin 7 under these experimental conditions (see first and fourth lanes). Most of these protein bands could not be detected when the immunoprecipitation was performed using a control IgG (second lane) or when the incubation with the Syntaxin 7 antibody was performed in the presence of excess recombinant GST-Syn7 (fifth lane). The most prominent bands detected were of average molecular mass 230, 130, 120, 90, 35, and 30 kDa. To identify these proteins we increased the scale of the immunoprecipitation procedure so that bands could be visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (see Fig.3 C). These bands were excised, and tryptic peptide products were sequenced using electrospray mass spectrometry. The sequences obtained are shown in Table I. Several of the bands yielded very clear sequence data and gave positive identities when these sequences were used for BLAST searching of the protein data base. The doublet at 130/120 kDa contained sequences corresponding to the protein phosphatase 110-kDa regulatory subunit (25Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Alessi D.R. Campbell D.G. Shanahan C. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and a tyrosine kinase associated protein known as BAP-135 (26Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In an effort to verify the presence of BAP-135 in the Syntaxin 7 immunoprecipitate B16 cells were incubated with pervanadate because this causes a marked stimulation of BAP-135 tyrosine phosphorylation in B cells (26Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, immunoblotting of the Syntaxin 7 immunoprecipitate, obtained from these cells, using a phosphotyrosine antibody failed to reveal any detectable product corresponding to BAP-135 (data not shown). Of particular interest, we were able to detect a number of peptide sequences in the Syntaxin 7 immunoprecipitate corresponding to Syntaxin 7, α-SNAP (27Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), mVti-1b (GenBank NP058080), and VAMP8 (28Wong S.H. Zhang T. Xu Y. Subramaniam V.N. Griffiths G. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The t-SNARE, Syntaxin 6, was also identified in the same band that contained α-SNAP, migrating with an average molecular mass of 32 kDa. The abundant band at 55 kDa corresponded to IgG. None of the other bands that were identified using this approach yielded any detectable peptide sequences.Table IPeptide sequences predicted from mass spectrometer analysisProteinSequenceMolecular masskDaPredictedMeasuredProtein phosphatase 1 M 110-kDa regulatory subunit, Rattus sp. aortaAQLHDTNmELTDLK109.6120YDSSSTSSSDRYDSLLGRRSTQGVTLTDLQEAEKVGQTAFDVADEDILGYLEELQKKBAP-135 homolog, Mus musculusTPTQTNGSNVPFKPR110.3115Syntaxin 7,M. musculusETDKYIKEFGSLPTTPSEQR29.835EKNLVSWESQTQPQVQVQDEEITEDDLRDRLVAEFTTSLTNFQKQLEADIMDINEIFKDLGMMIHEQGDmIDSIEANVESAEVHVQQANQQLSRITQcSVEIQREFGSLPTTPSEQRTLNQLGTPQDSPELRac-SYTPGIGGDSAQLAQRYIKEFGSLPTTPSEQRA-soluble SNAP, M. musculusAIAHYEQSADYYKGEESNSSANK33.933LLEAHEEQNVDSYTEAVKHDAATcFVDAGNAFKKADPQEAINcLMRAIDIYEQVGTSAmDSPLLKLLEAHEEQNVDSYTEAVKEYDSISRNSQSFFSGLFGGSSKLAVQKYEELFPAFSDSRHHISIAEIYETELVDVEKLDQWLTTMLLRSyntaxin 6, M. musculus (low level product)IGGELEEQAVmLDDFSHELESTQSR29.032Putative v-SNARE Vtilb, M. musculusEFGSLPTTPSEQR29.830TLNQLGTPQDSPELRLVAEFTTSLTNFQKQLEADImDINEIFKVAMP8, M. musculusNKTEDLEATSEHFK11.415Immunoprecipitated proteins visualized in Fig. 3 were subjected to MS analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” Sequence matches for the tryptic peptides obtained.

Also shown is the predicted molecular mass of the complete matched protein and the apparent molecular mass by SDS-PAGE of the excised band from which those peptide matches were derived. To verify the identity of these proteins as Syntaxin 7-interacting partners we immunoblotted immunoprecipitates obtained from B16 cells using antibodies specific for a variety of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, Syntaxin 6, VAMP8, and mVti1b were all enriched in the Syntaxin 7 immunoprecipitate to almost the same extent as Syntaxin 7. None of these proteins was present when the immunoprecipitation was performed using preimmune serum-coated protein A beads (Fig. 4, second lane). The immunoprecipitation efficiency of Syntaxin 7 was ∼50% (Fig. 4, compare firstand third lanes). In the case of Syntaxin 6, VAMP8, and mVti1b ∼20%, 20, and 10% of each protein was coprecipitated with Syntaxin 7, indicating that each of these proteins was highly enriched in the Syntaxin 7 complex suggesting that they likely form stable SNARE complexes in vivo. It has been reported recently that another v-SNARE, VAMP7, can play a role in the delivery of epidermal growth factor to a degradative compartment, most likely the late endosomal/lysosomal system, where VAMP7 is localized (18Advani R.J. Yang B. Prekeris R. Lee K.C. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although we did not detect this protein in the Syntaxin 7 immunoprecipitate by MS/MS we were able to detect coprecipitation of VAMP7 with Syntaxin 7 by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). VAMP7 was enriched in the Syntaxin 7 immunoprecipitate to the same extent as VAMP8 (Fig. 4). Although a significant proportion of VAMP7 was found in the Syntaxin 7 immunoprecipitate, our inability to detect it by MS/MS raised the possibility that it may be expressed at lower abundance than other proteins. We also immunoblotted these fractions with antibodies specific for Syntaxin 4 and VAMP3 to investigate the specificity of the immunoprecipitatio"
https://openalex.org/W2150037328,"We have cloned murine genomic and complementary DNA that is equivalent to the human ABO gene. The murine gene consists of at least six coding exons and spans at least 11 kilobase pairs. Exon-intron boundaries are similar to those of the human gene. Unlike human A and B genes that encode two distinct glycosyltransferases with different donor nucleotide-sugar specificities, the murine gene is a cis-AB gene that encodes an enzyme with both A and B transferase activities, and thiscis-AB gene prevails in the mouse population. Cloning of the murine AB gene may be helpful in establishing a mouse model system to assess the functionality of the ABO genes in the future.

Cloning of the murine AB gene may be helpful in establishing a mouse model system to assess the functionality of the ABO genes in the future. Histo-blood group A/B antigens are clinically important antigens in blood transfusion and organ transplantation. These antigens are oligosaccharide antigens whose immunodominant structures are defined as GalNAc α1→3 (Fuc α1→2) Gal- and Gal α1→3 (Fuc α1→2) Gal- for A and B antigen, respectively. Functional alleles at the ABO locus encode enzymes that catalyze the final step of synthesis. A alleles encode for A transferase, which transfers the GalNAc residues from the UDP-GalNAc nucleotide-sugar to the galactose residue of the acceptor H substrates defined by Fuc α1→2 Gal-. B alleles encode for B transferase that transfers the galactose residue from UDP-galactose to the same H substrates. O alleles are nonfunctional, null alleles. During the past decade, we have been studying the molecular genetic basis of the histo-blood group ABO system (1Yamamoto F. Vox Sang. 2000; 78: 91-103PubMed Google Scholar). From a human gastric carcinoma cell line cDNA library, we were able to clone human A transferase cDNA (2Yamamoto F. Marken J. Tsuji T. White T. Clausen H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1146-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based on the partial amino acid sequence of the soluble form of A transferase purified from human lung (3Clausen H. White T. Takio K. Titani K. Stroud M. Holmes E. Karkov J. Thim L. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1139-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using cross-hybridization with A transferase cDNA probes, we then cloned B transferase cDNA and nonfunctional O allelic cDNA from cDNA libraries made with RNA from colon adenocarcinoma cell lines that exhibited different ABO phenotypes (4Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Possible allele-specific mutations were identified. Four amino acid substitutions were discovered between A and B transferases. O alleles were more homologous to A alleles than to B alleles. A single base deletion was found near the N terminus of the coding sequence in most of the O alleles, which caused the codon frame to shift. This resulted in a truncated protein without glycosyltransferase activity. In addition to the three major alleles (A 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionα-S-dGTP2′-deoxyguanosine-5′-O-(1-thio-triphosphate)α-S-dCTP2′-deoxycytidine-5′-O-(1-thio-triphosphate)RACErapid amplification of cDNA ends, B, and O), we also identified mutations that modified the enzymatic activity by determination of the partial nucleotide sequences of subgroup alleles (A2, A3, Ax, and B3) (5Yamamoto F.

Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We also elucidated the molecular mechanisms of two phenomena named cis-AB and B(A) (7Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Harris T. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Kominato Y. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Ishimoto S. Nishida S. Shima M. Fujimura Y. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the incidence was low, another type of O allele was discovered that lacked the single base deletion but contained an amino acid substitution at the residue crucial for nucleotide-sugar recognition/binding (9Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Bromilow I.M. Duguid J.K. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although no functional analyses have been performed to disprove polymorphism, others have reported additional alterations (10Ogasawara K. Yabe R. Uchikawa M. Saitou N. Bannai M. Nakata K. Takenaka M.

The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of a variety of ABO alleles are posted on the Blood Group Antigen Gene Mutation Database developed by Blumenfeld and colleagues (available on the World Wide Web). polymerase chain reaction 2′-deoxyguanosine-5′-O-(1-thio-triphosphate) 2′-deoxycytidine-5′-O-(1-thio-triphosphate) rapid amplification of cDNA ends A/B antigens are not restricted to humans but are widely present in nature (16Kabat E.A. Blood Group Substances: Their Chemistry and Immunochemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1956Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the presence/absence of homologous sequence(s) in the genomes of other species of organisms (17Kominato Y. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Russell M. Hakomori S. Yamamoto F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hybridization of zoo blots, using the radiolabeled human A transferase cDNA probe, showed weak signals in chicken genomic DNA but strong signals, comparable with the signal detected in human DNA, in genomic DNA from mice and other mammals. No signals were detected in genomic DNA from lower species of organisms in the evolutionary tree. We next determined the partial nucleotide sequences of the primate ABO genes (17Kominato Y. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Russell M. Hakomori S. Yamamoto F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The glycosyltransferases responsible for A or B phenotypes in primates were shown to conserve amino acid substitutions corresponding to codons 266 and 268 in humans. A similar study was also reported by others (18Martinko J.M. Vincek V. Klein D. Klein J. Immunogenetics. 1993; 37: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Through comparative sequence analyses of the ABO genes from humans and apes, we and others proposed a convergent hypothesis of evolution that ABO genes arose from independent mutations after the speciation of humans and apes (19Saitou N. Yamamoto F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20O'Huigin C. Sato A. Klein J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 101: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). No apparent disadvantages are recognized among any of the phenotypes involving the ABO polymorphism. Hemolytic disease of newborns may be a natural selection against specific combinations of blood groups between the mother and fetus. However, serious incompatibility cases are rare with ABO, since the natural antibodies against A and B antigens are mostly IgM and do not cross the placenta. Although some anti-A, B antibodies are IgG and capable of crossing the placenta, A/B antigens are not well developed in fetuses. Therefore, little damage is done. There should be some reason for the existence of ABO polymorphism in the population. It has been speculated that the possible role of the ABO system is to provide resistance against infection (21Pittiglio D.H. Wallace M.F. Gibbs F.L. Genetics and Biochemistry of A, B, H, and Lewis Antigens. American Association of Blood Banks, Arlington, VA1986: 1-56Google Scholar). Actually, Leb(Fucα1→2 Gal β1→3 (Fuc α1→4) GlcNAc-), an ABO-related structure, was demonstrated to be the receptor for a Gram-negative bacillus, Helicobacter pylori, a causative agent for gastritis, peptic ulcer, and possibly gastric cancer (22Boren T. Falk P. Roth K.A. Larson G. Normark S. Science. 1993; 262: 1892-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). A and B transferases modify the Leb structure into ALeband BLeb structures, which H. pylori does not bind to in vitro. This may explain the earlier observation that group O individuals have a higher incidence of stomach ulcer than individuals in any other group (21Pittiglio D.H. Wallace M.F. Gibbs F.L. Genetics and Biochemistry of A, B, H, and Lewis Antigens. American Association of Blood Banks, Arlington, VA1986: 1-56Google Scholar). Antibodies against the α1→3 Gal epitope (Gal α1→3 Gal-) were demonstrated experimentally to block the interspecies infection of certain retroviruses (23Takeuchi Y. Porter C.D. Strahan K.M. Preece A.F. Gustafsson K. Cosset F.L. Weiss R.A. Collins M.K. Nature. 1996; 379: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). From this result, anti-A and anti-B antibodies have been suspected to play a role in inhibiting the epidemics of certain infections. Some type of selection based on the advantage/disadvantage of having antigens/antibodies may have been operating at the ABO locus to secure the survival of species from extinction during evolution. The report that an anti-A monoclonal antibody neutralized human immunodeficiency virus particles produced by lymphocytes from group A individuals but not from group B or O individuals (24Arendrup M. Hansen J.E. Clausen H. Nielsen C. Mathiesen L.R. Nielsen J.O. AIDS. 1991; 5: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) may support this hypothesis. To experimentally assess the functionality of the ABO genes, establishing an animal model is critical. As an initial step, we cloned and characterized the murine ABO gene equivalent. Mouse genomic DNA library (ML1044j), which was constructed by replacing the internal BamHI–BamHI stuffer fragment of the λ EMBL3 SP6/T7 vector with MboI-partially cleaved genomic DNA fragments of the BALB/c strain of mouse, was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit and an AdvanTage PCR1 cloning kit were also from CLONTECH. A GeneClean kit was purchased from Bio101 (La Jolla, CA), and pT7T3α18 plasmid vector, α-S-dGTP, α-S-dCTP, and S-300 MicroSpin columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. LipofectAMINE was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [14C]UDP-GalNAc, [14C]UDP-galactose, and [α-32P]dCTP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and 2′-fucosyllactose was from Oxford Glycosystems (Rosedale, NY) and from Calbiochem. Murine anti-A and anti-B monoclonal antibody mixtures were purchased from Ortho Diagnostic Systems (Raritan, NJ). BiotinylatedUlex europaeus agglutinin I, Vectastain Elite ABC kit, and 4-chloro-1-naphthol substrate kit were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA), and EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin was purchased from Pierce. Bluescript SKM13+ vector, Prime-It II kit, Duralose-UV membranes, and frozen competent XL1-blue strain ofEscherichia coli bacteria were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Restriction endonucleases and nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were from Life Technologies, New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. dRhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kits and BigDye cycle sequencing kits were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Under low stringency conditions, ∼1 million plaques from the mouse genomic DNA library were screened using a human A transferase cDNA probe by the plaque hybridization method (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probe was prepared by the random hexamer primer method, using a Prime-It II kit and [α-32P]dCTP (26Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). After four rounds of screening, individual clones were isolated. Phage DNA was prepared, cleaved with restriction endonucleases, gel-electrophoresed, and Southern transferred. Hybridization was then performed to construct restriction enzyme cleavage maps. DNA from MABOφ16 phage clone was cleaved with HindIII andSalI and subcloned into the Bluescript SKM13+ vector. Nested deletion constructs were prepared by the ExoIII-mung bean nuclease method (27Chang D.W. Tartof K.D. Yeung A.T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 127: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Where no unique 3′-overhang restriction sites were available, the thioderivative fill-in reactions were performed with Klenow enzyme using α-S-dGTP and α-S-dCTP beforeExoIII treatment. After transformation of E. coliXL1-blue strain, plasmid DNA was prepared from individual clones and analyzed for insert size. The nucleotide sequences were determined by Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method using the dRhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences were aligned using Lasergene SeqMan II sequencing project management software. RNA from the CMT-93 rectal carcinoma cell line (ATCC 223-CCL), established from a C57BL strain of mouse, was prepared and used for the 5′-RACE experiments (29Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). We followed the Marathon cDNA amplification protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the first strand of cDNA was synthesized from RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Marathon cDNA synthesis primer. After the second strand was synthesized with RNase H, E. coli DNA polymerase I, andE. coli DNA ligase, the Marathon cDNA adaptor was ligated. Nested PCR was performed, first with AP1 adaptor primer and MY-1 primer and then with AP2 and MY-2 primers. AP1 and AP2 primers were provided in the kit. The nucleotide sequences of MY-1 and MY-2 primers were complementary to the sequences in the coding region of the murine ABO genes. Their sequences were as follows: 5′-TTAGTTTCTGATTGCCTGATGGTCCTTGGGCAC and 5′-TCATGCCACACAGGCTCAATGCCGT for MY-1 and 2, respectively. PCR products were electrophoresed through a 3% agarose gel, and the DNA was gel-purified using the GeneClean kit. DNA fragments were then ligated with pT-Adv vector from the AdvanTage PCR cloning kit by the T-A cloning method. Nucleotide sequences of the inserts were determined. TheBamHI–XhoI fragment containing the last coding exon of the murine ABO gene was first subcloned from a murine ABO genomic clone, MABOφ11, into the pT7T3α18 plasmid vector. TheBamHI site was located in the intron preceding the last coding exon of the murine ABO gene. The XhoI site was in the λ EMBL3 SP6/T7 vector next to the BamHI site used to accommodate genomic DNA. This construct was then digested withSstI and SnaBI. The SstI site was within the pT7T3α18 plasmid vector, and the SnaBI site was located downstream of the stop codon of the mouse ABO gene coding sequence. The SstI–SnaBI fragment containing the coding sequence in the last coding exon of the mouse ABO gene was then isolated. The human B transferase expression construct with intron, pBBBB (30Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was cleaved with BamHI, blunt-ended by the Klenow filling-in reaction, and then digested with SstI. TheSstI site was in the intron preceding coding exon 7 of the human ABO gene; BamHI was in the eukaryotic expression vector (originally pSG-5). The SstI-blunt (BamHI) vector fragment containing the human B transferase cDNA sequence of exons 1–6 was then ligated to the mouseSstI–SnaBI fragment to produce the human-mouse chimeric gene (pHuman-mouse chimera). A murine cDNA eukaryotic expression construct was then constructed by replacing theEcoRI–AflII fragment from the chimeric construct with the EcoRI–AflII fragment from a 5′-RACE clone in the pT-Adv vector. The EcoRI site of the clone was in the plasmid and located 5′ upstream of the cDNA end. TheAflII was in the last coding exon. The EcoRI site in the pSG-5 vector was located downstream of the SV40 early promoter and upstream of the human cDNA sequence. The resultant construct (pMouse) contained the entire coding sequence of the mouse ABO gene cDNA. Plasmid DNA was prepared by the SDS-alkaline method (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The HeLa cell line derived from a human adenocarcinoma of uterus was used as a recipient of transient DNA transfection analyses. The HeLa cells express H antigens on their cell surfaces and have been successfully used in similar transfection experiments of A and B transferase expression constructs (5Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10515-10520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Following the manufacturer's protocol, we used LipofectAMINE for transfection. Seventy-two hours after transfection, the cells were washed and harvested. Cell pellets were then lysed in buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm sodium cacodylate, 10 mm MnCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100). A/B transferase activity was determined by measuring the transfer of carbon-14 from [14C]UDP-GalNAc or [14C]UDP-galactose to the acceptor substrate 2′-fucosyllactose, as described previously (31Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10515-10520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After incubation, the reaction products were separated from unincorporated nucleotide-sugars by AG1-X8 anion exchange column chromatography. The incorporation of radioactivity was determined using a scintillation counter. Murine submaxillary glands were used for the expression analyses of A/B transferases. A and B transferase activities were measured by the incorporation of carbon-14 from [14C]UDP-GalNAc or [14C]UDP-galactose to 2′-fucosyllactose. Although the same reaction conditions were used, the reaction product was separated from the precursor substrate by paper chromatography rather than column chromatography. Genomic DNA was prepared by the proteinase K-SDS method and used to amplify a DNA fragment derived from the murine ABO gene. The names and nucleotide sequences of the primers used were as follows: SN-16, 5′-GAGACTGCAGAACAACACTT; SN-17, 5′-CAATGCCGTTGGCCTTGTC. The PCR-amplified DNA fragments were purified through chromatography using S-300 MicroSpin columns and subjected to direct DNA sequencing reactions with the BigDye cycle sequencing kit. After the sequencing reaction, DNA was purified and then analyzed using an ABI Prism 377 automatic DNA sequencer. Expression of the ABH antigens in murine submaxillary glands was examined immunologically using extracts spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. Murine anti-A and anti-B monoclonal antibody mixtures were biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After biotinylation, the unincorporated biotin was removed using Microcon 30 centrifugal filter devices. The submaxillary glands from C57BL and ICR strains of mice were homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 mNaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.1% SDS. The extract was then spotted onto a Duralose-UV membrane. As controls, the extracts similarly obtained from human colon adenocarcinoma SW48 cells (AB phenotype) and from group A and O porcine submaxillary glands were also spotted on the membrane. After drying for 15 min, the membrane was treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and 0.3% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. After washing, the membrane was incubated overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. The membrane was then cut into four pieces, which were individually incubated with either biotinylated murine anti-A monoclonal antibody mixture, biotinylated murine anti-B monoclonal antibody mixture, biotinylated Ulex europaeus agglutinin I, or bovine serum albumin (negative control) for 1 h at room temperature. The filters were washed separately and then incubated collectively with the Elite ABC reagents for 15 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the membranes were treated with 4-chloro-1-naphthol substrate for color development. Certain mammalian cells exhibit α1→3 Gal epitopes. The cDNA encoding α1,3-galactosyltransferase that synthesizes this epitope was cloned from cow (32Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van Tunen A.J. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14290-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse (33Larsen R.D. Rajan V.P. Ruff M.M. Kukowska-Latallo J. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gu F. Preece A.F. Gustavsson I. Andersson L. Gustafsson K. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Humans do not exhibit this epitope but possess the antibody against the epitope in sera (36Galili U. Macher B.A. Buehler J. Shohet S.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Human sequence corresponding to this gene was shown to be a pseudogene due to frameshifts and nonsense mutations (32Joziasse D.H.

Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A/B transferases utilize the galactose substrate with fucose, whereas α1,3-galactosyltransferase utilizes the substrate without fucose. ABO genes and α1,3-galactosyltransferase genes share significant homology at both the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence levels (30Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloned canine cDNA encoding Forssman glycolipid synthetase (UDP-GalNAc:globoside α1,3-N-acetyl-d-galactosaminyltransferase) also exhibited sequence homology (38Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, these genes are believed to have derived from the same ancestral gene and constitute the ABO gene family. Southern hybridization experiments of murine genomic DNA showed different banding patterns when murine α1,3-galactosyltransferase cDNA probe and human A transferase cDNA probe were used (17Kominato Y. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Russell M. Hakomori S. Yamamoto F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33Larsen R.D. Rajan V.P. Ruff M.M. Kukowska-Latallo J. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the ABO gene equivalent was assumed to exist in the mouse genome (17Kominato Y. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Russell M. Hakomori S. Yamamoto F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Results from our cloning experiments of the murine ABO gene described here concluded that mice actually do possess an ABO gene equivalent. We cloned the genomic DNA sequence encompassing most of the murine ABO structural gene. By screening 1 million phage plaques from a murine genomic DNA library, we obtained a total of nine independent clones that hybridized with the human A transferase cDNA probe. A preliminary mapping showed that two phage clones named MABOφ11 and MABOφ16 contained the entire coding sequence in the last coding exon. Since the MABOφ16 clone contained the sequence farther upstream, this clone was used for the nucleotide sequence determination. The MABOφ11 clone containing the farther downstream sequence was used to construct a human-mouse ABO gene chimeric expression construct as well as a murine gene expression construct. We sequenced the entire insert in the MABOφ16 clone (∼11.2 kilobase pairs) with more than 99.9% accuracy. Almost all of the coding sequence was contained in the sequenced region. The exon-intron boundaries were determined and are shown in Fig.1. Fig. 1, A and B, represents two probable splicing patterns, although other possibilities still exist because the sequence encoding the first few amino acid residues has not yet been identified. There are six coding exons in Fig. 1 A and seven in Fig. 1 B. Approximately 4.0 kilobase pairs and 70 base pairs upstream of the splicing acceptor site of coding exon 2 (cEXON 2) in Fig. 1 A, there was a CTCAGAG sequence and a TGAATCTCAG sequence, respectively. These sequences may be portions of the coding sequence, since they are found upstream in the cDNA preceding the sequence in cEXON 2. Fig.1 B depicts the case where GAATCTCAG of the latter TGAATCTCAG sequence represents the sequence in the preceding exon. In that case, the acceptor site of cEXON 3 needs to shift 2 nucleotides upstream, which would break up the GT-AG rule of splice junctions. We determined the entire nucleotide sequence contained in the MABOφ16 clone, which included ∼5.0 kilobase pairs of sequence upstream of the splicing acceptor site of cEXON2 in Fig. 1 A. No sequence corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region was found. Therefore, the promoter region of the murine ABO genes must reside farther upstream. The sequence corresponding to human coding exons 3 and 4 was found in one exon in the mouse gene. However, the number of amino acid residues (19 amino acids) was much smaller than that of human exons 3 and 4 combined (35 amino acids). Further studies are needed, since there may be an alternative splicing that would divide this small exon into two smaller exons with an intron in between. The entire insert sequence in the MABOφ16 clone and the entire cDNA sequence have been deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (accession numbersAB041038 and AB041039). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences in the coding region of the murine cDNA were aligned with those of human A1-1 (A101) allele (accession number AF134412 in GenBankTM) by combining the Clustal method (40Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar) and the J. Hein method (41Hein J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 626-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) using the MegAlign software. Results are shown in Fig. 1. Especially high homology was observed in the coding sequence in the last two coding exons. The percentages of identical nucleotide and amino acid residues in the last two coding exons were 78% (642/822) and 81% (222/273) between the two species, respectively. The amino acid sequence of the murine gene was also aligned with the amino acid sequences of human A and B transferases, mouse α1,3-galactosyltransferase, and canine Forssman glycolipid synthetase. Results are shown in Fig.2 A. The percentages of the identical amino acid residues of the coding sequences in the last two coding exons are 47% (127 of 272) between the mouse ABO and α1,3-galactosyltransferase genes and 49% (132 of 272) between the mouse ABO gene and the dog Forssman synthetase gene. Fig. 2 Bhighlights the amino acid sequences of the region important for the recognition/binding of nucleotide-sugars. The phylogenetic tree is shown in Fig. 2 C. The cloned mouse gene was evolutionarily mapped closest to the human ABO gene. It was also mapped closer to the canine Forssman gene than the murine α1,3-galactosyltransferase gene. We examined whether the isolated mouse ABO gene sequence could encode a functional glycosyltransferase. We first constructed a human-mouse chimeric construct in an eukaryotic expression vector pSG-5.

https://openalex.org/W2020140319,"We have previously shown coexpression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor Met in the invasive tumor front of human breast carcinomas. We have also demonstrated secretion of HGF, constitutive activation of Met, and increased invasion in a murine breast carcinoma cell line, SP1. These observations suggest the presence of an HGF autocrine loop in some breast carcinoma cells, which confers increased survival, growth, and invasiveness during tumor progression and metastasis. c-Src tyrosine kinase, which is critical in regulating the expression of many genes, is activated in SP1 carcinoma cells, as well as in most human breast cancers. We therefore examined the role of c-Src kinase in HGF expression in breast carcinoma cells. Expression of activated c-Src in SP1 cells increased transcription from the HGF promoter and expression of HGF mRNA and protein, while dominant negative c-Src had the opposite effect. Using deletion analysis, we showed that the region between −254 and −70 base pairs was required for c-Src responsiveness of the HGF promoter. This region contains two putative consensus sequences (at −110 and −149 base pairs) for the Stat3 transcription factor, which bind protein complexes containing Stat3 (but not Stat1, -5A, or -5B). Coexpression of activated c-Src and Stat3 synergistically induced strong HGF promoter activity in SP1 cells, as well as in a nonmalignant epithelial cell line, HC11 (HGF negative). c-Src kinase activity correspondingly increased the tyrosine 705 phosphorylation and DNA binding affinity of Stat3 (but not Stat1, -5A, or -5B). Collectively, our data indicate a cooperative effect of c-Src kinase and Stat3 in the activation of HGFtranscription and protein expression in breast carcinoma cells. This process may be important in overriding the strong repression ofHGF expression in nonmalignant epithelium, and thereby promote tumorigenesis.

This process may be important in overriding the strong repression ofHGF expression in nonmalignant epithelium, and thereby promote tumorigenesis. Scatter factor, also known as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),1 is a multifunctional cytokine. Through binding to its receptor (Met), HGF can induce cell survival (1Qiao H. Saulnier R. Patrzykat A.

Disruption of HGF expression in mice results in lethality in early development (5Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W. Sharpe M. Gherardi E. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), while deletion of Met causes underdevelopment of limb buds (6Bladt F. Riethmacher D. Isenmann S. Aguzzi A. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 376: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). During development of the mammary gland, HGF is expressed by stromal cells, whereas epithelial cells express Met, but not HGF (7Andermarcher E. Surani M.A. Gherardi E. Dev. Genet. 1996; 18: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Paracrine stimulation of normal breast epithelium with HGF, in cooperation with other growth factors (e.g. neuregulin), promotes branching morphogenesis (8Yang Y.M. Spitzer E. Meyer D. Sachs M. Niemann C. Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific suppression of HGF expression in normal epithelial cells provides a tightly controlled regulation of mammary ductal morphogenesis (9Liu Y. Beedle A.B. Lin L. Bell A.W. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7046-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast to normal breast epithelium, HGF and Met are frequently overexpressed in breast carcinomas (10Ghoussoub R.A.D. Dillon D.A. D'Aquila T. Rimm B.E. Fearon E.R. Rimm D.L.

This high level of HGF and Met expression has been identified as a possible independent predictor of poor survival in breast cancer patients (11Yamashita J. Ogawa M. Yamashita S. Nomura K. Kuramoto M. Saishoji T. Shin S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1630-1633PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously shown that invasive human carcinoma cells coexpress HGF and Met, particularly at the migrating tumor front (12Tuck A.B. Park M. Sterns E.E. Boag A. Elliott B.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 225-232PubMed Google Scholar). We have also found that breast carcinoma cell lines frequently express HGF and Met, whereas most nonmalignant epithelial cell lines express Met, but not HGF. 2W. Hung, J. Gin, and B. Elliott, unpublished results.2W. Hung, J. Gin, and B. Elliott, unpublished results. Furthermore, overexpression of HGF or a constitutively active mutant form of Met (Tpr-Met) in transgenic mice (15Liang T.J. Reid A.E. Xavier R. Cardiff R.D. Wang T.C. J. Clin.

Together, these results suggest that establishment of an autocrine HGF loop and sustained activation of the Met signal transduction pathway in carcinoma cells may promote tumor progression. However, the mechanisms leading to aberrant expression of HGF in carcinoma cells are not known. A number of signaling molecules, such as c-Src (19Rahimi N. Hung W. Saulnier R. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), Grb2/Ras (17Fixman E.D. Holgado-Madruga M. Nguyen L. Kamikura D.M. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J.

Raptis L. Rossiter J.P. Tremblay E. Elliott B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 123-133PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to be part of the HGF/Met signaling pathway. Activation of Met through binding of HGF causes autophosphorylation of two specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor tyrosine kinase (20Fixman E. Fournier T. Kamikura D. Naujokas M. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13116-13122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These phosphorylated tyrosine residues act as multifunctional docking sites that bind the SH2 domain of specific cytoplasmic signaling molecules and causes their activation. The c-Src nonreceptor tyrosine kinase is expressed in many cell types, and its activity is increased in response to HGF and binding to Met (19Rahimi N. Hung W. Saulnier R. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Increased activation of the tyrosine kinase c-Src occurs in many human cancer cells, and c-Src plays a critical role in breast cancer. Overexpression of an activated form of c-Src in transgenic mice induces mammary hyperplasia (21Webster M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, c-Src kinase is required in polyoma middle T-induced mammary tumorigenesis in transgenic mice (22Guy C.T. Muthuswamy S.K. Cardiff R.D. Soriano P. Muller W.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that c-Src kinase is constitutively activated in a mouse breast carcinoma cell line, SP1, which expresses both HGF and tyrosine-phosphorylated Met and which exhibits spontaneous invasion through matrigel (19Rahimi N.

Furthermore, c-Src kinase activity is required for HGF-dependent cell motility and anchorage-independent growth of SP1 cells (19Rahimi N. Hung W. Saulnier R. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings indicate that c-Src kinase is an important requirement, but is not sufficient, for mammary tumorigenesis. Activation of c-Src kinase can lead to increased expression of many genes, including growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (25Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1629-1635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that elevated c-Src activity can promote increased HGF expression and the establishment of an HGF autocrine loop in SP1 cells. We observed that the c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 causes a 2-fold reduction in HGF transcription in SP1 cells. In addition, expression of a dominant negative mutant of c-Src (SRC-RF) in SP1 cells leads to similar levels of reduction in HGF mRNA and functional protein. Using deletion mutants of the HGFpromoter, we have located a region (between −254 and −70) of theHGF promoter responsive to increased c-Src kinase activity in SP1 cells. This region contains two putative consensus binding sites for Stat3. Stat3 is a transcription factor originally described as the target of interferon receptors (28Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), but recent reports have indicated that Stat3 can be activated by c-Src kinase via platelet-derived growth factor (29Wang Y. Wharton W. Garcia R. Kraker A.J. Jove R. Pledger W. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2075-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and HGF receptors (30Boccaccio C. Ando M. Tamagnome L. Bardelli A. Michieli P. Battistini C. Comoglio P. Nature. 1998; 391: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and is important in mammary differentiation (30Boccaccio C. Ando M. Tamagnome L. Bardelli A. Michieli P. Battistini C. Comoglio P. Nature. 1998; 391: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the role of Stat3 in c-Src-dependent regulation of HGF transcription. The results indicate that while expression of Stat3 alone increasedHGF promoter activity, simultaneous expression of Stat3 and activated c-Src led to strong cooperative activation of HGFtranscription in both nonmalignant epithelial and carcinoma cells. Expression of mutant c-Src kinases in breast carcinoma cells altered both the tyrosine phosphorylation status and DNA binding activity of Stat3. While activated c-Src induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity, a dominant negative mutant of c-Src reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding. Together these data suggest that c-Src kinase and Stat3 act cooperatively in the activation of HGF expression in breast carcinoma cells, and may be important in overriding the strong repression of HGF expression in nonmalignant epithelial cells. Rabbit anti-c-Src IgG was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody EC10 against chicken c-Src was a gift from Dr. S. Parsons. Rabbit anti-sheep IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Sheep anti-HGF IgG was a gift from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Rabbit anti-HGF antibody was generated against recombinant glutathioneS-transferase-HGF-(1–120) protein in our laboratory at Queen's University, this antibody recognizes only the N-terminal portion of HGF (data not shown). Anti-Stat1, -Stat3, -Stat5A, and -Stat5B and anti-phospho-Stat3 (Y705) antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). c-Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). c-Src expression plasmids were constructed by subcloning activated (Y527F) and dominant negative (K295R,Y527F) chicken c-src cDNAs (gift from Drs. J. Brugge and D. Shalloway) into the EcoRI site of DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment)-treated pBabePuro plasmid to generate pBabe Y527F and pBabe Src-RF. A reporter construct containing the full-length HGF promoter region fused to luciferase (2.7 HGF-luc) was constructed by ligating theHindIII/XbaI fragment (treated with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment)) of 2.8 HGF-CAT (gift from Dr. R. Zarnegar) into the HindIII site of pGL2-Basic (Promega), also treated with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). Further deletions were constructed by cutting 2.7 HGF-luc with SmaI,SacI, and BglII, followed by re-ligation to generate 0.5 HGF-luc, 0.3 HGF-luc, and 0.1 HGF-luc, respectively. The 1.2 HGF-luc was constructed by ligating the 1.4-kb SalI fragment from 2.7 HGF-luc into the XhoI site of pGL2-Basic. An internal deletion mutant 0.5Δ HGF-luc was constructed by digestion of 0.5 HGF-luc with PvuII/BglII and treatment with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) before re-ligation. The Δ1 HGF-luc was constructed by ligating the SmaI fragment of 2.7 HGF-luc into the same site of 0.5Δ HGF-luc. The Δ2 HGF-luc was constructed by ligating the SmaI fragment of 2.7 HGF-luc into 0.8 HGF-luc. The ΔΔ HGF-luc was made by ligating theSmaI fragment of Δ2 HGF-luc into the same site of 0.5Δ HGF-luc. For normalization of transfection efficiency of each sample, pSG5βgal (a gift from Dr. M. Petkovich) or pCHCβgal (a gift from Dr. F. Kern) (31McLeskey S.W. Kurebayashi J. Honig S.F. Zwiebel J.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2168-2177PubMed Google Scholar), which expresses β-galactosidase under the control of SV40 and cytomegalovirus promoters, respectively, was used. The SP1 tumor cell line is derived from a spontaneous poorly metastatic murine mammary intraductal adenocarcinoma, and expresses both HGF and Met. The characterization of the SP1 cell line has been described previously (19Rahimi N. Hung W. Saulnier R. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Rahimi N. Tremblay E. McAdam L. Park M. Schwall R. Elliott B.E.

HC11 is a mammary epithelial cell line (32Doppler W. Groner B. Ball R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, insulin (5 μg/ml), and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). All transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Canadian Life Technology, Burlington, ON, Canada) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells (15,000) were seeded in a 24-well plate and transfected with 0.4 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of pSG5βgal, and up to 0.4 μg of expression plasmids (such as c-Src) as indicated. After 48 h, transfected cells were harvested and lysed. One-fifth of the cell lysate was used to assay for β-galactosidase activity, an equal amount of lysate was used for a luciferase assay using PharMingen Luciferase Substrates (BD PharMingen, Mississauga, ON). Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer with wavelength at 562 nm. Luciferase activity of each sample was normalized to the corresponding β-galactosidase activity. For immunoprecipitation and in vitro c-Src kinase assays, 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded in a 100-mm tissue culture plate and transfected with 4 μg of reporter plasmid, 1 μg of pSG5-β-galactosidase, and up to 4 μg of expression plasmids as indicated. One-tenth of the cells was used for a luciferase assay, and the remaining cells were lysed and used for immunoprecipitation. To obtain stably transfected cells, SP1 cells were plated at 70% confluence in 60-mm plates and transfected with 2 μg of plasmids expressing various mutants of c-Src. Puromycin (2 μg/ml, Sigma, Oakville, ON) was added to cells 24 h following transfection, and was maintained until all cells in the mock transfection were killed. Puromycin-resistant cells were then collected and used as pooled cell lines. Expression and activity of c-Src mutants in transfected cells were checked using Western blotting analysis and a c-Src kinase assay. Total c-Src protein was immunoprecipitated with an excess amount of anti-c-Src (pan) antibody to maximize the amount of antibody-protein complex formed. We have previously found that these c-Src mutants are quite effective, and that relatively small levels of expression can result in significant phenotypes (19Rahimi N. Hung W. Saulnier R. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cells grown to 80% confluence on a 100-mm dish were washed and lysed with TriZol reagent (Canadian Life Technology). Phase separation was achieved by addition of chloroform and centrifugation at top speed in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Aqueous phase containing total RNA was removed to a new tube and precipitated with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol for 10 min at room temperature. The RNA pellet was recovered by centrifugation and washed with 70% ethanol. After brief drying, the RNA pellet was resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry. An aliquot (1 μg) of total RNA was used for reverse transcription with avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 15 min. One-tenth of the reaction was used in PCR analysis with end-labeled oligonucleotides specific forHGF (5′-TGTCGCCATCCCCTATGCAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGTCACAAGTCTTCAACT-3′) and β-glucuronidase (GUSB) sequences, as previously described (33Ivanchuk S.M. Myers S.M. Mulligan L.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The PCR reaction conditions were 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 25 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and a final cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. The reaction was then analyzed on a 2% agarose gel by electrophoresis. The bands corresponding to theHGF and GUSB products were excised and the amount of radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Conditioned media were collected and HGF was partially purified using copper (II) affinity column chromatography, as described previously (34Rahimi N. Etchells S. Elliott B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 80% confluence. The cell monolayer was washed with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Conditioned media were collected, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Conditioned medium (10 ml) from each cell line was then loaded onto a copper (II) affinity column. The copper (II) affinity column was prepared by chelating Cu2+ ions on a 1-ml HiTrap Chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfe, PQ), and equilibrated with equilibration buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm imidazole). The conditioned medium was recycled through the column 5 times to ensure binding of all HGF proteins, and the column was washed thoroughly with 15 volumes of equilibration buffer. HGF protein was eluted from the column with equilibration buffer containing 80 mm imidazole at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml each were collected; previous experiments have determined that essentially all HGF was eluted in fraction 2 (Ref. 34Rahimi N. Etchells S. Elliott B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar and data not shown). The fraction containing HGF was concentrated by centrifugation with Microcon centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut off. The samples were analyzed on a denaturing 10% SDS-PAGE gel, followed by Western blotting with anti-HGF antibody. Cells were grown to confluence and treated as indicated. After three washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 2 mmEGTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and protein concentrations were determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of lysate were incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h or overnight. Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed three times with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously (19Rahimi N. Hung W. Saulnier R. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In vitro c-Src kinase assays were performed as described previously (19Rahimi N. Hung W. Saulnier R. Tremblay E. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, each lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Src IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described above. One-half of each immunoprecipitate was subject to SDS-PAGE under nondenaturing conditions and Western blot analysis to confirm the amount of c-Src protein present. The other half of each immunoprecipitate was assayed for c-Src kinase activity by incubating with 10 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 μm Na3VO4), 1.4 μg of freshly prepared acid-denatured enolase (Sigma), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 × SDS sample buffer, and samples were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Serine and threonine phosphorylations were hydrolyzed by incubating the acrylamide gel in 1 m KOH at 45 °C for 30 min, followed by fixing in 45% MeOH and 10% acetic acid for 30 min at room temperature. The gel was dried under vacuum. Autoradiograms were produced and analyzed with a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Oligonucleotides used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay binding were Stat3-110F (5′-GGGCTGTTGTTAAACAGT-3′), Stat3-110R (5′-AGAACTGTTTAACAACAG-3′), Stat3-149F (5′-GGGGTTGAGGAAAGGAAG-3′), and Stat3-149R (5′-CCCCTTCCTTTCCTCAAC-3′). Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed by boiling equal molar amounts of each oligonucleotide for 10 min and then cooling slowly to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides (20 pmol) were labeled by a filling-in reaction with Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (35Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline before resuspension in cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min before lysis by brief vortexing. Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate). High salt extraction was performed by incubation on ice for 30 min in buffer C and centrifugation at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant (nuclear extract) was determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described by Mohan et al. (36Mohan W.S. Chen Z.Q. Zhang X. Khalili K. Honjo T. Deeley R.G. Tam S.P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 255-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly the binding reaction was performed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear extracts with 0.1 pmol of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe in the presence of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 9% glycerol, and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 10 min before analysis on 5% nondenaturing PAGE gel in Tris glycine buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 266 mm glycine). When unlabeled oligonucleotides were added, 10-fold molar excess was included in the binding reaction. For supershifting experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of the indicated antibody at room temperature for 20 min prior to the binding reaction. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 7% acetic acid, 40% methanol for 30 min, and dried under vacuum. The gel was then exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager. To study the regulation of HGF expression in breast carcinoma cells, we used the mouse mammary carcinoma cell line SP1, which coexpresses HGF and tyrosine-phosphorylated Met (23Rahimi N. Tremblay E. McAdam L. Park M. Schwall R. Elliott B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the levels of HGF mRNA in SP1 cells. We first examined the dose-dependent effect of an inhibitor of c-Src family kinases, PP2 (37Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from SP1 cells treated with different concentrations of PP2 and used for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription. Relative HGF mRNA levels were determined"

Smad2 and Smad3 both associate with the c-Ski and Sno oncoproteins to repress transcription of Smad target genes via recruitment of a nuclear corepressor complex. Ski-interacting protein (SKIP), a nuclear hormone receptor coactivator, was examined as a possible modulator of transcriptional regulation of the TGF-β-responsive promoter from the plasminogen activator inhibitor gene-1. SKIP augmented TGF-β-dependent transactivation in contrast to Ski/Sno-dependent repression of this reporter. SKIP interacted with Smad2 and Smad3 proteins in vivo in yeast and in mammalian cells through a region of SKIP between amino acids 201–333. In vitro, deletion of the Mad homology domain 2 (MH2) domain of Smad3 abrogated SKIP binding, like Ski/Sno, but the MH2 domain of Smad3 alone was not sufficient for protein-protein interaction. Overexpression of SKIP partially overcame Ski/Sno-dependent repression, whereas Ski/Sno overexpression attenuated SKIP augmentation of TGF-β-dependent transcription. Our results suggest a potential mechanism for transcriptional control of TGF-β signaling that involves the opposing and competitive actions of SKIP and Smad MH2-interacting factors, such as Ski and/or Sno.

TGF-β signaling requires the action of a family of DNA-binding proteins called Smads, including TGF-β-specific (Smad2 and Smad3), BMP-specific (Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8), a common Smad4, and anti-Smads (Smad6 and Smad7). TGF-β signals through sequential activation of two cell surface receptor serine-threonine kinases, which phosphorylate Smad2 and/or Smad3. Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3, together with Smad4, translocates into the nucleus where the Smad heterodimer binds Smad-binding elements (SBEs) in association with other nuclear factors in promoters of target genes (1Massague J.

The mechanism of Ski/Sno repression of TGF-β signaling appears to involve an interaction with a complex consisting of the nuclear corepressor (N-CoR) and a histone deacetylase enzyme (15Luo K.X.

N-CoR, and its related co-repressor silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid receptors (SMRT), interact with a wide variety of other nuclear factors to mediate transcriptional repression (17Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 18Chen J.D.

Interestingly, the Ski-interacting protein (SKIP) was initially identified in a two hybrid screen using v-Ski as a bait and was later independently identified as a VDR- and CBF1-interacting factor (20Dahl R.

Virol. 1999; 74: 1939-1947Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, the recent observation that SKIP modulates CBF1 and Notch-dependent signaling suggests that SKIP may play a role in the regulation of a number of different and distinct cellular signaling pathways (23Zhou S.F.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2400-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).As Ski and Sno can modulate TGF-β-dependent signaling, it was of interest to determine whether SKIP could also modulate the TGF-β-signaling pathway through interaction with the Smad proteins. In this study, in contrast to Ski- and Sno-mediated repression, SKIP augmented TGF-β-dependent transcription. A region of SKIP, aa 201–333, appeared to be required for the Smad interaction. SKIP interacted in vitro and in vivo with Smad3 and partially counteracted Ski- and Sno-dependent repression, while Ski/Sno attenuated SKIP transactivation of TGF-β signaling. These results suggest that SKIP may play an opposite role to Ski and Sno in the control of TGF-β-dependent transcription.DISCUSSIONThe Ski and Sno oncoproteins have been shown to negatively modulate TGF-β signaling through an interaction with a N-CoR repressor complex (15Luo K.X. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). As SKIP, a nuclear hormone receptor-interacting cofactor, also associates with both Ski and Sno, this study was undertaken to determine the potential role of SKIP in TGF-β signaling. In these studies SKIP augmented TGF-β−dependent transcription and exhibited a direct interaction with Smad proteins. This SKIP-Smad interaction was apparent both in vitro andin vivo, as demonstrated by GST pull-down assays, Far Western analysis, and yeast two hybrid protein-protein studies. The region between aa 201 and 333 within SKIP appeared to act as the Smad-interacting domain, while, SKIP, like Ski and Sno, interacted with the MH2 domain of Smad3. Moreover, Ski and Sno attenuated SKIP transactivation, while SKIP partially counteracted Ski- and Sno-mediated transcriptional repression.The C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad2 and Smad3 has been reported to be a key region involved in multiple protein-protein interactions, including those with the coregulators CBP/p300 and the Smad repressors Ski and Sno (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal MH1 domain of the Smads confers only low affinity DNA binding to a consensus SBE (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although natural TGF-β-responsive promoters contain functional clusters of SBEs, other DNA-binding factors, such as FAST-1, TFE3, and AP-1, as well as non-DNA binding factors through protein-protein interaction with the C-terminal MH-2 domain, are involved in determining the specificity and direction of Smad target gene action (29Hua X.X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 32Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). As such, SKIP appears to play a role in augmentation of TGF-β-specific Smad transcriptional activity via an interaction with the MH2 domain of Smad3. Our data also suggest, as SKIP was unable to interact with an isolated MH2 domain (last 26 aa) of Smad3 in GST binding assays and yeast two-hybrid studies, that other regions within the Smad proteins possibly within the context of the whole Smad protein may also modulate Smad-SKIP interaction.Although SKIP was able to interact with Smad2 and Smad3 in yeast, SKIP co-transfection with Smad3 with or without Smad4, led to the greatest increases in reporter activity in mammalian cells, presumably because the 3TP-lux reporter is Smad3-selective (27Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as SKIP interacted with Smad2 in vivo and in vitro, it is also possible that SKIP in mammalian cells may be able to modulate TGF-β signaling through Smad2 in certain situations (30Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the transient transfections we observed that Smad3 augmented basal reporter activity, as previously described with this promoter (5Sun Y. Liu X.D. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but this activity was further increased by SKIP. Further studies will be required to address the specific reasons for this effect of SKIP.The deletional analysis of SKIP in yeast and mammalian cells suggests that the aa 201–333 region of SKIP is required for Smad interactionsin vivo. However, some functional differences were observed between yeast and mammalian cells. Specifically, although the C-terminal SKIP construct (aa 334–536) did not interact with Smad2 or Smad3 in yeast, its transactivation activity in mammalian cells was comparable to wild-type SKIP. A C-terminal transactivation domain of SKIP that functions in mammalian cells, distinct from the Smad interaction domain, is consistent with the domain C-terminal to aa 437 of murine SKIP (NcoA-62) being involved in vitamin D-dependent transactivation (21Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. Macdonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).As SKIP interacts with Ski/Sno and Smad3 and, in turn, Ski/Sno interact with Smad3, to address the possibility that these proteins form a ternary complex, we performed a gel shift analysis using the PE2 probe from the PAI-1 promoter, as used in the transient transfections. The EMSA clearly showed that both SKIP and Ski/Sno alone formed a slightly higher migrating complex with Smad3/4. However, we did not observe the formation of a ternary complex in the presence of all three proteins. Thus, these data are consistent with the transient transfection results, which suggests competition occurring between SKIP and Ski/Sno for Smad3 transactivation, but cannot exclude the presence of a ternary complex forming between these proteins.In this study SKIP acted as a coactivator of TGF-β-dependent transcription. SKIP similarly acts as a coactivator of nuclear hormone receptor-dependent transcription, but also as a repressor of Notch signaling through its interaction with SMRT and associated histone deacetylase enzyme proteins (21Baudino T.A.

These divergent effects of SKIP may depend on interaction of SKIP with other, possibly cell-specific nuclear factors. For example, SKIP converts CBF1 from a transcriptional repressor to activator through switching its interaction between the corepressor SMRT and Notch 1C (23Zhou S.F. Fujimuro M. Hsieh J.J.D. Chen L. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2400-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In our study SKIP and Ski/Sno modulated each other's opposing transcriptional activities, raising the intriguing possibility that the relative cellular expression of SKIPversus Ski or Sno may play a regulatory role on TGF-β-dependent transcription and hence its effects on cell growth and differentiation. Interestingly, the Smad-interacting domain of SKIP (aa 201–333) appears to be also involved in interaction with Ski and Sno. 2J. Figueroa and M. J. Hayman, unpublished observations. These results and those showing that SKIP, like Ski/Sno, interacted with the MH2 domain of Smad3 suggest that the opposing transcriptional effects of SKIP and Ski/Sno may involve competition for Smad3 binding between SKIP and c-Ski/Sno, and/or other Smad3 MH2-interacting factors, such as with CBP/p300 (7Akiyoshi S.

Thus, the modulatory effects of SKIP through the MH2 domain potentially increase the complexity and diversity of Smad-dependent transcriptional effects. Furthermore, as SKIP and Ski/Sno interact with each other and also with the related corepressors N-CoR/SMRT, an additional mechanism could involve SKIP-mediated derepression (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Luo K.X. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 20Dahl R. Wani B. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Zhou S.F.

This may possibly occur via SKIP sequestration of corepressors such as SMRT or N-CoR from the Ski/Sno repressor complex, a mechanism similar to that suggested for Hoxc-8 and Smad1 (35Shi X.M. Yang X.L. Chen D. Chang Z.J. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Whatever the molecular mechanism of SKIP action, it is nevertheless clear that SKIP plays a role in modulation of this important cellular and signaling pathway.In summary, our results support a model in which SKIP positively modulates TGF-β-dependent-transcription and potentially competes with other MH2-interacting factors, such as c-Ski and Sno, to determine the transcriptional outcome of a TGF-β-responsive target gene. This suggests a potential role for SKIP in the regulation of TGF-β effects on cell growth and differentiation. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 superfamily members are multifunctional cell-cell signaling proteins, which include the TGF-βs, bone-morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), activins, and inhibins, mullerian-inhibiting substance and growth differentiation factors (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily mediate many key cellular events in growth and development and are evolutionarily conserved fromDrosophila to mammals (2Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling requires the action of a family of DNA-binding proteins called Smads, including TGF-β-specific (Smad2 and Smad3), BMP-specific (Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8), a common Smad4, and anti-Smads (Smad6 and Smad7). TGF-β signals through sequential activation of two cell surface receptor serine-threonine kinases, which phosphorylate Smad2 and/or Smad3. Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3, together with Smad4, translocates into the nucleus where the Smad heterodimer binds Smad-binding elements (SBEs) in association with other nuclear factors in promoters of target genes (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Tendijke P.

Recently it has been shown that Smad proteins also interact with other nuclear factors such as c-Ski and the Ski-related novel (Sno) protein and nuclear hormone receptors, including the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to modulate TGF-β signaling (5Sun Y.

The mechanism of Ski/Sno repression of TGF-β signaling appears to involve an interaction with a complex consisting of the nuclear corepressor (N-CoR) and a histone deacetylase enzyme (15Luo K.X. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 16Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). N-CoR, and its related co-repressor silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid receptors (SMRT), interact with a wide variety of other nuclear factors to mediate transcriptional repression (17Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 18Chen J.D.

Interestingly, the Ski-interacting protein (SKIP) was initially identified in a two hybrid screen using v-Ski as a bait and was later independently identified as a VDR- and CBF1-interacting factor (20Dahl R. Wani B. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. Macdonald P.N. J. Biol.

Virol. 1999; 74: 1939-1947Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, the recent observation that SKIP modulates CBF1 and Notch-dependent signaling suggests that SKIP may play a role in the regulation of a number of different and distinct cellular signaling pathways (23Zhou S.F. Fujimuro M. Hsieh J.J.D. Chen L. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2400-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As Ski and Sno can modulate TGF-β-dependent signaling, it was of interest to determine whether SKIP could also modulate the TGF-β-signaling pathway through interaction with the Smad proteins. In this study, in contrast to Ski- and Sno-mediated repression, SKIP augmented TGF-β-dependent transcription. A region of SKIP, aa 201–333, appeared to be required for the Smad interaction. SKIP interacted in vitro and in vivo with Smad3 and partially counteracted Ski- and Sno-dependent repression, while Ski/Sno attenuated SKIP transactivation of TGF-β signaling. These results suggest that SKIP may play an opposite role to Ski and Sno in the control of TGF-β-dependent transcription. DISCUSSIONThe Ski and Sno oncoproteins have been shown to negatively modulate TGF-β signaling through an interaction with a N-CoR repressor complex (15Luo K.X. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). As SKIP, a nuclear hormone receptor-interacting cofactor, also associates with both Ski and Sno, this study was undertaken to determine the potential role of SKIP in TGF-β signaling. In these studies SKIP augmented TGF-β−dependent transcription and exhibited a direct interaction with Smad proteins. This SKIP-Smad interaction was apparent both in vitro andin vivo, as demonstrated by GST pull-down assays, Far Western analysis, and yeast two hybrid protein-protein studies. The region between aa 201 and 333 within SKIP appeared to act as the Smad-interacting domain, while, SKIP, like Ski and Sno, interacted with the MH2 domain of Smad3. Moreover, Ski and Sno attenuated SKIP transactivation, while SKIP partially counteracted Ski- and Sno-mediated transcriptional repression.The C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad2 and Smad3 has been reported to be a key region involved in multiple protein-protein interactions, including those with the coregulators CBP/p300 and the Smad repressors Ski and Sno (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal MH1 domain of the Smads confers only low affinity DNA binding to a consensus SBE (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although natural TGF-β-responsive promoters contain functional clusters of SBEs, other DNA-binding factors, such as FAST-1, TFE3, and AP-1, as well as non-DNA binding factors through protein-protein interaction with the C-terminal MH-2 domain, are involved in determining the specificity and direction of Smad target gene action (29Hua X.X.

As such, SKIP appears to play a role in augmentation of TGF-β-specific Smad transcriptional activity via an interaction with the MH2 domain of Smad3. Our data also suggest, as SKIP was unable to interact with an isolated MH2 domain (last 26 aa) of Smad3 in GST binding assays and yeast two-hybrid studies, that other regions within the Smad proteins possibly within the context of the whole Smad protein may also modulate Smad-SKIP interaction.Although SKIP was able to interact with Smad2 and Smad3 in yeast, SKIP co-transfection with Smad3 with or without Smad4, led to the greatest increases in reporter activity in mammalian cells, presumably because the 3TP-lux reporter is Smad3-selective (27Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as SKIP interacted with Smad2 in vivo and in vitro, it is also possible that SKIP in mammalian cells may be able to modulate TGF-β signaling through Smad2 in certain situations (30Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the transient transfections we observed that Smad3 augmented basal reporter activity, as previously described with this promoter (5Sun Y. Liu X.D. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but this activity was further increased by SKIP. Further studies will be required to address the specific reasons for this effect of SKIP.The deletional analysis of SKIP in yeast and mammalian cells suggests that the aa 201–333 region of SKIP is required for Smad interactionsin vivo. However, some functional differences were observed between yeast and mammalian cells. Specifically, although the C-terminal SKIP construct (aa 334–536) did not interact with Smad2 or Smad3 in yeast, its transactivation activity in mammalian cells was comparable to wild-type SKIP. A C-terminal transactivation domain of SKIP that functions in mammalian cells, distinct from the Smad interaction domain, is consistent with the domain C-terminal to aa 437 of murine SKIP (NcoA-62) being involved in vitamin D-dependent transactivation (21Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. Macdonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).As SKIP interacts with Ski/Sno and Smad3 and, in turn, Ski/Sno interact with Smad3, to address the possibility that these proteins form a ternary complex, we performed a gel shift analysis using the PE2 probe from the PAI-1 promoter, as used in the transient transfections. The EMSA clearly showed that both SKIP and Ski/Sno alone formed a slightly higher migrating complex with Smad3/4. However, we did not observe the formation of a ternary complex in the presence of all three proteins. Thus, these data are consistent with the transient transfection results, which suggests competition occurring between SKIP and Ski/Sno for Smad3 transactivation, but cannot exclude the presence of a ternary complex forming between these proteins.In this study SKIP acted as a coactivator of TGF-β-dependent transcription. SKIP similarly acts as a coactivator of nuclear hormone receptor-dependent transcription, but also as a repressor of Notch signaling through its interaction with SMRT and associated histone deacetylase enzyme proteins (21Baudino T.A.

These divergent effects of SKIP may depend on interaction of SKIP with other, possibly cell-specific nuclear factors. For example, SKIP converts CBF1 from a transcriptional repressor to activator through switching its interaction between the corepressor SMRT and Notch 1C (23Zhou S.F. Fujimuro M. Hsieh J.J.D. Chen L. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2400-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In our study SKIP and Ski/Sno modulated each other's opposing transcriptional activities, raising the intriguing possibility that the relative cellular expression of SKIPversus Ski or Sno may play a regulatory role on TGF-β-dependent transcription and hence its effects on cell growth and differentiation. Interestingly, the Smad-interacting domain of SKIP (aa 201–333) appears to be also involved in interaction with Ski and Sno. 2J. Figueroa and M. J. Hayman, unpublished observations. These results and those showing that SKIP, like Ski/Sno, interacted with the MH2 domain of Smad3 suggest that the opposing transcriptional effects of SKIP and Ski/Sno may involve competition for Smad3 binding between SKIP and c-Ski/Sno, and/or other Smad3 MH2-interacting factors, such as with CBP/p300 (7Akiyoshi S.

Thus, the modulatory effects of SKIP through the MH2 domain potentially increase the complexity and diversity of Smad-dependent transcriptional effects. Furthermore, as SKIP and Ski/Sno interact with each other and also with the related corepressors N-CoR/SMRT, an additional mechanism could involve SKIP-mediated derepression (1Massague J. Wotton D.

This may possibly occur via SKIP sequestration of corepressors such as SMRT or N-CoR from the Ski/Sno repressor complex, a mechanism similar to that suggested for Hoxc-8 and Smad1 (35Shi X.M. Yang X.L. Chen D. Chang Z.J. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Whatever the molecular mechanism of SKIP action, it is nevertheless clear that SKIP plays a role in modulation of this important cellular and signaling pathway.In summary, our results support a model in which SKIP positively modulates TGF-β-dependent-transcription and potentially competes with other MH2-interacting factors, such as c-Ski and Sno, to determine the transcriptional outcome of a TGF-β-responsive target gene. This suggests a potential role for SKIP in the regulation of TGF-β effects on cell growth and differentiation. The Ski and Sno oncoproteins have been shown to negatively modulate TGF-β signaling through an interaction with a N-CoR repressor complex (15Luo K.X. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E.

The C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad2 and Smad3 has been reported to be a key region involved in multiple protein-protein interactions, including those with the coregulators CBP/p300 and the Smad repressors Ski and Sno (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal MH1 domain of the Smads confers only low affinity DNA binding to a consensus SBE (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although natural TGF-β-responsive promoters contain functional clusters of SBEs, other DNA-binding factors, such as FAST-1, TFE3, and AP-1, as well as non-DNA binding factors through protein-protein interaction with the C-terminal MH-2 domain, are involved in determining the specificity and direction of Smad target gene action (29Hua X.X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M.

As such, SKIP appears to play a role in augmentation of TGF-β-specific Smad transcriptional activity via an interaction with the MH2 domain of Smad3. Our data also suggest, as SKIP was unable to interact with an isolated MH2 domain (last 26 aa) of Smad3 in GST binding assays and yeast two-hybrid studies, that other regions within the Smad proteins possibly within the context of the whole Smad protein may also modulate Smad-SKIP interaction. Although SKIP was able to interact with Smad2 and Smad3 in yeast, SKIP co-transfection with Smad3 with or without Smad4, led to the greatest increases in reporter activity in mammalian cells, presumably because the 3TP-lux reporter is Smad3-selective (27Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as SKIP interacted with Smad2 in vivo and in vitro, it is also possible that SKIP in mammalian cells may be able to modulate TGF-β signaling through Smad2 in certain situations (30Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the transient transfections we observed that Smad3 augmented basal reporter activity, as previously described with this promoter (5Sun Y. Liu X.D. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but this activity was further increased by SKIP. Further studies will be required to address the specific reasons for this effect of SKIP. The deletional analysis of SKIP in yeast and mammalian cells suggests that the aa 201–333 region of SKIP is required for Smad interactionsin vivo. However, some functional differences were observed between yeast and mammalian cells. Specifically, although the C-terminal SKIP construct (aa 334–536) did not interact with Smad2 or Smad3 in yeast, its transactivation activity in mammalian cells was comparable to wild-type SKIP. A C-terminal transactivation domain of SKIP that functions in mammalian cells, distinct from the Smad interaction domain, is consistent with the domain C-terminal to aa 437 of murine SKIP (NcoA-62) being involved in vitamin D-dependent transactivation (21Baudino T.A. Kraichely D.M. Jefcoat S.C. Winchester S.K. Partridge N.C. Macdonald P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16434-16441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As SKIP interacts with Ski/Sno and Smad3 and, in turn, Ski/Sno interact with Smad3, to address the possibility that these proteins form a ternary complex, we performed a gel shift analysis using the PE2 probe from the PAI-1 promoter, as used in the transient transfections. The EMSA clearly showed that both SKIP and Ski/Sno alone formed a slightly higher migrating complex with Smad3/4. However, we did not observe the formation of a ternary complex in the presence of all three proteins. Thus, these data are consistent with the transient transfection results, which suggests competition occurring between SKIP and Ski/Sno for Smad3 transactivation, but cannot exclude the presence of a ternary complex forming between these proteins. In this study SKIP acted as a coactivator of TGF-β-dependent transcription. SKIP similarly acts as a coactivator of nuclear hormone receptor-dependent transcription, but also as a repressor of Notch signaling through its interaction with SMRT and associated histone deacetylase enzyme proteins (21Baudino T.A.

These divergent effects of SKIP may depend on interaction of SKIP with other, possibly cell-specific nuclear factors. For example, SKIP converts CBF1 from a transcriptional repressor to activator through switching its interaction between the corepressor SMRT and Notch 1C (23Zhou S.F. Fujimuro M. Hsieh J.J.D. Chen L. Miyamoto A. Weinmaster G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2400-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In our study SKIP and Ski/Sno modulated each other's opposing transcriptional activities, raising the intriguing possibility that the relative cellular expression of SKIPversus Ski or Sno may play a regulatory role on TGF-β-dependent transcription and hence its effects on cell growth and differentiation. Interestingly, the Smad-interacting domain of SKIP (aa 201–333) appears to be also involved in interaction with Ski and Sno. 2J. Figueroa and M. J. Hayman, unpublished observations. These results and those showing that SKIP, like Ski/Sno, interacted with the MH2 domain of Smad3 suggest that the opposing transcriptional effects of SKIP and Ski/Sno may involve competition for Smad3 binding between SKIP and c-Ski/Sno, and/or other Smad3 MH2-interacting factors, such as with CBP/p300 (7Akiyoshi S.

Thus, the modulatory effects of SKIP through the MH2 domain potentially increase the complexity and diversity of Smad-dependent transcriptional effects. Furthermore, as SKIP and Ski/Sno interact with each other and also with the related corepressors N-CoR/SMRT, an additional mechanism could involve SKIP-mediated derepression (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Luo K.X. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q.

This may possibly occur via SKIP sequestration of corepressors such as SMRT or N-CoR from the Ski/Sno repressor complex, a mechanism similar to that suggested for Hoxc-8 and Smad1 (35Shi X.M. Yang X.L. Chen D. Chang Z.J. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Whatever the molecular mechanism of SKIP action, it is nevertheless clear that SKIP plays a role in modulation of this important cellular and signaling pathway. In summary, our results support a model in which SKIP positively modulates TGF-β-dependent-transcription and potentially competes with other MH2-interacting factors, such as c-Ski and Sno, to determine the transcriptional outcome of a TGF-β-responsive target gene. This suggests a potential role for SKIP in the regulation of TGF-β effects on cell growth and differentiation.

TGF-β actions are directed by ligand-induced activation of TGF-β receptors with intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity that trigger phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) protein. Phosphorylated R-Smad proteins bind to Smad4, and the complexes formed move into the nucleus, where they act as components of a transcriptional complex. Here, we show that TGF-β signaling is inhibited by lefty, a novel member of the TGF-β superfamily. Lefty perturbed TGF-β signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Smad2 following activation of the TGF-β receptor. Moreover, lefty inhibited the events that lie downstream from R-Smad phosphorylation, including heterodimerization of R-Smad proteins with Smad4 and nuclear translocation of the R-Smad·Smad4 complex. Lefty repressed TGF-β-induced expression of reporter genes for the p21,cdc25, and connective tissue growth factor promoters and of a reporter gene driven by the Smad-binding element. Similarly, lefty inhibited both BMP-mediated Smad5 phosphorylation and gene transcription. The action of lefty does not appear to depend on protein synthesis, including synthesis of inhibitory Smad proteins. Thus, lefty provides a repressed state of TGF-β- or BMP-responsive genes and participates in negative modulation of TGF-β and BMP signaling by inhibition of phosphorylation of R-Smad proteins.

The two principal events in TGF-β signaling, TGF-β receptor and Smad phosphorylation, are controlled by a network of regulatory proteins, which modulate the magnitude of signals induced by TGF-β (22Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Positive regulators include ligand accessory receptors and substrate-anchoring factors such as membrane-anchored proteoglycan, betaglycan, and SARA (Smad anchor forreceptor activation). Betaglycan, also known as the TGF-β type III receptor, binds TGF-β and increases its affinity for the signaling receptors (23Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar, 24Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8797-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). By binding to the Mad homology-2 domains of Smad2 and Smad3, SARA facilitates the interaction of these Smad proteins with TGF-β receptors (25Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). A second set of factors participating in the negative regulation of TGF-β signaling includes the cytosolic growth factor-sequestering protein FKBP-12, the pseudoreceptor transmembrane protein BAMBI, and a set of inhibitory Smad proteins that include Smad6 and Smad7. Some of these factors inhibit the function of TGF-β by interacting with TGF-β receptors or Smad proteins. By virtue of binding to TGF-β type I receptor, FKBP-12 prevents its transphosphorylation by the TGF-β type II receptor (26Huse M. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1999; 96: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). BAMBI, on the other hand, blocks TGF-β-mediated signaling by forming inactive dimers with the type I receptor (27Onichtchouk D. Chen Y.G. Dosch R. Gawantka V. Delius H. Massagué J. Niehrs C. Nature. 1999; 401: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). By binding to receptor-activated Smad1, Smad6 forms a Smad1·Smad6 complex, which appears to be inactive (28Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), whereas a second inhibitory Smad protein, Smad7, binds to the activated TGF-β receptor, blocking the phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smad (34Stroschein S.L.

SnoN and c-Ski both inhibit TGF-β signaling by interfering with Smad function (36Li Y. Turck C.M. Teumer J.K. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β-mediated Smad signaling integrates with and is controlled by other signaling factors such as those in the Ras/Erk and Jak1/Stat pathways (37Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 38Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Erk, activated by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor, induces the phosphorylation of R-Smad proteins in the linker region and without inhibiting the association of R-Smad proteins with Smad4 and prevents the nuclear accumulation of Smad proteins (38Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Thus, the magnitude of the TGF-β effect is the net outcome of actions of these positive and negative signals.Besides the vast network of positive and negative intracellular regulatory factors, there are extracellular proteins that, by directly interacting with TGF-β, prevent its binding to receptors (22Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latency-associated peptide noncovalently binds TGF-β, keeping it in a latent form incapable of binding to betaglycan or its signaling receptors (23Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Some indirect evidence suggests that lefty, a member of the family of morphogens that is thought to encode a signal for “leftness,” is poised to act as an inhibitor of TGF-β family members (39Meno C.

Nature. 2000; 403: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the lefty-related factor Xatv acts as a feedback inhibitor of nodal signaling in induction of mesoderm and left/right axis development in Xenopus (44Cheng A.M. Thisse B. Thisse C. Wright C.V. Development. 2000; 127: 1049-1061PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Xatv in the marginal zone in Xenopus suppresses mesoderm formation, causes defects in gastrulation, and inhibits the secondary axis formation induced by Xnr1 and Xactivin, suggesting that Xatv acts as a feedback inhibitor of activin signaling (45Tanegashima K. Yokota C. Takahashi S. Asashima M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 99: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Injection of lefty into mouse blastocysts leads to neurogenesis, a function attributable to BMP inhibitors such as chordin, noggin, and follistatin (41Meno C. Ito Y. Saijoh Y. Matsuda Y. Tashiro K.

In this report, we carried out experiments to determine whether lefty is capable of blocking TGF-β and BMP signaling and the associated gene transcriptional activity.DISCUSSIONTGF-β is a potent cytokine capable of modifying and regulating many different cell functions. In view of these diverse activities, there is a great interest in understanding how the signaling by TGF-β is regulated. In view of the potent and diverse activities of TGF-β, the action of this cytokine is tightly controlled by a number of negative feedback mechanisms (29Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here, we show that lefty is an integral part of these feedback loops. Lefty exerts a significant inhibition of R-Smad phosphorylation by TGF-β and BMP in a dose-dependent fashion. This action of lefty appears to be dependent on events that are downstream from receptor activation since lefty inhibited R-Smad phosphorylation by a constitutively active TGF-β receptor. Inhibition of R-Smad phosphorylation by lefty is associated with inhibition of events that follow R-Smad activation, including the heterodimerization of R-Smad with Smad4, nuclear accumulation of the R-Smad·Smad4 complexes, and repression of the transcriptional activity of genes responsive to TGF-β and BMP. Thus, the effects of TGF-β, BMP, and lefty are channeled through a common Smad-mediated pathway, and the magnitude of the response to TGF-β or BMP depends on the amount of available lefty.The action of lefty in inhibiting the phosphorylation of R-Smad proteins is similar to that exerted by anti-Smad proteins. Smad6 interferes with TGF-β signaling by interaction and association with receptor-activated Smad (29Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N.

On the other hand, Smad7 binds the activated TGFβ type I receptor, blocking the association, phosphorylation, and activation of Smad2 (28Hata A. Lagna G. Massagué J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 32Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we considered that inhibition of phosphorylation of R-Smad by lefty might be mediated by induction of Smad6 or Smad7. However, lefty did not alter the synthesis of these inhibitory proteins. SnoN and Ski are unlikely candidates for mediating the actions of lefty since they both are nuclear oncoproteins. SnoN maintains the repressed state of TGF-β-responsive genes in the absence of ligand and participates in negative feedback regulation of TGF-β signaling in the presence of ligand. Under basal conditions, the SnoN oncoprotein interacts with Smad2 and Smad4 and represses their abilities to activate transcription through recruitment of the transcriptional corepressor N-CoR. Ski directly interacts with Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 on a TGF-β-responsive promoter element and represses their abilities to activate transcription through recruitment of the nuclear transcriptional corepressor N-CoR and possibly its associated histone deacetylase complex (55Luo K.X. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Thus, the actions of lefty complements the actions of these intracellular inhibitors of TGF-β responsiveness. The inhibitory effect of lefty is not due to synthesis of a protein, including induction of Smad6 or Smad7, suggesting that lefty acts through an as yet unidentified protein that interacts with either the intracytoplasmic domain of the TGF-β receptor or more likely the R-Smad proteins.The interaction of lefty proteins with TGF-β and/or BMP and the Smad signaling pathway is likely to play a major role during implantation and embryogenesis as well as oncogenesis. Lefty is a novel subfamily of the TGF-β protein superfamily and is comprised of lefty-1and lefty-2 in mouse (39Meno C. Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Ikeda M. Yokoyama T. Yokoyama M. Toyoda Y. Hamada H.

Both of these genes are asymmetrically expressed on the left side of gastrulating mouse embryos. However, the major expression domains of the two genes are different. lefty-1 expression is predominantly confined to the left side of the ventral neural tube, whereas lefty-2 is strongly expressed in the left lateral mesodermal plate (39Meno C.

Kuhara S. Hamada H. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In zebrafish embryos, lefty-1 is expressed in the central nervous system in the left diencephalon, whereas lefty-2 is expressed in the left heart field (57Bisgrove B.W. Essner J.J. Yost H.J. Development. 2000; 127: 3567-3579PubMed Google Scholar). Antivin/lefty-1 is also expressed asymmetrically on the left side of the prospective floor plate, notochord, and lateral plate mesoderm of the chick embryo (58Ishimaru Y. Yoshioka H. Tao H. Thisse B. Thisse C. Wright C.V. Hamada H. Ohuchi H. Noji S. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Asymmetric expression oflefty and nodal is perturbed in mouse mutants with laterality defects, and mutation of lefty A is seen in humans who exhibit left/right axis malformations (58Ishimaru Y.

Furthermore, the knockout mutation of lefty-1 induces a variety of L/R positional defects in visceral organs. The most notable feature oflefty-1-deficient mice is bilateral expression ofnodal and lefty-2, which leads to a left lung isomerism (40Meno C. Shimono A. Saijoh Y. Yashiro K. Mochida K. Ohishi S. Noji S. Kondoh H. Hamada H. Cell. 1998; 94: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). These and other observations support the concept that during embryogenesis, lefty proteins encode a signal for leftness and appear to be involved in neurogenesis. Like lefty, the signaling molecules of TGF-β, including its receptors and Smad proteins, have been implicated in embryo development. TGF-β is intrinsically involved in patterning during developmental processes and neurogenesis. In the chick embryo, TGF-β is involved in the death of ciliary, dorsal root, and spinal motor neurons as well as in neuronal losses that follow limb bud ablation (62Krieglstein K. Richter S. Farkas L. Schuster N. Dunker N. Oppenheim R.W. Unsicker K. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Both overexpression and deletion of TGF-β genes cause significant developmental abnormalities and death in embryos (63Agah R. Prasad K.S. Linnemann R. Firpo M.T. Quertermous T. Dichek D.A. Circ.

Mice genetically deficient in the TGF-beta receptor type II gene die around embryonic day 10.5 from abnormalities that are reminiscent of those described in TGF-β1−/− embryos, including defects in hematopoiesis and visceral yolk sac vasculogenesis (69Oshima M. Oshima H. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 79: 297-302Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In mouse embryos, Smad2 has been found as a key mediator that directs epiblast derivatives toward an endodermal as opposed to a mesodermal fate (70Tremblay K.D. Hoodless P.A. Bikoff E.K. Robertson E.J. Development. 2000; 127: 3079-3090PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, some evidence has emerged that directly ties the function of lefty to the signaling molecules of the TGF-β and BMP proteins. Some, if not all, of the developmental processes driven by TGF-β family members may be subject to modulation by lefty. We showed here that lefty inhibits BMP signaling, suggesting that the tissue patterning during embryogenesis might be regulated by the joint effect of these cytokines. Consistent with this thesis, it has recently been shown that regulation of left/right asymmetry in the gut and heart is not solely induced by lefty; rather, it is driven by context-dependent interactions between lefty and BMP-4 (61Branford W.W. Essner J.J. Yost H.J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Injection of lefty into two-cell stage Xenopus blastocysts promotes neuralization, an effect that is also inducible by factors such as noggin, follistatin, and chordin that inhibit BMP signaling (41Meno C.

De Robertis E.M. Nature. 1999; 376: 333-336Crossref Scopus (539) Google Scholar). These findings show that the development of asymmetry requires the joint cooperation of various members of the TGF-β superfamily. Similar to lefty, levels of phosphorylated Smad2 have been found to be asymmetrically distributed across both the animal-vegetal and dorsoventral axes in Xenopus embryos, suggesting that Smad2 is a candidate morphogen that regulates primary germ layer formation and dorsoventral patterning (7Faure S. Lee M.A. Keller T. ten Dijke P. Whitman M. Development. 2000; 127: 2917-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Micetrans-heterozygous for both Smad2 and nodal mutations have defects in left/right patterning, indicating that Smad2 is involved in the development of left/right asymmetry and that Smad2 may mediate nodal signaling in these developmental processes (72Nomura M. Li E. Nature. 1998; 393: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Moreover, the gene dosage of Smad2 has been found to be important in tissue patterning, suggesting that lefty might act by regulating the function of Smad2. The left/right asymmetric expression oflefty-2 is controlled by a left side-specific enhancer. The transcription factor FAST2, which mediates signaling by TGF-β and activin, binds to a conserved sequence in this asymmetric enhancer, which is both essential and sufficient for left/right asymmetric gene expression (73Liu B. Dou C.L. Prabhu L. Lai E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 74Saijoh Y. Adachi H. Sakuma R. Yeo C.Y. Yashiro K. Watanabe M. Hashiguchi H. Mochida K.

The forkhead transcription factor FoxH1, also known as FAST1, which associates with Smad proteins in response to an activin/TGF-β signal, plays a key role in the development of dorsal axial structures in zebrafish and in specification of mesoderm by TGF-β superfamily signals"

We have previously isolated yeast mutants of the mitochondrial Hsp70, Ssq1p, in a genetic screen for mutants with altered iron homeostasis. Here we describe the isolation of mutants of the J-domain protein, Jac1p, using the same screen. Mutantjac1 alleles predicted to encode severely truncated proteins (lacking 70 or 152 amino acids) were associated with phenotypes strikingly similar to the phenotypes of ssq1mutants. These phenotypes include activation of the high affinity cellular iron uptake system and iron accumulation in mitochondria. In contrast to iron accumulation, Fe-S proteins of mitochondria were specifically deficient. In jac1 mutants, like inssq1 mutants, processing of the Yfh1p precursor protein from intermediate to mature forms was delayed. In the genetic backgrounds used in this study, jac1 null mutants were found to be viable, permitting analysis of genetic interactions. TheΔjac1 Δssq1 double mutant was more severely compromised for growth than either single mutant, suggesting a synthetic or additive effect of these mutations. Overexpression of Jac1p partially suppressed ssq1 slow growth and vice versa.

However, iron can also be extremely toxic. The toxicity of iron results from interaction with reactive oxygen intermediates, generating highly toxic hydroxyl radicals that damage nearby macromolecules, including lipids, DNA, and proteins (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon, Oxford, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar). Cells cope with this dual nature of iron in part by homeostatic regulation of cellular iron uptake. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae and other organisms, iron uptake is induced by iron deprivation and repressed by iron sufficiency (3Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The components of the iron uptake system of yeast include a surface reductase encoded by FRE1 that is regulated by iron levels through changes in its transcription (4Dancis A. Roman D.G.

We used this property of theFRE1 gene to select mutants that failed to repressFRE1 expression in response to iron.

Fe-S clusters are modular units in which iron and sulfur are coordinated in various combinations and linked to the peptide backbone of proteins via cysteine sulfurs.

We also demonstrate genetic interactions between JAC1 and SSQ1. Rich medium consisted of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 μg/ml adenine, and various carbon sources. In some experiments 2% raffinose was used (YPAR), and in other experiments 2% glucose was used (YPAD). To induce the GAL10 promoter, the carbon source used was 2% raffinose and 0.5% galactose. Expression from theGAL10 promoter was turned off by growth in identical medium without galactose. For experiments with different concentrations of iron, standard defined medium with 2% raffinose was modified by omission of iron. Medium was autoclaved and iron was added back from a filter sterilized stock of 100 mm ferric ammonium sulfate. To achieve severe iron deprivation, defined medium without added iron was supplemented with 10 μm chelator bathophenanthrolene disulfonate (Fluka).

Haploid strain 61q (MATα, trp1–63,leu2–3,112, gcn4–101, his3–609,ura3–52, FRE1-HIS3::URA3,SSQ1::LEU2) was derived from strain 61 by insertion of an additional copy of SSQ1 carried on plasmid pRS405 and integrated at the BstEII site of theleu2–3,112 locus. 61q was subjected to mutagenesis by UV irradiation to produce a mortality of 40–70%. The mutagenized population was diluted and allowed to form colonies from single cells on YPAD agar plates. These colonies were replicated to agar plates containing defined medium supplemented with 10 μm copper sulfate and 20 μm ferric ammonium sulfate. After 4 days, some of the colonies developed papillae, which were streaked for single clones on YPAD plates and evaluated further. The mutants derived from 61q by this procedure included UV6.3 (jac1–3,rho°) and UV6.30 (jac1–30, rho°). The related parental strains CM3260 (MATα,trp1–63, leu2–3,112, gcn4–101,his3–609, ura3–52) and CM3262 (MATa , ino1–13,leu2–3,112, gcn4–101, his3–609,ura3–52) were used in crosses (5Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). UV6.3 and UV6.30 were backcrossed with CM3262, and spore clones were evaluated. Backcross of UV6.3 yielded spore clones 634–3C (FRE1-HIS3::URA3, jac1–3,rho+) and 8A (ura3–52, jac1–3,rho+). Backcross of UV6.30 yielded spore clones 725–3D (FRE1-HIS3::URA3, jac1–30,rho+) and 2C (ura3–52, jac1–30,rho+). In prior work, mutant selection using strain 61 yielded the mutant 191–33C (FRE1-HIS3::URA3, ssq1–4). This strain carries a mutant allele of ssq1, which is truncated at amino acid 220 of the coding region and was previously called ssc2–1 (8Knight S.A. Sepuri N.B. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18389-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In strains CM3260, 8A, and 2C, theAFT1 open reading frame (ORF)1 was interrupted by insertion of a URA3 marker gene at a uniqueHindIII site in the genome (7Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), creating strains CM3260Δaft1, 8AΔaft1, and 2CΔaft1. Plasmid pRS406-JAC1 was inserted at theMscI site of the JAC1 locus in CM3262, creating strain JM1 (URA3::JAC1). JM1 was crossed with 8A (jac1–3, ura3–52) and sporulated, and the tetrads were scored for non-repressed ferric reductase (mutant iron regulatory phenotype) and Ura+growth. All Ura+ tetrads lacked the mutant iron regulatory phenotype. A shuffle strain for JAC1 was constructed as follows. A diploid resistant to cycloheximide, YPH501 (cyh2/cyh2), was transformed with the construct jac1KOhis. This heterozygous knockout (JAC1/Δjac1::HIS3,cyh2/cyh2) was transformed with plasmid pRS318-JAC1, carrying the JAC1 ORF, 500 bp of 5′- and 3′-flanking region on a centromere-based plasmid with LEU2 and CYH2genes. A tetrad clone with Leu+ and His+growth, 729–4B, was identified and designated as a shuffle strain (MATa , ura3–52,lys2–801(amber), ade2–101(ochre),trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200,leu2-Δ1,Δjac1::HIS3(pRS318-JAC1)). A shuffle strain for SSQ1 was constructed in analogous fashion. The SSQ1 gene was interrupted withHIS3 in the YPH501 (cyh2/cyh2) diploid. This diploid was transformed with plasmid pRS318-SSQ1 sporulated, and a tetrad clone with Leu+ and His+ growth, MK4–6, was identified and used as a shuffle strain (MATα ,ura3–52, lys2–801(amber),ade2–101(ochre), trp1-Δ63,his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ1,Δjac1::HIS3(pRS318-SSQ1)). For counterselection against the presence of the plasmid pRS318, cells were exposed to 10 μg/ml cycloheximide added to agar plates containing growth media (26Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The JAC1 shuffle strain 729–4B and SSQ1 shuffle strain MK4–6 were mated, and a zygote was picked by micromanipulation. The diploid was streaked on cycloheximide plates to eject the pRS318 plasmids. The diploid, which became auxotrophic for leucine, was then sporulated. Tetrads were dissected and photographed after 5 days. The spore clones were transferred to YPAD plates, and genotypes were analyzed for presence ofSSQ1,Δssq1::HIS3,JAC1, andΔjac1::HIS3 alleles using genomic PCR. The primers for this analysis were as follows. ForJAC1, primer 011700B (5′-GACGCAAGAACAGACCTC-3′) and primer 041100A (5′-CGACCACAAGGAATTTGGAAC-3′) produced a product of 802 bp. ForΔjac1, primer 101499E (5′-CGCTCACCAAGCTCTTAAAACG-3′) and primer 041100A (see above) produced a 539-bp product. For SSQ1, primer 021198C (5′-CCTGAAACAAACTTCAG-3′) and 013098B (5′-CACCCGCTTGCCCATCAACA-3′) produced a 928-bp product. For Δssq1, primer 101499E (see above) and 013098B (see above) produced a 275-bp product. F1 was identified by screening a yeast genomic library (27Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) for correction of the slow growth and non-repressed reductase of 8A (jac1–3). F1 contained a 5.3-kb insert in the vector YCp50. The insert consisted of bp 458483–463769 of chromosome VII and included JAC1. The JAC1 ORF with 500 bp of flanking DNA was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from YPH501 by PCR using Pfu polymerase and inserted into the vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Similarly, the ORFs and flanking regions were amplified from the 8A (jac1–3) and 2C (jac1–30) strains and inserted into the same vector. Several clones of each were subjected to DNA sequencing. The wild-type and mutant JAC1genomic fragments with SstI and XhoI ends were subcloned into pRS406 for integration into the genome atStuI in the ura3–52 locus. The wild-typeJAC1 genomic fragment was also subcloned into the same sites in pRS318 for use in plasmid shuffling. For obtaining high levels of regulated expression, the JAC1 ORF and truncated variants (with amino acids 1–114 or amino acids 1–32) were amplified from the F1 plasmid with 5′ BamHI and 3′ XhoI sites and cloned into pEMBlyex4-i (9Li J. Kogan M. Knight S. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33025-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The plasmids, called GAL10-Jac1, GAL10-jac1(1–114), and GAL10-jac1(1–32) could be linearized with a unique StuI restriction site for integration at theura3–52 site. The SSQ1 ORF was inserted into theBamHI site of the same vector and could also be linearized with the unique StuI site. The JAC1 deletion construct, jac1KOhis, was made by inserting a genomic fragment containing JAC1 and flanking region between SalI and KpnI sites into plasmid YCplac22. BamHI sites were introduced at the start and stop of the open reading frame, allowing for replacement of the entire ORF with a cassette containing the HIS3 gene. The knockout construct could be released by digestion with NotI and SstI. To deleteJAC1, diploids CM3263, YPH501 (28Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar), and W303 (29Meyers A.M. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) were transformed with this fragment, and transformants were selected for growth in the absence of histidine. In each case, correct integration of the knockout was verified by PCR. For interruption/deletion ofSSQ1, a HIS3 cassette with BamHI ends was inserted into BglII sites within a 2.2-kbKpnI-EcoRI SSQ1 genomic fragment carried on the vector pCRscript. For disruption of SSQ1, digestion of this plasmid with KpnI and EcoRI was performed, releasing a 3.5-kb fragment prior to transformation. The pRS318-SSQ1 plasmid carried a 3461-bp EcoRI-SalI genomic fragment containing SSQ1. For expression in bacteria, the JAC1 ORF was amplified with 5′ NdeI and 3′ XhoI sites and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET21b (Novagen), forming an in-frame fusion with 6 histidines (His6). Expression in BL21(DE3) was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The overexpressed Jac1p-His6 fusion protein was isolated from inclusion bodies, purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 8 m urea, 0.4 m imidazole, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and found to contain a major band by staining with Coomassie Blue. The band was excised from the gel and used to inject rabbits for generation of polyclonal antibodies. The carboxyl-terminal 109 amino acids of the SSQ1 ORF was expressed in pET21b with His6 tag, purified from the soluble fraction of the bacterial lysate using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column as above, and used to immunize rabbits. Antibodies directed against Aco1p (30Li J. Saxena S. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1503-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), Mir1p, and Por1p (31Schulke N. Sepuri N.B. Gordon D.M. Saxena S. Dancis A. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22847-22854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Commercially available antibodies used in some experiments included mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against Cox3p or Pgk1p (3-phosphoglycerate kinase) (Molecular Probes). Mitochondria were isolated as described (32Murakami H. Pain D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2051-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The post-mitochondrial fraction was centrifuged at 386,000 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant was used as a cytosolic fraction. Intact mitochondria were resuspended in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 m sorbitol. For determining the iron content of mitochondria, wild-type or mutant yeast cells were grown to steady state for 16 h in defined medium supplemented with varying concentrations of iron. A small amount (100 nm) of tracer55Fe (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added during growth. Mitochondria were isolated in the usual fashion, and an amount equivalent to 250 μg of protein was exposed to 2% SDS in 50 μl for 10 min at 55 °C and suspended in 1 ml of scintillation mixture for counting in a Beckman scintillation counter. Radiolabeled precursors (Jac1p, Yfh1p, Put2p) were synthesized in a cell-free translation in the presence of a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (31Schulke N. Sepuri N.B. Gordon D.M. Saxena S. Dancis A. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22847-22854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Import reactions contained mitochondria (100 μg), radiolabeled preprotein, and 4 mm ATP and 1 mm GTP (31Schulke N. Sepuri N.B. Gordon D.M. Saxena S. Dancis A. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22847-22854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Following import at 20 °C for 15 min, reaction mixtures were treated with trypsin (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 0 °C. The protease was inactivated, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to film. Use of purified matrix processing protease (MPP) to test processing of mitochondrial precursor proteins was as described (33Gordon D.M. Qi S. Dancis A. Pain D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). High affinity cellular iron uptake was measured as described (5Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Aconitase was assayed by measuring the formation ofcis-aconitate at 240 nm as described (34Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Succinate dehydrogenase was assayed on mitochondria lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 by following the reduction of p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT) to INT-formazan as described (35Munujos P. Coll-Canti J. Gonzalez-Sastre F. Gella F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 506-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For detection of heme, mitochondrial proteins (100 μg) separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose were incubated with peroxide developer and chemiluminescent substrates (SuperSignal ECL, Pierce) for 5 min. The covalently bound heme group of cytochromec (Cyc1p) and the heme group of thebc1 complex (Cyt1p) were visualized by exposing the blot to film (36Vargas C. McEwan A.G. Downie J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). FRE1 encodes the major cell surface reductase and is required for iron acquisition from ferric iron chelates (4Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The FRE1 promoter, which is repressed in response to iron, was fused to the HIS3 coding region. Mutants that failed to respond to iron-mediated repression were selected for their ability to grow in the presence of iron and in the absence of histidine (5Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The most commonly selected mutants were defective in the SSQ1 gene. Therefore, in order to avoid selecting more of these mutants, the screen was modified by insertion of an additional copy of SSQ1 in the haploid genome. Two new mutants, UV6.3 and UV6.30 (Fig.1 A), were selected and found to exhibit small colony size, non-repressing surface ferric reductase, and increased high affinity ferrous iron uptake. The mutant phenotypes were found to be recessive. The mutants were backcrossed with a wild-type parental strain, and the slow growth and iron related phenotypes segregated in a 2+:2− pattern in the tetrads, consistent with involvement of a single nuclear locus. Crosses revealed that the two independent isolates contained allelic mutations. The wild-type allele for the mutant gene in 8A was then cloned by complementation of the slow growth and reductase phenotypes. The complementing activity was further localized to a minimal construct containing only the JAC1 ORF and 500 bp of 5′- and 3′-flanking DNA. To rule out the possibility that complementation by the JAC1-containing genomic DNA fragment could be indirect, the JAC1 ORF with its native promoter and a URA3marker gene were inserted into the unique MscI site of the chromosomal JAC1 locus in a wild-type strain. This strain JM1 (URA3::JAC1) was crossed with 8A (jac1–3, ura3–52) and sporulated. All Ura− tetrad clones exhibited slow growth and non-repressing reductase (mutant phenotype), indicating absence of recombination between the marked wild-type JAC1 and the 8A mutant. Hence, meiotic mapping also supported that the mutation in 8A responsible for the mutant phenotypes was in JAC1 or closely linked to this locus. The mutant alleles were rescued from strains 8A (jac1–3) and 2C (jac1–30) by PCR of theJAC1 ORF and flanking regions. DNA sequence analysis revealed single nucleotide changes in each case. For thejac1–3 allele, nucleotide 344 was changed from T to G, altering codon 115 from TTA (leucine) to TGA (Stop). Thejac1–3 mutant allele codes for a truncated protein lacking its carboxyl one-third. For the jac1–30 allele, nucleotide 97 was changed from C to T, altering codon 33 from CAA (glutamine) to TAA (Stop), and is thereby predicted to code for a severely truncated protein (Fig. 1). The severity of the truncation of the predictedJAC1 ORF in allele jac1–30 suggested that it would be non-functional or null. The viability of this mutant was surprising in view of an earlier work indicating that JAC1was an essential gene required for vegetative growth (11Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To directly address the question of essentiality of JAC1 in the CM3263 genetic background in which the mutants were selected, the entire ORF was deleted in this diploid, and the correctness of the deletion was verified by genomic PCR. The heterozygous knockout was sporulated and spore clones were dissected on rich (YPAD) medium and incubated at 30 °C. All four spores formed colonies, although the histidine prototrophs carrying the knockout constructs formed much smaller colonies than the wild-type spore clones (Fig.2 A). The tetrad clones containing the jac1 deletions could be maintained in culture, although they were often overgrown by more rapidly growing suppressor mutants. Similarly, in another yeast genetic background, YPH501, jac1 knockouts germinated and formed small colonies (Fig. 2 A). This slow growth phenotype of the jac1deletion was more severe when incubated at elevated (37 °C) or lower (23 °C) temperatures (data not shown). Thus, in both of these yeast strains, jac1 deletion was deleterious but still allowed germination and vegetative growth. We also examined the deletion phenotype in W303, another commonly used parental strain. In this background, the jac1 deletion underwent germination and formed tiny macroscopic colonies consisting of several thousand cells (Fig. 2 A, enlarged panel). However, these clones could not be propagated. Perhaps small amounts of Jac1p carried over from the diploid into the deletion spore clones supported a finite number of doublings prior to growth arrest. In summary,JAC1 is required for vegetative growth in some yeast genetic backgrounds and not in others. In genetic backgrounds in which the jac1 null strain was viable, it was extremely slow growing and accumulated suppressor mutations. To accurately assess the phenotype of mutants and to more easily work with strains carrying mutated forms of JAC1, we used a plasmid shuffle strategy as is used to study essential genes (26Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the deletion (Fig. 2 B,line 1) uncovered aft"
https://openalex.org/W1971071799,"Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) is a transport protein for lipophilic substances in bronchio-alveolar fluid, plasma, and uterine secretion. It acts as a carrier for steroid hormones and polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites. Previously, the existence of receptors for uptake of CCSP·ligand complexes into the renal proximal tubules had been suggested. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we demonstrate that CCSP binds to cubilin, a peripheral membrane protein on the surface of proximal tubular cells. Binding to cubilin results in uptake and lysosomal degradation of CCSP in cultured cells. Surprisingly, internalization of CCSP is blocked not only by cubilin antagonists but also by antibodies directed against megalin, an endocytic receptor that does not bind CCSP but associates with cubilin. Consistent with a role of both receptors in renal uptake of CCSP in vivo, patients deficient for cubilin or mice lacking megalin exhibit a defect in tubular uptake of the protein and excrete CCSP into the urine. These findings identify a cellular pathway consisting of a CCSP-binding protein (cubilin) and an endocytic coreceptor (megalin) responsible for tissue-specific uptake of CCSP and associated ligands.

Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP)1 is a small homodimeric protein consisting of two 8-kDa subunits linked by disulfide bridges (reviewed in Ref. 1Singh G. Katyal S.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol... 1997; 17: 141-143Google Scholar). The protein is predominantly produced in Clara cells, a non-ciliated cell type in the bronchiolar epithelium of the lung, and is secreted into the airway lumen. It represents one of the most abundant soluble proteins in the alveolar fluid (2Singh G. Katyal S.L. Gottron S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1985; 829: 156-163Google Scholar, 3Andersson O.

Experimental evidence suggests that this filtered CCSP is taken up specifically by epithelial cells of the proximal tubules in the kidney (5Brandt I. Lund J. Bergman A. Klasson-Wehler E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. Drug Metab. Dispos... 1985; 13: 490-496Google Scholar). Another site of CCSP expression is the rabbit uterus during the preimplantation phase of pregnancy. In fact, CCSP was first identified as a protein component of rabbit uterine secretion capable of inducing blastulation. It is therefore also known as uteroglobin or blastokinin (6Beier H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1968; 160: 289-291Google Scholar, 7Krishnan R.S. Daniel Jr., J.C. Science.. 1967; 158: 490-492Google Scholar). CCSP represents an important clinical marker of the health status of the lung and the kidney. In the lung, CCSP expression is induced during cellular differentiation (8Cardoso W.V. Stewart L.G.

Impaired development of the fetal lung or conditions that harm the adult tissue (e.g. smoking, xenobiotics, or cancer) result in significantly reduced levels of CCSP expression (10Bernard A. Thielemans N. Lauwerys R. Langhendries J.P. Van Lierde M. Freund M.M. Pediatr. Res... 1994; 36: 771-775Google Scholar, 11Bernard A.M. Gonzalez-Lorenzo J.M. Siles E. Trujillano G. Lauwerys R. Eur.

In the kidney, uptake of CCSP is dependent on the functional integrity of the proximal tubules, and impaired tubular activity causes urinary excretion of the protein (13Bernard A.M. Thielemans N.O. Lauwerys R.R. Kidney Int... 1994; 47: 34-37Google Scholar). So far, the physiological significance of CCSP remains unclear. Most notably, CCSP is recognized for its role as a carrier of methylsulfonyl polychlorinated biphenyl metabolites (MeSO2-PCB) in the organism. PCBs are industrial chemicals that, despite being banned from production for many years, remain common in the human population. They accumulate in the lung, in the kidney, and in fatty tissues causing a wide range of deleterious effects (reviewed in Ref. 14Safe S. Environ. Health Perspect... 1993; 100: 259-268Google Scholar). In exposed individuals, more than 80% of PCB metabolites in the lung are bound to CCSP (5Brandt I. Lund J. Bergman A. Klasson-Wehler E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. Drug Metab.

In the kidney, CCSP mediates the uptake and accumulation of MeSO2-PCB in the proximal tubules by yet unknown receptor pathways (5Brandt I. Lund J. Bergman A. Klasson-Wehler E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. Drug Metab. Dispos... 1985; 13: 490-496Google Scholar). A central role of CCSP as a determinant of PCB bioaccumulation is further supported by the finding that no MeSO2-PCBs accumulate in the lungs or in the kidneys of CCSP-deficient mice (16Stripp B.R. Lund J. Mango G.W. Doyen K.C. Johnston C. Hultenby K. Nord M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol... 1996; 271: L656-L664Google Scholar). As a further step in elucidating the molecular pathways regulating CCSP activity, we performed experiments to identify the cellular receptors that mediate the uptake of the protein into CCSP target tissues. We were able to uncover a two-receptor pathway responsible for the uptake of CCSP into the kidney and possibly other tissues. This pathway consists of cubilin, a peripheral membrane protein that binds CCSP, and an endocytic receptor megalin that associates with cubilin and mediates the endocytic uptake of cubilin·CCSP complexes.

Aucouturier (Necker Hospital, Paris, France); urine samples from patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome were obtained from O. de Baulmy (Hopital Robert Debré, Paris, France). Experiments involving SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis were performed according to standard procedures. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) or a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and rat receptor-associated protein (GST-RAP) were produced in DH5α bacteria as described before (20Nykjaer A. Dragun D. Walther D. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Herz J. Melsen F. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 507-515Google Scholar). Rat lavage CCSP and recombinant rat CCSP were purified as published previously (21Lund J. Devereux T. Glaumann H. Gustafsson J.A. Drug Metab. Dispos... 1988; 16: 590-599Google Scholar, 22Hard T. Barnes H.J. Larsson C. Gustafsson J.A. Lund J. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1995; 2: 983-989Google Scholar). The proteins were radiolabeled with125I using the IODOGEN method (23Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm... 1978; 80: 849-857Google Scholar). The cellular uptake and degradation of radiolabeled proteins were performed in Brown Norway rat yolk sac carcinoma cells cultured in standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum). Cellular degradation of 125I-ligands added to the culture medium was determined by standard protocols and expressed as nanograms of125I-labeled trichloroacetic acid-soluble material released into the culture medium per mg of total cell protein (24Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol... 1983; 98: 241-260Google Scholar). For urine collection, megalin-deficient mice and control litter mates were placed in metabolic cages for 16 h and given 10% sucrose in drinking water. Urine samples (∼5 ml/16 h) were collected on ice and were qualitatively indistinguishable from samples collected without sucrose load. Urine volume per h and creatinine levels were similar in megalin −/− and in control mice (∼0.5 mmol creatinine/liter). For bronchio-alveolar lavage, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the trachea was exposed and canulated. The diaphragm and parietal pleura were punctured to deflate the lungs. The lungs were slowly lavaged with 1 ml of sterile saline (0.15 m NaCl). The lavage was centrifuged at 10.000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove alveolar macrophages and cellular debris. Samples were concentrated by centrifugation through a low binding cellulose membrane (Millipore) at 1.500 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. The concentration of the recovered proteins was determined, and samples were stored at −80 °C for further analysis. Binding of ligands to megalin or cubilin was quantified by BIAcore analysis (Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (20Nykjaer A. Dragun D. Walther D. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Herz J. Melsen F. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 507-515Google Scholar). For generation of the receptor chips, a continuous flow of HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 3.4 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) passing over the sensor surface was maintained at 5 μl/min. The carboxylated dextran matrix of the sensor chip flow cell was activated by injection of 60 μl of a solution containing 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide in H2O. Then, 180 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 10 μg/ml of purified rabbit megalin or rabbit cubilin was injected. The remaining binding sites were blocked by subsequent injection of 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. The surface plasmon resonance signal from the immobilized receptors generated BIAcore response units equivalent to 30 fmol of megalin/mm2 and 40 fmol of cubilin/mm2. To test ligand binding, megalin or cubilin immobilized on the CM5 BIA sensor chip were incubated with the ligands in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, and the relative increase in response between megalin and control flow channels was determined. For determination of binding affinities, different concentrations of each ligand were subjected to BIAcore analysis on the cubilin sensor chip. The kinetic parameters were determined by using BIAevaluation 3.0 software. Wild type and megalin-deficient mice were perfusion-fixed through the heart with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylated buffer. The collected tissues were trimed and immersion-fixed for 1 h in 1% paraformaldehyde, infiltrated with 2.3 m sucrose containing 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Semithin 0.8-μm cryosections from the tissues were incubated with rabbit anti-rat CCSP antibody (1:1000 dilution) or rabbit anti-rat cubilin antibody (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by either Alexa 546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) or peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO). For the latter incubations, peroxidase was visualized by diaminobenzidine, and the sections were counterstained with Meier's stain for 2 min. For electron microscopy, ultrathin 70- to 90-nm cryosections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-cubilin antibody (1:5000 dilution) followed by 10 nm of gold-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (British BioCell International, Cardiff, United Kingdom). This study was conducted to identify the receptors responsible for cellular uptake and tissue accumulation of CCSP and CCSP·ligand complexes. We focused our attention on the proximal tubules of the kidney, because this tissue has been shown to clear CCSP and CCSP·PCB complexes from the glomerular filtrate (13Bernard A.M. Thielemans N.O. Lauwerys R.R. Kidney Int... 1994; 47: 34-37Google Scholar, 16Stripp B.R. Lund J. Mango G.W. Doyen K.C. Johnston C. Hultenby K. Nord M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol... 1996; 271: L656-L664Google Scholar). Two efficient receptor pathways are known to operate in the epithelium of the renal proximal tubule (reviewed in Ref. 25Christensen E.I. Birn H. Verroust P. Moestrup S.K. Int. Rev. Cytol... 1998; 180: 237-284Google Scholar). One is cubilin, a peripheral membrane protein involved in the clearance of filtered albumin (26Birn H. Fyfe J.C. Jacobsen C. Mounier F. Verroust P.J. Orskov H. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest... 2000; 105: 1353-1361Google Scholar). The other receptor is megalin, a multifunctional scavenging receptor of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. The latter receptor is responsible for retrieval of vitamin·carrier complexes from the glomerular filtrate. These complexes include 25-OH vitamin D3·vitamin D-binding protein and vitamin A·retinol-binding protein (20Nykjaer A. Dragun D. Walther D. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Herz J. Melsen F. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 507-515Google Scholar, 27Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol... 1999; 10: 685-695Google Scholar). To test whether cubilin or megalin may be responsible for tubular uptake of CCSP, we analyzed binding of CCSP to both receptors by BIAcore analysis. As seen in Fig.1 A, purified rat lavage CCSP bound to cubilin but not to megalin immobilized on the BIA sensor chips. The Kd of CCSP binding to cubilin was 56 nm (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained with recombinant rat CCSP (recCCSP); however, the affinity of binding was slightly lower (Kd of 400 nm, data not shown). We further investigated the requirements for CCSP binding to cubilin in more detail applying two inhibitors that interfere with ligand binding to this receptor. One inhibitor is EDTA, which chelates calcium ions required for cubilin/ligand interaction. As expected, binding of CCSP to cubilin was dependent on calcium and significantly reduced by the addition of EDTA to the assay medium (Fig.2 A). The second inhibitor tested was the receptor-associated protein (RAP), a cellular chaperone that antagonizes endocytic receptors including cubilin. Recombinant RAP can be applied exogenously to block binding of ligands to cubilin in vitro or in cells (28Kristiansen M. Kozyraki R. Jacobsen C. Nexo E. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 20540-20544Google Scholar). Preincubation of cubilin with RAP impaired the ability of the receptor to interact with CCSP (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Inhibition of CCSP binding to cubilin by EDTA and RAP. In panel A, binding of 0.5 μmrecombinant rat CCSP to cubilin was tested in the absence (Cubilin) or in the presence of 20 mm EDTA (Cubilin + EDTA). In panel B, cubilin was pre-incubated with 10 μm RAP resulting in 400 response units. No further significant increase in response was achieved by subsequent addition of 0.5 μm recCCSP or 10 μm RAP, indicating inhibition of ligand binding by RAP. As a control, 0.5 μm recombinant CCSP were added to the receptor chip without prior addition of RAP (50 response units). Thearrows denote the time points of addition of reagents to the BIA sensor chips.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) So far, our studies had established specific and calcium-dependent binding of CCSP to cubilin, a peripheral membrane protein in the renal proximal tubule. Because tubular epithelial cells internalize CCSP in vivo (5Brandt I. Lund J. Bergman A. Klasson-Wehler E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. Drug Metab. Dispos... 1985; 13: 490-496Google Scholar), we investigated whether binding of CCSP to cubilin resulted in endocytic uptake of the protein. As a model cell line we used Brown Norway rat yolk sac carcinoma cells (BN16 cells), which express abundant amounts of cubilin and megalin (29Le Panse S. Ayani E. Nielsen S. Ronco P. Verroust P. Christensen E.I. Eur. J. Cell Biol... 1997; 72: 257-267Google Scholar). Thus, these cells represent the receptor profile of proximal tubular cells. When 125I-labeled recCCSP was added to BN16 cells, time-dependent uptake and lysosomal degradation of the protein were observed (Fig.3). Uptake and degradation of CCSP were blocked by the receptor antagonist RAP and by chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation (Fig. 3). To confirm that the cellular catabolism of CCSP was dependent on cubilin activity, we applied anti-cubilin antibodies to block the receptor on BN16 cells. As controls, we used non-immune IgG or antiserum directed against megalin. As expected, addition of anti-cubilin IgG to the assay medium significantly inhibited CCSP degradation as compared with control IgG (Fig. 4, columns 1 and2). Surprisingly, anti-megalin IgG also inhibited CCSP degradation to a similar extend (Fig. 4, column 3). Combined application of anti-cubilin and anti-megalin antibodies inhibited CCSP degradation even further (Fig. 4, column 5). The inhibition of CCSP degradation by anti-megalin antibodies was not because of a cross-reactivity of the antiserum with cubilin. As shown in Fig.5, anti-megalin antiserum did not recognize this receptor in Western blot analysis of BN16 membrane preparations (Fig. 5).Figure 4Inhibition of recCCSP degradation by anti-cubilin and anti-megalin IgG. Replicate monolayers of BN16 cells received 0.25 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without glutamine) containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 270–450 ng/ml of 125I-recCCSP (specific activity 1754 cpm/ng). In addition, the medium included 200 μg/ml of the indicated purified IgGs. After 2 h incubation at 37 °C, the amount of radiolabeled degradation products secreted into the medium was determined. Each value is the mean of four separate experiments (± S.E.). 100% values represent degradation rates in the absence of added immunoglobulins and range from 70–450 ng of CCSP/mg of cell protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Western blot analysis of BN16 cell membranes. 10 (lane 1) or 1 μg (lane 2) of partially purified membrane proteins from BN16 cells were subjected to non-reducing 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Replicate filters were incubated with rabbit anti-cubilin IgG (lane 1) or sheep anti-megalin IgG (lane 2). Bound IgGs were detected using chemiluminescence. The position of migration of marker proteins of 250 and 98 kDa in the gel is indicated. No cross-reactivity of the anti-megalin IgG with cubilin was observed (and vice versa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our studies had uncovered the finding that degradation of CCSP in BN16 cells is dependent on megalin, a receptor that does not bind CCSP directly. These results were intriguing as they supported a previous hypothesis about the mechanism of cubilin action. Cubilin is a protein without transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains that remains only loosely associated with the plasma membrane. Because the receptor is able to bind to megalin, it was proposed that cubilin may undergo endocytosis by association with megalin (30Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 5235-5242Google Scholar, 31Hammad S.M. Barth J.L. Knaak C. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 12003-12008Google Scholar). Thus, binding of inhibitory antibodies to megalin may affect ligand uptake via cubilin in BN16 cells. To confirm that such a dual receptor pathway is also operablein vivo, we analyzed the renal metabolism of CCSP in patients and in laboratory animals lacking cubilin or megalin. If our hypothesis was correct, kidneys with deficiency in either receptor should excrete CCSP. First, we tested urinary excretion of CCSP in patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome, an inheritable defect in the cubilin gene (32Aminoff M. Carter J.E. Chadwick R.B. Johnson C. Grasbeck R. Abdelaal M.A. Broch H. Jenner L.B. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. de la Chapelle A. Krahe R. Nat. Genet... 1999; 21: 309-313Google Scholar). As a control, we analyzed patients with renal Fanconi syndrome. These individuals suffer from a general tubular resorption defect and excrete numerous plasma proteins that are normally reabsorbed by the proximal tubules. As shown in Fig.6, patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome excreted significant amounts of CCSP in their urine (lanes 2 and 4). Similar amounts of the protein were detected in urine of Fanconi patients (lane 5). No CCSP was observed in the urine of control subjects (lanes 1 and3). The urinary loss of CCSP in patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome was not because of an unspecific tubular resorption defect, because β2-microglobulin, a marker of tubular dysfunction, was not excreted. This protein is taken up by other tubular receptor pathways and excreted in patients with Fanconi syndrome (Fig. 6). A total of four patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome, three patients with Fanconi syndrome, and six control subjects were analyzed. All samples gave the same results as the ones shown in Fig. 6. Next, we tested for excretion of CCSP in mice genetically deficient for megalin (20Nykjaer A. Dragun D. Walther D. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Herz J. Melsen F. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 507-515Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of this receptor in the renal uptake of CCSP, the animals secreted significant amounts of CCSP. The protein was not found in the urine of control animals (Fig. 7). A deficiency in the tubular uptake of CCSP in megalin knockout mice was further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of mouse kidney sections using anti-rat CCSP antiserum. In wild type mouse kidneys, abundant CCSP was detected in endosomal and lysosomal compartments of proximal tubular cells indicating uptake of the protein from the glomerular filtrate. No CCSP staining was observed in megalin-deficient kidneys (Fig.8). To characterize the consequence of megalin deficiency on functional cubilin expression in more detail, we investigated the subcellular localization of this receptor in kidney sections. In wild type tissue, cubilin was present on the apical brush border surface of proximal tubular cells (Fig. 8). In particular, the protein was found in endosomes and recycling membrane vesicles, so-called dense apical tubules, which carry internalized receptors back to the cell surface. This pattern is consistent with a role for cubilin as recycling endocytic receptor (Fig. 9). In tubular cells lacking megalin, the total amount of cubilin found within the cells and on the brush border surface was dramatically reduced (Fig. 8). Small amounts of the protein found on the apical surface were present in membrane vesicles of significantly lesser density than dense apical tubules. These membrane vesicles most likely represented vesicles carrying newly synthesized cubilin from thetrans-Golgi network to the cell surface. In these cells, cubilin was distinctly excluded from endosomes and dense apical tubules (Fig. 9).Figure 7Urinary loss of CCSP in megalin-deficient mice. Urine samples (15 μl) from two wild type (+/+) and three megalin-deficient (−/−) mice were subjected to 4–20% non-reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-rat CCSP antiserum.

Next, we tested whether this receptor pathway may also be responsible for the catabolism of CCSP in the lung. Because no tissue was available from patients with Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome, we focused our studies on the lungs of megalin-deficient mice. No obvious difference in the overall protein pattern (Fig.10 A) or the amount of CCSP (Fig. 10 B) was detected in the bronchio-alveolar lavage of megalin −/− as compared with control mice. In addition, no significant difference in the interaction of total lavage proteins with megalin or cubilin was detected when samples from wild type or megalin-deficient mice were tested by BIAcore analysis (not shown). These results indicated that megalin-deficient lungs did not accumulate significant amounts of CCSP or other receptor ligands in the alveolar space. The findings, however, did not exclude the existence of alternative receptor pathways for catabolism of CCSP in the lung. In the present study, we have identified the receptors responsible for the uptake of CCSP into the proximal tubules of the kidney. The existence of such receptors has previously been postulated based on the uptake of CCSP and CCSP·PCB complexes into the kidney (5Brandt I. Lund J. Bergman A. Klasson-Wehler E. Poellinger L.

Doyen K.C. Johnston C. Hultenby K. Nord M. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol... 1996; 271: L656-L664Google Scholar). This CCSP receptor pathway consists of the following two cellular proteins: cubilin, a peripheral membrane protein that binds CCSP, and megalin, an endocytic receptor required for endocytosis of cubilin·CCSP complexes. Cubilin is a 460-kDa soluble protein. Structurally, it is characterized by the presence of 8 epidermal growth factor-type repeats and a cluster of 27 so-called CUB domains (30Moestrup S.K.

Cubilin was initially purified and cloned as the intrinsic factor receptor, a protein in the terminal ileum responsible for the uptake of intrinsic factor (IF)·vitamin B12 complexes (30Moestrup S.K.

Consistent with a crucial role of this protein in intestinal vitamin B12 absorption, patients with cubilin gene defects (Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome) suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia (32Aminoff M. Carter J.E. Chadwick R.B. Johnson C. Grasbeck R. Abdelaal M.A. Broch H. Jenner L.B. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. de la Chapelle A. Krahe R. Nat. Genet... 1999; 21: 309-313Google Scholar). Apart from the terminal ileum, cubilin is also expressed in several other tissues, including the proximal tubules and the yolk sac (30Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 5235-5242Google Scholar, 31Hammad S.M. Barth J.L. Knaak C. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 12003-12008Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the protein may be involved in uptake of additional ligands in non-gastrointestinal cell types. In the proximal tubules, cubilin was recently shown to be responsible for clearance of filtered albumin (26Birn H. Fyfe J.C. Jacobsen C. Mounier F. Verroust P.J. Orskov H. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest... 2000; 105: 1353-1361Google Scholar). A role for the receptor in cellular uptake of high density lipoproteins was also demonstrated (37Kozyraki R. Fyfe J. Kristiansen M. Gerdes C. Jacobsen C. Cui S. Christensen E.I. Aminoff M. de la Chapelle A. Krahe R. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. Nat. Med... 1999; 5: 656-661Google Scholar, 38Hammad S.M. Stefansson S.

Given its function as an endocytic receptor, the structure of cubilin is unusual. The protein lacks obvious transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains and remains only loosely associated with the plasma membrane. Membrane attachment is mediated through an amphipathic helix located in the amino-terminal portion of the protein (28Kristiansen M. Kozyraki R. Jacobsen C. Nexo E. Verroust P.J. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 20540-20544Google Scholar). Because cubilin is coexpressed with megalin and is able to bind to this receptor in vitro, a model was proposed whereby cubilin associates with megalin to recycle through the endocytic compartments (30Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 5235-5242Google Scholar). Several cubilin ligands have been suggested to utilize this coreceptor pathway, including the IF (30Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 5235-5242Google Scholar), albumin (26Birn H. Fyfe J.C. Jacobsen C. Mounier F. Verroust P.J. Orskov H. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest... 2000; 105: 1353-1361Google Scholar), and high density lipoproteins (31Hammad S.M. Barth J.L. Knaak C. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 12003-12008Google Scholar). However, no conclusive data have been described so far that such a coreceptor pathway is active in vivo. In the present study, we present novel experimental evidence that the cubilin/megalin coreceptor system exists in vivo and that it is responsible for the renal clearance of CCSP. Inhibition of cubilin in cultured cells (Fig. 4) or genetic inactivation in patients (Fig. 6) eliminates cellular uptake of CCSP. The same effect can be observed when megalin is inactivated (Fig.4) or genetically deficient (Figs. 7 and 8). The association of cell surface proteins with an endocytic receptor for recycling through the endocytic compartments has been described before. Most commonly, this phenomenon is observed for proteins linked to the plasma membrane via glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchors. One example is the urokinase receptor, which associates with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein to achieve endocytic uptake of ligands (39Nykjaer A. Conese M. Christensen E.I. Olson D. Cremona O. Gliemann J. Blasi F. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 2610-2620Google Scholar). Both receptors associate with one another through their common ligand, the urokinase·plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complex. The existence of endocytic coreceptors for the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored prion protein has also been postulated (40Harris D.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev... 1999; 12: 429-444Google Scholar). The cubilin/megalin coreceptor system, however, is unique as it involves a peripheral membrane protein without glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor (cubilin) directly bound to an endocytic coreceptor (megalin). In the absence of megalin (as in megalin knockout kidneys), the total amount of cubilin expressed on the cell surface is reduced significantly (Figs. 8 and 9). The few receptor molecules on the apical membranes are unable to perform endocytosis of CCSP (Fig. 8) and seem to be excluded specifically from endosomes and recycling membrane vesicles (Fig. 9). These findings suggest the involvement of megalin in two distinct steps of cubilin transport and function. (i) Megalin is important but not essential for trafficking of cubilin through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. (ii) Megalin is absolutely required for internalization and endosomal targeting of cubilin. Taken together with data by Moestrup et al. (30Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 5235-5242Google Scholar) and Hammad et al. (31Hammad S.M. Barth J.L. Knaak C. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 12003-12008Google Scholar), a mechanism seems likely whereby cubilin remains associated with megalin throughout the endocytic pathway and on the cell surface. Ligands such as IF, albumin, or CCSP associate with this receptor complex by binding to sites on cubilin distinct from the megalin binding domain. Although the moderate affinity of cubilin for CCSP precluded the direct demonstration of a ternary complex between CCSP, cubilin, and megalin, the formation of such a complex with the IF has been reported before (30Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 5235-5242Google Scholar). Expression of megalin and cubilin is not restricted to the proximal tubules in the kidney but seen in a number of embryonic and adult tissues. This raises the question whether the same receptor system may also be responsible for accumulation of CCSP in non-renal tissues. The unimpaired metabolism of CCSP in megalin-deficient lungs suggests that this receptor mechanism is not operable in the respiratory epithelium (Fig. 10). Besides the kidney, tissues with confirmed coexpression of megalin and cubilin are the yolk sac and the distal ileum (31Hammad S.M. Barth J.L. Knaak C. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 12003-12008Google Scholar). The cellular uptake of CCSP has been described in the renal proximal tubules and in the endometrium (13Bernard A.M. Thielemans N.O. Lauwerys R.R. Kidney Int... 1994; 47: 34-37Google Scholar, 41Bochskanl R. Thie M. Kirchner C. Histochemistry.. 1984; 80: 581-589Google Scholar, 42Bochskanl R. Thie M. Wirth B. Kirchner C. Cell Tissue Res... 1988; 252: 625-630Google Scholar). It remains to be shown whether megalin and cubilin are coexpressed in the endometrium or whether CCSP is taken up in other tissues expressing both receptors. The identification of a receptor pathway for clearance of CCSP from the glomerular filtrate raises some interesting hypothesis as to the physiological role of this protein in vivo. The main function of megalin in the proximal tubules is the retrieval of plasma carrier proteins that have been filtered through the glomerulus (reviewed in Ref. 43Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol... 1999; 10: 2224-2236Google Scholar). These carrier proteins are the vitamin D-binding protein, the retinol-binding protein, transcobalamin, and transthyretin. The reabsorption of these carrier proteins is required to prevent the urinary loss of essential metabolites bound to the carriers including vitamins A, D3, and thyroxine (20Nykjaer A. Dragun D. Walther D. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Herz J. Melsen F. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 507-515Google Scholar, 27Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol... 1999; 10: 685-695Google Scholar, 44Sousa, M. M., Norden, A. G., Jacobsen, C., Willnow, T. E., Christensen, E. I., Thakker, R. V., Verroust, P. J., Moestrup, S. K., and Saraiva, M. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.Google Scholar). The clearance of CCSP by the same receptor pathway suggests that this protein may also act as a carrier for important metabolites that have to be scavenged from the renal filtrate. Consistent with this hypothesis, the CCSP homodimer has been shown to bind progesterone in a central pocket formed by the two protein subunits (45Dunkel R. Vriend G. Beato M. Suske G. Protein Eng... 1995; 8: 71-79Google Scholar). Whether progesterone is a physiological ligand for CCSP in vivoremains unclear. Because the affinity for the steroid hormone greatly varies among CCSP species and is very low for human and monkey CCSP, the existence of yet unidentified CCSP ligands remains likely. Cubilin-deficient patients and megalin knockout mice should exhibit urinary loss of these metabolites. A function for CCSP in transport and cellular uptake of lipophilic substances is also supported by its role in bioaccumulation of MeSO2-PCB. Conceivably, these lipophilic xenobiotics displace the endogenous ligands transported by CCSP and thus are targeted to the same cell types that normally internalize CCSP·ligand complexes. Consistent with this hypothesis, mice deficient in megalin or patients defective for cubilin should still accumulate MeSO2-PCB in the lung but lack uptake into the kidney. At present, the poor viability of the megalin knockout mouse precludes the experimental proof of this hypothesis. However, the generation of a mouse model with kidney-specific megalin gene defects will enable us to test this concept. In conclusion, our studies have uncovered the receptor pathway that is responsible for renal uptake of CCSP. These findings have elucidated an important step in the catabolism of the protein and will direct further research toward characterization of the metabolism and the functional significance of this carrier protein in vivo.

In this study, 57 analogues of MCH were investigated on the recently cloned human MCH receptor stably expressed in HEK293 cells, on both the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production and guanosine-5′-O-(3-[35S]thiotriphosphate ([35S]- GTPγS) binding. The dodecapeptide MCH-(6–17) (MCH ring between Cys7 and Cys16, with a single extra amino acid at the N terminus (Arg6) and at the C terminus (Trp17)) was found to be the minimal sequence required for a full and potent agonistic response on cAMP formation and [35S]- GTPγS binding. We Ala-scanned this dodecapeptide and found that only 3 of 8 amino acids of the ring, namely Met8, Arg11, and Tyr13, were essential to elicit full and potent responses in both tests. Deletions inside the ring led either to inactivity or to poor antagonists with potencies in the micromolar range. Cys7 and Cys16 were substituted by Asp and Lys or one of their analogues, in an attempt to replace the disulfide bridge by an amide bond. However, those modifications were deleterious for agonistic activity. In [35S]- GTPγS binding, these compounds behaved as weak antagonists (KB 1–4 μm). Finally, substitution in MCH-(6–17) of 6 out of 12 amino acids by non-natural residues and concomitant replacement of the disulfide bond by an amide bond led to three compounds with potent antagonistic properties (KB = 0.1–0.2 μm). Exploitation of these structure-activity relationships should open the way to the design of short and stable MCH peptide antagonists.

Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)1 has been initially described in fish as a heptadecapeptide (Asp-Thr-Met-Arg-Cys-Met-Val-Gly-Arg-Val-Tyr-Arg-Pro-Cys-Trp-Glu-Val (1Kawauchi H. Kawazoe I. Tsubokawa M. Kishida M. Baker B.I. Nature. 1983; 305: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar)). Its structure was relatively conserved throughout evolution, although in mammals the sequence of MCH is a nonadecapeptide with differences mainly in the N terminus (Asp-Phe-Asp-Met-Leu-Arg-Cys-Met-Leu- Gly-Arg-Val-Tyr-Arg-Pro-Cys-Trp-Gln-Val (2Vaughan J.M. Fischer W.H. Hoeger C. Rivier J. Vale W. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1660-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)). In rodents, there are now several lines of evidence for the involvement of MCH in the central regulation of feeding behavior as reviewed by Tritos and Maratos-Flier (3Tritos N.A. Maratos-Flier E. Neuropeptides. 1999; 33: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The MCH peptide and its receptor are expressed in the hypothalamus, a region involved in energy balance and food intake (4Bittencourt J.C. Presse F. Arias C. Peto C. Vaughan J. Nahon J.L. Vale W.

In this particular brain area, MCH mRNA is overexpressed and up-regulated during fasting in ob/ob mice as well as in rats (8Presse F. Sorokovsky I. Max J.P. Nicolaidis S. Nahon J.L.

Maratos-Flier E. Nature. 1998; 396: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in peripheral tissues, MCH also stimulates the release of leptin from isolated rat adipocytes (14Bradley R.L. Kokkotou E.G. Maratos-Flier E. Cheatham B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The lack of suitable binding conditions, mainly due to the hydrophobic and sticky nature of MCH itself or derivatives (15Drozdz R. Eberle A.N. J. Receptor Signal Transduc. Res. 1995; 15: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Burgaud J.L. Poosti R. Fehrentz J.A. Martinez J. Nahon J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was probably a limitation for expression cloning of the receptor. The MCH receptor was nevertheless recently identified by several groups using reverse pharmacology (17Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J.

The MCH function was assigned to the previously described orphan receptor SLC-1 (22Kolakowski J.L.K. Jung B.P. Nguyen T. Johnson M.P. Lynch K.R. Cheng R. Heng H.Q. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F.

Receptor cloning and association of functional tests open the way to the search for pharmacological tools, especially receptor antagonists that are needed to study receptor functions. One of the possible strategies to this goal is the chemical modification of the natural peptide including peptide shortening, amino acid substitution, and conformation restriction with the help of structure-activity relationships and modeling studies toward optimized nonpeptide ligands. Such a strategy has been successful for the design of subtype-specific antagonists of neuropeptide Y receptors (24Beck-Sickinger A.G. Wieland H.A. Wittneben H. Willim K.D. Rudolf K. Jung G. Eur. J.

In the case of MCH, only two sets of data have been published on the pharmacological action and binding affinity of MCH analogues in vitro. A first series of experiments with fish MCH on fish, frog, or other batrachian skin assays were reported (28Kawazoe I. Kawauchi H. Hirano T. Naito N. Int. J. Pept.

Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1989; 10: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the MCH ring was essential (32Matsunaga T.O. Hruby V.J. Lebl M. Castrucci A.M.L. Hadley M.E. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and that any modification (including amino acid deletion) of this ring was deleterious for biological activity (30Lebl M. Hruby V. Castrucci A.M. Hadley M.E. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A second series of data have been published more recently using membranes from mammalian cells that were tested for their capacity to bind the current labeled derivative of MCH, [Phe13,Tyr19]MCH (15Drozdz R.

Furthermore, the mRNA for the cloned receptor could not be found in some of those cell lines. 2M. Rodriguez and L. Maulon, unpublished observations. 2M. Rodriguez and L. Maulon, unpublished observations. Thus, these results cannot be attributed to the MCH receptor. More pharmacological data should be gathered on the cloned human receptor. To date, a single report described studies with MCH analogues (particularly Arg11-modified ones) on human MCH receptor reported the design of the weak MCH antagonist [d-Arg11]MCH (37Macdonald D. Murgolo N. Zhang R. Durkin J.P. Yao X. Strader C.D. Graziano M.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It also showed, by site-directed mutagenesis, that the residue Asp123 in the third transmembrane domain of the receptor was critical in binding and receptor activation. In the present report, an extensive and detailed structure-activity relationships study of MCH, including a panel of 58 peptides, is presented using two different functional assays on HEK293 cells stably expressing the human MCH receptor, the inhibition of the intracellular cAMP production and the stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding on membrane preparations. The minimal peptide sequence maintaining the agonistic activity was found to be the dodecapeptide MCH-(6–17), which includes the cyclic part of MCH. From this minimal structure, several antagonists with weak (micromolar) to relatively high (0.1 μm) potency could be designed. Most of the natural and modified peptides were purchased from NEOSYSTEM SA, Strasbourg, France, using the classical methods of peptide chemistry. They were prepared on solid phase (see Ref. 38Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 1-203Google Scholar for example) using Fmoc for α-protection (39Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2308) Google Scholar),tert-butyl type groups for side chain protection, and trityl for cysteine. Arginine was used under its protected form, 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl arginine (40Carpino L.A. Shroff H. Triolo S.A. Mansour E.S. Wenschuh H. Albericio F. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 7829-7832Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Final deprotection and cleavage from the resin was achieved by treatment with 90% trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of thiol scavengers. Final purification was obtained by preparative reverse phase chromatography using a C18 Delta-Pak, 15 μm, 300 Å, in linear gradients of acetonitrile/water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Head-to-tail cyclic compounds, such as compound 23, were synthesized on an orthochloro-chlorotrityl resin, the Nα-Fmoc eliminated by the action of piperidine, the linear protected peptide cleaved from the resin with 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the cyclic peptide obtained by bromo-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBroP) activation (41Coste J. Frérot E. Jouin P. Castro B. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 1967-1970Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar) at high dilution. Compounds cyclized over a disulfide bridge, such as compounds 18–22, were obtained via air oxidation under strong agitation for 16 h at room temperature of the unprotected and cleaved linear peptide in dilute solution. Finally, compounds cyclized over an amide bond, such as compound 3, were assembled on a Merrifield resin using groups of the benzyl type for side chain and final Nαprotection, and groups of the tert-butyl type for protection of the basic and acidic side chains were involved in the cyclization. After removal of the latter groups under mild acidic conditions (50% trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2), cyclization was achieved under activation by PyBroP on the resin, and finally, the cyclic peptide was both freed from its protecting groups and cleaved from the resin by treatment with fluohydric acid. The purity of each peptide assessed by analytical reversed phase HPLC varied between 90 and 99%, and the molecular weight was confirmed by electrospray mass spectroscopy.

Human brain poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) was reversed-transcribed with oligo(dT)12–18 using reverse Transcriptase Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA (corresponding to 1 μg of total RNA) was subjected to 35 cycles of amplification using the forward primer 5′-GAGACCCAAGCTTCTGGATGGACCTGGAAGCCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GATGACGCGGCCGCTCAGGTGCCTTTGCTTTCTG-3′ (33Drozdz R. Eberle A.N. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After an initial cycle of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, polymerase chain reaction was carried out for 35 cycles with the following cycle conditions: 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 3 min with a postincubation of 72 °C for 7 min. The expected 1064-base pair fragment was isolated and ligated into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmid, pcDNA3.1-SLC1, was sequenced on both strands by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems 377). HEK293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin were seeded at 5.106 cells in a T75 cm2 culture flask. 24 h later, they were transfected with 10 μg of the pCDNA3.1-SLC1 plasmid using LipofectAMINE as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The day following transfection, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 800 μg/ml of active geneticin, and seeded at different dilutions in 96-well plates that were kept for 2–3 weeks in an humidified CO2 incubator. At the end of this selection period, isolated clones were picked, amplified, and further characterized by cAMP experiments. One positive clone was subcloned in limited dilution before being used for all the cAMP and [35S]GTPγS experiments. Intracellular cAMP was determined using the Flash plate technology (SMP004, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, forskolin (15 μm) and test peptides diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added into 96-well flash plates, and incubation was started with the addition of cells (35,000 cells per well). After 15 min at 37 °C, incubation was stopped by the addition of the revelation mix, and 2 h later, plates were counted on a TopCount (Packard Instrument Co.). Cells grown at confluency were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min (4 °C). The resulting pellet was suspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), containing 5 mm EGTA and homogenized using a Kinematica Polytron. The homogenate was then centrifuged (95,000 ×g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the resulting pellet was suspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA. Determination of protein content was performed according to the method of Lowry et al. (42Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of membrane preparations were stored at −80 °C until use. Membranes and peptides were diluted in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 3 μm GDP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml saponin). Incubation was started by the addition of 0.2 nm [35S]GTPγS to membranes (25 μg/ml) and drugs and further followed for 45 min at room temperature. For experiments with antagonists, membranes were preincubated with both the agonist and the antagonist for 30 min prior the addition of [35S]GTPγS. Nonspecific binding was defined using cold GTPγS (10 μm). Reaction was stopped by rapid filtration through GF/B filters followed by three successive washes with ice-cold buffer. Stable HEK293 cells expressing the human MCH receptor were seeded (40,000 cells per well) into 96-well black-walled culture plates coated with poly-d-lysine 24 h before assay. Cells were loaded with a calcium kit assay buffer (Molecular Devices) containing 2.5 mm probenecid and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 6% CO2 atmosphere. After 10 s, the antagonist was added. For antagonist studies, tested substances were added 10 min before the addition of MCH. Increases of intracellular Ca2+ in the presence of peptides were monitored using the fluorimetric imaging plate reader detection system (Molecular Devices) at 488 nm for 120 s. A total of 58 MCH analogues (including genuine MCH) was obtained by synthesis on solid phase with a purity of ≥90%. They included compounds cyclized over the side chain of two cysteines (cystine analogues), compounds cyclized over an amide bond between two amino acid side chains, and head-to-tail cyclic analogues (TableI). All peptides were used as tools to establish the ligand structure-activity relationships, both as agonists or antagonists, at the human MCH receptor. The HEK293 cell line stably expressing the MCH receptor was selected through MCH-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The density of the MCH receptors, as determined in saturation binding experiments using125I-labeled [3-iodo-Tyr13]MCH, was 759 ± 55 fmol/mg proteins, and the dissociation constant of the radioligand was 0.46 ± 0.11 nm (n = 3) (data not shown). As shown in Fig.1, human MCH (compound 42) strongly inhibits the forskolin-induced intracellular cAMP level. Neither the substitutions of Tyr13 by Phe13 and Val19 by Tyr19 (compounds 41) nor the iodination of Tyr13 (compound 40) significantly affected the potency of these peptides to inhibit forskolin-induced intracellular cAMP level (Fig. 1 and TableII). Salmon MCH (compound 45) was slightly less potent than human MCH in this assay (Fig. 1 and TableII). Replacement of the two cysteines by two serine residues, leading to a linear MCH analogue (compound 44), dramatically decreased the potency ∼300-fold (Fig. 1 and Table II) indicating that the cyclic part of MCH plays an essential role for activity. These MCH analogues were full agonists in the cAMP assay.Table IIAgonistic potency of shorter analogues of MCH to inhibit the forskolin-induced cAMP production and to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding at hSLC1 receptorCompoundStructure2-a"
https://openalex.org/W2052167720,"Bag1 is a regulator of heat shock protein 70 kDa (Hsp70/Hsc70) family proteins that interacts with steroid hormone receptors. Four isoforms of Bag1 have been recognized: Bag1, Bag1S, Bag1M (RAP46/HAP46), and Bag1L. Although Bag1L, Bag1M, and Bag1 can bind the androgen receptor (AR) in vitro, only Bag1L enhanced AR transcriptional activity. Bag1L was determined to be a nuclear protein by immunofluorescence microscopy, whereas Bag1, Bag1S, and Bag1M were predominantly cytoplasmic. Forced nuclear targeting of Bag1M, but not Bag1 or Bag1S, resulted in potent AR coactivation, indicating that Bag1M possesses the necessary structural features provided it is expressed within the nucleus. The ability of Bag1L to enhance AR activity was reduced with the removal of an NH2-terminal domain of Bag1L, which was found to be required for efficient nuclear localization and/or retention. In contrast, deletion of a conserved ubiquitin-like domain from Bag1L did not interfere with its nuclear targeting or AR regulatory activity. Thus, both the unique NH2-terminal domain and the COOH-terminal Hsc70-binding domain of Bag1L are simultaneously required for its function as an AR regulator, whereas the conserved ubiquitin-like domain is expendable.

Steroid receptors play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of many organs. The androgen receptor (AR)1 is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (1Evans R.M. Science.. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar). One tissue that exhibits profound dependence on the ligand for this nuclear hormone receptor is the prostate gland. In normal prostate, androgens induce production of growth factors in the stromal cells that cause growth of the luminal secretory epithelial cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Thompson T.C. Cancer Cells.. 1990; 2: 345-354Google Scholar). The AR controls gene expression programs in these epithelial cells, resulting in the expression of various proteins characteristic of the differentiated state including prostate-specific antigen (3Wolf D.A. Schulz P. Fittler F. Mol. Endocrinol... 1992; 6: 753-762Google Scholar). Tumors develop from the prostatic epithelial cells and ultimately become independent of the androgenic hormones. Endocrine therapy, either by reducing the levels of androgen or by blockading androgens at the level of the AR, usually results in a favorable clinical response and a dramatic regression of prostate cancer due to apoptotic cell death (4Westin P. Stattin P. Damber J.E. Bergh A. Am. J. Pathol... 1995; 146: 1368-1375Google Scholar). However, after an initial response to androgen ablation, the prostate cancers eventually become unresponsive if endocrine therapy is continued long term (5Lepor H. Ross A. Walsh P.C. J. Urol... 1982; 128: 335-340Google Scholar). It remains an open question whether the AR continues to play a role in hormone-independent prostate cancers. Many hormone-insensitive tumors have been found to retain a wild-type AR gene. Moreover, the AR gene is sometimes amplified, or its transcriptional activity may be increased in advanced prostate cancer (6de Vere W.R. White R. Meyers F. Chi S.G. Chamberlain S. Siders D. Lee F. Stewart S. Gumerlock P.H. Cancer Res... 1997; 57: 314-319Google Scholar). Therefore, a need exists to understand more about the factors that control the functions of the AR so that the mechanisms responsible for resistance to endocrine therapy can be revealed and eventually alleviated. In the absence of the ligand, AR and most steroid hormone receptors are maintained in an inactive state complexed with heat shock proteins. Upon binding of the cognate ligand, the receptor dissociates from the inactive complex and translocates to the nucleus in which it binds specific response elements in the promoter and/or enhancer regions of responsive genes (reviewed in Ref. 7Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1994; 63: 451-486Google Scholar). Once bound to the nuclear response element, the nuclear receptor up-regulates or down-regulates transcription by transmitting signals directly to the transcriptional machinery via direct protein-protein interactions. In addition, another class of proteins called coactivators is recruited and serves as bridging molecules between the transcription initiation complex and the nuclear receptor (reviewed in Ref. 8Freedman L.P. Cell.. 1999; 97: 5-8Google Scholar). Recently, an isoform of the human Bag1 protein (known as Bag1L) has been reported to bind the AR and enhance transcriptional activity in the presence of the ligand (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar). Bag1 contains a COOH-terminal “BAG” domain that binds the ATPase domain of heat shock protein 70 kDa (Hsp70/Hsc70) family proteins (10Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C.

Through this interaction with Hsc70, Bag1 is able to interact with a variety of intracellular proteins and regulate diverse cellular processes relevant to cancer including cell division, cell survival, and cell migration (15Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell.. 1995; 80: 279-284Google Scholar, 16Wang H.-G. Takayama S. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it is also possible that other non-Hsc70-binding domains in the NH2-terminal portion of Bag1 mediate interactions with target proteins, thus providing a mechanism for directing Hsc70 family chaperones to specific proteins in the cells. For example, Bag1 contains a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, which has been proposed to permit its direct binding to the 26 S proteosome (21Luders J. Demand J. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 4613-4617Google Scholar). However, the significance of this and other NH2-terminal regions in Bag1 for transactivation of AR or other steroid hormone receptors is unknown. It has been shown that at least four isoforms of Bag1 protein can arise from alternative initiation of translation within a common mRNA: Bag1S, Bag1, Bag1M (RAP46/HAP46), and Bag1L (22Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J... 1997; 328: 807-813Google Scholar, 23Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 3116-3131Google Scholar). These isoforms all contain the Hsc70-binding BAG domain near the COOH terminus as well as the upstream UBL domain, but they differ in the lengths of their amino-terminal regions. Additional motifs have been recognized within the NH2-terminal segment of the Bag1 proteins including candidate nuclear localization sequences (NLS) and variable numbers of TXSEEX repeat sequences (23Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 3116-3131Google Scholar, 24Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C.B. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 146: 929-940Google Scholar). Bag1L, the longest isoform, contains both an SV40-LargeT-like and nucleoplasmin-like candidate NLS preceded by a unique ∼50 amino acid-domain. This Bag1 isoform is predominantly nuclear (23Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C.

Bag1M (RAP46/HAP46) contains only a portion of the candidate NLS and has been shown to reside in the cytosol unless stimulated to traffic into the nucleus by associating with other proteins, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (24Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C.B. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 146: 929-940Google Scholar). Bag1 and the shorter and rarer isoform of Bag1S are predominantly found in the cytosol (23Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 3116-3131Google Scholar). Bag1 proteins have been reported to interact with and regulate the activity of several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. For example, Bag1M and Bag1L have been found to repress the activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (24Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C.B. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 146: 929-940Google Scholar, 25Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 11465-11469Google Scholar), and Bag1 represses the transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptors (27Liu R. Takayama S. Zheng Y. Froesch B. Chen G.-Q. Zhang X. Reed J.C. Zhang X.-K. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 16985-16992Google Scholar). Conversely, Bag1L but not Bag1M or Bag1 can potentiate the transcriptional activity of the AR (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar). In this report, we have extended structure-function analysis of Bag1 protein with respect to their regulation of the AR. The plasmids pcDNA3-Bag1L, pcDNA3-Bag1L_C, and pcDNA3-Bag1 have been described previously (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar). pcDNA3-Bag1M was generated from pcDNA3-Bag1/Bag1M (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar) by mutating the initiation codon that gave rise to Bag1 from an ATG to an ATC so that this construct now can give rise only to Bag1M. The cDNAs encoding various fragments of Bag1 were generated by polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid pcDNA3-Bag1L (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar) using the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers containingEcoRI and XhoI sites: Bag1S, 5′-GGGAATTCGCCACCATGGCGGCA-3′ (F1) and 5′-CCCTCGAGTCACTCGGCCAGGGCAAAG-3′ (R1); Bag1LΔ1–50, primer 5′-GCGGAATTCGCCACCATGACTGCCAGC-3′ (F2) and R1; Bag1LΔ1–16, 5′-GGGAATTCGAGCGGATGGGTTCCCG-3′ (F3) and R1; Bag1MΔC83, 5′-GGGAATTCATGAAGAAGAAAACCCGGCGCC-3′ (F4) and 5′-CCCCTCGAGTCAAAAACCCTGCTGGATTCCAG-3′ (R2); and Bag1C83 5′-GGGAATTCCTGCCCAAGGATTTGCAAGCTG-3′ and R1. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested withEcoRI and XhoI and then directly cloned into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Bag1S and Bag1LΔ1–50) or pcDNA3-Myc (Bag1LΔ1–16, Bag1MΔC83, and Bag1C83). The GST-Bag1 fusion proteins were generated from pGEX-4T-Bag1L, pGEX-4T-Bag1LΔC, pGEX-4T-Bag1, pGEX-4T-Bag1ΔC, pGEX-4T-Bag1M, pGEX-4T-Bag1MΔC83, and pGEX-4T-1-Bag1C83. These plasmids were all generated by subcloning the appropriate cDNAs from pcDNA3 clone into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To generate the nuclear-targeted Bag1 proteins, the appropriate cDNA was subcloned from pcDNA3 clone into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-NLS (generated by the insertion of an oligonucleotide containing the SV40-LargeT-like NLS into theHindIII-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1). The reporter pLCI plasmid contains the full-length mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat sequence linked with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (28Lee H.J. Kokontis J. Wang K.C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1993; 194: 97-103Google Scholar, 29Mowszowicz I. Lee H.J. Chen H.T. Mestayer C. Portois M.C. Cabrol S. Mauvais-Jarvis P. Chang C. Mol. Endocrinol... 1993; 7: 861-869Google Scholar). The pSG5-AR plasmid contains the cDNA for the wild-type AR (28Lee H.J. Kokontis J. Wang K.C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1993; 194: 97-103Google Scholar). The monkey kidney COS-7 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 3 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). One day prior to experiments, cells were transferred into charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum (CT-FBS) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus Phenol Red to reduce background levels of steroids. R1881 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was dissolved in ethanol and added to the cultures at a minimum dilution of 0.0001% (v/v). Control cells received an equivalent amount of solvent only. COS-7 cells at 60% confluency in 12-well plates (Nunc) were transfected by a lipofection method. 1.1 μg of DNA was diluted into 176.5 μl of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and combined with 3 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 185.5 μl of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 20 min, 0.375 ml of Opti-MEM was added, and the mixtures were overlaid onto monolayers of cells. After culturing with 5% CO2 for 5 h at 37 °C, 0.75 ml of Opti-MEM containing 20% CT-FBS was added to the cultures. At 32–36 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 0.1 nm R1881. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. For reporter gene assays, cell lysates were made as described previously (30Nielsen D.A. Chang T.C. Shapiro D.J. Anal. Biochem... 1989; 179: 19-23Google Scholar), and assays for β-galactosidase and CAT activity were performed. All transfection experiments were carried out in duplicate, repeated at least three times, and normalized for β-galactosidase activity. The AR was in vitrotranslated in reticulocyte lysates (TNT lysates, Promega) containing [35S]methionine and then preincubated with 10 nm R1881 for 30 min. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and blocked in NET-N buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 15% milk for 30 min. The immobilized GST proteins (10 μg) were incubated for 2 h with 10 μl of R1881 treated in vitro translated AR in NET-N buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, proteinase inhibitors, and 10 nm R1881. The beads were washed three times in NET-N buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then boiled in Laemmli SDS sample buffer. The use of equivalent amounts of intact GST fusion proteins and successful in vitrotranslated of the AR was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis using Coomassie Blue staining or autoradiography, respectively. Transfected COS-7 cells were fixed with a −20 °C chilled mix of methanol and acetone (1:1) for 2 min at 20 °C. After fixation the cells were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 2% FBS, and 0.1% goat serum and then incubated for 4 h at 20 °C with anti-Bag1 antibody (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) diluted 1:50 in blocking solution (31Takayama S. Kochel K. Irie S. Inazawa J. Abe T. Sato T. Druck T. Huebner K. Reed J.C. Genomics.. 1996; 35: 494-498Google Scholar). After this incubation, cells were rinsed three times for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline at 20 °C and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Dako Corp.), diluted 1:50 in blocking solution for 2 h at 37 °C. Excess secondary antibody was thoroughly washed off with phosphate-buffered saline. The slides were then treated with Mowiol containing 1,4-diazabicylo[2.2.2]octane, and glass coverslips were applied. The stained slides were observed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad 1024MP). COS-7 cells at 60% confluency in 10-cm2 plates were transiently transfected either with empty vectors or a combination of expression vectors encoding for AR, Bag1L, or Bag1 by a lipofection procedure. 10 μg of DNA was incubated with 26 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 min, and the mixtures were overlaid onto monolayers of cells. After culturing with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 5 h, 1 volume of Opti-MEM containing 20% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (CT-FBS) was added to the cultures. Cells were transferred into 24-well plates 1 day later and grown in CT-FBS medium for an additional 24 h. To determine the hormone binding affinities of the transfected AR, cells were incubated for 2 h with increasing concentrations (0.1–10 nm) of [3H]R1881 (86 ΔCi/nmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of cold R1881. Cells were then washed three times with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the counts/min of cells transfected with a control plasmid from the counts/min of samples transfected with the AR expression plasmid that was treated with the same concentration of the hormone. The results represent the means of three independent experiments. The human Bag1 protein exists as four isoforms (Fig.1 A), which all contain the same COOH-terminal Hsc70-binding domain and an upstream ubiquitin-like domain but differ in the lengths of their NH2-terminal regions (23Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 3116-3131Google Scholar). The Bag1L and Bag1M (RAP46) isoforms of the human Bag1 protein have been previously shown to bind the AR in vitro(9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar, 25Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 11465-11469Google Scholar). To determine whether other isoforms of the human Bag1 protein could interact with the AR, we performed in vitro protein interaction assays. The Bag1 isoforms were fused to GST and incubated with in vitro translated radiolabeled AR. As shown in Fig.1 B, the AR specifically interacted with Bag1L and Bag1 but not with the control proteins GST and GST-CD40. Mutants of Bag1L and Bag1, which lack the COOH-terminal Hsc70-binding domain (ΔC), were unable to interact with the AR in these assays, indicating that the BAG domain is required for interactions with the AR. Moreover, a GST-fusion protein containing only the last COOH-terminal 83 amino acids, GST-Bag1C83, was sufficient for binding to AR under these conditions (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, we conclude that the BAG domain of Bag1 protein is necessary and sufficient for associating with the AR. Although all isoforms of Bag1 interact with the AR in vitro, only the Bag1L protein significantly enhances the transcriptional activity of the AR in vivo (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar). Because the ligand-bound AR is localized to the nucleus (7Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1994; 63: 451-486Google Scholar), only isoforms of the Bag1 protein that are nuclear would be expected to enhance the transcriptional activity of the AR. Therefore, we checked the compartmentalization of the Bag1 proteins by immunofluorescence. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the various Bag1 isoforms followed by immunostaining with an anti-Bag1 monoclonal antibody and analysis by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Bag1L is exclusively a nuclear protein, whereas all other Bag1 isoforms are predominantly cytosolic (Fig. 2,left panels). These findings are consistent with the presence of both nucleoplasmin-like and SV40-LargeT-like nuclear-targeting sequence in the Bag1L protein (22Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J... 1997; 328: 807-813Google Scholar, 23Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 3116-3131Google Scholar) but not Bag1M, Bag1, or Bag1S. Although the Bag1M (RAP46/HAP46) isoform contains a region of basic residues suggestive of a nuclear targeting sequence (25Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 11465-11469Google Scholar), it is evidently transported inefficiently into the nucleus. Interestingly, the Bag1L protein may be associated with nuclear substructures given the speckled pattern of the immunofluorescence observed (Fig. 2). The difference in cellular distribution of the Bag1 proteins represents a possible explanation for the inability of the cytosolic Bag1 isoforms to enhance the transcriptional activity of the AR. To address this issue, we constructed plasmids that express Bag1L, Bag1M, Bag1, or Bag1S fused to SV40-LargeT-like nuclear-targeting sequences. Nuclear localization of these NLS-Bag1 proteins was verified by transfecting COS-7 cells with plasmids expressing the nuclear-targeting Bag1 isoforms and then immunostaining with an antibody that recognizes Bag1 (Fig. 2, right panels). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy analysis revealed that all the Bag1 isoforms are located exclusively in the nucleus of transfected cells. The effects of these nuclear-targeted Bag1 isoforms on AR transcriptional activity were then tested by transfection into COS-7 cells together with an AR-expressing plasmid and an ARE-containing reporter gene. The cells were stimulated with R1881 to activate AR. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the fusion of heterologous nuclear-targeting sequences to the 5′ end of Bag1L did not alter its ability to enhance the transcriptional activity of the AR. Targeting of Bag1M to the nucleus but not Bag1 or Bag1S was sufficient to enhance the transcriptional activity of the AR. Taken together, these results suggest that the first 70 amino acids of Bag1L are expendable for AR coactivation, whereas the NH2-terminal region of Bag1M corresponding to amino acids 71–115 of Bag1L is required in conjunction with nuclear localization for enhancing AR function. Immunoblot analysis showed that the levels of all Bag1 isoforms produced in cells (except Bag1S) were comparable to the nuclear-targeted isoforms, excluding quantitative differences in the levels of these proteins as a trivial explanation for the results (Fig.3 B). The difference in the level of expression of Bag1S and NLS-Bag1S makes it difficult to conclude that NLS-Bag1S is without effect on AR-mediated transactivation. The absence of Bag1S from the nucleus would argue against its role in transactivation. The observation that Bag1L is the only isoform that is nuclear suggests that the unique NH2-terminal domain of Bag1L might perform a role in nuclear targeting or retention. We therefore generated two NH2-terminal truncation mutants of Bag1L lacking either the first 16 amino acids of Bag1L (Bag1LΔ1–16) or retaining the nuclear-targeting sequences of Bag1L but lacking the NH2-terminal 50 amino acids that differentiate it from the Bag1M protein (Bag1LΔ1–50). Both the Bag1LΔ1–16 and Bag1LΔ1–50 proteins retain the candidate nuclear-targeting sequences of Bag1L and therefore should target to nuclei similar to Bag1L. To explore this option, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Bag1LΔ1–16, Bag1LΔ1–50, or Bag1L, and the localization of the resulting proteins was determined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Bag1L and Bag1LΔ1–16 exhibited essentially the same compartmentalization pattern within the cell (Fig. 4 B, upper panels), demonstrating a nuclear speckled pattern of immunostaining. In contrast, the Bag1LΔ1–50 protein was more promiscuous in its subcellular localization. Whereas Bag1LΔ1–50 was found in the same nuclear substructures as Bag1L, the protein was also found in a diffuse cytosolic staining pattern in transfected cells. This finding suggests that amino acids 17–50 of Bag1L may contain sequences necessary for optimal retention of Bag1L in the nucleus. To contrast these subcellular localization results with coactivation function, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the AR, an ARE-containing reporter gene, and plasmids encoding Bag1L, Bag1LΔ1–16, or Bag1LΔ1–50. The transfected cells were then stimulated with the synthetic androgen R1881. Bag1LΔ1–50 but not Bag1LΔ1–16 exhibited a decreased ability to enhance the transcriptional activity of the AR (Fig. 4 D). Taken together, these observations suggest that the correct nuclear targeting/retention of Bag1L is required for optimal functional interactions of Bag1L and the AR. To confirm this finding, we fused a nuclear-targeting sequence to Bag1L, Bag1LΔ1–16, and Bag1LΔ1–50 and transiently transfected the NLS-fusion constructs into COS-7 cells. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed that NLS-Bag1L, NLS-Bag1LΔ1–16, and NLS-Bag1LΔ1–50 exhibit essentially the same nuclear pattern within the cell (Fig. 4 B, lower panels). Targeting of Bag1L and Bag1LΔ1–16 to the nucleus did not significantly alter their effect on the AR, however, nuclear-targeting of Bag1LΔ1–50 markedly improved its ability to enhance AR transcriptional activity (Fig. 4 D). Immunoblot analysis revealed that all Bag1 isoforms were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4 C). The Bag1 protein contains a UBL domain that is conserved within the Bag1 homologues ofCaenorhabditis elegans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (32Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 781-786Google Scholar). To explore whether this region has functional significance in the enhancement of AR-mediated transcription, we constructed a deletion mutant of Bag1L lacking this region (Bag1LΔUBL) (Fig. 5 A). COS-7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing Bag1LΔUBL, AR, and an ARE-containing reporter gene plasmid and then stimulated with R1881. As illustrated in Fig. 5 B, deletion of the UBL domain from Bag1L did not alter its ability to enhance AR-mediated transcription in reporter gene assays, suggesting that this region of Bag1L is not required for functional interactions of Bag1L and the AR. Immunoblot analysis showed that the levels of Bag1LΔUBL produced in cells was comparable to Bag1L (Fig. 5 C). COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Bag1LΔUBL or Bag1L, and the localization of the resulting proteins was determined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Bag1L and Bag1LΔUBL exhibited essentially the same compartmentalization pattern within the cell (Fig. 5 D), demonstrating a nuclear speckled pattern of immunostaining. Heat shock proteins and other molecular chaperones are required for placing steroid hormone receptors into a state that is competent to bind steroid ligands (33Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Brinkmann A.O. Grootegoed J.A. Mulder E. Biochemistry.. 1992; 31: 2393-2399Google Scholar, 34Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Robins D.M. Caplan A.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 28697-28702Google Scholar). The ability of Bag1 proteins to bind and modulate the function of Hsp70/Hsc70 family molecular chaperones (10Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.J. Reed J.C. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 4887-4896Google Scholar), therefore, could conceivably alter the ability of AR to bind androgenic hormones. Therefore, we determined the hormone binding affinity of the AR in whole cells in the absence or presence of overexpressed Bag1 or Bag1L. As depicted in Fig.6 A, the presence of elevated levels of either Bag1 or Bag1L did not significantly influence the amount of hormone bound to the receptors at any of the hormone concentrations tested. In addition, as revealed by Scatchard analysis (Fig. 6, B–D), neither Bag1 nor Bag1L significantly altered the apparent equilibrium binding constant (Kd) for R1881. Therefore, Bag1L exerts its influence on AR-mediated transcription at a stage other than ligand binding. The data presented here confirm that Bag1L is the only isoform of Bag1 capable of enhancing the transcriptional activity of the AR (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar). Thus, despite evidence that Bag1M and Bag1 can interact with the ARin vitro, only Bag1L interacts with AR in cells (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar) and alters its transactivation function. Because Bag1L is the only isoform that is constitutively present in the nucleus, one possible explanation is that the higher nuclear levels of Bag1L may be responsible for its physical and functional interactions with AR complexes. Previous studies have shown that Bag1L does not alter the ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of the AR (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar). The appendage of an exogenous nuclear-targeting sequence to Bag1M, Bag1, and Bag1S is sufficient to force these proteins into the nucleus. This forced nuclear targeting bestowed upon Bag1M but not Bag1 or Bag1S the ability to coactivate the AR. Therefore, it appears that additional structural differences in Bag1L and Bag1M compared with Bag1 and Bag1S play an important role in the differential effects of these proteins on the AR. Recent papers have suggested that the TXSEEX repeat found in 8, 8, and 2 copies, respectively, in Bag1L, Bag1M, and Bag1 is required for repression of the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor (24Schneikert J. Hübner S. Martin E. Cato A.C.B. J. Cell Biol... 1999; 146: 929-940Google Scholar). Thus, these TXSEEX motifs may be important for functional collaboration of Bag1 with AR as both Bag1L and Bag1M are effective at potentiating AR function when expressed within the nucleus, whereas Bag1 is not. By deleting the NH2-terminal region of Bag1L, we demonstrated a function for this unique proline-rich domain for the first time. Subcellular localization experiments indicated that although Bag1L and Bag1LΔ1–16 were localized to nuclear substructures, Bag1LΔ1–50 protein was present diffusely throughout the cells. Therefore, the region between amino acids 17 and 50 of Bag1L was found to be required for its efficient import into nuclei or retention within the nucleus. We speculate that this NH2-terminal region of Bag1L participates in interactions with the nuclear proteins that serve to anchor Bag1L firmly in the nucleus. In contrast, deletion of the UBL domain from Bag1L did not impair subcellular targeting or functional collaboration with the AR. A wide variety of proteins have been shown to contain UBLs (reviewed in Ref.35Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol... 2000; 10: 335-342Google Scholar). These domains can mediate direct interactions with subunits of the proteosome that recognize polyubiquitin chains on proteins that have been targeted for destruction. Recently, Bag1 was reported to bind the 26 S proteosome in vitro. The UBL domain is found within all four Bag1 isoforms and is conserved in the Bag1 homologues of other species including the yeast S. pombe and the nematodeC. elegans (32Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 781-786Google Scholar), implying an evolutionarily conserved role for this domain in some aspect of Bag1 function. However, deletion of the UBL domain did not abrogate the stimulatory effect of Bag1L on AR function. Thus, whatever the function of the conserved UBL domain of Bag1 may be, it is expendable for coactivation of steroid hormone receptors. Similar to the NH2-terminal unique domain, the COOH-terminal region of Bag1 that is required for Hsc70 binding was found to be essential for potentiation of AR activity. The data reported here and elsewhere indicate that the COOH-terminal Hsc70-binding domain of Bag1 and Bag1L is required for interactions with AR in vitro and for coimmunoprecipitation of Bag1L with AR from cell lysates (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar). Moreover, we presented novel evidence here that the BAG domain of Bag1 is sufficient for association with the ARin vitro. It has therefore been postulated that the interaction of Bag1L with the AR may involve Hsp70. Hsp70/Hsc70 along with Hsp90 and Hsp56 are involved in maintaining nuclear receptors in an inactive conformation in the cytoplasm. Thus, it is possible that Hsc70/Hsp70 family molecular chaperones provide a bridge between the AR and Bag1L. Alternatively, Hsp70 and AR may compete for binding to the BAG domain as has been determined recently for Hsp70 and Raf-1 (36Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol... 2000; 2: 469-475Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones perform several important functions in the regulation of steroid hormone receptors. For example, a variety of chaperones including Hsc70/Hsp70 is required to achieve receptor conformations that are competent to bind steroid ligands. Thus, enhanced ligand binding represents one possible explanation for the mechanism by which Bag1L potentiates AR function. If true, however, we would have expected the other isoforms of Bag1 also to potentiate AR activity, given that translation and folding of the AR occurs in the cytosol where the unliganded AR resides in a complex with Hsp90 and other chaperones. Thus, the data reported here demonstrating a lack of effect of Bag1 on the ligand binding affinity of the AR are consistent with the observed differences in the ability of nuclear and cytosolic isoforms of Bag1 to enhance AR activity. In addition, because heat shock proteins sequester AR in the cytosol in an inactive state until bound by specific steroid ligands, it was also possible that Bag1 proteins might regulate cytosol to nuclear translocation of AR, however, we previously demonstrated that this is not the case (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar). Given that Bag1L does not alter the affinity of AR for steroid ligands and does not modulate nuclear translocation of AR, we speculate that it potentiates AR function either by affecting coactivator binding to AR or by altering AR affinity for DNA-binding sites. Interestingly, it has been reported that Bag1M is able to bind to DNA and stimulate basal transcription machinery directly in vitro (25Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 11465-11469Google Scholar). Thus, Bag1L interactions with AR could conceivably increase the affinity of AR-containing transcription complexes for DNA, thereby enhancing transcriptional output of AR-responsive genes. However, given that we failed to see any affect of Bag1L on the binding of the AR to an ARE in gel retardation assays (data not shown), this observation alone cannot account for the unique effects of Bag1L on AR. Taken together, the data reported here imply that at least two domains within Bag1L are important for its functional collaboration with the AR, namely the TXSEEX repeats and the COOH-terminal BAG domain, which binds Hsp70/Hsc70 family molecular chaperones. Multiple explanations can be envisioned for how these two domains might participate in the regulation of AR. For example, both of these domains might directly or indirectly bind AR. In this regard, it may be relevant that several coactivators of nuclear receptors, such as GRIP-1 and SRC-1, make multiple interactions with nuclear receptors through different domains (26Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 6164-6173Google Scholar, 37Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y.

However, it is equally probable that the BAG domain alone mediates interactions of Bag1L with AR, whereas the TXSEEX repeats associate with other proteins such as coactivators. Difficulties in producing soluble stable TXSEEX repeats alone have precluded us from distinguishing these two mechanisms to date. Another aspect of Bag1L effects on AR is that they may be indirect, involving Bag1L/Hsc70-induced conformational changes in AR that enhance its interactions with coactivators or reduce interactions with corepressors. Given that only the Bag1L isoform of Bag1 collaborates functionally with the AR, one mechanism by which tissues could alter their responsiveness to androgens is by adjusting the levels of the Bag1L protein produced. The human bag1 mRNA can generate up to four protein products through alternative mRNA translation from various canonical AUG or noncanonical CUG codons (22Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J... 1997; 328: 807-813Google Scholar, 23Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 3116-3131Google Scholar). The mouse bag1 mRNA similarly can produce up to three protein products but lack the AUG that is responsible for generating Bag1M (RAP46) (23Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 3116-3131Google Scholar). In human tissues and tumor cell lines, it has also been shown that Bag1 and Bag1L are by far the most abundant isoforms of Bag1 produced with little or no Bag1M or Bag1S present (23Takayama S. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Kitada S. Zapata J.M. Kochel K. Knee D. Scudiero D. Tudor G. Miller G.J. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 3116-3131Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas Bag1 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the organs of mice and humans, Bag1L production is tissue-specific and found predominantly in hormone-sensitive tissues, such as the testis, ovary, breast, and prostate. Also, in human tumor cell lines, levels of Bag1L tend to be highest in hormone-dependent cancers, such as prostate (AR), breast (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and lymphoid (glucocorticoid receptor) malignancies in which steroid hormones are known to play major roles in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and death. Given that Bag1L enhances the transactivation function of AR and that it has been shown to render AR less inhibitable by anti-androgenic drugs (9Froesch B.A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11660-11666Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine whether the levels of Bag1L change during the progression of prostate cancers as they undergo conversion from hormone-responsive to hormone-refractory disease.

https://openalex.org/W2025854486,"We cloned a cDNA encoding a novel synGAP, synGAP-d (GenBankTM accession numberAB016962), from a rat brain cDNA library. The clone consisted of 4801 nucleotides with a coding sequence of 3501 nucleotides, encoded a protein consisting of 1166 amino acids with >99% homology with 1092 amino acid overlaps to synGAP, and contained a 13-nucleotide insertion to the previously reported synGAP mRNAs, which suggested that the clone was a splice variant of synGAP. We also found that there are at least seven variants in the 3′ portion of the synGAP mRNA and that they encoded five different protein isoforms. The coding sequence of these C-terminal variants were classified into α1, α2, β1, β2, β3, β4, and γ, and synGAP-d was classified as the β1 form. The previously reported synGAPs (synGAP-a, -b, and -c and p135synGAP) can be classified as the α1 isoform. All isoforms were expressed specifically in the brain. Unexpectedly, the β isoform, which lacks a C-terminal PSD-95-binding motif ((S/T)XV), was more restricted to the postsynaptic density fraction than the motif-containing α1 isoform. The β isoform did not interact with PSD-95 but specifically interacted with a nonphosphorylated α subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II through its unique C-terminal tail.AB016962 We cloned a cDNA encoding a novel synGAP, synGAP-d (GenBankTM accession numberAB016962), from a rat brain cDNA library.

Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Kim J.H. Liao D. Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). There are three isoforms of synGAP proteins: synGAP-a or p135 synGAP, synGAP-b, and synGAP-c (GenBankTM accession numbersAF058789, AF048976, AF058790, and AF050183, respectively). They are different at the N termini, and p135synGAP has N-terminal and C-terminal variants (GenBankTM accession numbers AF053938and AF055883, respectively) (1Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The synGAP protein is condensed in postsynaptic density (PSD),1probably through interaction with the PDZ domains of PSD-95/SAP90 via its C-terminal amino acids. The protein negatively regulates Ras activity by stimulating GTPase activity of Ras. Activity of the synGAP is regulated by the phosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII); phosphorylation by CaMKII reduces the synGAP activity, leading to Ras activation by increasing the GTP-bound form of Ras (1Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In this respect, synGAP is a key molecule that enables cross-talking between Ca2+/calmodulin and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways. Both signaling pathways are believed to function at the postsynaptic sites in vivo (3Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Nishida E. Neurosci.

A recent study implicated Ras signaling and MAPK in the modulation of synaptic transmission (5Manabe T. Aiba A. Yamada A. Ichise T. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Katsuki M. J.

Thus, similar to the Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing factor (or Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor) (Ras-GRF or CDC25) (12Brambilla R. Gnesutta N. Minichiello L. White G. Roylance A.J. Herron C.E. Ramsey M. Wolfer D.P. Cestari V. Rossi-Arnaud C. Grant S.G. Chapman P.F. Lipp H.P. Sturani E. Klein R. Nature. 1997; 390: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), synGAP may contribute to synaptic plasticity. Neurofibromin 1 protein, aDrosophila-specific RasGAP, is involved in the learning and memory of the fruit fly (13Guo H.F. Tong J. Hannan F. Luo L. Zhong Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In this study we cloned a novel isoform of synGAP, synGAP-d, and further identified various isoforms of synGAP. We also identified the nonphosphorylated form of CaMKII α subunit as a specific binding protein of synGAP-β. cDNA λ ZAP II library from rat brain cortex and Bluescript plasmid were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); Isogen was purchased from Nippon Gene KK (Tokyo, Japan); DNase I was from Qiagen (Tokyo, Japan); RNA PCR kit (Avian Myeloblastosis Virus) version 2.1 was from Takara Co. Ltd. (Ohtsu, Japan); pGEM-T easy vector was from Promega Corporation(Madison, WI); keyhole limpet hemocyanine, protease inhibitor mixture, and anti-actin were from Sigma; Affi-Gel 10 resin was from Bio-Rad; anti-synGAP (anti-α1) (number 06-900) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-CaMKII β subunit antibody was from Life Technologies, Inc.; anti-PSD-95 (P43520) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-neurofilament (70 kDa) and anti-α-internexin were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); anti-α-tubulin, pGEX-4T-1 vector, and BL21 bacteria were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech; horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin IgG (H&L) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse Ig (G + A + M) was from Cappel (West Chester, PA); SuperSignal, SuperSignal ULTRA, and SuperSignal BLAZE chemiluminescent detection reagents for Western blotting were from Pierce; polyvinylidine difluoride membrane was from Millipore; and protein G plus/protein A-agarose was from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Peptide β (KGAAPGPPRHG) was chemically synthesized by Iwaki Glass (Funabashi, Japan). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Total RNA was isolated from the rat tissues using ISOGEN according to the manufacture's instructions. The RNA was incubated with DNase I (Qiagen) at 37 °C for 30 min and treated by Isogen again. RT-PCR was essentially followed by the protocol of the RNA PCR kit (Avian Myeloblastosis Virus) version 2.1. One microgram of total RNA was used for the RT-PCR reaction. cDNA was produced at 42 °C for 30 min, and the following PCR reaction was 28 cycles, unless stated otherwise, of 30 s of 94 °C, 30 s of 60 °C, and 1 min of 72 °C. We tested 7–35 cycles of the PCR and confirmed that the quantity of amplified synGAP gene products did not reach the saturating level at the end of 28 cycles of the reaction. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis using 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ethidium bromide. The ethidium bromide-stained images were printed by a CCD camera system (ATTO printograph, ATTO Bioscience & Technology, Tokyo, Japan). The two sets of PCR primers spanning the alternatively spliced junction in the 3′ tail portion of the synGAP were synthesized. Primer set 1 corresponded to nucleotides 4500–4519 (5′ primer, 5′-AGAAGCGCTTGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 4658–4639 (3′-primer, 5′-GTCGAGCAGCCTCTTCTTGG-3′) of the synGAP-d cDNA, and primer set 2 corresponded to nucleotides 4319–4339 (5′ primer, 5′-TACTCGAAGTCCATGGACGAG-3′) and 4707–4687 (3′ primer, 5′-TCACACGCGGGTTTGTTGGAC-3′) of the synGAP-d cDNA. Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-GCTGTGGGCAAGGTCATC-3′ and 5′-CCTGGTCCTCAGTGTAGC-3′ (sense and antisense, respectively); those for rat ninjurin2 (GenBankTM accession number AF250322) were 5′-ATGGAGTCAGACCGAGAAATC-3′ and 5′-AGCCGCATGGCATTGGAC-3′ (sense and antisense, respectively). cDNAs corresponding to amino acid residues 729–1166 of synGAP-d protein, amino acid residues 787–1249 of synGAP-b protein, the C-terminal 21-amino acid portion of synGAP-β, the C-terminal 48-amino acid portion of synGAP-α2, and the C-terminal 35-amino acid portion of synGAP-γ were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector. The constructs were transfected into BL21 cells, and transcription was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or Western blotting. Antiserum specific to PSD protein was produced by immunizing a rabbit using whole PSD proteins as immunogen after sonicating the protein to maximally unfold the PSD structures. Peptide β, the C-terminal peptide of synGAP-β with N-terminally added lysine (KGAAPGPPRHG), was immobilized to keyhole limpet hemocyanine and used to immunize a rabbit to generate antiserum. Anti-synGAP-β antibody (anti-β) was affinity-purified by the peptide β immobilized to Affi-Gel 10. Anti-CaMKII antibody and anti-phosphorylated CaMKII peptide antibody were produced as reported previously (14Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Tanaka R. Tada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Ogura A. Kudo Y. Tanaka R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PSD proteins were solubilized at 4 °C for 2 h in a low stringent buffer (16Suen P.C. Wu K. Xu J.L. Lin S.Y. Levine E.S. Black I.B. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 59: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or at 4 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2% SDS, 50 mmNaF, 100 μm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (solubilization buffer). In the latter case, five volumes of dilution buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 (17Lau L.-F. Mammen A. Ehlers A.D. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21622-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) were further added and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, incubated at 4 °C for 3 h or overnight with antibodies, and then mixed for 2 h with protein G plus/protein A-agarose. Alternatively, the supernatant was incubated with antibody immobilized chemically to protein G plus/protein A-agarose. The gel was pelleted and washed three times, and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk, incubated with antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, and immunostained using the chemiluminescent substrate. Chemiluminescence was captured and visualized with a CCD video camera system (Atto Densitograph Lumino CCD AE-6930, ATTO Bioscience & Technology, Tokyo, Japan). PSD proteins (20 μg) were solubilized by boiling for 5 min in the solubilization buffer (see above) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, five volumes of Triton X-100-containing dilution buffer were added, and the mixture incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with peptide β coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (bed volume, 5 μl). The gel was washed four times by brief centrifugation and aspiration. The pull-down proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were analyzed by silver staining or Western blotting. Whole cerebral neocortices of embryonic day 18 rats (Sprague-Dawley) were mechanically dissociated and plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated dishes at a lower density (500–800 cells/mm2). Cortical neurons were grown with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mmpure glutamine (Ajinomoto, Tokyo, Japan), 2% fetal bovine serum, nutrient mixture N2, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.3) (18Narisawa-Saito M. Carnahan J. Araki K. Yamaguchi T. Nawa H. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The following day the original medium was replaced by the medium lacking serum (serum-free N2 medium). Cells (15 days on culture) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as described previously (18Narisawa-Saito M. Carnahan J. Araki K. Yamaguchi T. Nawa H. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and stained with rabbit anti-β, anti-PSD-95, or anti-synaptophysin antibody combined with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. They were examined and photomicrographed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Synaptic plasma membrane fraction of the forebrain was prepared from Wistar rats (6 weeks old, male) by the method of Cohen et al. (19Cohen R.S. Blomberg F. Berzins K. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 181-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) with modification by Wuet al. (20Wu K. Carlin R. Siekevitz P. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the PSD fraction was successively prepared as described previously (14Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Tanaka R. Tada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki T. Usuda N. Ishiguro H. Mitake S. Nagatsu T. Okumura-Noji K. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 61: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The postsynaptic raft (or dendritic raft) fraction (22Suzuki T. Ito J. Takagi H. Saitoh F. Nawa H. Shimizu H. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 89: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was obtained as a band between 0.32 and 1.0m sucrose after sucrose gradient centrifugation to obtain the PSD fraction. P1 (fraction containing nuclei and cell debris), P2 (crude mitochondrial fraction), and Syn (synaptosomal fraction) were obtained during PSD isolation. Protein from these fractions was assayed using the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. All preparations were stored at −80 °C until use. Antiserum specific to PSD protein was produced by immunizing a rabbit using whole PSD protein as the immunogen. The antibody recognized a number of proteins in the PSD fraction and relatively few proteins in the other subcellular fractions prepared from the brain, and it did not cross-react with Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal proteins of other tissues such as the liver (data not shown). We used this antibody for the initial screening of the cDNA library. About 500,000 plaques of the λZAP cDNA library were plated and screened at first, and we obtained five different clones, of which three DNA sequences were identical to the fodrin α subunit, plectin, and neurofilament H subunit, and one of which, clone 601, had not previously been reported in the initial data base. We proceeded with the cloning using clone 601 cDNA as a probe and obtained three independent cDNAs, 6011, 6012, and 6013. Finally, we obtained the sequence of 601f by compiling the 601, 6011, 6012, and 6013 clones (Fig.1 a). 601f DNA was 4801 bases long and contained a 3501-base open reading frame (1124–4624). The nucleotide sequence of the coding region had a >99% identity in >1092 amino acid overlaps with those of various types of synGAPs. Therefore, we named the clone synGAP-d (GenBankTM accession number AB016962). The synGAP-d protein most resembled synGAP-b (GenBankTM accession numberAF058790), and the differences between the two proteins are illustrated in Fig. 1 (b and c). SynGAP-b protein was 58 amino acids longer than synGAP-d in the N terminus (Fig.1 c). Ala61 and Ala62 in the synGAP-b were replaced by Tyr and Phe, respectively, in the synGAP-d. SynGAP-d had deletions of two amino acids, Val1136 and Lys1137, shown in synGAP-b. SynGAP-d mRNA had an insertion of 13 nucleotides near the 3′ tail of the coding sequence, which made a frameshift, producing a C-terminal tail completely different from that of synGAP-b (Fig. 1 b). A splice variant with this 13-base nucleotide had also been reported in p135synGAP by Chen et al. (1Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession numberAF055883). The C-terminal of the synGAP-d lacked the (S/T)XV motif, an association motif with PSD-95. The synGAP-d had a pleckstrin homology domain, a C2 domain, a GAP domain, and a Pro-rich domain as found in other synGAP proteins. The presence of synGAP-b and synGAP-d mRNAs was confirmed by RT-PCR in the total RNA prepared from the rat forebrain. Two primer sets, sets 1 and 2, used for the RT-PCR were located surrounding the 13-oligonucleotide insert in the synGAP-d (Fig. 2 a). RT-PCR using primer sets 1 and 2 produced two and three major bands, respectively (Fig. 3 a). We purified these bands by extracting the DNA from the cut bands, subcloned them into pGEM-T easy vector (Fig. 3 b), and determined their nucleotide sequences. Unexpectedly, we obtained seven different sequences with minor differences. These seven synGAP clones of 3′ tail coding sequences were classified based on sequence similarity and named systematically as synGAP-α (α1 and α2), β (β1, β2, β3, and β4), and γ, as shown in Fig. 2 a. We omitted “d” from the names, because this classification might also be used in other synGAP isoforms in addition to synGAP-d. The presence of synGAP-α2, which was longer than the end point of the 3′ primer, was confirmed by RT-PCR using a different 3′ primer, which hybridized to the far 3′ portion (data not shown), and was supported by the finding that synGAP-α2 produced a C-terminal tail with 11 amino acid sequences extremely similar to those of human RasGAP and nGAP (GenBankTM accession number AL035702 and AF047711, respectively). The single base g insertion seen in the α2, β1, β2, and β4 may not be an artificial by-product produced by PCR, because this insertion was found in the 6013 clone. SynGAP-a, -b, and -c, with common C-terminal sequences, can also be named as synGAP-aα1, synGAP-bα1, and synGAP-cα1, respectively, when adopting the present classification.Figure 3Separation of alternatively spliced variants of synGAP cDNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a, RT-PCR using RNA isolated from the rat forebrain as a template.

There are at least four synGAP proteins in which the C-terminal tails were different. The C-terminal (S/T)XV motif, a PDZ-binding motif, was present only in the synGAP-α1 protein. All of the β isoform proteins showed the same C-terminal tail sequence, which was the same as that found in the C terminus of p135synGAP (1Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Expression of synGAP variants was examined in various tissues by RT-PCR using two different primer sets (Fig. 4). All of the synGAP variants were specifically expressed in the brain. The expression of the γ form was extremely low compared with those of α and β, and bands close to but slightly larger than the γ band were detected in the PCR of non-neuronal tissues. Expression profiles of synGAP-α and β were similar between the forebrain and cerebellum, whereas the expression levels of both genes in the cerebellum were lower than those in the forebrain. Developmental changes in the expression of synGAP variants were examined in the rat forebrain by RT-PCR (Fig.5). The level of synGAP mRNAs was as high as the adult level 1 day and 1 week after birth. The assay condition was judged to be appropriate because expression of the nerve injury-induced protein (ninjurin) (24Araki T. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 353-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Araki T. Milbrandt J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) assayed under the same conditions showed developmental change with a gradual increase, saturating at 6 weeks after birth. Amplified synGAP gene products did not reach the saturating level at the end of 28 cycles of PCR. Before using anti-β in immunochemical and immunocytochemical studies, we first tested the specificity of the antibody by Western blotting (Fig.6). Anti-β reacted specifically with the expressed GST-synGAP-β1 C-terminal half protein but not with the expressed GST-C-terminal half synGAP-α protein (Fig. 6 a). The antibody also reacted with the GST 21-amino acid C-terminal peptide of synGAP-β but not with GST itself, the GST-α2 C-terminal peptide, nor the GST-γ C-terminal peptide (Fig. 6 b). Thus, the anti-β specifically reacted with the C-terminal tail portion of synGAP-β. Anti-synGAP antibody purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (termed here as anti-α1) reacted with the GST C-terminal half synGAP-α1 protein but not with the GST C-terminal half synGAP-β protein, the GST-α2-C-terminal peptide, nor the GST-γ C-terminal peptide (Fig. 6). Thus, these antibodies reacted mutually exclusively and specifically to synGAP-α1 and -β, respectively. Then we examined the subcellular distribution of synGAP-α1 and -β (Fig. 7). Both antibodies detected bands in the 130 kDa region that were considered to be synGAP proteins. The distribution of synGAP-β was highly restricted in the PSD fraction, which was confirmed by the picture taken at higher sensitivity (Fig. 7 b, lower panel). SynGAP-α1 was also highly enriched in the PSD but was also detected, although the content was low, in the other subcellular fractions: postsynaptic (or dendritic) raft, synaptic plasma membrane, synaptosome, and P2 and P1 fractions. The distribution patterns of PSD-95 and the CaMKII α subunit verified the subcellular fractionation, with both proteins being enriched in the PSD fraction. Next we examined the intracellular distributions of the synGAP-α1 and -β in cultured neurons (Fig. 8). Immunoreactivity for synGAP-β was localized in the dendrites including spines and co-localized with PSD-95, a postsynaptic marker in the forebrain (26Garner C.C. Kindler S. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 429-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Their co-localization in the spines was shown typically in Fig. 8 (insets in a andb). The distribution of synGAP-β and synaptophysin, a presynaptic marker (27Grabs D. Bergmann M. Schuster T. Fox P.A. Brich M. Gratz M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1765-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was compared by double immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 8 c). Synaptophysin immunoreactivity was distributed in a patch-like pattern and localized in close proximity to synGAP-β. Patchy stainings of synaptophysin are believed to be localization of presynaptic terminals. Thus, the postsynaptic localization of synGAP-β was indicated by immunostaining of cultured cortical neurons as well. SynGAP-α1 possessed the C-terminal (S/T)XV motif, which was suggested to bind to the first or second PDZ domain of the PSD-95 protein (28Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Therefore, synGAP-α1 is suggested to be anchored to PSD with intervention by PSD-95. Unexpectedly, synGAP-β was more restricted to the PSD fraction than synGAP-α1, although synGAP-β lacked the PSD-95-binding motif (Fig. 7). This finding suggested searching the synGAP-β-binding protein(s) in the PSD proteins. We first tested the interaction of the synGAP-β with PSD-95 in the PSD by co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig.9). SynGAP-α1, but not synGAP-β, was co-precipitated when PSD proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-PSD-95 antibody. In reverse, PSD-95 was co-precipitated when PSD proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-α1 but not when they were immunoprecipitated with anti-β. Next we surveyed the binding protein(s) by a co-immunoprecipitation study (Fig. 10 a). In this case, we adopted the solubilization method of Lau et al.(17Lau L.-F. Mammen A. Ehlers A.D. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21622-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), because this method enabled the efficient solubilization of PSD proteins and also the maintenance, in part, of the undissociated functional protein complexes. In fact, this method solubilized PSD proteins nearly completely (data not shown). Thus, this solubilization method was judged to be the most appropriate for the immunoprecipitation of PSD proteins. We used antibody immobilized chemically to agarose gel, because otherwise immunoglobulin heavy and light chains hindered detection of some proteins in the polyacrylamide gel. We tested some cytoskeletal proteins and PSD-enriched proteins by Western blotting. The CaMKII α subunit, β-actin, and α-internexin were co-immunoprecipitated with synGAP-β. The amounts of these co-immunoprecipitated proteins were low compared with synGAP-β, probably because of dissociation of the functional complexes, to some extent, after solubilization of PSD proteins with SDS. These proteins were not precipitated when using only protein G plus/protein A-agarose gel that was treated in a similar way to immobilize the antibody to the gel. Thus, these precipitations were judged to be specific. The α-tubulin and CaMKII β subunit were not co-immunoprecipitated with synGAP-β. Finally we searched the direct binding partner using the pull-down method (Fig. 10 b). When solubilizing, PSD proteins were completely dissociated to monomeric conditions by boiling in the presence of SDS and dithiothreitol (17Lau L.-F. Mammen A. Ehlers A.D. Kindler S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21622-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This method enabled the detection of a direct binding partner alone. We first detected the pull-down materials separated in a polyacrylamide gel by silver staining and found that only one 50-kDa protein, comigrating with the CaMKII α subunit in the PSD fraction, was pulled down (Fig.10 b, left panel). We then confirmed the pull-down material as a CaMKII α subunit by Western blotting. α-Internexin and β-actin were not detected, which was different from the findings of the co-immunoprecipitation study (Fig. 10 a). The CaMKII β subunit was not bound to peptide β. The binding of the CaMKII α subunit was judged to be specific because the band was not observed when using only Affi-Gel or when free peptide β (500 μg/tube) was added during the pull-down. We next examined the effect of CaMKII autophosphorylation on the CaMKII α subunit binding to peptide β. CaMKII in the PSD fraction was autophosphorylated in the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin and incubated with peptide β immobilized to Affi-Gel 10, as shown in Fig. 10 b. Autophosphorylation of the CaMKII was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-phosphorylated CaMKII peptide antibody (Fig. 11, PSD panels). The autophosphorylated CaMKII α subunit was not pulled down by peptide β, under similar conditions where the nonphosphorylated CaMKII α subunit was pulled down (Fig. 11, Pulldown panels). We have cloned a novel gene, synGAP-d, that encodes a synGAP isoform with an unique C-terminal 21-amino acid sequence. The cloned synGAP-d was most similar to synGAP-b except for the N-terminal and C-terminal tail sequences. SynGAP-d protein is 58 amino acids shorter than synGAP-b in the N terminus and has a replacement near the N terminus, and synGAP-d DNA has a deletion of six nucleotides near the C-terminal portion of the protein and an insertion of 13 nucleotides in the 3′ portion of its coding sequence; this causes a frameshift and produces a 21-amino acid-long C-terminal sequence unique to the synGAP-d. We also found that there are various synGAP isoforms of which the C-terminal portions are unique. Three isoforms of the synGAP protein with different N-terminal sequences have been reported: synGAP-a (identical to p135synGAP), -b, and -c (1Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Kim J.H. Liao D. Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 c). p135synGAP possesses putative splice variants with insertions in the N-terminal or C-terminal region (1Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The present finding increases the repertoire of the synGAP protein isoforms. We classified and named the synGAP isoforms identified in this study based on the types of differences (Fig. 2). We omit “a,” “b,” “c,” or “d” from the names. All these a, b, and c isoforms are N-terminal variants as shown in Fig. 1 c, whereas the C-terminal sequences are common to all of these variants. Variation in the C terminus found in synGAP-d may exist in combination with these N-terminal variations, because this C-terminal variation has also been reported in p135synGAP (1Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and synGAP-d, and anti-β-immunoreactive bands with slightly different molecular sizes were detected as shown in Fig. 10 a. Heterogeneity of the synGAP proteins may add differential roles to these proteins in various brain regions. Furthermore we identified a specific binding protein for the synGAP-β isoform as a CaMKII α subunit. The C-terminal portion of synGAP proteins is important, especially for their targeting to specific sites in the neuronal cells, because previously reported synGAP possesses the (S/T)XV motif in the C-terminal end, and the protein interacts with the first or second PDZ domain of PSD-95 via this motif. Thus, the (S/T)XV motif-containing synGAPs can be localized to PSD through this interaction. The difference in the binding partners between the (S/T)XV motif-containing synGAP and the synGAP-β form may explain the difference in their subcellular distribution. Unexpectedly, the (S/T)XV motif-lacking β isoform was more restricted to the PSD fraction than the (S/T)XV motif-containing synGAP, which suggested that there should be a specific binding molecule in the PSD fraction. In fact, the unique synGAP-β C-terminal sequence was found to bind to the CaMKII α subunit, which was a well known PSD protein (14Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Tanaka R. Tada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, synGAP-β isoforms may be concentrated in the PSD fraction through binding to the CaMKII α subunit. The interaction between the CaMKII α subunit and the synGAP−β form could be regulated by synaptic activity, because peptide β did not interact with the autophosphorylated α subunit of CaMKII (Fig. 11). The present findings, together with previous observations (1Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Kim J.H. Liao D. Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), suggest that both the (S/T)XV motif-containing synGAP and the β isoform are localized in the postsynaptic sites including spines. Close interaction of synGAP-β with the CaMKII α subunit may have specific functional significance in addition to that as a substrate for CaMKII. The functional significance of this interaction awaits further study."

To more clearly define the structural and mechanistic bases for substrate specificity of human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase, kinetics of excision and DNA binding activities were measured for several different damaged and undamaged purines within identical DNA sequence contexts. We found that1,N 6-ethenoadenine (εA) and hypoxanthine (Hx) were excised relatively efficiently, whereas 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, O 6-methylguanine, adenine, and guanine were not. Single-turnover kinetics of excision of Hx and εA paired with T showed that excision of Hx was about four times faster than εA, whereas binding assays showed that the binding affinity was about five times greater for εA than for Hx. The opposing pyrimidine base had a significant effect on the kinetics of excision and DNA binding affinity of Hx but a small effect on those for εA. Surprisingly, replacing a T with a U opposite Hx dramatically reduced the excision rate by a factor of 15 and increased the affinity by a factor of 7–8. The binding affinity of human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase to a DNA product containing an abasic site was similar to that for an Hx lesion.

The binding affinity of human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase to a DNA product containing an abasic site was similar to that for an Hx lesion. The base excision repair pathway provides the cell with a major line of defense against damage to DNA bases by excising damaged bases and resynthesizing DNA. Base excision repair is initiated by the activity of DNA glycosylases, which function to identify and excise damaged bases. Because these enzymes recognize DNA base damage, they are key to the overall effectiveness of the pathway. Monofunctional DNA glycosylases such as human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (hAAG)1 excise damaged DNA bases by hydrolysis of the C1′-N glycosylic bond, forming a free DNA base and an abasic sugar residue. Once the damaged base is removed, other enzymes in the pathway remove the remaining sugar residue and resynthesize DNA to fill in the gap. DNA glycosylases are damage-specific; different enzymes are responsible for excising different types of damaged DNA bases. Some glycosylases such as uracil DNA glycosylase are very specific and excise only a single damaged base, uracil, in this case. Other DNA glycosylases have broader substrate specificities. For example, formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FaPy) recognizes oxidative damage to DNA bases and excises 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), FaPy, and 5-hydroxycytosine. Based on both structural (for recent reviews, Refs. 1Mol C.D. Parikh S.S. Putnam C.D. Lo T.P. Tainer J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct... 1999; 28: 101-128Google Scholar, 2McCullough A.K.

Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 952-963Google Scholar) data, DNA glycosylases are believed to “flip” damaged nucleotides out of the DNA helix and into an enzyme active site, where catalysis takes place. Given this type of flipping mechanism, it is easy to imagine how a DNA glycosylase may recognize a specific damaged DNA base through interactions in the active site that provide a “tight” fit and align the glycosylic bond for chemistry. For DNA glycosylases with broader substrate specificities, the nature of the structural interactions and mechanisms that provide specificity are less clear. We are interested in the mechanisms by which DNA glycosylases are able to efficiently identify and excise damaged DNA bases. Alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (also referred to as 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase and N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase) is the only glycosylase identified to date in human cells that excises alkylation-damaged bases. This glycosylase has been shown to have a broad substrate specificity and has been reported to excise at least 12 different damaged bases including 3-methyladenine (5Chakravarti D. Ibeanu G.C.

Ellenberger T.E. Samson L.D. Bioessays.. 1999; 21: 668-676Google Scholar). These damaged purine bases are structurally diverse and contain modifications to both the major and minor groove sides of base pairs as well as to groups involved in base pairing. For example, the methyl group of 3-methyladenine projects into the minor groove, whereas that of 7-methylguanine projects into the major groove, but neither of these methyl groups interrupts hydrogen bonding interactions with its base pairing partner. On the other hand, hydrogen-bonding interactions are disrupted for ethenoadenine and the etheno adducts of guanine. Deamination of adenine to form hypoxanthine alters base pairing and converts a Watson-Crick base pair with T to a wobble base pair, whereas 8-oxoG is still capable of forming a Watson-Crick base pair with C. Given these different base and base pair structures, it is difficult to formulate one model for the structural and mechanistic bases of recognition and excision of these chemically diverse substrates. To begin to define the mechanistic basis for substrate recognition and excision by hAAG, kinetics of excision and DNA binding affinities were measured for DNA containing different damaged DNA bases within the same sequence context. In addition, the effects on excision rates and binding constants of varying the base paired with a damaged DNA base were examined. Although the alkylated DNAs processed by hAAG appear to have few characteristics in common, the goal of our experiments is to determine whether there are common underlying structural features that are recognized by hAAG. Base excision and DNA binding by hAAG were measured for more than 20 different base pair combinations. Fig.1 illustrates structures of some of the base pairs that were incorporated into DNA substrates. We found ethenoadenine (εA) and hypoxanthine (Hx) to be the most efficiently excised; however, excision of Hx was affected dramatically by its base-pairing partner. Synthetic oligonucleotides were either purchased from Fisher-Genosys or made on an Applied Biosystems, Inc. 392 DNA synthesizer using standard β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry and reagents from Glen Research. Oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concentrations of purified single-stranded oligonucleotides were determined from absorbances measured at 260 nm using extinction coefficients calculated for each oligonucleotide at 260 nm (18Secrist III, J.A. Barrio J.R. Leonard N.J. Weber G. Biochemistry.. 1972; 11: 3499-3506Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient used for εA was 5000m−1 cm−1(extinction coefficient for1,N 6-ethenoadenosine (19Secrist III, J.A. Barrio J.R. Leonard N.J. Weber G. Biochemistry.. 1972; 11: 3499-3506Google Scholar)), and extinction coefficients for εA dinucleotides were estimated to be the average of mononucleotide extinction coefficients. For Hx, extinction coefficients for A and A dinucleotides were used, and forO 6-methylguanine (O6-MeG) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), extinction coefficients for G and G dinucleotides were used. The overall error in oligonucleotide extinction coefficients contributed by using estimated values for Hx, O6-MeG, and 8-oxoG is small because the damaged base is only 1 out of 25 total nucleotides. All oligonucleotides were 25 nucleotides in length and of identical sequence (5′-GCGTCAAAATGTDGGTATTTCCATG-3′) except for the central damaged base (D). Duplex DNA substrates were made by annealing labeled oligonucleotides to an equal concentration of unlabeled complementary oligonucleotides. Annealed duplexes were typically prepared at 20 times greater concentrations than used in excision or binding assays and then diluted directly into assay mixtures without further purification. A deletion mutant of hAAG that is missing the first 79 amino acids from the N terminus (hAAGΔ79) was used in all assays. Deletion of this unconserved N-terminal region has been shown to have no effect on either base excision or DNA binding activities of the enzyme (7O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1993; 21: 5561-5569Google Scholar, 20Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G. Mitra S. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 580-589Google Scholar,21Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell.. 1998; 95: 249-258Google Scholar), but the truncated enzyme is more soluble at low ionic strength. A catalytically inactive mutant, hAAGΔ79E125Q, containing a single point mutation, Glu-125 → Gln, was used in DNA binding assays. Both hAAGΔ79 and hAAGΔ79E125Q were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (21Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell.. 1998; 95: 249-258Google Scholar). Base excision was measured using a chemical cleavage/gel assay. DNA strands containing a damaged DNA base were 5′-end-labeled with 32P and annealed to a complementary strand. Excision reactions were performed by incubating hAAGΔ79 with a DNA substrate at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 9.5% v/v glycerol. Typical reaction mixtures contained 400 nm hAAGΔ79 and 50 nm duplex DNA. At several time points during the course of excision reactions, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was quenched in 0.2 m NaOH (final concentration) and heated at 90 °C for 5 min to cleave DNA products containing apurinic sites. After heating, samples were diluted with 2 volumes of loading buffer consisting of 95% formamide and 20 mm EDTA. Unreacted substrates were separated from cleaved products by electrophoresis on 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. DNA binding was measured in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The DNA strand containing the damaged base was 5′-end-labeled with 32P and annealed to a complementary strand containing either T, C, or U opposite the damaged base. Labeled oligos (50 nm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of hAAG for 10 min at 4 °C, diluted with loading buffer, and loaded directly onto a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C for 180 min at 8 V/cm. The EMSA assay buffer was identical to the buffer used in excision assays and contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 9.5% v/v glycerol. The fraction of DNA bound by hAAG was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Apparent binding constants (Kd,app) for hAAG binding to DNA substrates were calculated using Equation 1 for a simple two-state binding model where Eo is the total enzyme concentration, Do is the total DNA concentration, and ED total is the total concentration of all enzyme-bound species (see Equation 3 under “Results”). [EDtotal]=Eo+Do+Kd,app−(Eo+Do+Kd,app)2−4EoDo2Equation 1 A survey was done of the excision activity of hAAG on several different damaged and undamaged DNA bases to determine which of these bases were most efficiently excised by hAAG. Damaged DNA bases were incorporated at a single site in the center of synthetic oligonucleotides 25 nucleotides in length using standard β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry. Duplex DNA substrates were made by annealing to the complementary oligonucleotide and were identical in sequence except for the central “damaged” base pair. Excision activity was measured in time course assays by incubating these 32P-labeled DNA substrates (50 nm) with hAAGΔ79 (400 nm) at 37 °C for periods up to 160 min. A chemical cleavage/gel assay was used to measure the amount of excision of each damaged base at several times during the course of the excision reaction. In this assay, DNA products containing apurinic sites were chemically cleaved by heating in 0.2m NaOH at 90 °C for 5 min. Cleaved DNA products were then separated from uncleaved substrates by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitated by phosphorimaging. Time courses for excision of several of the bases that were tested as substrates are shown in Fig. 2 (see Fig. 1 for structures of base pairs). Of the damaged DNA bases tested, Hx and εA were excised most efficiently; excision of Hx was nearly complete in 10 min, and excision of εA was nearly complete in 80 min. In contrast, significant excision of 8-oxoG and O6-MeG did not occur over a period of 160 min. Changing the base opposite 8-oxoG and O6-MeG from C to T did not affect excision rates (data not shown). It has been reported that hAAG is capable of excising undamaged purines (16Berdal K.G. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 363-367Google Scholar, 17Wyatt M.D. Allan J.M. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T.E. Samson L.D. Bioessays.. 1999; 21: 668-676Google Scholar); however, under our assay conditions, significant excision of A and G were not observed when present as correct pairs or when present as G·T and A·C mispairs. The kinetics of excision of εA and Hx were examined in more detail. Because excision kinetics were extremely slow under steady-state kinetic conditions and the enzyme loses activity with prolonged incubation at 37 °C, single turnover kinetics of excision were measured (note: when hAAG is incubated with DNA under conditions where DNA binding occurs, the enzyme is protected from inactivation at 37 °C 2C. W. Abner and L. B. Bloom, unpublished information. ). For these assays, the 25-nucleotide DNA duplex substrates above containing a central εA·T or Hx·T base pair were used. In these experiments, 50 nm DNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of hAAGΔ79 up to 800 nm in separate reactions. Aliquots were withdrawn at several time points during each reaction, quenched with 0.2 m NaOH, and analyzed by the chemical cleavage/gel assay method described above. For each concentration of hAAGΔ79, two or three separate time course reactions were performed. The averages and S.D. for time courses at 400, 600, and 800 nmconcentrations of hAAGΔ79 are plotted in Fig.3. For both damaged base pairs, εA·T and Hx·T, reaction time courses are essentially the same at these three enzyme concentrations, demonstrating that the concentration of enzyme is saturating, and reaction kinetics are not a function of enzyme-substrate binding rates. Individual time course reactions at each enzyme concentration were fit to an exponential rise (Equation 2) to determine values forkobs. y=a(1−e−kobst)Equation 2 For εA, kobs values were 0.080 ± 0.003, 0.075 ± 0.001, and 0.076 ± 0.001 min−1 for duplicate measurements at concentrations of 400, 600, and 800 nm enzyme, respectively. Calculated values of kobs were 4–5 times greater for Hx and were 0.31 ± 0.01, 0.32 ± 0.01, 0.37 ± 0.01 min−1 for triplicate measurements at 400, 600, and 800 nm enzyme, respectively. To determine whether the base paired opposite εA or Hx had any effect on the efficiency of hAAG-catalyzed excision, thymidine (T) was replaced with both 2′-deoxycytidine (C) and 2′-deoxyuridine (U). The pyrimidine base paired opposite the damaged base had a larger effect on excision of Hx than on excision of εA. Time course assays (Fig. 4) were done in duplicate using 400 nm hAAG and 50 nm “damaged” DNA as above. Replacing T with a C resulted in little if any effect on the observed rate (kobs) of excision of εA, which was 0.066 min−1, but decreasedkobs for Hx by a factor of about 5 to 0.062 min−1. Surprisingly, replacing T with U resulted in a decrease in the rates of excision of both εA and Hx. Again, the effect on the rate of excision of εA was smaller and was reduced by a factor of 1.7 to 0.045 min−1. Excision of Hx was reduced by a factor of about 15 to 0.022 min−1 when T was replaced with U. As a control, the DNA strand that contained U was labeled, and excision was measured in assays using both hAAGΔ79 and E. coli uracil DNA glycosylase. No uracil DNA glycosylase activity was observed in reactions with hAAGΔ79, whereas quantitative excision of U was seen in reactions with uracil DNA glycosylase (data not shown). The effect of replacing T with U is striking because U differs from T in that it simply lacks the 5-methyl group, which extends into the major groove. To determine whether a 5-methyl group affects base excision by hAAG, C was replaced with 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) in base pairs with εA and Hx. In this case, the 5-methyl group had no effect, and excision was the same for base pairs with C and 5-MeC (data not shown). To better define the interactions between hAAG and different damaged DNA bases, the binding affinity of hAAG to DNA duplexes containing different damaged DNA bases was measured. For these experiments, a catalytically inactive mutant of hAAG, hAAGΔ79E125Q, was used so that binding to DNA substrates could be measured in the absence of excision. In this mutant, glutamic acid 125 was replaced by glutamine. This Glu residue has been proposed to act as a general base to activate water for hydrolysis of the glycosylic bond (21Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell.. 1998; 95: 249-258Google Scholar). In excision assays with εA and Hx paired opposite T, hAAGΔ79E125Q was unable to excise either εA or Hx over a period of 80 min under conditions as in Fig. 2 (data not shown). To determine whether the mutation of Glu-125 to Gln affected binding activity, binding of “wild type” hAAGΔ79 and hAAGΔ79E125Q to DNA duplexes containing an εA·T base pair was measured. Incubation of hAAGΔ79 with εA-containing DNA at 4 °C significantly reduces the rate of excision of εA, so that binding to this substrate can be measured in the absence of significant product formation. The same 25-nucleotide duplex DNA substrates used in excision assays were used in binding assays, and the DNA strand containing the damaged base was 5′-end-labeled with 32P. Binding experiments were done by incubating the εA·T-containing DNA duplex with different concentrations of enzyme at 4 °C for 10 min. After 10 min, an aliquot of these reaction mixtures was removed and analyzed using an EMSA. Two additional aliquots of each reaction mixture were removed: the first, when the EMSA gel was loaded, and the second, after the gel was completed. These additional aliquots were immediately quenched with 0.2 m NaOH and analyzed to determine the amount of excision of εA that occurred during the time course of the EMSA. Results from EMSAs are shown in Fig.5 A for hAAGΔ79 and Fig.6 A (upper panel) for hAAGΔ79E125Q. Binding isotherms for the wild type and catalytically inactive mutant are virtually identical (Fig.5 B), indicating that the point mutation reduces excision activity but has little if any effect on DNA substrate binding. For wild type hAAGΔ79, only about 16% of the substrates were converted to abasic DNA products during the time course of the EMSA at the highest enzyme concentration.Figure 6Binding of hAAG Δ79E125Q to DNA containing1,N 6-ethenoadenine and hypoxanthine base pairs. DNA duplexes containing εA or Hx paired with T, C, or U were incubated with increasing concentrations of hAAGΔ79E125Q. Assays contained 50 nm DNA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 9.5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. A, EMSAs were used to quantitate the fraction of DNA bound by protein. B, binding isotherms are shown for DNA containing εA·T (circles), εA·C (squares), and εA·U (triangles) pairs (left panel) as well as Hx·T (circles), Hx·C (squares), and Hx·U (triangles) pairs (right panel). Each EMSA experiment was performed in triplicate, and average values and S.D. for the different concentrations of enzyme-bound DNA are shown. Solid curvesthrough the data points are the results of fits to calculate dissociation constants (Kd,app) assuming a simple two-state binding mechanism (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The catalytically inactive mutant, hAAGΔ79E125Q, was used to measure the binding affinity of the enzyme to DNA substrates containing different damaged DNA bases. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were done as above using the same damaged duplex DNA substrates used in excision assays. Representative phosphorimager scans of binding data are shown in Fig.6 A for DNA duplexes containing εA and Hx base pairs with T, C, and U. In general, hAAG binds with greater affinity to DNA containing εA base pairs than Hx base pairs. The base-pairing partner has a significant effect on the enzyme affinity for DNA substrates containing Hx base pairs. For each DNA substrate, three separate EMSA experiments were performed and quantitated. Binding isotherms showing the average and S.D. of these three independent experiments are shown in Fig. 6 B. Data were fit to a simple two-state binding model shown in Equation 3 using a quadratic equation (see “Experimental Procedures,” Equation 1) to determine an apparent dissociation constant (Kd,app) whereED total represents all species of EDcomplexes formed (i.e. both complexes where the damaged nucleotide are flipped (ED flip) and not flipped (ED un)). E+D⇌EDtotalEquation 3 Apparent dissociation constants calculated for εA base pairs were 20 ± 2, 23 ± 2, and 6.3 ± 1.0 nm for base pairs with T, C, and U, respectively. Dissociation constants for DNA duplexes containing Hx base pairs were affected to a much greater extent by changing the base-pairing partner. Apparent dissociation constants were 92 ± 2 and 12 ± 2 nm for Hx·T and Hx·U base pairs, respectively. For the duplex containing Hx·C base pairs, Kd,app is ∼600 nm and is too great to accurately determine because at high enzyme concentrations, bands “smear” on EMSA gels, probably due to nonspecific binding of the enzyme to undamaged DNA. In addition to measuring binding to DNA containing εA and Hx lesions, hAAG binding was measured to DNA containing each of the base pairs that were used in excision assays. These base pairs included O6-MeG opposite C and T, 8-oxoG opposite C and T, G opposite T, C, and U, and A opposite T, C, U, and 5-MeC. Significant binding to these DNA substrates was not observed (data not shown). Although U opposite a lesion increased binding to DNA containing εA and Hx, it had no effect when placed opposite G or A. Several DNA glycosylases including E. coli MutY (22Porello S.L. Leyes A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Google Scholar), human thymine DNA glycosylase (23Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar), and human methyl-CpG-binding endonuclease 1 (24Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Stoerker J. Genuardi M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 32422-32429Google Scholar) have been shown to bind very tightly to the products of their excision reactions. To determine whether hAAG has a high affinity for apurinic DNA products, binding of hAAGΔ79 to duplex DNA substrates containing a synthetic abasic site was measured. A synthetic “reduced” abasic site was used in place of the natural abasic site because this substrate is more stable and can be incorporated at a specific site using standard synthetic chemistry. As a control, binding of hAAGΔ79 to DNA containing a natural abasic site was measured (data not shown) and found to be similar to binding to a reduced abasic site, as has been observed by others (15Miao F. Bouziane M. O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res... 1998; 26: 4034-4041Google Scholar). Results from EMSA experiments with DNA substrates containing abasic sites are shown in Fig.7. As with damaged bases, the affinity of the enzyme for abasic sites is affected by the base opposite the abasic site. The enzyme only binds duplexes that contain pyrimidines opposite the abasic site. Apparent binding constants calculated for substrates with pyrimidines opposite the abasic site were 140, 300, and 56 nm for T, C, and U, respectively. Interestingly, when either εA or Hx was placed opposite the abasic site, the enzyme did not bind DNA duplexes, suggesting that the enzyme cannot recognize these damaged bases unless a base is paired opposite them. The human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase has been shown to have a broad substrate specificity excising damaged purines, particularly alkylated purines. Various studies have shown that hAAG is capable of excising 3-methyladenine (5Chakravarti D. Ibeanu G.C. Tano K. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 15710-15715Google Scholar, 6Samson L. Derfler B.

https://openalex.org/W2022492858,"Rab proteins are a family of small GTPases that regulate intracellular vesicle traffic. Rab8b, because of its homology with Rab8, has been suggested to function in vesicle transport to the plasma membrane. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a Rab8b interacting clone, termed TRIP8b, from a rat brain cDNA library. The gene encodes a 66-kDa protein with homology to the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 receptor. The interaction between Rab8b and TRIP8b was further verified by in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Additional experiments with Rab8b mutants demonstrated that Rab8b requires a guanine nucleotide but not prenylation for its interaction with TRIP8b. Western immunoblot analysis showed that TRIP8b was primarily expressed in brain. Subcellular fractionation of AtT20 cells revealed that TRIP8b was present in both cytosolic and membrane fractions. To investigate the function of Rab8b and TRIP8b in secretion, we examined the release of ACTH from AtT20 cells. Results from stable cell lines expressing Rab8b or TRIP8b indicated that both proteins had a stimulatory effect on cAMP-induced secretion of ACTH. In summary, these data suggest that Rab8b and TRIP8b interact with each other and are involved in the regulated secretory pathway in AtT20 cells.

Rab proteins are a family of small GTP-binding proteins that are important regulators of vesicle transport (1Gonzalez L.J. Scheller R.H.

They undergo nucleotide exchange to establish the active GTP-bound form and are incorporated onto transport vesicles either during or after vesicle formation. The GTP-bound form of Rab proteins recruit effectors, either directly or indirectly, to target vesicles to the appropriate sites on acceptor membranes. These effectors include motor proteins which link the vesicles to the cytoskeleton (4Echard A. Jollivet F. Martinez O. Lacapere J.J. Rousselet A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Goud B.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To date, about 40 distinct Rab proteins have been identified and each is believed to be specifically associated with a particular vesicle transport pathway (2Martinez O. Goud B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 8Olkkonen V.M. Stenmark H. Int. Rev Cytol. 1997; 176 (., 1–85): 1-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, only a fraction of known Rab proteins have their functions characterized in detail. Among these, Rab8 (which we term Rab8a) has been shown to be a key regulator of constitutive polarized vesicle transport to the dendrites in the neurons or to the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells (9Huber L.A. Pimplikar S. Parton R.G. Virta H. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 10Huber L.A. Dupree P. Dotti C.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 918-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Peranen J. Auvinen P. Virta H. Wepf R. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, Rab8a is localized to the Golgi region, cytoplasmic vesicular structures, and the plasma membrane of Madine-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. When the wild type and dominant active mutant forms of Rab8a are overexpressed in baby hamster kidney fibroblast cells, a dramatic change in cell morphology occurs. The cells form elongated processes as a result of a reorganization of both their actin filaments and microtubules. In this case, newly synthesized vesicular stomatitis virus, a basolateral marker protein is preferentially delivered into these cell outgrowths. While the role of Rab8a in vesicle traffic has been elucidated, the function of Rab8b, a closely related isoform, remains unclear. Rab8b was first identified during a library screen to look for novel Rabs involved in secretory granule fusion in mast cells and basophils (12Armstrong J. Thompson N. Squire J.H. Smith J. Hayes B. Solari R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1265-1274PubMed Google Scholar). Rab8b has an overall amino acid identity of 80% with Rab8a. While the NH2 termini are highly conserved, the COOH-terminal domain of Rab8b is substantially divergent from that of Rab8a. Transient expression of the Myc-tagged Rab8b fusion protein in neuroblastoma and basophilic leukemia cells shows staining of both the plasma membrane and ill-defined vesicular structures. When overexpressed, Rab8b induces striking plasma membrane outgrowth, similar to that observed for Rab8a. Northern immunoblot analysis shows the highest expression level of Rab8b in spleen and brain. In contrast, Rab8a has very low expression levels in spleen and brain. From these data, we postulated that like Rab8a, Rab8b may also play a similar role in the vesicle traffic from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, because of the substantial COOH-terminal differences between Rab8b and Rab8a and their different tissue expression patterns, we also suspected that Rab8b may be involved in roles in secretion that are not shared or substituted by Rab8a. Our study was aimed to further characterize Rab8b's function in the secretory pathway. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a Rab8b interacting protein named TRIP8b and the function of Rab8b and TRIP8b in the regulated secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 1The abbreviations used are:ACTHadrenocorticotropic hormoneHAhemagglutininGSTglutathioneS-transferaseTPRtetratricopeptide repeatNeoneomycinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideHEKhuman embryonic kidneyGDIGDP dissociation inhibitorABIACTH biosynthetic intermediatePEX5peroxisomal targeting signal 1 receptorFBSfetal bovine serumGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis secretion in AtT20 cells. adrenocorticotropic hormone hemagglutinin glutathioneS-transferase tetratricopeptide repeat neomycin phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride human embryonic kidney GDP dissociation inhibitor ACTH biosynthetic intermediate peroxisomal targeting signal 1 receptor fetal bovine serum guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Rat Rab8b cDNA was cloned from a rat brain cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction screening using primers specific to the 5′ and 3′ sequences of Rab8b (12Armstrong J. Thompson N. Squire J.H. Smith J. Hayes B. Solari R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1265-1274PubMed Google Scholar). The forward primer used was 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCGAAGACGTAC-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-CGGGATCCTCAAAGCAGAGAACA-3′. For subsequent cloning, both primers were designed to contain a BamHI restriction site. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and colonies were screened with a α-32P-labeled primer (5′-GGTGGGCCAGTGAAAATAACAGAA-3′) corresponding to a portion of the C terminus of Rab8b. Positive colonies were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For two-hybrid screens, Rab8b was cloned into the pAS2-1 vector at theEcoRI and BamHI sites. The Rab3a construct used was previously described (13Ngsee J.K. Fleming A.M. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rab8a (kindly provided by Johan Peranen) was cloned into pAS2-1 at the EcoRI and NcoI sites, while Pex5 (kindly provided by Wolfgang Schliebs) was cloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites. The expression of the GAL4BD fusion proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting before starting the library screen. An oligo(dT) rat brain cDNA library was cloned into the pGAD424X vector as described (14Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Rab8b and the rat brain cDNA library were co-transformed into the yeast strain Y190 according to manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). To obtain the amino-terminal TRIP8b sequence, a TRIP8b PstI fragment derived from the original R38 clone that was isolated in the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a rat brain cDNA phage library (Stratagene). Several clones containing the NH2-terminal sequence were identified. Enzyme digestion and cloning strategies were used to produce a full-length TRIP8b clone whose sequence has been deposited to the GenBankTM data bank (accession number AF324454). Rab8b mutants were created using the Stratagene Quikchange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit. These mutants include: Rab8bQ67L, Rab8bT22N, Rab8bC204S, and Rab8bN121I. All the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. These mutants were either cloned into pAS2-1 (CLONTECH) for two-hybrid studies, pXJ40-Myc or pXJ40-hemagglutinin (HA) (15Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for immunofluorescence staining and pXJ40-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) (16Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for in vitro translation and binding studies. The full-length TRIP8b was cloned into pBluescript at theEcoRI and XhoI sites. Digestion withEcoRI, BglII, and XhoI produced a 570-base pair NH2-terminal fragment (TRIP8b-N) and a 1.3-kilobase fragment containing the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (TRIP8b-TPR). TRIP8b, TRIP8b-N, and TRIP8b-TPR were cloned separately into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for GST fusion protein production and pXJ40-Myc or pXJ40-HA vectors for transient transfection and immunofluorescence staining. TRIP8b and TRIP8b-N were also cloned into pXJ41-neomycin (neo) (16Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for stable transfection of AtT20 cells. For the two-hybrid experiments, TRIP8b-N and TRIP8b-TPR were cloned into pACT2 (CLONTECH). To create the GST-SLL construct, two oligonucleotides were designed. The upper primer was 5′-AATTCTCTCTGCTTTGAAAGCTT-3′ and the lower primer was 5′-TCGAAAGCTTTCAAAGCAGAGAG-3′. Each primer was phosphorylated by the polynucleotide kinase in a 20-μl reaction at 37 °C for 30 min according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To anneal the two primers, the reactions were mixed together, incubated at 65 °C for 15 min, and slowly cooled to room temperature. The annealed primers produced a double stranded fragment with 5′ and 3′ overhangs which was then cloned into pGEX4T-1 at theEcoRI and SalI sites. The GST-STOP construct was created in the same manner using 5′-AATTCTGATGATGATGAAGATCT-3′ as the upper primer and 5′-TCGAAGATCTGCATCATCATCAG-3′ as the lower primer. For the bacterial expression of GST fusion proteins, pGEX4T-1 constructs were transformed into BL21 cells (Stratagene). Cultures were grown at 37 °C until anA600 of 0.6 was reached and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h before being harvested. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and subjected to sonication. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g in an SS34 rotor (Beckman) for 20 min and loaded onto a column containing glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed 5 times with PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP, and then 2 times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 before the GST fusion protein was eluted with 10 mmreduced glutathione (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% glycerol. To obtain antibodies against TRIP8b, serum was obtained from a rabbit injected with purified GST-TRIP8b-N and affinity purified on a GST-TRIP8b-N column. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1000 mg/liter glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum. AtT20 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4500 mg/liter glucose and 10% fetal bovine serum while stably transfected AtT20 cells were grown in the same media plus 250 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). HEK 293T cells or AtT20 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5 or 15% CO2 incubator, respectively. TRIP8b was cloned into pBluescript vector and in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the T7 TNT kit fromPromega. For studies with bacterially expressed proteins, 25 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins (GST-SLL, GST-STOP, GST-Rab8b, GST-Rab8bΔSLL, and GST-Rac2) were bound onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. For the cellular expressed proteins, cell extracts from HEK 293T cells transiently transfected with pXJ-GST constructs containing Rab8b, Rab8bΔSLL, or Rab8bC204S were bound onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed 5 times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with 400 μl of 1 × GTP/GDP exchange buffer (50 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.3, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Triton X-100) including 1 mm GTP, GTPγS, or GDP, or 10 mm EDTA in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube at room temperature for 4 min. The beads were spun down at 2000 rpm for 30 s, the supernatants were discarded and the beads were stored on ice. 50 μl of 35S-labeled TRIP8b was diluted with 800 μl of binding/wash buffer (PBS with 25 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100) including 25 μg of GST protein. The 850-μl mixture was then incubated with the GST fusion proteins bound on beads at 4 °C for 15 min. The beads were spun down and the supernatants were discarded. The beads were washed 4 times with 800 μl of ice-cold binding/wash buffer. At the end, proteins were extracted from the beads with 2 × SDS loading buffer, run onto a SDS-PAGE gel, and the gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film. 4.5 μg of total DNA (1.5 μg of pXJ40-HA-TRIP8b and 3 μg of pXJ40-Myc-Rab8b), 20 μl of Superfectin (Qiagen), and 300 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were incubated at room temperature for 15 min before another 2.5 ml of growth media was added. The total transfection mixture was added to a 10-cm tissue culture plate containing HEK 293T cells and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The media was removed and the cells were grown overnight in 10 ml of fresh growth media. The next day, the cells were briefly and gently washed with PBS before cellular proteins were extracted at 4 °C for 3 h with 10 mmHepes-OH, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm PMSF. The extract was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of protein A beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 1 h, spun down, and the beads discarded. The supernatant was then incubated with either 1 μg of anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 1 μg of rabbit IgG (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. Then 20 μl of protein A beads were added and incubated with the supernatant for 30 min. The beads were recovered by brief centrifugation and washed 5 times with 10 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The amount of immunoprecipitated TRIP8b was determined using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (F-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the amount of Rab8b that co-immunoprecipitated with TRIP8b was observed with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). AtT20 cells were plated onto 2-well chamber slides (Nunc) and transiently transfected the next day with Superfectin. The day after the transfection, the cells were washed 2 times with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min or with −20 °C acetone at room temperature for 2 min. Then the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with blocking buffer, and incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody for 30 min. The rabbit polyclonal TRIP8b antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100 and the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was used at 1:500. The anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody (Sigma) was used at 1:200 and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used at 1:100 (Sigma). A 10-cm plate of confluent AtT20 cells was scraped in PBS, centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, and the cell pellet resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mmHepes-OH, pH 7.3, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF and lysed by sonication. An aliquot of the homogenized fraction was taken for Western immunoblot analysis and the remainder centrifuged at 200,000 × g in a TLA 100.2 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C for 1 h. The pellet was solublized with 20 μl of 2 × SDS gel loading buffer. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and solublized with 20 μl of 2 × SDS gel loading buffer. The homogenate, pellet, and supernatant fractions were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with anti-TRIP8b sera or anti-Rab8 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), and detected using goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and Pierce Supersignal. Note, the Rab8 antibody reacts against both Rab8a and Rab8b, while reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of poly(A) RNA revealed that similar amounts of Rab8a and Rab8b messenger RNA were present in AtT20 cells (data not shown). For the extraction studies, AtT20 membrane pellets were resuspended in 0.1 mm Na2CO3, pH 11, or 1% Triton X-100 as described (17Hutt D.M. Da Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 40 μg of membrane fraction was incubated on ice for 1 h with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11, or 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm EDTA. Following the incubation, the fractions were centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and the resulting precipitates were solubilized with 2 × SDS loading buffer. While the pellet fractions were resuspended with 2 × SDS loading buffer. Both fractions were subjected to Western immunoblot analysis as described above. GST-GDI1 protein was expressed and purified as described above except for the absence of detergent in the wash and elution buffers. Instead, the wash buffers were 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with 500 or 150 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted with the 150 mmNaCl wash buffer containing 7.5 mm reduced glutathione. An AtT20 membrane fraction was prepared as described (17Hutt D.M. Da Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the membrane pellet resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 300 mm sucrose by sonication. 25 μg of resuspended membranes were preincubated with 1 mm GDP for 20 min at 37 °C and then incubated with 400 nm GST-GDI1 in the presence of 1 mm GDP and analyzed as described above. AtT20 cells were plated out onto a 6-well plate with a density of 4 × 105cells/ml, 2 ml/well. The next day, cells were transfected with pXJ41-neo-Myc-Rab8b, TRIP8b, or TRIP8b-N. Briefly, 2 μg of DNA, 5 μl of Superfectin, and 100 μl of serum-free media were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 to 30 min before another 600 μl of growth media was added. Then the total 700-μl mixture was added drop by drop onto each well of cells. Cells were incubated for 4 to 5 h, changed to new growth media, and grown at 37 °C overnight in a 15% CO2 incubator. The next day, each well was trypsinized and the cells plated out onto a 150-mm plate, and after 24 h the media was changed to a media containing 250 μg/ml G418. Cells were kept growing until colonies formed. Several colonies were isolated and continuously grown in 96-, 24-, and 6-well plates. Positive clones were identified by protein expression using Western immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence. The experiment was performed as described with modifications (18Baldini G. Wang G. Weber M. Zweyer M. Bareggi R. Witkin J.W. Martelli A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 50–75% confluence in 12-well plates for 3 days before the assay. The cells were washed three times with serum-free media and then incubated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.3, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, with or without 100 mm 8-Br-cAMP at 37 °C for 1 h. The media fraction from each well was collected and PMSF was immediately added. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and the wash combined with the media fraction. The media fraction was precipitated with 4 × volume −20 °C acetone overnight. The cells were extracted with 50 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.3, 250 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm PMSF for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and 15–20% of the supernatant was precipitated with 4 × volume of −20 °C acetone overnight. For both the media and cell fractions, precipitated proteins were resuspended in 2 × SDS gel loading buffer, electrophoresed onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to Western immunoblot analysis. For immunodetection of ACTH products, the polyclonal antibody against ACTH (RGG8502, Peninsula Laboratories) was used at 1:1000 to detect both the 30-kDa ACTH biosynthetic intermediate (ABI) and the 13-kDa mature form of ACTH. Densitometric quantification of the autoradiographs was performed with a Bio-Rad/GS700 imaging densitometer. The percentage of ABI and ACTH secreted was calculated by dividing the media value by the sum of the media and cellular values. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Over 2 × 106 clones from a rat brain cDNA library were screened using the GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid system (14Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with either Rab8b or the GTPase-defective mutant (Rab8b-Q67L) to identify Rab8b interacting proteins. A single clone was observed to interact with both proteins. A full-length clone (R38) was obtained by screening a rat brain cDNA library and predicted to encode a hydrophilic 66-kDa protein. BLASTP analysis of the R38 protein sequence against GenBankTM reveals that the R38 had 44% identity with the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 receptor (also referred to as PEX5), a protein involved in the transport of peroxisomal enzymes. Analysis of the R38 protein sequence revealed that the most significant homology (66% identity) between the two proteins occurs at the COOH-terminal half of R38 where six TPR motifs are located to form a TPR domain (Fig. 1). TPR motifs are 34-amino acid repeats that are observed in a variety of proteins and are implicated in protein-protein interaction (19Ponting C.C. Phillips C. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1053-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem.

In the case of PEX5, its TPR domain consists of seven TPR motifs and is involved in the binding of peroxisomal enzymes containing the tripeptide motif SKL at their carboxyl terminus (22Otera H. Okumoto K. Tateishi K. Ikoma Y. Matsuda E. Nishimura M. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Ohashi K. Higuchi O. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 388-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dodt G. Gould S.J. J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). We further analyzed the interaction of R38 with several other mutant forms of Rab8b with properties described for a number of Rab proteins, including Rab8a (26Ren M. Zeng J. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Rosenfeld M. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Table I). In addition to Rab8b and Rab8b-Q67L, R38 was able to interact with Rab8b-T22N (a form of Rab8b which is predominantly in the GDP-bound state) and Rab8b-C204S (a mutant which abolishes the terminal cysteine required for isoprenylation) constructs. No binding to R38 was observed with the dominant negative nucleotide-free mutant, Rab8b-N121I. Finally, we examined the interaction of two other Rab proteins, Rab8a and Rab3a, with R38. While Rab8a has over 80% homology with Rab8b, no binding of R38 was observed with Rab8a as well as Rab3a (Table I). These results suggested that the binding of Rab8b to R38 was specific, independent of the nucleotide state and prenylation status of Rab8b. We have therefore termed R38 as TRIP8b, for TPR-containingRab8b interacting protein.Table IInteraction of Rab8b with TRIP8b in the yeast two-hybrid systemBaitPreyβ-Galactosidase activityRab8bTRIP8b++++Rab8b-Q67LTRIP8b+++++Rab8b-T22NTRIP8b+++Rab8b-C204STRIP8b+++Rab8b-N121ITRIP8b−Rab8aTRIP8b−Rab3aTRIP8b−Rab8bTRIP8b++++Rab8bTRIP8b-N−Rab8bTRIP8b-TPR++++Rab8bPEX5−Bait and prey constructs were co-transformed into yeast Y190.

In addition to the interaction of TRIP8b with Rab8b mutants, the two-hybrid system was also employed to characterize the interaction of Rab8b with different regions of TRIP8b, the amino-terminal half (TRIP8b-N) and the COOH-terminal half (TRIP8b-TPR) that contains the TPR domain. As displayed in Table I, Rab8b interacts only with TRIP8b constructs containing the TPR domain (TRIP8b and TRIP8b-TPR). This result is similar to that observed for PEX5, which only requires its TPR domain to bind to enzymes that have the tripeptide motif SKL as their COOH-terminal residues (22Otera H. Okumoto K.

Because of these results and the homology between TRIP8b and PEX5, the interaction between Rab8b, which has the tripeptide motif SLL at its COOH terminus, and PEX5 was also examined. However, no interaction was observed (Table I), indicating that the SLL motif of Rab8b cannot be recognized by the TPR domain of PEX5. To further characterize the interaction"
https://openalex.org/W1865268615,"Krüppel-associated box-containing zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZFPs) repress transcription via functional interaction with the corepressor KRAB-associated protein-1 (KAP-1). KAP-1 directly interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), a dose-dependent regulator of heterochromatin-mediated silencing. Here we show that two KRAB-ZFPs that we previously identified, KRAZ1 and KRAZ2, are targeted to foci of centromeric heterochromatin containing HP1α through the interaction with KAP-1. Centromeric targeting potential of KRAZ1 and KAP-1 is strictly correlated with their silencing activities; a KRAB mutant of KRAZ1 that is unable to bind KAP-1 and KAP-1 deletions unable to bind HP1 cannot localize to centromeric foci nor repress transcription. We provide evidence that this correlation is likely to be functionally relevant. First, overexpression of the VP16 transactivation domain fused with the KAP-1 deletion that binds to KRAB but not to HP1 leads to dramatic redistribution of KRAZ1 from centromeric foci and simultaneously converts KRAZ1-mediated silencing into strong transcriptional activation. Second, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases, trichostatin A, effectively redistributes KRAZ1 and KAP-1 from centromeric foci and partially relieves their silencing activities. These data strongly suggest that KRAB-ZFPs/KAP-1 silence transcription by dynamic recruitment of the target locus to the specific gene silencing compartment, centromeric heterochromatin, in a histone deacetylase-dependent manner.

The Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)1 was originally identified as an evolutionarily conserved motif that is presumably contained in about one-third of the several hundred Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) (1Bellefroid E.J.

HP1 constitutes a subfamily of the chromatin organization modifier (chromo) superfamily and is a dose-dependent regulator of heterochromatin-mediated silencing known as position effect variegation, suggesting that HP1 is a functional and structural component of heterochromatin (for review see Ref. 16Eissenberg J.C.

However, these three subtypes exhibit distinct subnuclear localization patterns depending on the species and cell type (20Horsley D. Hutchings A. Butcher G.W. Singh P.B. Cytogenet.

Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1999; 108: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). For example, in mouse NIH3T3 cells, HP1α was found almost exclusively in foci of centromeric heterochromatin (15Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You J. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Khechumian R. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6385-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). HP1β localizes to centromeric foci, and additional nuclear speckles appear to represent euchromatin (14Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J.

Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6385-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). KAP-1 was shown to colocalize with HP1β in pericentromeric heterochromatin and with HP1γ in euchromatic regions (14Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4366-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), suggesting that KAP-1 may exert its silencing activity by a heterochromatin-mediated mechanism. However, there is no evidence indicating a correlation between subnuclear localization of KAP-1 or KRAB-ZFPs and their silencing function.In this report, we demonstrate that two KRAB-ZFPs, KRAZ1 and KRAZ2, which we identified previously (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), colocalize with KAP-1 in foci of centromeric heterochromatin containing HP1α. Centromeric localization of KRAZ1/2 is dependent on the interaction with KAP-1, and in turn, binding to HP1 is essential for centromeric recruitment of KAP-1. We further provide data that strongly suggest that KRAB-ZFPs/KAP-1 repress transcription by locus targeting to centromeric heterochromatin in a histone deacetylase-dependent manner.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmidsRecombinant DNA techniques were performed according to standard protocols (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The pGL3-G5SV and expression plasmids for GAL4-, Myc-, and VP16-fused KAP-1 deletions have been described previously (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To express full-length KRAZ1 and KRAZ2, cDNAs encoding amino acids 42–652 of KRAZ1 and 1–606 of KRAZ2 (GenBankTM accession numbers AB024004 for KRAZ1 andAB024005 for KRAZ2) were inserted into the pEF-BOS-GAL4 or pEF-BOS-6xMyc-tagged vectors (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To construct KRAB mutants of KRAZ1/2, the KRAB-containing regions of full-length KRAZ1/2 were replaced by the corresponding fragments containing the amino acid substitutions in KRAB-A domains (aspartic acid-valine to alanine-alanine; DV to AA) (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3-G5T7, was constructed by subcloning the fragment carrying five GAL4-binding sites excised from pGL3-G5SV (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the fragment carrying seven repeats of tetracycline operator and the cytomegalovirus promoter excised from pUHD10–3 (23Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar) into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). To express tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA), the fragment containing tTA excised from pRetro-Off (CLONTECH) was inserted into pEF-BOS bsr (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Transfection and Luciferase AssayTransient transfection of NIH3T3 cells using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and luciferase assay using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) were performed as described (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase activity from pGL3-G5SV or pGL3-G5T7 was normalized for transfection efficiency with sea-pansy luciferase activity from the internal control plasmid, pRL-SV40 (Promega). -Fold repression was calculated by comparing normalized luciferase activity of each GAL4 fusion with that of GAL4DBD alone, which represents the basal activity of the reporter used. Each transfection experiment was repeated at least three times in duplicate, and the results are presented as averages with standard deviations of duplicates in representative experiments. For TSA treatment, 16 h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TSA (Wako) or an equal volume of Me2SO as a vehicle control and incubated for an additional 32 h.GST Pull-down AssayThe expression plasmids for GST-HP1α and GST-HP1γ (24Ye Q. Callebaut I. Pezhman A. Courvalin J.C. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14983-14989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. H. J. Worman (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Paris, France). Protein purification and GST pull-down assay were performed as described (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–5 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with35S-labeled VP16-KAP-1 deletions that werein vitro-translated by using the T7 TNT system (Promega). After washing, bound proteins were separated by 10–12% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by a Bio-image analyzer (Fujix BAS 5000).AntibodiesThe primary antibodies (Abs) used were as follows: (i) rabbit polyclonal Ab against human KAP-1 (nucleotides 1882–2673 that are 96% identical to mouse KAP-1) (25Chang C.J. Chen Y.L. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5880-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. S. C.

Chambon (CNRS, Strasbourg, France); (iii) rabbit polyclonal Ab against human HP1α (amino acids 181–191 that are 91% identical to mouse HP1α) (21Minc E. Allory V. Worman H.J. Courvalin J.C. Buendia B. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1999; 108: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Courvalin (CNRS, Paris, France); (iv) mouse anti-GAL4 mAb (RK5C1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (v) rabbit anti-VP16 polyclonal Ab (CLONTECH); and (vi) unlabeled and Cy3-labeled mouse anti-Myc mAb (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Labeling was performed by a Cy3 labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All of the following secondary Abs were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.: donkey Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse or rabbit IgG and donkey FITC-labeled anti-mouse or rabbit IgG. Species specificities of the secondary antibodies were confirmed by control staining.Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingThese were performed as described (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, GAL4DBD, GAL4-KRAZ1, or GAL4-KRAZ1 mutant were transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells, together with VP16-KAP-1 N835, and immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GAL4 Ab (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-VP16 Ab.Immunofluorescent MicroscopyFor conventional and confocal microscopy analysis, NIH3T3 cells were plated 24 h before transfection on eight chamber slides (Nunc, Inc.) precoated with 0.1% gelatin and transfected using LipofectAMINETM as described (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed 24–48 h after transfection with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by permeabilization with 1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min. After washing three times with 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies for 60 min. DNA was labeled with 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) for 5 min, and the slides were mounted with PermaFluorTM (Shandon/Lipshaw). All staining experiments were repeated more than twice, and at least 100 transfected cells were examined in each experiment with conventional microscopy (DIAPHOT-300; Nikon) or confocal laser microscopy (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad). The fluorescence signals from the two fluorochromes were recorded simultaneously in one scan and saved separately on two channels to be processed independently with the Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc.).RESULTSKRAZ1 and KRAZ2 Colocalize with KAP-1 and HP1α to Centromeric FociWe previously reported that N-terminal KRAB-containing regions of KRAZ1 and KRAZ2 repress transcription when heterologously targeted to the nucleus as fusions with GAL4DBD (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We observed, however, that these regions alone did not localize to the nucleus (data not shown), whereas full-length KRAZ1 and KRAZ2 containing zinc fingers in the C terminus (15 and 9 repeats, respectively; see Fig. 1 A) were nuclearly localized (Fig. 1 B). We thus further investigated the subnuclear localization of KRAZ1/2 within this more physiological context of full-length proteins. Each Myc-tagged full-length protein was transiently expressed in mouse NIH3T3 cells and examined by immunofluorescent staining with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig.1 B). In ∼20% of transfected cells, KRAZ1 exhibited a unique dot-like structure in interphase nuclei, whereas the remaining 80% presented a diffuse distribution (Fig. 1 B, aand c). KRAZ2 also displayed similar nuclear dots though to a lesser extent than KRAZ1 (Fig. 1 B, e andg), suggesting that these dot-like structures might be a common characteristic in many KRAB-containing ZFPs. Although the levels of KRAZ1/2 expression varied widely among individual transfected cells, there was no correlation between the presence of the dot-like structures and the expression level (data not shown), suggesting that dot formation is not likely because of artifacts caused by overexpression. Moreover, KRAZ1/2 nuclear dots coincide with DAPI-stained dots that correspond to foci containing centromeric heterochromatin (Fig. 1 B, d and h) (21Minc E. Allory V. Worman H.J. Courvalin J.C. Buendia B. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1999; 108: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 26Aagaard L. Laible G. Selenko P. Schmid M. Dorn R. Schotta G. Kuhfittig S. Wolf A. Lebersorger A. Singh P.B. Reuter G. Jenuwein T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), suggesting that KRAZ1/2 specifically localize to centromeric foci. We focused on KRAZ1 for further investigation, because the cell population showing nuclear dots was consistently larger for KRAZ1 than KRAZ2. However, basically similar data were obtained for KRAZ2.KRAZ1 functionally interacts with KAP-1 through its KRAB domain (9Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16412-16422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and KAP-1 was shown to directly bind to all three HP1 proteins, HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ in vitro (14Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4366-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A.

Thus, we examined whether KRAZ1 colocalizes with KAP-1 and HP1s within the nucleus by using immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Among the HP1 members, we focused on HP1α, because endogenous HP1α exclusively localized to centromeric foci as reported previously (see Refs. 15Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You J. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Khechumian R. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6385-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar and 21Minc E. Allory V. Worman H.J. Courvalin J.C. Buendia B. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1999; 108: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar and Fig.2 A, b). Consistent with the previous observation (14Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4366-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), endogenous KAP-1 was concentrated in dot-like structures in nearly 50% of the nuclei (Fig.2 A, a). KAP-1 dots colocalized exclusively with HP1α (Fig. 2 A, c), indicating that KAP-1 localized to foci of centromeric heterochromatin. Overlaying of the corresponding images revealed that the nuclear dots of KRAZ1 coincided entirely with endogenous KAP-1 and HP1α in centromeric foci (Fig.2 A, d–i). Furthermore, like other proteins that are specifically targeted to centromeric foci such as HP1β/MOD1, CAF1 p150, and Suv39 h1 (26Aagaard L. Laible G. Selenko P. Schmid M. Dorn R. Schotta G.

Cell. 1999; 4: 529-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), dot-like structures by KRAZ1 were resistant to Triton X-100 extraction (data not shown), suggesting that KRAZ1 is specifically targeted to centromeric foci and tightly associated with heterochromatin. The colocalization of KRAZ1 dots with KAP-1 and HP1α were further confirmed by using a different combination of antibodies, anti-mouse KAP-1 (1Tb-1A9, which was kindly provided by Dr. P. Chambon; see Ref. 15Nielsen A.L. Ortiz J.A. You J. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Khechumian R. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Losson R.

The contribution of type IV pili to virulence lies primarily in their ability to promote the attachment of the pathogens to various receptors of host cells during colonization. Type IV pili are also required for bacterial locomotion known as twitching motility (2Whitchurch C.B. Hobbs M. Livingston S.P. Krishnapillai V. Mattick J.S.

Gram-negative bacteria such asKlebsiella oxytoca, Erwinia chrysanthemi,P. aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas campestris have protein secretion systems, called type II secretion systems or the main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway, which export extracellular proteins including pullulanase, pectinase, cellulase, and toxins outside of the outer membrane (5d'Enfert C.

They are also found in type IV secretion systems including the conjugation systems of IncP plasmids RP4 and R751, and IncW plasmid R388 (11Pansegrau W. Lanka E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The encoded proteins contain several conserved motifs: Walker box A and B involved in ATP binding (14Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), an Asp box, and a His box (see Fig. 4 A). In addition to these motifs, a group of PulE-VirB11 family NTPases, related to type IV pilus biogenesis systems and type II secretion pathways, contain two CXXC motifs and an Arg box (8Possot O. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Many of the PulE-VirB11 family NTPases have been shown to be essential for piliation, extracellular protein secretion, transformation, and conjugal transfer (15Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Nature. 1993; 346: 362-365Google Scholar). Several PulE-VirB11 family NTPases have been purified and characterized (10Sandkvist M. Bagdsarian M. Howard S.P. DiRita V.J.

In addition, TrwD and TrbB proteins of plasmids R388 and RP4, respectively, and HP0525 protein in the cag pathogenicity island ofHelicobacter pylori have been shown to exhibit NTPase activity (17Rivas S.

Lanka E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). IncI1 plasmids R64 and ColIb-P9 form two types of sex pili, a thick rigid pilus and a thin flexible pilus. The thin pilus is required only for conjugation in liquid media (23Komano T. Funayama N. Kim S.-R. Nisioka T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 16-kb1 DNA segment, including the traA-D and pilI-V genes, of the 54-kb R64 transfer region is required for the formation of thin pilus (24Kim S.-R. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3594-3603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R64 and ColIb-P9 thin pili belong to the type IV pilus family based on the amino acid sequence similarities between variouspil products and proteins related to the formation of other type IV pili. The products of the traBC andpilK-V genes were shown to be essential for the formation of thin pilus on the cell surface (25Yoshida T. Kim S.-R. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sakai D. Komano T. Plasmid. 2000; 43: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). R64 and ColIb-P9 thin pili function in the formation of donor-recipient cell aggregates in liquid matings. Specificity of recipient cells is determined by seven C-terminal segments of PilV adhesins, which are switched through shufflon multiple inversion (27Komano T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Komano T. Kim S.-R. Yoshida T. Nisioka T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The R64 pilQ product shares amino acid sequence similarity with PulE-VirB11 family NTPases (24Kim S.-R. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3594-3603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, the R64 pilQ gene product, essential for thin pilus formation, was overproduced and purified. Purified PilQ protein formed homooctamers and displayed ATPase activity. Several amino acid substitutions were introduced into the pilQ gene within conserved motifs. Effects of pilQ mutations on thin pilus formation, ATPase activity, and multimer stability were examined. The bacterial strains used in this work were E. coli JM83 Δ(lac-proAB)rpsL thi ara φ80 dlacZΔM15 (29Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J.

Plasmid vector pUC119 (32Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) was used for cloning. pET28b and pET11a (31Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4839) Google Scholar) were used for overexpression of the pilQ gene. pKK641A′ (28Komano T. Kim S.-R. Yoshida T. Nisioka T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) carried traABCD and pil genes for R64 thin pilus formation. pKK641A′ pilQ1 (25Yoshida T. Kim S.-R. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carried the pilQ1frameshift mutation. pKK661 (28Komano T. Kim S.-R. Yoshida T. Nisioka T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was a pHSG576-derivative plasmid carrying genes for remaining R64 transfer functions includingoriT. pKK702a (25Yoshida T. Kim S.-R. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a pUC119-derivative plasmid carrying R64 pilQ gene. Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was prepared as previously described (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The solid medium contained 1.5% agar. Antibiotics were added to liquid and solid media at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 25 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; and nalidixic acid, 20 μg/ml. E. coli NF83 or BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pKK661, pKK641A′ pilQ1 and pilQplasmid, and E. coli TN102 cells were used as donor and recipient cells, respectively. Donor cells were grown to the log phase and mixed with recipient cells in the stationary phase. After standing for 90 min at 37 °C, the mixture was plated at various dilutions onto LB plates containing chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid. Since pKK661, pKK641A′ pilQ1 and pilQ plasmid complement each other, donor cells harboring pKK661, pKK641A′pilQ1 and pilQ plasmid transmitted pKK661 carrying oriT into recipient cells (23Komano T. Funayama N. Kim S.-R. Nisioka T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfer frequency is presented as the ratio (expressed as percentage) of the number of transconjugants to that of donor cells. In the case of BL21 (DE3) harboring pEQ11, LB medium containing 0, 10, 50, or 100 μm IPTG was used. Construction of plasmids and other methods of DNA manipulation were performed as described previously (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To construct the T7 promoter overexpression system of thepilQ gene, an NdeI site was introduced at the initiation codon of the pilQ gene by PCR using appropriate primers and pKK702a DNA as a template. TheNdeI-BamHI fragment of the PCR product was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI site of pET28b to give pEQ28. The XbaI-BamHI fragment of pEQ28 was inserted into the XbaI-BamHI sites of pUC119 and pET11a to give pKK702h and pEQ11, respectively. The pilQ mutants were constructed by the PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis method using pKK702h as a template (34Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The resultant mutants are as follows: F209S (TTT to TCT), I219T (ATA to ACA), T234I (ACC to ATC), K238Q (AAA to CAA), D263N (GAT to AAT), D304N (GAT to AAT), H328A (CAC to GCC), C375A (TGT to GCT), C423A (TGT to GCT), R432A (AGA to GCA), and I490V (ATC to GTC). To construct the Δ340 deletion mutant, the NdeI-AccI fragment of pKK702h was introduced into the HincII site of pUC119 by blunt end ligation after treatment with Klenow fragment. To construct mutant pilQ overexpression plasmids, theXbaI-BamHI fragments of pKK702h with mutantpilQ genes were inserted into theXbaI-BamHI site of pET28b. An overnight culture of BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pEQ28 was diluted 50-fold in LB medium (500 ml) containing kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C with shaking. When theA600 of the culture reached ∼0.5, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 1 h, the induced cells were harvested by centrifugation and used for the purification of PilQ protein. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. IPTG-induced cells were resuspended in 50 ml of TS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl) and disrupted by a French pressure cell. Cell extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a Talon Co2+affinity column (CLONTECH). After washing the column with TS buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, bound proteins were eluted with TS buffer containing 300 mmimidazole. The PilQ-containing fraction was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and loaded onto a MonoQ ion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). The column was washed with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), and then bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient (from 0 to 1.0 m) of NaCl in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). The PilQ-enriched fractions were applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer G (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl). Peak fractions of PilQ protein were concentrated; dialyzed against a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 mmNaCl, and 30% glycerol; and stored at −80 °C. ATPase activity of His tag PilQ protein was estimated by the thin layer chromatography (TLC) method (35Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in 40 μl of buffer A (50 mm MES (pH 6.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 25 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT) containing 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (0.9 mCi/mmol) and 2 μm His tag PilQ protein. Aliquots (1 μl) from reaction mixtures were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck) and developed in 1 m formic acid and 0.5m LiCl. The spots of free phosphate and ATP were visualized and quantitated by a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film). The effects of pH on ATPase activity were examined using MES buffer for pH 5.0–7.0 and Tris buffer for pH 7.5–9.0. To determine the kinetics of PilQ ATPase activity, a spectrophotometric method (36Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was performed with slight modifications. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in a mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.25 mm NADH, 5 units of pyruvate kinase, 10 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 6 μg of His tag PilQ protein, and various concentrations of ATP, and decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured using a UV160 spectrophotometer (Shimazu).Km and Vmax values were calculated from Eadie-Scatchard plots. Four doses of the purified His tag PilQ protein were injected subcutaneously into the back of a New Zealand White rabbit in an emulsion containing complete Freund's adjuvant. Anti-PilQ antibody was purified by affinity chromatography using PilQ-conjugated ECH Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Crude thin pilus fraction was prepared as described previously (37Yoshida T. Furuya N. Ishikura M. Isobe T. Fukushima-Haino K. Ogawa T. Komano T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. colicells harboring pKK641A′ pilQ1 and pilQ plasmids with or without mutations were grown to late log phase with shaking at 37 °C. The culture medium was centrifuged at 140,000 ×g for 1 h. The pellet is referred to as the thin pilus fraction. Cells harboring pKK641A′ or pKK702a were lysed by EDTA-lysozyme and fractionated to periplasm, cytoplasmic, and crude membrane fraction as described previously (38Boeke J.D. Model P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5200-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Crude membrane fraction was separated to outer membrane and inner membrane by the three-step sucrose gradient procedure (39Ramer S.W. Bieber D. Schoolnik G.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6555-6563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amounts of PilQ protein in all fractions were determined by Western blot analysis using anti-PilQ antibody. Size and stability of PilQ multimer were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. The purified wild-type and mutant His tag PilQ proteins (500 μg) were applied to a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) with or without 1 mm ATP. Protein concentration and ATPase activity were determined by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and by the TLC method, respectively. The following proteins were used as molecular mass standards: ferritin (450 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (68 kDa). To analyze ATP-induced conformational change of the PilQ protein, trypsin sensitivity of His tag PilQ protein was compared in the presence and absence of 1 mm ATP. Two μg of the purified His tag PilQ protein with or without mutations was digested on ice with 0.3 μg of trypsin in 20 μl of buffer A with or without 1 mm ATP. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitates of acid-denatured proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed with acetone, and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. The samples were applied to SDS-PAGE (15% gel), and then tryptic fragments of PilQ protein were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-PilQ antibody. To study the characteristics of the R64 pilQ product, the pilQgene was cloned into pET28b to give pEQ28 (Fig.1 A). pEQ28 carried a modifiedpilQ gene in which a stretch of six histidine residues was attached at its N terminus. To examine the effects of the PilQ N-terminal His tag on PilQ activity, the complementation activity of pEQ28 for the pilQ1 frameshift mutation in R64 liquid matings was estimated. For that purpose, pEQ11, an Amprderivative of pEQ28, was constructed. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) harboring pKK661, pKK641A′ pilQ1 and pEQ11, and strain TN102 were used as donor and recipient cells, respectively (TableI). The transfer frequency of pKK661 from donor cells harboring pKK661 and pKK641A′ pilQ1 and was less than 0.0001%. When pKK702a carrying the wild-type pilQ gene on pUC119 was introduced into donor cells, the transfer frequency was increased to 0.5–1.0%. When pEQ11 was introduced into donor cells, the transfer frequency was also increased to wild-type levels in the presence of 0–100 μm IPTG. These results suggest that the presence of the His tag at the N terminus of PilQ protein does not affect PilQ activity. Therefore, His tag PilQ protein was purified and used for further analyses to characterize its enzymatic and biochemical features.Table IEffects of overexpression of pilQ gene with His tag on the complementation of the pilQ1 mutationPlasmidTransfer frequency in the presence of various concentrations (μm) of IPTGaOverproduction of PilQ protein under various conditions was roughly estimated by Western blot analysis using anti-PilQ antibody. E. coli NF83 cells harboring pKK702a produced approximately twice as much PilQ protein as compared with those harboring pKK641A′. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pKK702a produced approximately twice, twice, 5-fold, and 10-fold as much PilQ protein as compared with those harboring pKK641A′ under the presence of 0, 10, 50, and 100 μmIPTG, respectively.01050100%PKK661, pKK641A′1.20.970.80.93PKK661, pKK641A′pilQ1<0.0001<0.0001<0.0001<0.0001PKK661, pKK641A′ pilQ1, pKK702a1.00.510.540.5PKK661, pKK641A′pilQ1, pEQ111.11.01.10.67Transfer frequency of pKK661 from E. coli BL21 (DE3) donor cells harboring pKK661, pKK641A′ pilQ1, and complementation plasmids in liquid mating was estimated in the presence of various concentrations of IPTG, and is indicated as a percentage of transconjugants relative to donor cells.a Overproduction of PilQ protein under various conditions was roughly estimated by Western blot analysis using anti-PilQ antibody.

Open table in a new tab Transfer frequency of pKK661 from E. coli BL21 (DE3) donor cells harboring pKK661, pKK641A′ pilQ1, and complementation plasmids in liquid mating was estimated in the presence of various concentrations of IPTG, and is indicated as a percentage of transconjugants relative to donor cells. Upon IPTG induction, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pEQ28 overproduced a 58-kDa protein (data not shown). Since this protein was not produced in the absence of induction and the apparent molecular mass of the overproduced protein is consistent with the calculated value of 59,995 Da, the 58-kDa protein is most likely to be His tag PilQ protein. After ultracentrifugation of cell extract, most overproduced PilQ protein was recovered in the soluble fraction (Fig.1 B, lane S). The PilQ protein was purified by Co2+ affinity chromatography (Fig.1 B, lane E). The peak fraction was further purified by MonoQ anion exchange and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1 B, lane P). SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining indicated that the purity of His tag PilQ protein was over 98% (data not shown). Approximately 2.5 mg of purified His tag PilQ protein was obtained from a 500-ml culture. The purified His tag PilQ protein was used to immunize a rabbit. The purified anti-PilQ antibodies specifically reacted against a 58-kDa PilQ protein present in whole cell lysate from E. coli cells harboring pKK641A′ or pKK702a. Subcellular fractionation experiments were performed to determine localization of PilQ protein within cells. E. coli cells harboring pKK641A′ or pKK702a were separated into cytoplasmic, periplasmic, inner membrane, and outer membrane fractions. Proteins in every fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for PilQ protein by Western blotting using anti-PilQ antibody. PilQ protein was recovered almost exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells harboring pKK641A′ or pKK702a (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the PilQ protein is a cytoplasmic protein. To detect the ATPase activity of the purified His tag PilQ protein, thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis was performed. When the purified PilQ protein was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, release of a Piradiochromatographic spot was observed on a TLC plate in a time- and PilQ concentration-dependent manner (data not shown), indicating that the PilQ protein contains ATPase activity. The effects of different reaction conditions on His tag PilQ ATPase activity were examined (Table II). When PilQ ATPase reactions were carried out under different pH conditions using MES (pH 5–7) and Tris (pH 7.5–9) buffers, maximum ATPase activity was observed around pH 6.5, while either increasing or decreasing the pH from 6.5 significantly lowered the ATPase activity. The PilQ ATPase required divalent cations since EDTA, a divalent cation chelator, strongly inhibited ATPase activity. The optimal concentration of Mg2+ required for ATPase activity was ∼5 mm, whereas a similar concentration of Ca2+resulted in lower activity. The optimal salt concentration was ∼25 mm for both KCl and NaCl, while KCl produced slightly higher ATPase activity than NaCl. Therefore, further ATPase assays were performed with 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mmKCl and at pH 6.5. Kinetics of ATP-hydrolyzing activity of PilQ protein was estimated by the spectrophotometric method. As derived from the Eadie-Scatchard plot (data not shown), the apparentKm for ATP was 0.26 mm, and theVmax value was 0.71 nmol/min/mg of protein.Table IICharacteristics of the ATPase activity of PilQ proteinParameterATPase activitynmol/min/mg proteinDivalent cation (−KCl, pH 6.5)10 mm EDTA0.0170.5 mm MgCl20.595 mmMgCl20.900.5 mm CaCl20.075 mm CaCl20.07Salt (+5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5)25 mmKCl1.0225 mm NaCl0.89pH (+5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl)5.5 (MES)0.776.5 (MES)1.027.5 (Tris)0.758.5 (Tris)0.22The effects of different reaction conditions on ATPase activity of His tag PilQ protein were examined.

To examine whether His tag PilQ protein is able to bind to NTPs or dNTPs other than ATP, the inhibition of PilQ ATPase by NTPs or dNTPs was estimated. A standard ATPase assay with [γ-32P]ATP was performed in the presence of 5-fold excess of unlabeled NTPs or dNTPs. Unlabeled ATP apparently inhibited PilQ ATPase by 79% as expected (Fig.3). PilQ ATPase inhibition by dATP and dGTP were 55% and 30%, respectively, while inhibition by GTP, CTP, UTP, dCTP, and dTTP was less than 20%. These results indicate that PilQ protein exhibits the highest affinity to ATP followed by dATP and dGTP. PilQ affinity to other NTPs or dNTPs is low. It is of great interest whether these NTPs or dNTPs are hydrolyzed by PilQ protein. [α-32P]dATP hydrolysis by PilQ protein was demonstrated by TLC analysis (data not shown). In the previous sections, we have demonstrated that R64 PilQ protein contains ATPase activity. Hence, it was of interest to test whether the ATPase activity of PilQ protein is required for R64 thin pilus biogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1994729367,"A group of 16-kDa proteins, synthesized and secreted by rat pancreatic acinar cells and composed of pancreatic stone protein (PSP/reg) and isoforms of pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP), show structural homologies, including conserved amino acid sequences, cysteine residues, and highly sensitive N-terminal trypsin cleavage sites, as well as conserved functional responses in conditions of pancreatic stress. Trypsin activation of recombinant stress proteins or counterparts contained in rat pancreatic juice (PSP/reg, PAP I and PAP III) resulted in conversion of 16-kDa soluble proteins into 14-kDa soluble isoforms (pancreatic thread protein and pancreatitis-associated thread protein, respectively) that rapidly polymerize into insoluble sedimenting structures. Activated thread proteins show long lived resistance to a wide spectrum of proteases contained in pancreatic juice, including serine proteases and metalloproteinases. In contrast, PAP II, following activation with trypsin or pancreatic juice, does not form insoluble structures and is rapidly digested by pancreatic proteases. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicate that activated thread proteins polymerize into highly organized fibrillar structures with helical configurations. Through bundling, branching, and extension processes, these fibrillar structures form dense matrices that span large topological surfaces. These findings suggest that PSP/reg and PAP I and III isoforms consist of a family of highly regulated soluble secretory stress proteins, which, upon trypsin activation, convert into a family of insoluble helical thread proteins. Dense extracellular matrices, composed of helical thread proteins organized into higher ordered matrix structures, may serve physiological functions within luminal compartments in the exocrine pancreas.

This group, without defined function, is composed of the following protein species. Pancreatic stone protein (PSP/reg)1 is a 16-kDa acidic protein with an isoelectric point in the range of pH 5.5–6. A truncated form of this protein was originally isolated from calcium carbonate stones surgically removed from the main pancreatic duct of humans with chronic pancreatitis (1De Caro A. Lohse J. Sarles H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1176-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For several years it was believed that PSP/reg served as an inhibitor of calcium carbonate precipitation in pancreatic juice, and it was proposed that its name should be changed to “lithostathine” (2Sarles H. Dagorn J.C. Giorgi D. Bernard J.P. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 900-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, it was later shown that PSP/reg has no more crystal inhibitory activity than several of the pancreatic digestive enzymes (3Bimmler D. Graf R. Scheele G.A. Frick T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3073-3082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 4De Reggi M. Gharib B. Patard L. Stoven V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4967-4971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that the expression of PSP/regprotein is increased during the regeneration of islets after nicotinamide treatment and partial pancreatectomy (5Terazono K. Uchiyama Y. Ide M. Watanabe T. Yonekura H. Yamamoto H. Okamoto H. Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Unno M. Itoh T. Watanabe T. Miyashita H. Moriizumi S. Teraoka H. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1992; 321: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These observations led to the conclusion that PSP/reg may be a protein involved in regeneration (7Watanabe T. Yonemura Y. Yonekura H. Suzuki Y. Miyashita H. Sugiyama K. Moriizumi S. Unno M. Tanaka O. Kondo H. Bone A.J. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3589-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and furthermore may act as a growth mediator stimulating the proliferation of β-cells. Tissue culture studies implied a mitogenic activity of PSP/reg on the growth of various cell types (8Zenilman M.E. Magnuson T.H. Swinson K. Egan J. Perfetti R. Shuldiner A.R. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1208-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Fukui H. Kinoshita Y. Maekawa T. Okada A. Waki S. Hassan S. Okamoto H. Chiba T. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1483-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and application of PSP/reg was observed to partially ameliorate diabetes in NOD mice (10Gross D.J. Weiss L. Reibstein I. van den Brand J. Okamoto H. Clark A. Slavin S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2369-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a receptor was cloned from regenerating islets that binds PSP/reg and causes an increase in proliferation of cells transfected with a vector containing the receptor cDNA (11Kobayashi S. Akiyama T. Nata K. Abe M. Tajima M. Shervani N.J. Unno M. Matsuno S. Sasaki H. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10723-10736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Reg II (PAP I) appears to be involved in regeneration of motor neurons by acting as a Schwann cell mitogen (12Livesey F.J. O'Brien J.A. Li M. Smith A.G. Murphy L.J. Hunt S.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Still other investigations sought to implicate PSP/reg in the digestive process. However, recent studies did not show regulated PSP/reg synthesis and secretion in response to changes in nutritional substrates in the diet (13Bimmler D. Angst E. Valeri V. Bain M. Scheele G.A. Frick T.W. Graf R. Pancreas. 1999; 19: 255-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) is a 16-kDa basic protein with an isoelectric point in the range of pH 6.5–7.6. Although most species contain a single PAP form, rat contains three isoforms, PAP I, PAP II, and PAP III, transcribed from three separate genes (14Iovanna J. Orelle B. Keim V. Dagorn J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24664-24669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Frigerio J.M. Dusetti N.J. Keim V. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L.

Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 248-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) pancreatitis. Although showing an acute phase response under conditions of pancreatic disease, the function of PAP remains unknown. PSP/reg and PAP forms, cloned in the rat, mouse, cow, and man, show similarities in amino acid sequence. At the C terminus there is a C-type lectin binding sequence, and it has been proposed that this site might confer bacterial resistance on PAP (14Iovanna J. Orelle B. Keim V. Dagorn J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24664-24669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Iovanna J. Frigerio J.M. Dusetti N. Ramare F. Raibaud P. Dagorn J.C. Pancreas. 1993; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that PSP/reg and PAP both act as acute phase reactants in pancreatic juice under a variety of conditions including acute pancreatitis (20Keim V. Iovanna J.L. Dagorn J.C. Digestion. 1994; 55: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), chronic pancreatitis in male WBN/Kob rats, and during the post-weaning period (21Bimmler D. Schiesser M. Angst E. Bain M. Frick T.W. Graf R. Pancreas. 1999; 19: 416Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Trypsin cleavage of PSP/reg and PAP has resulted in the appearance of precipitated proteins believed to represent insoluble thread structures in humans (22Gross J. Carlson R.I. Brauer A.W. Margolies M.N. Warshaw A.L. Wands J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2115-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and cows (23Gross J. Brauer A.W. Bringhurst R.F. Corbett C. Margolies M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5627-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it remains difficult to understand how precipitation properties could serve useful functions in pancreatic physiology, and it is not clearly known whether these precipitated protein forms demonstrate specific or nonspecific structures. By taking a different approach in this study, we have attempted to define the functional as well as structural similarities shared between these molecules as a means to generate clues related to their function. To this end we have cloned, expressed, and purified recombinant forms of PSP/reg, PAP I, PAP II, and PAP III in the rat (24Bimmler D. Frick T.W. Scheele G.A. Pancreas. 1995; 11: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25Schiesser M. Bimmler D. Frick T.W. Graf R. Pancreas. 2001; 22: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These purified reagents have allowed us to investigate the structural and functional properties of these proteins before and after trypsin cleavage to search for a unifying hypothesis that might explain the function of these proteins in pancreatic physiology and pathology. In this paper we have studied the structural/functional consequences of trypsin activation on these proteins with respect to (i) resistance of the processed forms to trypsin as well as to the heterogeneous mixture of proteases in pancreatic juice, (ii) the kinetics of conversion from soluble to insoluble protein forms, (iii) the kinetics of assembly of protein subunits into polymerized thread structures, and (iv) the morphology of polymerized thread structures by scanning, transmission scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Recombinant PSP/reg was produced in the baculovirus system and purified as described previously (3Bimmler D. Graf R. Scheele G.A. Frick T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3073-3082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Bimmler D. Frick T.W. Scheele G.A. Pancreas. 1995; 11: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Monospecific antibodies directed against rat PSP/reg were generated in rabbits as described earlier (24Bimmler D. Frick T.W. Scheele G.A. Pancreas. 1995; 11: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PAP I cDNA and PAP II cDNA were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a rat pancreas cDNA library using PAP I- and II-specific primers and confirmed by DNA sequencing. PAP III cDNA was isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using rat ileum mRNA as a template. First, total RNA was extracted from rat ileum as described (13Bimmler D. Angst E. Valeri V. Bain M. Scheele G.A. Frick T.W. Graf R. Pancreas. 1999; 19: 255-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and then mRNA was prepared with an Oligotex mRNA minikit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription of 5 μg of ileal mRNA was performed in a volume of 25 μl at 37 °C for 30 min using 19 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a PAP III-specific primer. All three PAP isoforms are secretory proteins; therefore, we attempted to direct the accumulation of recombinant proteins in the media rather than intracellularly. To ensure that these proteins are secreted byP. pastoris, the endogenous PAP signal peptides were substituted by the signal peptide of the α-mating factor. The latter contains a Kex2 signal cleavage site consisting of a Lys-Arg followed by a Glu. Since all PAP isoforms start with a Glu, the PCR and subcloning strategy was designed to produce a cDNA with the Lys-Arg site followed by the first amino acid of the PAP isoforms (Glu). At the 5′-end of the cDNAs an XhoI site was included that facilitates ligation of the cDNA with the pBlueScript and recreates the correct reading frame of the α-mating factor signal peptide in pPIC9 (viz. manual of the Pichia Expression Kit, Invitrogen). The cDNAs were processed using a two-step PCR amplification procedure. In a first PCR, an antisense primer was combined with the matching sense primer (all primer sequences are described in Ref. 25Schiesser M. Bimmler D. Frick T.W. Graf R. Pancreas. 2001; 22: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Second, the purified PCR products were combined in another PCR with the same antisense primers and a set of sense primers causing an elongation of the cDNA. PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Gene Amp PCR system 9600 using Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 30 cycles were run (1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C). After each amplification step the cDNAs were purified by excising them from agarose gels (26Heery D.M. Gannon F. Powell R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 173-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The recovered cDNAs were purified by phenol extraction and sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation. The cDNAs were subsequently digested with XhoI andEcoRI restriction endonucleases (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The digests were purified and subcloned into pBlueScript (Stratagene) using T4 ligase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TOP F10′Escherichia coli cells were transformed with the ligated plasmids by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Pulser II. Purified plasmids from individual colonies were digested with restriction enzymes to check for inserts, and some were subsequently sequenced to confirm the correct orientation of the coding sequence. Plasmids carrying the correct sequence were then digested with XhoI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, and the inserts were subcloned into the Pichia shuttle vector pPIC9 (Invitrogen). One recombinant vector for each isoform was sequenced again to confirm the correct insertion and sequence. ThePichia strains GS115 and KM71 (Invitrogen) were transformed with the linearized recombinant pPIC9 vector (SalI restriction endonuclease) by electroporation according to the supplier's recommendations. The transformants were plated on histidine-deficient minimal dextrose (MD) agar plates (1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 0.00004% biotin and 1% dextrose), and colonies were analyzed for insert integration by PCR, using the α-factor primer and the 3′ AOX1 (alcohol oxidase) primer. Positive clones were selected and tested with respect to their expression levels. By using a shaking incubator at 280 rpm, colonies were grown at 29 °C in baffeled flasks, each containing 80 ml of buffered minimal glycerol (BMG) medium (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 0.00004% biotin, and 1% glycerol). Culture growth was monitored by measurement of the absorbance (600 nm); when anA 600 between 2 and 6 was reached, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. To induce expression of the recombinant protein, the cells were resuspended in 12 ml of BMM medium (BMG medium, containing 0.5% methanol instead of glycerol) and cultured for 6 days. The protein secretion was monitored in 24-h intervals by electrophoretic analysis of the supernatant (Coomassie-stained SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels). The most productive clones were selected and cultured in increased culture volumes. The highest yields were found in 5-day-old cultures. High yield media were collected by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged again at 5000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were diluted 1:3 with chilled MilliQ filtered water (Millipore) and adjusted to pH 3.6 with HCl. Diluted protein solution (1200–1600 ml) was applied at a rate of 5 ml/min to a cation exchange column (SP-Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 26 × 80 mm) with a bed volume of 40 ml. The column was washed with 2 volumes of starting buffer (50 mm MES, 10 mm LiCl, pH 5.3). The proteins were eluted with a linear LiCl gradient (0–35% elution buffer: 50 mm MES, 2 m LiCl, pH 6.3), generated by an AKTA purifier system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To verify the identity of each of the isoforms, both mass spectrometry (electrospray mass analysis, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed. The secreted, purified forms of PAP I, II, and III were desalted by ultrafiltration. To identify the new N terminus of the trypsin-resistant 14-kDa protein, each isoform was digested with trypsin as described below. The solutions were centrifuged to pellet the fibrils and remove the cleaved undecapeptide. For PAP II, the solution was filtered after digestion with an ultrafiltration device that retained the C-terminal peptide (10-kDa molecular weight cut-off, Centricon, Millipore). For mass analysis, aliquots were adsorbed to C18 ZIP tips (Millipore), eluted with 78% methanol, 1% formic acid, and injected into the analyzer. One hundred micrograms of recombinant PAP II were injected in Freund's complete adjuvant into several subcutaneous deposits in the back of a New Zealand White rabbit and a guinea pig. After 1 month the animals were boosted with 50 μg of PAP II in Freund's incomplete adjuvant followed by a similar boost a month later. Antibody titers were monitored in serum after venopuncture of the ear vein. Terminal bleeding was performed under anesthesia (Ketamine/Xylazine) by heart puncture. The antibody directed against PAP II reacts with PAP II (100%), PAP III (35%), PAP I (<10%), PATP II (80%), PATP III (<10%), and PATP I (<10%) but does not react with PSP/reg. Twenty microliters of rat pancreatic juice were diluted in 400 μl of Tris-Calcium buffer (10 mm, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2) and equilibrated at 37 °C. An aliquot was withdrawn, and enteropeptidase (Worthington) was added at a final concentration of 0.1 unit/ml. The reaction was continued at 37 °C for 16 h during which several aliquots were withdrawn as a function of time as indicated in Fig. 1. The aliquots were transferred into a tube containing 50 μg of FOY 305, a potent trypsin inhibitor, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until all aliquots had been collected. The samples were then rapidly thawed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min in a cooled Beckman centrifuge (TL-100). The supernatant fraction was transferred to a new tube, and the pellet fraction was washed with 50 μl of Tris-Calcium buffer and centrifuged as described above. The pellets were dissolved in Tris-Calcium buffer in the original volume of the sample. They were prepared for electrophoresis by adding a 0.5 volume of 3-fold concentrated SDS-sample buffer (150 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 0.015% bromphenol blue, 15% glycerol v/v) followed by heating for 5 min at 90 °C. To maximize immunoreactivity of the activated protein forms, β-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the buffer solutions. Activation of the recombinant proteins was performed in a volume of 100 or 200 μl in Tris-Calcium buffer. Proteins (10 or 20 μg) were activated with 0.5–1 μg of trypsin (Worthington) for 30 min at 37 °C. Standard 15% polyacrylamide gels were prepared in SDS. Protein samples were heat-denatured at 90 °C in SDS-sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 5% glycerol) in the presence or absence of β-mercaptoethanol as indicated above. Proteins resolved in gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (0.1% in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, Bio-Rad). For Western blot analysis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) (24Bimmler D. Frick T.W. Scheele G.A. Pancreas. 1995; 11: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) on a semidry blotting apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Guinea pig anti-PAP II, diluted 1:3000 (25Schiesser M. Bimmler D. Frick T.W. Graf R. Pancreas. 2001; 22: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and phosphatase-coupled anti-guinea pig IgG, diluted 1:10,000 (Sigma), were used to detect PAP and PATP. For the detection of PSP/regand PTP, chemiluminescence (ECLplus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was employed. The primary rabbit anti-PSP/reg antibody was diluted 1:20,000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The secondary antibody, peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was diluted 1:25,000 in the same buffer. Development and detection followed the manufacturer's recommendations. Relative quantities of individual protein bands were estimated by densitometry. Coomassie Blue-stained gels or Western blots were scanned with a Scanjet 6300C (Hewlett-Packard). The files were imported into Adobe Photoshop and quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) software. Intensities were expressed in percent of the maximal value as indicated in the figure legends. Recombinant thread proteins were diluted to 10 μg/50 μl in Tris-Calcium buffer and centrifuged in Microfuge tubes (Beckman) using a table top ultracentrifuge (Beckman TL 100). Following centrifugation of the sample at 1000 × g (4 °C, 30 min), the supernatant fractions were transferred to new tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with Tris-Calcium buffer (described above) and redissolved in the original volume. Pellet and supernatant fractions were denatured in the presence of SDS-sample buffer, including 1% β-mercaptoethanol, for 5 min at 90 °C and submitted to SDS-PAGE. For scanning electron microscopy, pouches of nylon mesh, ∼1 cm2, were produced by folding a small piece of nylon mesh. The edges were heat-sealed, except for a small hole through which the samples could be introduced. The activation mixtures were transferred into the pouch, closed with a clamp, and submerged in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.5, for 30 min at 4 °C. The pouch was then transferred to 2% glutaraldehyde in 100 mmsodium cacodylate, pH 7.5. After fixation at 4 °C overnight, the pouches were opened and processed for SEM analysis using standard procedures. The samples were viewed on a JEOL (JSM-25S II) scanning electron microscope. Photographs were taken via an attached computer using the software DISS (Digital Image Scanning System, Prophysics, Switzerland). For scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, Philips CM 120) analysis, a small amount of fibrillar material was removed from the surface of the pouch and plated with gold. To exclude gold-derived artifacts, the following pilot study was performed. After glutaraldehyde fixation, the pouch (see above) was immersed in 2% OsO4, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer for 3 h. The pouch was rinsed and processed for SEM and STEM. In the absence of gold plating, the quality of resolution of the protein matrix was inferior compared with the gold-plated sample. However, it was concluded that the structure of the unplated sample was comparable to the structure of the gold-plated sample. To prepare thin sections of fibrils for examination in the electron microscope, the activation mixtures were initially embedded in Epon. However, this approach required extensive centrifugation after each medium change and a polymerization step at 60 °C. The resulting preparations appeared amorphous due to the loss of the fibrillar architecture. To circumvent this problem, we omitted centrifugation and used an alternative procedure that did not require polymerization at 60 °C. The digests were mixed with 0.1 volume of 25% glutaraldehyde and left at 4 °C overnight. Then OsO4 was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and fixation was continued at room temperature for another hour. The fibrils demonstrated a black appearance and settled to the bottom of the vessel. Unicryl (British Biocell Int., Cardiff, UK), an embedding medium that polymerizes at low temperatures under UV light, was used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife and examined in an electron microscope (Philips 400). As a negative control for this procedure, buffer was substituted for the activation mixture and processed as described above. Although some amorphous material was generated during OsO4 fixation, the fibrillar structures were not observed in the control. For negative contrast staining of fibrils, a small drop of activated sample was placed on the surface of a grid, dried, exposed to phosphotungstic acid (27Brenner S. Horne W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and examined in the electron microscope. The multiple sequence alignment was created by “PileUp,” an algorithm for progressive, pairwise sequence alignments by Feng and Doolittle (28Feng D.F. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1987; 25: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). The same program produces a dendrogram that depicts the clustering relationships. The determination of sequence similarity and identity was performed by pairwise analysis using the program “Gap.” Gap and PileUp are part of the Wisconsin package version 9, supplied by Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). GCG is run on a UNIX system (Silicon Graphics) maintained by the Rechenzentrum der Universität Zürich. Fig. 1shows the sequence alignment of the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of three isoforms of PAP with PSP/reg in the rat. The mature secretory proteins are defined by two peptide domains separated by a highly conserved trypsin cleavage site. In three of the four secretory stress proteins (PSP/reg, PAP I, and PAP III), the Arg11–Ile12 bond represents the most sensitive cleavage site for trypsin. Upon trypsin cleavage the N-terminal undecapeptide is separated from the C-terminal peptide, which varies from 138 residues in PAP to 133 residues in PSP/reg. In addition to similarities in size, these proteins show similarities in sequence and protein domains. PSP/reg shows 43% identity and 54% similarity with PAP I, 45% identity and 52% similarity with PAP II, and 50% identity and 57% similarity with PAP III. PSP/reg is five amino acids shorter than the three PAP isoforms. The conservation of six cysteine residues suggests that three disulfide bonds are conserved. At the C terminus there is a conserved sequence indicating a C-type lectin domain (Fig. 1). Although the function of this signature sequence has not been elucidated, CTLs have been found in a variety of proteins that demonstrate diverse functions in different cellular and extracellular compartments (29Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 393-400Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, the conserved N-terminal trypsin cleavage site is not observed in other proteins bearing CTLs. The secreted and proteolytic processed forms of recombinant PSP/reg and recombinant PAP shown in Fig. 1 were analyzed by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. The secreted forms of PAP I, II, and III all conformed with the expected amino acid sequence (first 10 amino acids determined), starting with a glutamine residue in each case. The processed forms of PAP also conformed with the expected sequence (first 5–7 amino acids determined) starting with an isoleucine (PATP I, III) or a threonine (PATP II) residue. Mass analysis yielded the following measurements: PAP I, 16623.6 (theoretical 16623.6); PATP I, 15414.0 (15414.2); PAP II, 16404.2 (16403.2); PATP II, 15203.9 (15203.9); PAP III, 16247.8 (16248.0); and PATP III, 15021.5"

Single mutations of Lys819 or Arg822 to Ala, Phe, or Glu allow good expression, but produce strong inhibition of ATPase activity. The main defect produced by these mutations is strong interference with enzyme phosphorylation by ATP in the presence of Ca2+, and also by Pi in the absence of Ca2+. The Lys819 and Arg822 mutants undergo slight and moderate reduction of Ca2+ binding affinity, respectively. Reduction of overall steady state ATPase velocity is then due to inhibition of phosphorylated intermediate formation. On the other hand, a cluster of conservative mutations of Asp813, Asp815, and Asp818 to Asn interferes strongly with enzyme activation by Ca2+ binding and formation of phosphorylated enzyme intermediate by utilization of ATP. Enzyme phosphorylation by Pi in the absence of Ca2+undergoes slight or no inhibition by the triple aspartate mutation. Therefore, the triple mutation interferes mainly with the calcium-dependent activation of the ATPase. The effect of the triple mutation can be to a large extent reproduced by single mutation of Asp813 (but not of Asp815 or Asp818) to Asn. Functional and structural analysis of the experimental data demonstrates that the L67 loop plays an important role in protein folding and function.

NP mRNA and protein levels increased in the hippocampus after kindled seizures and injection of antibody against NP led to retardation of epilepticus in mice (5Okabe A. Momota Y. Yoshida S. Hirata A.

Furthermore, application of recombinant NP induced an increase in the amplitude of the tetanic stimulation-induced early phase long term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral pathway (7Komai S.

It has been proposed that the plasticity changes are regulated by the balance between the accumulation and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. There is, indeed, some evidence that the formation of hippocampal LTP is attributable to cell-ECM interactions, involving cadherin (8Tang L. Hung C.P. Schuman E.M.

Therefore, rearrangement of these ECM components by NP and a specific inhibitor might implicated in the formation of LTP. As another characteristic of NP, it has been shown that NP mRNA was restricted to neurons in the limbic areas of adult brain involving the CA1–CA3 subfields of the hippocampus, the amygdaloid nucleus, the cingulate cortex, the anterior olfactory nuclei, the septal nuclei, and the diagonal bands (4Chen Z.-L.

Recent studies have shown that the neuronal degeneration response to several pathological stimuli, including age-associated memory impairment, Alzheimer's disease, brain ischemia, and epilepsy, occurs in highly vulnerable regions including the CA1 subfield and hilar area of the hippocampal formation, the cingulate area, and the basal forebrain (19Arendt T.

Thus, control of NP activity by a specific inhibitor may play a role in the selective vulnerability. However, the specific inhibitor for NP has still not been identified. Serine proteases are controlled by specific inhibitors called serpins (2Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by the α2-macroglobulin (α2M) family that acts as a panprotease inhibitor through a unique trapping mechanism (23Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The neurally expressed serpins protease nexin-1 and neuroserpin are synthesized and secreted in most brain regions (24Baker J.B. Low D.A. Simmer R.L. Cunningham D.D.

On the other hand, intracellular protease inhibitors belonging to the ovalbumin serpin family have been recently identified in the immune system (30Bird P.I. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 1998; 24: 63-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and induction of serine proteinase inhibitor-3 (SPI3) mRNA was reported in brain ischemia (31Nakaya N. Nishibori M. Wang Z. Sakiyama J. Saeki K. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the target protease is not to be identified in brain. Second, α2M is cleaved in a peptide bond in the “bait region” within α2M by proteases. This cleavage allows α2M to undergo a drastic conformational change and to form a cage-like structure around the protease, leading to loss of protease hydrolytic activity against macromolecules (32Sottrup-Jensen L.

Additionally, conformational change also reveals binding sites for the α2M receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (34Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol.

In the present study, we investigated whether there were specific inhibitors that form a complex with NP in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the adult mouse brain in vivo. The search revealed two distinct complexes and SPI3 and MUG I as NP-specific. We propose that SPI3 and MUG I regulate NP activity in adult brain. Recombinant neuropsin (r-NP) was produced as precursor in cultured medium using a baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (15Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K.

The amount of r-NP and r-NP-mutant proteins (N2a) in the cultured supernatant was determined based on band density stained using colloidal properties of Coomassie G-250 (GelCode Blue, Pierce) followed by SDS-PAGE. Purified r-NP (Baculo) was used as a control of the amount. Anti-NP monoclonal antibodies (F12mAb and B5mAb) (6Momota Y. Yoshida S. Ito J. Shibata M. Kato K. Sakurai K. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka S. Eur.

The hippocampus and cerebral cortex were dissected from adult mice (8 weeks old, Slc:ddY, Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan), and the tissues were mixed and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer with 1 ml of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.15 m NaCl for the tissues recovered from one mouse. After incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the soluble fraction was recovered (0.15 m NaCl-soluble fraction). The sediment was resuspended with an equal volume of ice-cold 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 2% Triton X-100, homogenized, and stood on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 102,000 × g for 10 min, the Triton-insoluble residue was pelleted; resuspended with an equal volume of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1% Triton X-100; homogenized; and stood on ice for 30 min. After further centrifugation at 208,000 × g for 10 min, the second Triton-insoluble fraction was homogenized in an equal volume of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mNaCl; incubated on ice for 30 min; and then centrifuged at 383,000 × g for 10 min. Finally, the supernatant was recovered as a cytoskeleton-rich fraction (15Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K. Momota Y. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka T. Midorikawa R. Kamachi T. Kawabe A. Shiosaka S. J.

Crude extracts (3 mg) were incubated with r-NP (2 μg) on ice for 1 h and rotated in the presence of Affi-Gel Hz beads (Bio-Rad) conjugated with rat IgG (more than 20 μg of IgG/2 μg of r-NP) at 4 °C for 30 min. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with Affi-Gel Hz beads conjugated with F12mAb (more than 20 μg of IgG) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.15 m NaCl and rotated at 4 °C for 15 h. The beads were washed, mixed with an equal volume of SDS-containing buffer w/o 100 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), boiled for 5 min, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 5–15% gradient of acrylamide, according to Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% skim milk in 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) for 30 min at room temperature, the membranes were reacted with rabbit anti-NP polyclonal antibody (11pAb) and then anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) in 5% skim milk-TTBS. The secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Immun-Star Substrate; Bio-Rad). After development, the band intensities were analyzed using one-dimensional gel image analysis software (Quantity One software, PDI, Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). After incubation of r-actNP and Triton-soluble fractions (430 mg) on ice for 30 min, the Affi-Gel Hz beads conjugated with F12mAb were mixed, rotated, and washed sequentially based on the above immunoprecipitation. The r-actNP/Triton-soluble fractions/F12mAb ratio was 1:7600:10 (w/w/w). The F12mAb beads were packed in a Sepacol column (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The column was washed with five bed volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.15 m NaCl and of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m NaCl. The 65-kDa complex was eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. After dialysis with a 2000-fold volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 2.5 h, the sample was freeze-dried. The concentrated sample was then resuspended with distilled water and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Crude extracts (150 mg) in the 0.15 m NaCl-soluble fraction were dialyzed with a dialysis membrane (Seamless Cellulose Tube, molecular weight cut-off 12,000–14,000; Wako) in a 100-fold volume of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.25 m NaCl at 4 °C for 4 h. After centrifugation and filtration with a 0.22-μm filter, the extract was applied to a Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.6 m NaCl (FPLC LCC-500 PLUS system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 144 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions with the greatest binding activity for r-actNP were eluted at 0.2–0.3 m, pooled, and subjected to affinity chromatography with r-actNP and Affi-Gel Hz beads conjugated with F12mAb according to the above procedures for purification of 65-kDa complex. The r-actNP/pooled Resource Q eluant/F12mAb ratio was 1:800:7 (w/w/w). Eluant with an A280of more than 0.01 was pooled, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 with 1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Then the mixture was diluted 5-fold with 12.5% glycerol and 0.125 m NaCl. Samples were applied to a column of Mono Q PC connected with a precolumn under the Smart system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anion exchange resin was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol. Bound proteins were eluted with NaCl in a linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.6 m for 67 min at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Purity and molecular weight were assessed by SDS-PAGE using a 5–15% gradient of acrylamide, silver staining, and Western blot. The band densities visualized by Western blot and Coomassie Blue R-250 were determined using one-dimensional gel image analysis software (Quantity One software). The 65- and 230-kDa complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a gel containing, respectively, 10% and a 5–15% gradient of acrylamide and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Each band was excised and digested with 3 μg/mlAchromobacter lyticus protease I (39Masaki T. Tanabe M. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 40Kawasaki H. Emori Y. Suzuki K. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C overnight. The digests were separated using a model 1100 liquid chromatography system (Hewlett Packard Company, California) on a DEAE-5PW column (1 × 20 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and a CAPCELL PAK RP18 (1 × 100 mm; Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan), which were linked tandemly, with a linear gradient of 0–48% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 96 min for the 65-kDa complex and with linear gradients of 0.8% (0 min) to 10% (10 min) to 40% (130 min) to 80% (135 min) acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for the 230-kDa complex at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Fractionated peptides were subjected to protein sequencing and mass spectrometry as described previously (41Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Recombinant SPI3 (r-SPI3) was prepared with the Pichia pastoris expression system (42Sun J. Coughlin P. Salem H.H. Bird P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To obtain an SDS-stable complex of r-SPI3 and r-actNP (Baculo), 200 ng of r-SPI3 was added to 100 ng of r-actNP and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples containing either r-SPI3 or r-actNP alone were incubated in parallel. Three identical sample sets were separated by reducing 12.5% SDS-PAGE. One set was silver-stained, and the other two sets were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with either rabbit anti-NP (11pAb) or rabbit anti-SPI3 antibody. Next, the stoichiometry was measured by incubating increasing amounts of r-SPI3 with r-actNP (40 nm) in a total volume of 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin in individual wells of a microtitration plate previously blocked with buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The reactants were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and residual amidolytic activity was measured by 100 μl of 100 μm t-butoxycarbonyl-Val-Pro-Arg-methylcoumarin in the same buffer for a final concentration of 50 μm and monitoring the fluorescence change using a Biolumine read. The data were used to plot the enzymatic rate of substrate hydrolysis as a function of the amount of SPI-3 added to the reaction well. Linear regression to the x axis was used to calculate the precise amount of SPI-3 required to inhibit rNP completely. Furthermore, the association rate constant between r-SPI3 and r-actNP was determined. A constant amount of r-actNP (0.2 nm) was mixed with different concentrations of r-SPI3 and excess substrate (40 μm;t-butoxycarbonyl-Val-Pro-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide) in a final volume of 200 μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8,000. The reactions were monitored at 37 °C for 2 h with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm, with residual activity determined periodically. The interactions of recombinant SPI3 with r-actNP were determined with the progress curve method followed by slow binding inhibition kinetics (43Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar),Y=vst+(v0−vs)∗(1−e−k′t)/k′Equation 1 where Y represents the amount of product at timet, k′ is the apparent first order rate constant, and v0 and vs are the initial and steady state velocities, respectively. The association (Ka) was calculated using the equation,Ka=Kobs(1+[S]/Km)Equation 2 where Kobs = k′, [S] represents the concentration of substrate, and Km is the Michaelis constant. Ki is essentially obtained by the Guy Salvesen and Hideaki Nagase method (44Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar),Ki=Ki(app)/1+[S]/KmEquation 3 where V0/Vi = 1 + [I]/Ki(app) and V0represents the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis rate in the absence of an inhibitor. Vi is the inhibited rate. Values were determined from Dixon plots. In the present study,Km, kcat, andkcat/Km of r-NP were 123.6 μm, 4.2 s−1, and 33,900m−1 s−1, respectively. MUG I (sequential concentration, 0.28–4.48 μg) purified from mouse serum (45Saito A. Sinohara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 775-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was incubated with r-actNP (Baculo) (40 ng) at 25 °C for 15 min, and the mixture was subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE to determine whether it formed an SDS-stable complex. To determine the effect of MUG I on the proteolytic activity of NP for fibronectin, a mixture of r-actNP (Baculo) (20 ng) and plasma MUG I (sequential concentration, 0.14–2.28 μg) was incubated with fibronectin (400 ng; human plasma; Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 16 h as described previously (15Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K. Momota Y. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka T. Midorikawa R. Kamachi T. Kawabe A. Shiosaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11189-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Sample was subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were reacted with mouse anti-fibronectin monoclonal antibody (clone10; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and then anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). After detection of the secondary antibody by enhanced chemiluminescence, the band density of 170-kDa fragments of fibronectin was determined with one-dimensional gel image analysis software. For preparation of riboprobes, the SPI3 target sequence was amplified with a single cDNA synthesized from the hippocampal total RNA by one round of polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-CCAAAGTTTAAGCTGGAGGAGAA-3′/5′-CTGACAGGAATACCCTTTGCTCA-3′ (338 bp; bp 887–1224), and the polymerase chain reaction fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector. α-35S-Labeled riboprobes were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals): antisense, NcoI and SP6 RNA polymerase; sense, SalI and T7 RNA polymerase. In situhybridization histochemistry was performed as previously described (4Chen Z.-L. Yoshida S. Kato K. Momota Y. Suzuki J. Tanaka T. Ito J. Nishino H. Aimoto S. Kiyama H. Shiosaka S. J.

No signals were detected on the adjacent sections incubated in control hybridization mixture containing sense probe (see Fig. 6 C). Coronal sections (14 μm thick) of adult mouse (8 weeks old, Slc:ddY) were cut on a cryostat. Sections on slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.7 mmCaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2, for 1 h at 4 °C. Sections were treated with 20 mm glycine and phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min; washed with 0.15 mNaCl, 20 mm boric acid, and 5 mm sodium tetraborate decahydrate, pH 8.0 (BBS); and incubated with rabbit serum anti-MUG I antibody (diluted to 1:500) or the preimmune rabbit serum (diluted to 1:500) (46Yamamoto K. Tsujino Y. Saito A. Sinohara H. Biochem. Int. 1985; 10: 463-469PubMed Google Scholar) in 3% bovine serum albumin and 3% goat serum in BBS overnight at 4 °C. After a wash with BBS, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (diluted 1:600;BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) in 5% bovine serum albumin and BBS was applied overnight at 4 °C. After being washed, coverslips were mounted in glycerol containing Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) and 1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane (Sigma-Aldrich) (47Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. ColdSpring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and were observed with an Axioplan2 microscope (CarlZeiss, Tokyo, Japan). No signals were detected on the adjacent sections incubated with preimmune serum before the rabbit was immunized with MUG I (see Fig. 7, G–I). We screened for NP-specific inhibitors present in adult mouse brain in vivo. We monitored whether r-NP (Baculo), originating from the baculovirus expression system, formed SDS-stable complexes with molecules within extracts prepared from adult mouse hippocampi and cerebral cortices, in which NP mRNA is expressed most abundantly (4Chen Z.-L.

https://openalex.org/W2090469116,"Transcriptional reinitiation is a distinct phase of the RNA polymerase II transcription cycle. Prior work has shown that reinitiation is deficient in nuclear extracts from Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking the 80-kDa subunit of Ku, a double-strand break repair protein, and that activity is rescued by expression of the corresponding cDNA. We now show that Ku increases the amount or availability of a soluble factor that is limiting for reinitiation, that the factor increases the number of elongation complexes associated with the template at all times during the reaction, and that the factor itself does not form a tight complex with DNA. The factor may consist of a preformed complex of transcription proteins that is stabilized by Ku. A Ku mutant, lacking residues 687-728 in the 80-kDa subunit, preferentially suppresses transcription in Ku-containing extracts, suggesting that Ku interacts directly with proteins required for reinitiation. The Ku mutant functions normally in a DNA end-joining system, indicating that the functions of Ku in transcription and repair are genetically separable. Based on our results, we present a model in which Ku is capable of undergoing a switch between a transcription factor-associated and a repair-active state."

Here we show that Grb2 and Grb3-3, the molecules functioning as an adaptor in the signal transduction pathway, specifically and directly bind to p27 in the cytoplasm and participate in the regulation of p27. The interaction requires the C-terminal SH3-domain of Grb2/3-3 and the proline-rich sequence contained in p27 immediately downstream of the Cdk binding domain. In living cells, enforcement of the cytoplasmic localization of p27, either by artificial manipulation of the nuclear/cytoplasmic transport signal sequence or by coexpression of ectopic Jab1/CSN5, markedly enhances the stable interaction between p27 and Grb2. Overexpression of Grb2 accelerates Jab1/CSN5-mediated degradation of p27, while Grb3-3 expression suppresses it. A p27 mutant unable to bind to Grb2 is transported into the cytoplasm in cells ectopically expressing Jab1/CSN5 but is refractory to the subsequent degradation. These findings indicate that Grb2 participates in a negative regulation of p27 and may directly link the signal transduction pathway with the cell cycle regulatory machinery.

These findings indicate that Grb2 participates in a negative regulation of p27 and may directly link the signal transduction pathway with the cell cycle regulatory machinery. The proliferation of mammalian cells is strictly regulated by extracellular signals, which largely exert their effects during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Among G1 regulatory factors, the Cdk inhibitor p27 (p27Kip1), which negatively regulates cell proliferation, is the downstream target of mitogen-stimulated signal transduction, and modulation of p27 activity is one of the most important steps not only in the control of mammalian cell proliferation but also in the regulation of normal tissue development and in the suppression of malignant transformation (1Sgambato A. Cittadini A. Faraglia B. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The expression level of p27 is regulated in several ways, among which cell cycle-dependent and substrate-specific proteolysis seems to be the most important (1Sgambato A. Cittadini A. Faraglia B. Weinstein I.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of p27 has been reported to involve (i) phosphorylation of the Thr187residue by the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex (3Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 4Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), (ii) transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), (iii) ubiquitination mediated by the ubiquitin ligase SCFSKP2 complex (6Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat.

However, the precise biochemical link between these events and the biochemical reaction that initiates p27 degradation remains to be clarified.Recently, we have isolated a new regulator of p27, Jab1/CSN5 (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Jab1/CSN5 was originally identified as a coactivator of c-Jun transcription factor (9Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and recent findings indicate that Jab1/CSN5 is the fifth component of the COP9 signalosome complex (10Wei N. Deng X.W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (the nomenclature of the eight subunits is now unified as CSN1–8 (11Deng X.W. Dubiel W. Wei N. Hofmann K. Mundt K. Colicelli J. Kato J. Naumann M. Segal D. Seeger M. Carr A. Glickman M. Chamovitz D.A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 202-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)). Although the COP9 signalosome was originally identified inArabidopsis as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis, purification of the COP9 signalosome complex from mammalian cells has revealed that its function is not necessarily restricted to light/dark-mediated signal transduction in plants. Genetic analysis has demonstrated that the complex plays a pivotal role in the regulation of early development (12Freilich S. Oron E. Kapp Y. Nevo-Caspi Y. Orgad S. Segal D. Chamovitz D.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1187-1190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but the specific biochemical functions of the complex are not fully clarified yet. Jab1/CSN5 directly interacts with p27 in vitro as well as in vivo. In cells expressing ectopic Jab1/CSN5, p27 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and is induced to be degraded in a manner sensitive to chemical inhibitors of CRM1-dependent nuclear export and the 26 S proteasome. Jab1/CSN5 overexpression enables mouse fibroblasts to progress from G0 to S phase in low serum, indicating that Jab1/CSN5 plays an important role in G1 progression and cell proliferation (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar).Many growth factor receptors exhibit tyrosine kinase activity triggered by oligomerization upon binding to their specific ligands, leading to autophosphorylation (13Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine residues contained in the activated receptor serve as docking sites for a variety of downstream effector molecules such as Grb2. Grb2 functions as an adaptor and contains two types of interaction domains, SH2 and SH3 (14Birge R.B. Knudsen B.S. Besser D. Hanafusa H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). SH2 mediates binding to phosphotyrosine residues contained in the receptor, and SH3 directs Grb2 to the proline-rich motif, through which Grb2 associates with SOS, resulting in activation of Ras protein. The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade consisting of Raf kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk1 and Erk2) as well as another Ras target, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, acts downstream of Ras and facilitates cell cycle progression through G1. Introduction of a dominant negative form of Ras into proliferating cells up-regulates p27 protein expression (15Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 16Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while activation of Ras induces p27 down-regulation (17Kawada M. Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase counteracts the action of Ras to down-regulate p27 (16Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kawada M. Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that the receptor-Ras-(mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) signaling pathway plays an important role in p27 regulation. In the present study, we show that Grb2 and its alternatively spliced form, Grb3-3, bind to p27 in the cytoplasm and that the interaction between Grb2 and p27 is required for efficient degradation of p27. Our findings may, at least in part, explain why nuclear p27 is translocated to the cytoplasm before degradation and provide a novel pathway from the signal transduction machinery directly to the cell cycle regulator.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant Proteins and in Vitro Protein Binding AssayTo construct the p27(PA) mutant, overlapping fragments of p27, introducing the relevant nucleotide changes, were made. The 3′-fragment was made by PCR 1The abbreviations used are:PCRpolymerase chain reactionHAhemagglutininSH2 and SH3Src homology domain 2 and 3, respectivelyGSTglutathione S-transferase using wild-type p27 cDNA as a template and the PA mutation primer (5′-C TAC TAC AGG GCC GCG CGC GCC GCC AAG AGC GCC TGC-3′) and 3′-p27 primer (5′-AAGCTT CGT CTG GCG TCG AAG G-3′).

The overlapping PCR fragments were purified, mixed, and used as the template for the second PCR. The full-length p27(PA) mutant fragment was amplified by PCR using the 5′- and 3′-p27 primers introducing a 5′ BamHI and a 3′ HindIII site, respectively. cDNA fragments encoding p27 variants, Grb2, Grb3-3, and a variety of SH3-containing proteins were amplified by PCR using a pair of primers specific to each of them. The resulting PCR fragments were cloned, sequenced to confirm sequence integrity, and inserted into pGEX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in frame with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and pBluescript. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (18Akamatsu E. Tanaka T. Kato J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16494-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Crude cell extracts containing recombinant mammalian cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex expressed in Sf9 cells by infection with baculovirus expression vectors were prepared as previously described (19Kato J. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). pBluescript plasmids containing cDNA were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT T7/T3 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding was performed as described (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the protein complexes were washed in the same buffer.Cell Culture and High Efficiency TransfectionNIH3T3 and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Grb2/Grb3-3 cDNA was inserted into the pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.) in frame with a FLAG epitope. The expression vectors for p27 variants and Jab1 were previously described (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with vectors by a modified calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method (20Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4809) Google Scholar). The highest efficiency was obtained as described (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Consistently, 50–80% of the transfected cells expressed exogenous proteins coded in the plasmid. Antisense oligonucleotides and controls directed to Grb2 have been designed and manufactured by Biognostik, Germany, and were directly added to the medium (final concentration 2 μm). Cells were cultured in the same medium for 3 days and harvested. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies specific to Grb2, p27, and p21.Protein AnalysesCells were harvested 24 h (for detection of the complex) and 48–72 h (for detection of p27 down-regulation) after transfection. Metabolic labeling, cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 18Akamatsu E. Tanaka T. Kato J. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to GST and p27 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to HA and FLAG peptide epitopes were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Kodak, respectively.Immunofluorescent StainingCells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, stained with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated with Texas Red-linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For determination of BrdU incorporation, cells stained with anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Babco) followed by Texas Red-linked antirabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were treated with 1.5m HCl and stained with anti-bromodeoxyuridine mouse monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fluorescein-linked anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cell samples were viewed by phase-contrast and/or fluorescence microscopy. More than 500 cells were examined for each transfectant.RESULTSIdentification of Grb2 and Grb3-3 as New Interactors Specific to p27Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified three kinds of cDNAs (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), all of which encode polypeptides capable of specifically interacting with the C-terminal domain of p27Kip1. We previously showed that one of them encodes Jab1/CSN5, which negatively regulates p27 by translocating it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and subsequently inducing its degradation (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The second class of cDNA contained the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, which is well known to function as an adaptor molecule in the signal transduction pathway (14Birge R.B. Knudsen B.S. Besser D. Hanafusa H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of the interaction between p27 and Grb2, we analyzed the capability of p27 to bind to other SH3-containing proteins. We selected from the data base several genes that encode proteins containing a SH3 domain closely related to the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (more than 40% identity), including STAM, SH3P8, SH3P13, and mNck-α (accession numbers are U43900, U58885, U58887, andAF043259, respectively) in addition to Grb2 and its alternatively spliced form, Grb3-3 (21Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocque B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We cloned their coding sequences by PCR using a pair of primers specific to each of them, transcribed/translated them in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine, and used these 35S-labeled proteins to assay in vitro the binding to GST and GST-fused p27 recombinant proteins preabsorbed onto glutathione beads. Fig. 1 A shows that35S-labeled Grb2 and Grb3-3 but not the others associated with GST-p27 fusion proteins in a test tube. The amounts of bound Grb2 and Grb3-3 were almost the same, and neither molecule bound to GST alone, indicating that the interaction between p27 and Grb proteins is specific and that Grb2 and Grb3-3 have equivalent binding capabilities at least in vitro.Among a variety of GST fusion proteins containing a portion of the p27 molecule (Fig. 1 B), all that contained amino acids 89–96 bound to 35S-labeled, in vitro-transcribed/translated Grb2 and Grb3-3 proteins in a test tube (Fig. 1 C). The N terminus deletion mutant, p27-(89–197), associated with Grb2/3-3 slightly weaker than other mutants, suggesting that amino acids adjacent to 89 are required for efficient interaction. The region of amino acids 89–96 is rich in proline residues and contains two overlapping SH3-binding motifs (PXXP) (14Birge R.B. Knudsen B.S. Besser D. Hanafusa H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Alteration of all of these 4 proline residues to alanine (RPPRPPK to RAARAAK) completely abolished the binding activity for Grb2/3-3, while this mutant, designated as p27(PA), retained the capability of interacting with cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes (Fig. 1 D), inhibiting the kinase activity of cyclin-Cdk complexes and inducing G1 arrest when overexpressed in mouse fibroblasts (data not shown, but see Fig.4 C). This proline-rich motif is unique to p27 and not found in sequences of other similar Cdk inhibitors, p21 and p57. In fact, we did not detect interaction between p21 and Grb2/Grb3-3 under these conditions in vitro (negative data not shown).Figure 4The integrity of the Grb2 binding site is required for Jab1-mediated down-regulation of p27. A, subcellular localization of the p27(PA) mutant in the presence and absence of Jab1. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with an HA-tagged p27(PA) mutant alone (top panels) or together with a Jab1 expression vector (bottom panels) and, at 48 h post-transfection, stained with antibody to an HA epitope followed by the Texas Red-tagged secondary antibody. The results obtained by phase-contrast (PC) and fluorescence microscopy (aHA) are shown. B, stability of wild-type and PA mutant p27 proteins in the presence and absence of ectopic Jab1. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with HA-p27 wild-type (circles) and PA mutant (squares) plasmids alone (open symbols) or with HA-Jab1 (closed symbols), and the relative35S in HA-p27 was measured as in Fig. 3. C, p27(PA) is resistant to Jab1-mediated neutralization of the proliferation-inhibitory activity of p27. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with HA-p27 wild-type or PA mutant plasmids with or without FLAG-Jab1. After 48 h, cells were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 24 h and simultaneously stained with anti-HA and anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibodies. Percentages of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells among HA-positive cells are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Grb3-3 consisting of two functional SH3 domains but lacking half of the SH2 domain (21Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocque B. Science. 1994; 264: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is able to bind to p27, indicating that the SH3 but not SH2 domain is involved in interaction with p27. To determine more precisely the binding domain within Grb proteins, we generated truncated mutants of Grb3-3, one containing the N terminus SH3 domain (SH3N) and the other the C terminus SH3 (SH3C) (Fig. 1 E), and then tested them for activity to bind to 35S-labeled full-length p27 proteins in vitro (Fig. 1 F). We found that the GST fusion protein containing the C terminus SH3 but not the N terminus SH3 interacted with p27. Thus, these results clearly indicate that p27 and Grb2/3-3 specifically interact with each other at least in vitro through the proline-rich motif and a specific SH3 domain.Grb2 and Grb3-3 Bind to p27 in the Cytoplasm in VivoIn mouse fibroblasts, which express p27 and Grb2 but not Grb3-3 (data not shown), we were unable to detect a complex between endogenous p27 and Grb2; nor did we see any interaction between the two in COS cells overexpressing exogenous HA-tagged full-length p27 and FLAG-tagged Grb2 proteins (data not shown). This could be because the intracellular localization of the two proteins is different (p27 is in the nucleus and Grb2 in the cytoplasm) and because the intermediate p27-Grb2 complex exists only for a very limited time. We examined these possibilities by using p27 mutants. When we ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged Grb proteins together with the p27 mutant (p27(NES)) that localizes mainly in the cytoplasm because of the artificially fused NES sequence (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), we found that p27(NES) efficiently formed a complex with Grb2 and Grb3-3 in vivo (Fig.2 A). In addition, we detected very stable interaction between Grb2/Grb3-3 and another p27 mutant, p27-(1–151), which lacks the nuclear localization signal and remains in the cytoplasm (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In another experiment, we observed a p27/Grb association when we used degradation-resistant p27 mutants (e.g. p27(T187A), p27-(1–186) (3Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 4Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar)) (data not shown, but see Fig. 2 C and below). With wild-type p27, Grb3-3, but not Grb2, formed a detectable amount of complex (Fig.2 B, seventh lane from theleft). Thus, we conclude that (i) p27 binds to Grb proteins when it localizes in the cytoplasm, (ii) the p27/Grb2 interaction is very transient, and (iii) inhibition of Thr187phosphorylation in p27 or disruption of SH2 function in Grb2 increases the stability of the complex (see below). In control experiments, we tested for p21 in lieu of p27 in normal NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and transfected COS cells and found that the interaction with Grb2/Grb3-3 was specific to p27 (negative data not shown).Figure 2Specific interaction of Grb proteins with cytoplasmic p27 in vivo. COS cells were transfected with the expression vectors shown at the top of the panels. Lysates from cells harvested 24 h post-transfection were directly analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies to HA and FLAG epitopes or subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP)/immunoblot analysis using the same antibodies.A, Grb2/3-3 form stable complexes with a p27 mutant containing artificial NES. B, binding of Grb3-3 with p27 was enhanced by ectopic expression of Jab1. C, both binding sites for Grb2 and Jab1 contained in p27 are required for p27/Grb2 interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As for the factor that causes the cytoplasmic localization of p27, we focused on Jab1/CSN5, which directly binds to p27 and down-regulates the protein by translocating it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Since ectopic coexpression of HA-Jab1 (CSN5) induces down-regulation of wild-type p27 and its effect is prominent 48–72 h after transfection, we assayed for the complex formation 24 h after transfection, at which time p27 is not markedly down-regulated. Fig. 2 B shows that coexpression of HA-Jab1 significantly increased the amount of complex formed between ectopic p27 and Grb3-3 proteins (seventh and eighth lanes from theleft). Interestingly, upon immunoprecipitation with antibody specifically recognizing the C-terminal half of the p27 protein, Grb3-3 proteins were not coprecipitated. Since we did not detect Grb3-3 in anti-HA-immunoprecipitates from cells expressing HA-Jab1 and FLAG-Grb3-3, it seems likely that this anti-p27 antibody interfered with the formation of complex between p27 and Grb proteins, or, alternatively, HA-Jab1 may assist in increasing the stability of the p27-Grb protein complex. We detected interaction between wild-type p27 and Grb2 in the presence of ectopic HA-Jab1, but not in its absence (Fig. 2 C). Mutation of the C terminus phosphorylation site (T187A), which renders p27 more stable (3Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 4Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), enhanced the complex formation, while mutation in the Grb2-binding site (p27(PA)) or deletion of the Jab1-binding domain (p27(Del 97–151)) abolished the interaction. The p27/Grb2/Jab1 interaction was completely disrupted in the presence of leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of the NES/CRM1-dependent nuclear export (22Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Ectopic Jab1/CSN5 did not induce complex formation between p21 and Grb2/3-3 (negative data not shown), confirming the specificity of the interaction. Thus, ectopic expression of Jab1 enables specific p27-Grb2 interaction by translocating p27 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and by increasing the stability of the complex.Grb2 Facilitates Down-regulation of p27 in VivoWe next examined the effect of Grb2 and Grb3-3 on p27 stability. Fig.3 A shows that ectopic p27 was relatively stable (open circle), and coexpression of Jab1/CSN5 markedly reduced its stability (closed circle) as previously reported (5Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Additional coexpression of Grb2 further reduced the stability of p27 (open triangle), while coexpression of Grb3-3 blocked Jab1/CSN5-mediated down-regulation of p27 (closed triangle). Therefore, although only the SH3 domain is required for direct binding to p27, the integrity of the SH2 domain in Grb2 is important for induction of p27 down-regulation. The simplest interpretation is that the recruitment of a certain cellular protein, which most likely contains phosphorylated tyrosine residues, into the Grb2-p27-Jab1 complex would facilitate down-regulation of p27. However, Grb2 is well known to function in the signal transduction pathway (14Birge R.B. Knudsen B.S. Besser D. Hanafusa H. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 595-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), especially upstream of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the activation of which is reported to induce degradation of p27 (15Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 16Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell.

To analyze the possible involvement of the Ras signaling pathway in down-regulation of p27, we examined the effect of chemical inhibitors to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (PD98059 (PD); see Ref. 17Kawada M. Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin (WT); see Ref. 16Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the level of p27 in NIH3T3 cells transfected with HA-p27 together with Jab1/CSN5 and Grb2 (Fig.3 B). We found that Grb2 accelerated the degradation of p27 in the presence and absence of these inhibitors. These results strongly support our interpretation that Grb2 plays an important role in the regulation of p27 by the direct binding but not by activating the Ras signaling pathway.Figure 3Effect of Grb proteins on the stability of p27. A, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with expression vectors (open circle, p27 alone;closed circle, p27 and Jab1; open triangle, p27, Jab1, and Grb2; closed triangle, p27, Jab1, and Grb3-3), pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min at 48 h post-transfection and chased with excess cold methionine. At the indicated times, cells were collected, and the relative 35S in HA-p27 was measured. B, activation of the Ras signaling pathway is dispensable for accelerated degradation of p27 by Grb2."

RA treatment induces growth arrest and terminal differentiation of a human embryonal carcinoma cell line (NT2) into postmitotic central nervous system neurons. Using RNA fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction, we identified a novel serine/threonine-rich protein, RA-regulated nuclearmatrix-associated protein (Ramp), that was down-regulated during the RA-induced differentiation of NT2 cells. Prominent mRNA expression of ramp could be detected in adult placenta and testis as well as in all human fetal tissues examined. The genomic clone of ramp has been mapped to the telomere of chromosome arm 1q, corresponding to band 1q32.1–32.2. Associated with the nuclear matrix of NT2 cells, Ramp translocates from the interphase nucleus to the metaphase cytoplasm during mitosis. During the late stage of cytokinesis, Ramp concentrates at the midzone of the dividing daughter cells. The transcript expression oframp is closely correlated with the cell proliferation rate of NT2 cells. Moreover, overexpression of Ramp induces a transient increase in the proliferation rate of NT2 cells.

RA is a powerful differentiating agent and induces the differentiation of many cell types such as epithelial cells and mesenchyme cells (3De Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 4Plateroti M. Freund J.N. Leberquier C. Kedinger M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also induces the differentiation of cancer cells such as teratocarcinoma and leukemia (5Bollag W. Majewski S. Jablonska S. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 1453-1457PubMed Google Scholar) and many immortalized cell lines. Thus, RA has been used as an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (6Smith M.A. Parkinson D.R. Cheson B.D. Freidman M.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 1992; 10: 839-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The human embryonal carcinoma cell line, NTera2 cl. D1 (NT2), has been extensively used as a model system to study growth and differentiation as well as cancer therapy. RA treatment induces growth arrest and terminal differentiation of NT2 cells into postmitotic central nervous system neurons (7Andrews P.W. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 8Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RA-induced neuronal differentiation of NT2 cells is concomitant with the up-regulation of the homeotic genes, such as Hox 2.1 and Hox 2.2. On the contrary, the expression of growth factors, including transforming growth factor-α and basic fibroblast growth factor, and proto-oncogenes, such as c-myc and N-myc, are down-regulated during the neuronal differentiation (9Miller Jr., W.H. Moy D. Li A. Grippo J.F. Dmitrovsky E. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 511-517PubMed Google Scholar). These responses are mediated through two classes of nuclear receptors, the RA receptors and retinoid X receptors (10Collins S.J. Robertson K.A. Mueller L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 11Simeone A. Acampora D Arcioni L Andrews P.W. Boncinelli E. Mavilio F.

Although it is well-documented that RA receptors and retinoid X receptors play essential roles in RA-mediated events, including primitive endodermal differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse physiological actions have only recently been explored (13Cheung W.M.W. Chu P.W.K. Lung C.H. Ip N.Y. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. J.

Even less is known about how different genes are regulated by RA during these processes. The involvement of other signaling molecules, such as the coordinated regulation of the neurotrophin receptors, may mediate RA-induced central nervous system neuronal differentiation (17Cheung W.M.W. Chu A.H. Leung M.-F. Ip N.Y. NeuroReport. 1996; 7: 1204-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, one major thrust has been the identification of genes that are regulated during the RA-mediated cellular events (18Bouillet P. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Vicaire S. Garnier J.M. Schuhbaur B. Dolle P. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 420-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19Nakshatri H. Bouillet P. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Chambon P. Gene. 1996; 174: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have employed the RNA fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed PCR to identify candidate genes that are differentially regulated during the RA-induced neuronal differentiation of the NT2 cells (20Cheung W.M.W. Chu A.H. Ip N.Y. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the candidate genes identified, clone 8.31 encoded a novel gene that was down-regulated during the RA-induced neuronal differentiation of NT2 cells. Here we report the cloning and characterization of this novel gene, designated RA-regulated nuclearmatrix associated protein (Ramp). Ramp is a serine/threonine-rich protein that is associated with the nuclear matrix protein of the NT2 cells, and translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during mitosis and cytokinesis. Our data suggest that Ramp plays a role in the cell proliferation of these human embryonal carcinoma cells. Full-length cDNA of clone 8.31 (ramp) was obtained by screening an expression cDNA library prepared from undifferentiated NT2 cells (Stratagene) using the partial 8.31 cDNA fragment obtained by RNA fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed PCR as probes. The cDNA sequence encoding ramp has been submitted to GenBank™ (accession number AF345896). Radioactive cDNA probes were prepared using Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridization was performed at 60 °C. Single phages were obtained and transformed into XLOLR bacterial cells (Stratagene) and the cDNA fragment was cloned into pBK-CMV mammalian expression vector by in vivo excision. NT2 cells were cultured as previously described (21Cheung W.M.W. Fu W.Y. Hui W.S. Ip N.Y. BioTechniques. 1999; 26 (, 950–2, 954): 952-954Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (fetal bovine serum, Life Technologies, Inc.). NT2 cells were differentiated with 10 μmall-trans RA (t-RA; Sigma Chemical Co.) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose formulation) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell synchronization was performed by treating NT2 cells with nocodazole (1 μm) for 12 h, which arrested the cells at G2-M. Transfection of NT2 cells was performed using FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 96-well plates. Expression vectors (0.15 μg) plus 0.05 μg of the reference plasmid pCMV-βgal, expressing β-galactosidase as internal control for normalization, were used. For cell proliferation assays, NT2 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors containing wild typeramp, 6X histidine-, or EGFP-tagged ramp. Reference plasmid pCMV-βgal was co-transfected to serve as internal control for normalizing the transfection efficiency. MTT assays and β-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (22Cheung W.M.W. Hui W.S. Chu P.W.K. Chiu S.W. Ip N.Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). BrdUrd incorporation assays were performed using BrdUrd-based cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cells were labeled with BrdUrd solution for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed and denatured using FixDenat solution. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdUrd solution for 2 h, the cells were washed and incubated with substrate solution. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Genomic DNA fragment (∼2396 bp) containing the putative ramppromoter and the first exon (2304–2354 bp) of ramp cDNA (data not shown). The genomic DNA fragment was then fused to the 5′-end of the promoterless reporter secretory form of human placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP, CLONTECH). Deletion mutant (RampΔ, ∼311 bp) was constructed by deleting a ∼2080-bp DNA fragment from the 5′-end of the putative promoter. For promoter analysis, a putative ramp promoter was subcloned to the 5′-region of the reporter gene SEAP. SV40 early and acetylcholine receptor ε subunit promoters (23Si J. Miller D.S. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10367-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were used as control in the experiment. NT2 cells transfected with promoter constructs were treated with 10 μm t-RA in normal medium. After 24 h, transfected cells were lysed for luminescent SEAP and β-galactosidase assays (CLONTECH). Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) or as previously described (24Xie P. Cheung W.M.W. Ip F.C.F. Ip N.Y. Leung M.F. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described using ramp-specific cDNA probes at 60 °C (25Ip N.Y. Boulton T.G. Li Y. Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Anderson D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1994; 13: 443-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two micrograms of linearized plasmids were used for each coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Antisense rampcDNA construct in the same expression vector was used as negative control; luciferase gene was employed as positive control. Genomic DNA-encoding ramp was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation and was hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. After incubation with fluorescein-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies, the cells were counterstained with DAPI. The location of ramp was labeled in green (indicated by white arrows). A biotin-labeled probe, which is specific for the heterochromatic region of chromosome 1, was co-hybridized with the genomic rampclone. Chromosome 1-specific probes were detected by Texas avidin and was labeled in red (indicated by gray arrows). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fluka) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the immunofluorescent staining was performed. After blocking with 4% normal serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in PBS containing 0.25% Triton-X (Roche Molecular Biochemical), and 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical Co.), cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in antibody diluent (4% normal serum, 0.25% Triton-X, and 2% bovine serum albumin). Incubation with secondary antibodies was performed at room temperature for at least 2 h. Cells were visualized under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Polyclonal antibodies were generated against peptides designed from the N and C termini of the translated Ramp amino acid sequence. Monoclonal antibodies detecting β-tubulin (Tub2.1) were obtained from Sigma Chemicals. Polyclonal antibodies specific for EGFP (CLONTECH), 6× histidine (CLONTECH), phospho-cdc2 Y15 (New England BioLab), and lamin A/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were employed in the study. Alexa568- or Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. High salt isolation of nuclear matrix was prepared according to He et al. (26He D. Nickerson A.N. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). NT2 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then extracted with cytoskeletal (CSK) buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton-X) for 10 min at 4 °C. The cytoskeletal fraction was collected by centrifugation, and the chromatin was solubilized by digestion with 1 mg/ml DNase I in CSK buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. Ammonium sulfate was then added to a final concentration of 0.25 m, and samples were collected by centrifugation. High salt wash (2 m NaCl in CSK buffer) was performed for 5 min at 4 °C. The final pellet (core nuclear matrix) was resuspended in 8 m urea. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (13Cheung W.M.W. Chu P.W.K. Lung C.H. Ip N.Y. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by a wash with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mmsodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl at pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X, 1× aprotinin; Sigma, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1× Complete) at 4 °C for 15 min. Lysates were collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Protein assays were performed with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit based on the Bradford dye-binding procedure (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (typically 40 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% resolving gel using a Hoeffer minigel apparatus. Proteins were then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After blocking at room temperature for 1 h using TBS-Tween containing 5% non-fat milk, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in TBS-Tween containing 5% non-fat milk. Membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2500,Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBS-Tween, immunoreactive bands were detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized by x-ray film (Fuji). The cDNA encoding full-length 8.31 (ramp) was obtained by screening a cDNA library prepared from the undifferentiated NT2 cells. Double-stranded sequencing by T7 DNA polymerase revealed that the cDNA (∼2831 bp) is novel in its gene identity. The full DNA sequence and its deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig.1 A. The cDNA contains a single open reading frame corresponding to a protein of 730 amino acids (∼79.4 kDa). The ATG codon preceded by a consensus Kozak sequence is found at position 124, and the TAG codon is found at position 2314. Hydropathy analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence reveals that the protein contains a high percentage of hydrophilic residues (Fig.1 B). Although a potential transmembrane domain cannot be identified within the amino acid sequence, a putative nuclear localization signal is located at amino acid positions 197–203. The sequence is rich in serines and threonines (20.25% of all amino acids) and in basic residues (13.04% arginines, lysines, and histidines). There are five potential glycosylation sites at residues 190, 248, 289, 299, and 316, and three putative cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites at residues 413–416, 482–485, and 688–691. Another interesting feature is the presence of a proline-rich motif that shares high homology with the SH3-binding consensus, PXXP, at residues 637–641. Moreover, there is a leucine zipper located at 577 and two WD repeats at 113 and 231 of the clonedramp cDNA. To confirm that the full-length cDNA encoded a functional protein, coupled in vitro transcription and translation was performed to estimate the molecular weight of the encoded protein. It was demonstrated that the cloned full-length ramp cDNA could be translated into a protein of ∼85 kDa (Fig. 1 C). In addition, a chimeric enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-tagged Ramp protein (E-Ramp) was constructed by fusing the EGFP-encoding cDNA to the N terminus of the full-length ramp cDNA. The chimeric cDNA construct was transiently expressed in CHO cells and total proteins were collected. Immunoblotting using the anti-Ramp polyclonal antibodies revealed the expression of the EGFP-tagged Ramp proteins (Fig. 1 D). Two immunoreactive bands (∼110 and ∼180 kDa) were observed, the identity of which was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-EGFP antibodies. Because the Ramp protein contains several putative N-glycosylation sites, it is possible that the ∼180-kDa immunoreactive represents the glycosylated protein. To obtain clues on the potential function(s) of ramp, we have examined the expression profile of ramp in both adult and fetal human tissues. Among the tissues examined, including brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, placenta, small intestine, spleen, stomach, and testis, two transcripts (∼5 and ∼3 kb) oframp were predominantly expressed in the placenta and testis (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, skeletal muscles also expressed low level of ramp (upon long exposure of the autoradiogram). The expression of ramp was observed in all the human fetal tissues examined, which included brain, lung, liver, and kidney. All fetal tissues expressed the ∼5- and ∼3-kb ramptranscripts. Two extra transcripts of ∼4 and ∼2 kb were observed in the messenger RNA prepared from the fetal lung (Fig. 2 B). However, similar prominent expression of ramp was not observed in the corresponding adult tissues. Based on abundant level of expression of ramp in fetal liver, dot blot analysis was performed to examine the mRNA level in hematopoietic tissues (Fig. 2 C). Although rampwas detected in all hematopoietic tissues examined, mRNA level was highest in thymus and bone marrow. A low level oframp transcript was detected in the spleen and lymph node, and only a barely detectable level was observed in the peripheral leukocytes. DNA from a genomic clone of ramp was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. The initial experiment resulted in the specific labeling of the long arm of a group A chromosome, which was believed to be chromosome 1 on the basis of size, morphology, and banding pattern (Fig.3 A). Thus, a biotin-labeled probe, which was specific for the heterochromatic region of chromosome 1, was co-hybridized with the genomic clone of ramp. The specific labeling of genomic fragment containing ramp was labeled green (indicated by white arrows), and the heterochromatin of the chromosome 1 labeled red (indicated bygray arrows) (Fig. 3 B). A total of 80 metaphase cells were analyzed with 76 exhibiting specific labeling. Measurements of 10 specifically labeled chromosomes 1 demonstrated that the genomic clone of ramp is located at a position that is 62% of the distance from the heterochromatic-euchromatic boundary of the telomere of chromosome arm 1q, an area that corresponds to band 1q32.1–32.2. The result is schematized in Fig. 3 C. To examine the regulation of ramp expression by RA, the full-length ramp cDNA was used as a probe to examine its change in expression profile upon treatment with RA for 0–28 days (Fig. 4 A). Two transcripts (∼4.5 and ∼3.5 kb) of ramp were detected in NT2 cells. The transcript expression of ramp was transiently up-regulated after 1 day of RA treatment, followed by a decrease, reaching a low level of expression at day 28. Moreover, total proteins were obtained from NT2 cells treated with t-RA for 6 or 12 days. An immunoprecipitation assay was performed using anti-Ramp (N terminus) antibodies. The resulted immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-Ramp (C terminus) antibodies. As depicted in Fig. 4 B, undifferentiated NT2 cells expressed abundant level of Ramp proteins, which was repressed after 6 days of RA treatment. Interestingly, additional immunoreactive bands (∼175 and ∼180 kDa) were also detected by the anti-Ramp antibodies employed in the study. To define the subcellular localization of Ramp protein, we transiently transfected the ramp expression vector into CHO cells. Transfected CHO cells were immunostained with anti-Ramp polyclonal antibodies and counterstained with DAPI. It was observed that the Ramp protein was localized to the nucleus (Fig.5 A). A chimeric Ramp was constructed by fusing a 6X histidine tail to the C terminus of the Ramp. After transient transfection into CHO cells, the expression of Ramp was detected by double staining the transfected cells using the anti-6X histidine antibodies and anti-Ramp antibodies. Ramp protein was localized to the nuclear region of the transfected CHO cells, although some expression of Ramp could also be detected in the cytoplasm (Fig.5 B). The nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of the transfected Ramp observed in CHO cells raised the possibility that Ramp is associated with the nuclear matrix. To confirm that Ramp is a nuclear matrix-associated protein, we examined whether Ramp was localized to the nuclear matrix proteins of the NT2 cells. Nuclei were digested with DNase I and extracted with 2m NaCl to enrich for the nuclear matrices and its associated proteins. The nuclear matrix preparations were then electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-Ramp antibodies. Ramp proteins were detected in the crude nuclear preparation as well as the DNase I-treated and NaCl-washed purified nuclear matrix proteins (Fig.5 C). The subcellular distribution of Ramp was then examined throughout the cell cycle of the unsynchronized NT2 cells. During the interphase, strong Ramp immunoreactivity was detected mainly in the nuclei of the NT2 cells (Fig. 6 A). Positive signal, although less concentrated, could also be observed in the cytoplasm. At pro-metaphase and metaphase, Ramp was excluded from the condensed chromosomes, with the staining localized to the cytoplasmic region. In telophase, the Ramp staining remained in the cytoplasmic region of the daughter cells. It is interesting to observe that Ramp became concentrated at the midzone as the dividing NT2 cells progressed to late anaphase in cytokinesis. The subcellular localization of Ramp during the cell cycle raises the possibility that Ramp is a nuclear matrix-associated protein and actively participates in the cell division of NT2 cells. NT2 cells were then synchronized at G2-M phase by treatment with nocodazole. At pro-metaphase, NT2 cells revealed a strong DNA (DAPI) staining of the condensing chromosomes. Immunofluorescent staining using specific Ramp antibodies confirmed our previous observations with unsynchronized NT2 cells. Ramp proteins were localized to the cytoplasm and excluded from the chromatins (Fig.6 B). The G2-M-arrested NT2 cells were then immunostained with control antibodies that detected the tyrosine-phosphorylated cdc2 (Phospho-cdc2 Y15). Interestingly, the subcellular distribution of phospho-cdc2 Y15 was similar to that of the Ramp proteins. Thus, the localization of the Ramp proteins is consistent with our hypothesis that Ramp actively participates in the process of cell division. To evaluate the effect of RA on the expression of theramp gene, we cloned and sequenced a ∼2639-bp genomic DNA fragment containing the putative ramp promoter and the first exon (2304–2354 bp) of ramp cDNA (data not shown). The genomic DNA fragment was then fused to the 5′-end of the promoterless reporter SEAP. The SV40 early and the acetylcholine receptor ε promoters (AChRε) (23Si J. Miller D.S. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10367-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were used as control promoter reporter plasmids in the study. Transient transfection into NT2 cells resulted in the constitutive expression of SEAP, demonstrating that the putativeramp promoter was transcriptionally active in undifferentiated NT2 cells. The transfected NT2 cells were treated with 10 μm t-RA for 24 h, and the SEAP expression was monitored. RA up-regulated the relative expression of SEAP by ∼40% (p < 0.005; Fig.7 A). This is consistent with our previous observations that the expression of ramp was transiently up-regulated during the early stage of neuronal differentiation. Deletion of the 2080-bp DNA fragment from the putativeramp promoter (RampΔ) reduced the expression level of the reporter SEAP as well as the induction by RA. Similarly, RA treatment did not significantly affect the expression level of the control SV40 early and AChRε promoters. As the first step to explore the possibility that Ramp might play a role in the cell proliferation of the NT2 cells, we examined the effect of short term RA treatment on the proliferation of NT2 cells. NT2 cells were treated with t-RA (10 μm) for 1–7 days. The cell proliferation was quantitated by measuring the metabolic rate of viable cells and by determining the total cell count of NT2 cells. When NT2 cells were treated with t-RA for 1 day, there was a significant increase in the proliferation of NT2 cells, both in terms of metabolic activities (∼12%, Fig. 7 B), as well as in total cell number (∼18.9%, Fig. 7 C). At day 2, significant difference between the RA treatment or the control solvent treatment was not observed. This was followed by a sharp decrease in the total metabolic rate at day 4 of RA treatment. To further confirm the effect of RA on the proliferation of NT2 cells, we examined the rate of cell proliferation by monitoring the BrdUrd incorporation after 1–3 days of RA treatment. As shown in Fig. 7 D, the rate of BrdUrd incorporation was increased by more than 10% of the control after 1 day of RA treatment. Similar down-regulation was observed after day 2 of RA treatment. Thus, our data demonstrated a good correlation between the expression of ramp and the cell proliferation rate of NT2 cells. To further evaluate the effect of ramp on the cell proliferation, we transiently transfected the rampexpression vector into the NT2 cells. Control β-galactosidase expression vector driven by the constitutively expressed CMV promoter was used for normalizing the transfection efficiency. Rate of cell proliferation was monitored by MTT assays 48 h after transfection. Overexpression of ramp significantly up-regulated the proliferation rate of the NT2 cells by ∼10% (Fig.8 A). We could observe similar up-regulation of cell proliferation rate (∼14%) when the human neuroblastoma SY5Y cells were transfected transiently with the wild type ramp (Fig. 8 B). The effect of ramp on the proliferation of NT2 cells was also monitored by the BrdUrd incorporation assays. We transiently transfected the EGFP-tagged ramp (E-Ramp) expression vector into the NT2 cells and examine the rate of BrdUrd incorporation. Because the expression of retinoid receptor (RXRα) was not affected during the early stage of RA treatment (13Cheung W.M.W. Chu P.W.K. Lung C.H. Ip N.Y. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), EGFP-tagged RXRα (E-RXR) was used as negative control in the experiment. Overexpression of E-Ramp significantly up-regulated the NT2 cell proliferation rate"

This endogenous cell cycle regulated adenine DNA methyltransferase (CcrM) is essential for C. crescentuscellular viability. DNA methylation catalyzed by CcrM provides an obligatory signal for the proper progression through the cell cycle. To further our understanding of the regulatory role played by CcrM, we sought to investigate its biophysical properties. In this paper we employed equilibrium ultracentrifugation, velocity ultracentrifugation, and chemical cross-linking to show that CcrM is dimeric at physiological concentrations. However, surface plasmon resonance experiments in the presence of S-adenosyl-homocysteine evince that CcrM binds as a monomer to a defined hemi-methylated DNA substrate containing the canonical methylation sequence, GANTC. Initial velocity experiments demonstrate that dimerization of CcrM does not affect DNA methylation. Collectively, these findings suggest that CcrM is active as a monomer and provides a possible in vivo role for dimerization as a means to stabilize CcrM from premature catabolism.

These enzymes fall into one of three distinct classes predicated by the end target of the transferred methyl group: (a) N-4 position of cytosine, (b) C-5 position of cytosine, or (c) N-6 position of adenosine (1Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). During the past decade, DNA methylation has been implicated in a variety of biological processes. In higher eukaryotes, DNA is methylated at the C-5 position of cytosine within CpG dinucleotide sequences. The resulting DNA methylation state is involved in genomic imprinting (2Swain J.L. Stewart T.A. Leder P. Cell. 1987; 50: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), replication timing (3Sigfried Z. Cedar H. Curr.

Suppl. 1999; 32–33: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar), X-chromosome inactivation (5Riggs A.D. Pfeifer G.P. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 169-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and gene repression (6Huang L. Guan R.J. Pardee A.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, the predominant role of DNA methylation is to provide a rudimentary immune response, protecting bacteria from invading phage DNA (reviewed in Refs. 8Wilson G.G. Murray N.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 585-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 9Heitman J. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering. Plenum Press, New York1993: 57-108Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Bickle T.A. Kruger D.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 434-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These DNA restriction-modification systems are composed of two parts: a DNA MTase and its cognate restriction endonuclease. The DNA MTase modifies either an adenine or cytosine base within a specific sequence of the host DNA, thereby rendering the sequence resistant to endonuclease cleavage. Invading foreign DNA, which lacks a methyl modification within this defined sequence, is rapidly cleaved. Not all MTases exist as part of a restriction-modification system. The most studied example is the widespread adenine DNA MTase, Dam. Dam plays several important regulatory roles in the cell, including chromosome replication, gene expression, and DNA mismatch repair (reviewed in Refs. 11Marinus M.G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 113-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and 12Marinus M.G. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1996: 782-791Google Scholar and references therein). Additionally, Dam has been shown to be the master regulator that activates the transcription of several virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli(13Heithoff D. Sinsheimer R. Low D. Mahan M. Science. 1999; 284: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). At least one other DNA MTase has been identified that is not part of a restriction-modification system: a DNA adenine MTase denoted CcrM (cell cycle regulated DNAMTase). CcrM catalyzes the methylation of adenine at the N-6 position within the canonical sequence GANTC (where N can be any nucleobase) (14Zweiger G. Marczynski G. Shapiro L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 472-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Homologs of CcrM are found throughout the α-subdivision of Gram-negative bacteria. Members of this class include the freshwater bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, the nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium Rhizobium meliloti, the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and the animal pathogenBrucella abortus (15Wright R. Stephens C. Shapiro L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5869-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Unlike the nonessential Dam MTase, CcrM activity is absolutely required for viability throughout the α-subdivision (16Robertson G.T. Reisenauer A. Wright R. Jensen R.B. Jensen A. Shapiro L. Roop R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Stephens C. Reisenauer A. Wright R. Shapiro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and its activity is tightly regulated during the cell cycle (14Zweiger G. Marczynski G. Shapiro L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 472-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The cell cycle of C. crescentus is typified by an asymmetric cell division yielding a motile swarmer cell and a sessile stalked cell (18Brun Y.V. Marczynski G.T. Shapiro L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 419-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with DNA methylation serving as an obligatory signal for proper cell cycle progression. DNA replication is restricted to a stalked cell (19Marczynski G. Dingwall A. Shapiro L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), so the progeny swarmer cell must first differentiate into a stalked cell to initiate chromosome replication (18Brun Y.V. Marczynski G.T. Shapiro L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 419-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following semiconservative DNA replication, the resulting daughter chromosomes are hemi-methylated. At this point the division plate begins to form as the cell enters the predivisional cell stage. Concomitant with this step, CcrM is synthesized de novo. The DNA is rapidly remethylated restoring full methylation status immediately prior to the completion of cell division (17Stephens C. Reisenauer A. Wright R. Shapiro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Simultaneous with cell division is the rapid and complete degradation of CcrM. It is imperative that the delicate balance of methylation be maintained in order for C. crescentus to survive. An increase in CcrM stability leading to its constitutive methylation results in an aberrant cell morphology (14Zweiger G. Marczynski G. Shapiro L. J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5869-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Strict temporal regulation is achieved by: (a) transcription of the ccrM gene exclusively in the predivisional stage of the cell cycle (17Stephens C. Reisenauer A. Wright R. Shapiro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1210-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and (b) catabolism by a Lon-dependent pathway immediately prior to cell division (20Wright R. Stephens C. Zweiger G. Shapiro L. Alley M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1532-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Considering that CcrM is essential among pathogenic α-proteobacteria and that eukaryotes lack adenine DNA MTases, CcrM may be an ideal target for the design of a new class of anti-microbial drugs (16Robertson G.T. Reisenauer A. Wright R. Jensen R.B. Jensen A. Shapiro L. Roop R.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Wahnon D.C. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 976-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of DNA-binding proteins involved in gene expression has been shown to be a critical property governing activity. For instance, dimerization of λ cI repressor monomers is required for high affinity binding to bacteriophage λ operator DNA (22Bain D.L. Ackers G.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14679-14689Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, dimerization inhibits DNA binding by the TATA-binding proteins (23Jackson-Fisher A. Burma S. Portnoy M. Schneeweis L. Coleman R. Mitra M. Chitikila C. Pugh B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11340-11348Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DNA MTases have also been shown to exist in alternate oligomeric states and to possess a variable active form. Whereas most DNA MTases are monomeric, M.RsrI (24Kaszubska W. Webb H. Gumport R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 118: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Szegedi S.S. Reich N.O. Gumport R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3962-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the human placental DNA MTase (26Yoo H. Noshari J. Lapeyre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8066-8070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to be dimeric in solution. The functional state of M.RsrI has been identified as the monomeric form. However, the human placental DNA MTase is active as a dimer. In this paper, we show that the mechanistic behavior of CcrM is similar to the bacterial DNA MTase M.RsrI (i.e.exists in solution as a dimer at micromolar concentrations and functions actively as a monomer). Additionally, we propose a possible role for dimerization within the context of the C. crescentus cell cycle. [3H]AdoMet (82.4 Ci/mmol) was purchased from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). AdoHcy was obtained from Sigma. Dimethyl suberimidate was obtained from Pierce. Biotin-CPG columns and all special phosphoramidites for DNA synthesis were purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, VA), whereas all other phosphoramidites and ancillary reagents were from PE Biosystems (Foster City, CA). DE81 and glass fiber filters were obtained from Whatman (Clifton, NJ). All restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase used in cloning were acquired from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All other materials used were of the highest purity reagent grade commercially available. Synthetic oligonucleotides were generated using an Expedite Biosystems DNA synthesizer. Single-strand oligonucleotide purification was performed as previously described (27Capson T.L. Peliska J.A. Kaboord B.F. Frey M.W. Lively C. Dahlberg M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Following purification, the complementary single strands were annealed in the presence of 150 mm sodium chloride. The resulting duplex DNA (Fig. 1) was purified by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. To facilitate overexpression, a cloning vector incorporating transcriptional control by the T7 RNA polymerase was constructed. First, the multiple cloning site, intein, and chitin-binding domain were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the manufacturer-supplied pCYB1 plasmid (New England Biolabs) with introduction of a 5′-NdeI site and 3′-NotI site. Upon NdeI/NotI digestion, the polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into a predigested (NdeI/NotI), shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pET26b plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI) using T4 DNA ligase.SapI ultimately serves as the 3′-cloning site for the target protein to generate the target protein-intein-chitin-binding domain fusion protein; however, pET26b contains an embedded SapI site that needed to be removed. This SapI site was removed by overlap extension with ApaI/ΔSapI and ΔSapI/XmaI mutagenic primers. The final pET26b-IMPACT-NdeI-ΔSapI (pET-IMPACT) construct was formed by ligation of the ApaI/XmaI-digested mutagenic polymerase chain reaction product into the similarly digested, shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pET26b-IMPACT-NdeI plasmid. Subsequent cloning of CcrM into the pET-IMPACT plasmid was accomplished at a 5′-NdeI site and 3′-SapI site. Additionally, to facilitate controlledin vitro, thiol-induced cleavage of CcrM from the intein-chitin-binding domain fusion partner, the C-terminal asparagine residue of CcrM was mutated to a glycine (N358G). The N358G CcrM-intein-chitin-binding domain fusion protein was expressed in the E. coli cell strain, BL21 (DE3). After induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 90 min at 30 °C at an OD600 = 0.5–0.7, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 m sodium chloride, 3 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (buffer A) containing a protease inhibitor mixture composed of 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Subsequently, the resuspended pellet was lysed by sonication. Following clarification at 16,000 rpm (32,600 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was diluted 2-fold with buffer A. The diluted supernatant was applied to a pre-equilibrated 25-ml chitin column (New England Biolabs) at a flow rate of 0.5–1 ml/min. The chitin column containing the immobilized CcrM fusion protein was washed with 15–20 column volumes of buffer A followed by 5 column volumes of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 3 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (buffer B) at maximum gravity flow. To initiate the thiol-induced cleavage reaction to liberate full-length CcrM, the chitin column was flushed with cleavage buffer (buffer B supplemented with 75 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME)). To achieve complete cleavage (>90%) the column flow was stopped and incubated for at least 18 h at 4 °C. CcrM was eluted with two column volumes of cleavage buffer resulting in 85–90% purity as determined by SDS-PAGE. The remaining contaminants were removed by applying the chitin column eluate to a pre-equilibrated (buffer B) 10-ml DEAE-Sephacel column. CcrM eluted during the load and subsequent buffer B wash step, whereas the contaminating proteins were retained until a linear gradient reached an ionic strength of 250–300 mmsodium chloride. A final concentration of 150 mm potassium chloride was added to the fractions containing CcrM. The 95–98% (by SDS-PAGE) pure CcrM was concentrated using an YM-10 (Millipore) molecular mass cut-off membrane in an Amicon concentrator and dialyzed into storage buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm β-ME, 10% glycerol). The final CcrM concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a calculated extinction coefficient of 62,730 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm as determined from the amino acid composition by method of Edelhoch (28Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Typical yields with this protocol are 5–10 mg of pure CcrM/liter of cells grown. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements of CcrM were performed using a Beckman XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge (Fullerton, CA) in absorbance mode. Data were acquired using the supplied XL-I acquisition software. All experiments with native CcrM were performed at 25 °C in ultracentrifugation buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm potassium chloride); either in the presence (reduced) or absence (nonreduced) of 3 mmβ-ME. CcrM experiments were also performed using ultracentrifugation buffer (reduced and nonreduced) containing a chaotropic agent, 6m guanidine hydrochloride. To assure dialysis equilibrium was achieved, the protein samples were dialyzed against the appropriate buffer at 4 °C for at least 12 h (2 changes of 2 liters each) immediately prior to analysis. Simultaneous acquisition of a broad concentration range (300 nm to 12.5 μm) was accomplished by utilizing a six-channel centerpiece while monitoring at wavelengths (220–300 nm) appropriate for the protein concentration. Native CcrM and nonreduced, denatured CcrM data were acquired at rotor speeds of 14,000, 18,000, 22,000, and 26,000 rpm, whereas reduced, denatured CcrM data were collected at 14,000, 18,000, 24,000, 30,000, and 36,000 rpm. Equilibrium was achieved when two consecutive sets of data taken 2 h apart were completely superimposable. Subsequent to collection of these data, the rotor speed was increased to 45,000 rpm to deplete the meniscus, allowing experimental determination of base-line absorbance. Data were edited using the software package Microcal Origin (version 3.78, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Local and global nonlinear least squares analyses were employed using the program WinNonlinLR (version 1.05) (29Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Holvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) to extract solution molecular masses. Because of the strong UV absorbance of the oxidized reducing agent, poor signal to noise was observed at low protein concentrations in the presence of β-ME making global analysis results unreliable. Therefore, the dissociation constant for reduced CcrM was determined by fitting the solution molecular mass observed for several concentrations above 300 nm (at each rotor speed) to a general hyperbolic curve-fitting equation. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a two-channel centerpiece using a Beckman XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge in absorbance mode. Following dialysis into ultracentrifugation buffer in the presence 3 mm β-ME, varying concentrations of CcrM (3–11.5 μm) were centrifuged at a rotor speed of 36,000 rpm at 25 °C. The van Holde-Weischet method (30van Holde K.E. Weischet W. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar), within the UltraScanII software package (version 3.0), was utilized to calculate the sedimentation coefficient at each concentration (S25,b). Further verification of sedimentation coefficients was accomplished by employing the transport method (31Schachman H.K. Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1959Google Scholar) and the second moment method (32Goldberg R.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1953; 57: 194-202Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar) contained in the Microcal Origin software package. The S25,bvalues were converted to the standard reporting value, 20 °C in pure water (S20,w), by the following equation (33Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function , Part II. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1980: 591-641Google Scholar). S20,w=S(1−v_ρ)20,w(η25,b)(1−v_ρ)25,b(η20,w)Equation 1 where v̄20 (the partial specific volume of CcrM at 20 °C) is 0.7374 ml/g,v̄25 is 0.7396 ml/g,ρ20w (the density of pure water at 20 °C) is 0.9982 g/ml, ρ25,b (the density of buffer b at 25 °C) is 1.01132 g/ml for ultracentrifugation buffer, η20,w (the viscosity of pure water at 20 °C) is 0.01002 poise, andη25,b is 0.00905 poise for ultracentrifugation buffer. The data base program Sednterp (version 1.01) provided the means to calculate the partial specific volume of CcrM by the method of Cohn and Edsall (34Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Rheinhold, New York1943: 147-172Google Scholar). The S20,w0 values were determined by plotting S20,w versus CcrM concentration and extrapolating to infinite dilution. Chemical cross-linking of CcrM was achieved by using the bifunctional amine cross-linking agent, dimethyl suberimidate (DMS). A DMS stock solution of 50 mm was prepared in cross-linking buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.5, 150 mm potassium chloride, 3 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-ME, 10% glycerol) immediately prior to use. Cross-linking reactions were performed as follows: CcrM concentration was varied from 100 nm (4 μg/ml) to 2 μm (79 μg/ml) in the presence of 10 mm DMS in cross-linking buffer; this mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min; and quenched by the addition of a final concentration of 100 mm glycine, pH 8. Subsequently, the cross-linked reaction mixtures were separated by electrophoresis on a 7% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. CcrM-DNA binding stoichiometry was measured on a BIACORE 2000 (BIACORE, Upsala, Sweden) and data were acquired by the software package provided by the manufacturer. AnN 6-45/45(sp)-mer with one methylation site containing a 3′-biotin label on the methylated strand and an abasic substitution for the target adenine on the nascent strand to facilitate tight binding (25Szegedi S.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1388-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) was used. The biotinylated DNA was immobilized to a ligand load density of 187.2 response units on a streptavidin chip (BIACORE). A CcrM titration (concentration range, 0–2.0 μm with a random injection order) was performed in SPR buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm β-ME, 0.005% surfactant P-20). The activity of CcrM was unaffected by increasing the pH from 7.5 to 8.0 (data not shown), and thus, a pH of 8 was applied to minimize nonspecific interactions between CcrM and streptavidin. The flow rate for each injection was maintained at 25 μl/min, while the association phase was monitored for 3 min, and the dissociation phase was recorded for 15 min. Simultaneous multi-channel injection over a control surface (no DNA) and the experimental surface (containing DNA) provided a real time background subtraction. To avoid sample loss because of adsorption to the storage tubes or the fluidics, 3 μm BSA was supplemented in each injection. To enhance sequence selectivity and minimize nonspecific binding, 50 μm S-adenosyl-homocysteine (AdoHcy) was also included. Between each injection, the surface was regenerated with a 30-s injection of SPR buffer containing 2 m potassium chloride at a rate of 50 μl/min, followed by a 5-min stabilization period. Using BIAevaluation (version 3.1), the background subtracted data were fit to a Langmuir binding model to determineReq for each injection concentration. By plotting Req as a function of CcrM concentration, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximum analyte response level (Rmax) were obtained according to Equation 2(38Panayotou G. Brown T. Barlow T. Pearl L.H. Savva R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 45-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given these values, Equation 3 was used to calculate the CcrM-DNA stoichiometry (39Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29563-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Req=Rmax·CKd+CEquation 2 Stoichiometry=analyte responseligand responseligand Mmanalyte MmEquation 3 where the analyte molecular mass is approximated as 27,500 Da. Methyltransferase activity of CcrM was measured by monitoring tritium incorporation from [3H]AdoMet into a defined DNA substrate (40Berdis A.J. Lee I. Coward J.K. Wright R. Stephens C. Shapiro L. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2874-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Assays were conducted in a buffer consisting of 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm β-ME with 5 μm DNA, 50 μmAdoMet, and increasing concentrations of CcrM (125 nm to 1 μm). At 1-min intervals, the reaction was quenched by spotting 5-μl aliquots on DE81 filter paper. Filters were prepared as described in Berdis et al. (40Berdis A.J. Lee I. Coward J.K. Wright R. Stephens C. Shapiro L. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2874-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All data were corrected for nonspecific binding of [3H]AdoMet to the DE81 filter paper. Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was used to verify the molecular mass of CcrM (amino acid sequence predicted = 39,608 Da). Because of the strong absorbance at short wavelengths (<250 nm) inherent to most oxidized reducing agents, preliminary experiments were performed in the absence of reducing agents. The resulting data were fit to a single ideal species model using WinNonlinLR. The apparent molecular mass of nonreduced CcrM increased in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the molecular mass was observed to dramatically decrease as the rotor speed was increased from 14,000 to 22,000 rpm (data not shown). To test whether this apparent heterogeneity was a result of protein aggregation, denatured CcrM was ultracentrifuged in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The same correlation between molecular mass and rotor speed was observed (data not shown). The occurrence of molecular masses that exceed that of the monomer while in the presence of chaotropic agents, such as guanidine hydrochloride, can only be explained by a covalent interaction between two molecules of CcrM arising from inter-protein disulfide bond formation. This theory was tested by protein-gel electrophoresis in which CcrM was loaded in the presence or absence of β-ME onto a denaturing gel. In the presence of β-ME, a single band consistent with the amino acid sequence predicted monomeric mass of CcrM was observed, whereas in the absence of reducing agents a higher molecular mass species corresponding to a dimer appeared (data not shown). Taken together, these data are most consistent with the formation of a covalent dimer species in the absence of reducing agents. As a result of heterogeneity arising from inter-protein disulfides, equilibrium ultracentrifugation was conducted in the presence of the reducing agent β-ME. However, limitations imposed by the poor signal-to-noise ratios only allowed experiments to be performed at CcrM concentrations above 300 nm. The fitted molecular masses increased from 52,000 to 80,000 Da in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with the formation of a dimeric species. Diagnostic plots of molecular massversus load concentration (Fig.2 A) and molecular massversus rotor speed (Fig. 2 B) indicate that reduced CcrM displays behavior typical of a mass-action directed association (41Laue T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 427-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Global analysis of these data by WinNonlinLR to determine the dissociation constant proved unsuccessful. Therefore, the dissociation constant (Kd) was determined by plotting the fitted molecular mass as a function of load concentration at each rotor speed. The data for each speed were fit (Fig.3) to a general hyperbolic equation by fixing the molecular mass at infinite dilution to that of the monomer. This treatment provided an average Kd of 398.9 ± 73.8 nm. By this method, the molecular mass of the highest oligomeric state was determined to be 81,316 ± 1669 Da, in excellent agreement with the sequence-predicted dimeric mass of 79,216 Da. As a control, the reduced form of CcrM was denatured by addition of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and subjected to equilibrium ultracentrifugation. The denatured, reduced CcrM yielded a monomeric molecular mass (40,100 Da ± 2000 Da) that was invariant with increasing rotor speed (data not shown).Figure 3Sedimentation equilibrium determination of the dissociation constant for CcrM dimerization in the presence of reducing agents. Representative plot showing solution molecular mass determined by local nonlinear fitting of 22,000 rpm data (single-ideal species model using WinNonlinLR) as a function of cell-loading concentration.

Complexes of Mot1 and Spt15 (yeast TBP), radiolabeled in vitro, were immunoprecipitated with anti-TBP (or anti-Mot1) antibodies in the absence of DNA, showing Mot1 binds TBP in solution. Mot1 N-terminal deletions (residues 25–801) abolished TBP binding, whereas C-terminal ATPase domain deletions (residues 802–1867) did not. Complex formation was prevented above 200 mm salt, consistent with electrostatic interaction. Correspondingly, TBP variants lacking solvent-exposed positive charge did not bind Mot1, whereas a mutant lacking positive charge within the DNA-binding groove bound Mot1. ATPase-defective mutant, Mot1(D1408N), which inhibits growth when overexpressed (but is suppressed by co-overexpression of TBP), bound TBP normally in vitro, suggesting it forms nonrecyclable complexes. N-terminal deletions of Mot1(D1408N) were not growth-inhibitory. C-terminal deletions were toxic when overexpressed, and toxicity was ameliorated by TBP co-overproduction.

In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), as in other eukaryotes, many positive and negative regulatory factors act in concert to ensure that transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (pol II)1 is controlled correctly (1Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter accessibility is dictated by chromatin structure, which is modulated by chromatin-remodeling complexes and histone-modifying enzymes (2Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Once a promoter is available, formation of a preinitiation complex begins with binding of TFIID, a complex composed of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and several TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (3Albright S.R. Tjian R. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). TFIID binds to the TATA box sequence present at nearly all yeast promoters (4Struhl K. Annu. Rev.

Formation of a TFIID-DNA complex creates a platform for assembly of the remaining general transcription factors and pol II (6Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

Transcriptional activators stimulate transcription initiation via recruitment of the pol II preinitiation complex to a promoter either through direct interaction with TBP, TFIIB, and/or components of the pol II holoenzyme (9Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 311-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Parvin J.D. Young R.A. Curr. Opin.

Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence highlights the importance of activator recruitment of TBP. For example, by using a TBP derivative with altered DNA binding specificity, it was shown that activator-dependent engagement of TBP at a promoter is rate-limiting for transcription in vivo (12Klein C. Struhl K. Science. 1994; 266: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Also, fusion of TBP to the DNA-binding domains of either LexA or Gal4 allows high level transcription from LexA- or Gal4-binding sites in the absence of any other activator (13Chatterjee S. Struhl K. Nature. 1995; 374: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14Klages N. Strubin M. Nature. 1995; 374: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15Xiao H. Friesen J.D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5757-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finally, as shown by in vivocross-linking techniques, promoter occupancy by TBP correlates with transcriptional activity (16Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 17Li X.Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 399: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because promoter occupancy by TBP is central to gene activation (18Pugh B.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 255: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), TBP is also a prime target of transcriptional inhibitors. A conserved heterodimeric repressor, NC2/Dr1/DRAP, binds TBP via a histone-like fold, preventing TBP association with TFIIA and/or TFIIB, thereby repressing transcription (19Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1992; 70: 477-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 20Kim T.K. Zhao Y. Ge H. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1033-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells lacking NC2α (BUR6/NCB1 gene product) grow very poorly; cells lacking NC2β (NCB2 gene product) are inviable (21Goppelt A. Stelzer G. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Prelich G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another class of negative transcriptional regulator targeting TBP is the yeast MOT1 gene product. Like NC2, Mot1 is essential for viability and evolutionarily conserved. Mot1 homologs exist inDrosophila (55Goldman-Levi R. Miller C. Bogoch J. Zak N.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3121-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and humans (63van der Knaap J.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1701-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A recessive temperature-sensitive mutation (mot1-1) elevated transcription of a plasmid-borne reporter gene in the absence of its normal activator and also increased transcription from several chromosomal pol II-dependent genes, as well as from a basal promoter lacking any upstream activation sequence (UAS) (24Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An independently isolated allele (mot1-1033) had a similar effect on another pol II gene (25Piatti S. Tazzi R. Pizzagalli A. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Chromosoma. 1992; 102: S107-S113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Another recessive allele (bur3-1, for “bypass UAS requirement,” nowmot1-301) was isolated by selecting for mutations permitting transcription from the SUC2 gene promoter lacking its UAS (23Prelich G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Prelich G. Winston F. Genetics. 1993; 135: 665-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a primary role as a negative regulator, Mot1 was found to be the factor responsible for anATP-dependent inhibitory activity (ADI) in nuclear extracts (27Auble D.T. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that removes TATA box-bound TBP in an ATP-dependent manner (28Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although TBP stimulates RNA synthesis by all three RNA polymerase types in transcription reactionsin vitro (29Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the presence of Mot1 decreases transcription of pol II genes, but not pol I or pol III genes (28Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Likewise, Mot1 is required for repression in vitro of LEU2expression by the negative regulator, Leu3 (30Wade P.A. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mot1 was also identified in nuclear fractionation studies as a component (Taf170) of TBP-containing complexes distinct from TFIID (31Poon D. Campbell A.M. Bai Y. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23135-23140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of Mot1 possesses the seven signature motifs of a superfamily of helicases and nucleic acid-dependent ATPases (32Gorbalenya E.G. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), many of which modulate the state of assembly of protein-nucleic acid complexes (33Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Mot1 is the prototype of a distinct class that includes Snf2 (yeast), ERCC6/CSB (human), Brahma (Drosophila), HepA (Escherichia coli), and others (24Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Despite this homology, no helicase activity has been reported for any member of the Mot1/Snf2 group. Mot1, purified to apparent homogeneity, does not exhibit even local DNA strand-unwinding activity but does retain full ability to release TBP bound to a TATA box in an ATP-dependent manner (35Adamkewicz J.I. Mueller C.G. Hansen K.H. Prud'homme W. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21158-21168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Prior studies (36Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggested that contacts with DNA do not play a critical role in Mot1-TBP interaction. Here we have explored this issue in detail and present experiments performed both in vivo and in vitro that define the requirements for, and quantify the affinity of, the physical association between Mot1 and TBP. We also determined the subcellular localization of Mot1, and the role of TBP interaction in Mot1 compartmentation. Strain W303-1A (MAT a ura3-1 his3-11,15 ade2-1 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 can1-100) was used for all experiments, unless otherwise indicated. For immunofluorescence, an otherwise isogenic MAT a/MATα diploid (W303D) was used. Strain KHY18 was constructed in the following manner. Strain YPH501 (37Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed (38Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar) with anXhoI-NotI fragment of plasmid pKH4 containing themot1-Δ2::LEU2 allele in which theLEU2 gene replaces codons 79–1822 of theMOT1-coding sequence (39Hansen K. Biochemical and Genetic Characterization of Mot1 and Its Interaction with Components of the Basal Transcription Complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1996Google Scholar). After confirming correct transplacement of the MOT1 locus on one homolog of chromosome XVI by Southern blotting, the resultingLEU2 + diploid (KHY1) was transformed with pRSMOT1, a derivative of the URA3-markedCEN-based vector, pRS316 (37Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing a 7.1-kb genomicBglII fragment expressing MOT1 from its endogenous promoter (24Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). After sporulation and tetrad dissection, one of the resulting URA3 + LEU2 + MAT a spore clones was designated KHY18 and was used to study two site-directed mutants (mot1-462 and mot1-503) generated in this study (see below). Strain WPY1 was generated by transformation of strain W303D with a BamHI-SnaBI fragment of plasmid pKA23 containing the spt15Δ::LEU2mutation, in which a portion of the SPT15 coding sequence has been replaced with the LEU2 gene (40Arndt K.M. Ricupero S.L. Eisenmann D.M. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2372-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After selection of LEU2 + transformants and verification for proper integration at the SPT15 locus using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with appropriate primers, WPY1 was transformed with a TRP1-marked CEN-based plasmid expressing wild-type SPT15 from its endogenous promoter (pUN45IID) or the same plasmid expressing either of two TBP mutants (K133L,K138L or K133L,K145L) (41Buratowski S. Zhou H. Science. 1992; 255: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After sporulation, the cells were treated with diethyl ether to enrich for spores (42Dawes I.W. Hardie I.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1974; 131: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), andLEU2 + TRP1 + haploids carrying the spt15Δ::LEU2 mutation, maintained by low copy plasmids expressing TBP or TBP mutants, were selected on medium lacking Leu and Trp. Yeast cells without plasmids were grown at 30 °C in rich medium (YP), and cells with plasmids were grown in minimal medium (SC) lacking the appropriate nutrient(s) to maintain selection, as described (43Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), using glucose (Glc) as the carbon source unless otherwise indicated. Solid media contained either 2% Glc or 2% galactose and 0.2% sucrose (Gal/Suc). For expression of genes from the galactose-inducibleGAL1 promoter in liquid media, cells were pre-grown in SC containing 2% raffinose (Raf) as the carbon source, and then galactose (Gal) was added to 2% to initiate induction. Plasmids were introduced into yeast cells using a modification of the lithium acetate transformation procedure that utilizes single-stranded carrier DNA (38Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out using standard techniques (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To facilitate immunodetection of Mot1, DNA encoding the 16-residue c-Myc epitope (LEEQKLISEEDLLRKR) recognized by the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9E10 (45Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) was fused in-frame to the 3′-end of the MOT1coding sequence, using a PCR-based method that exploits 3 primers (46Yon J. Fried M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) as follows: an upstream primer (JDM26), aMOT1/Myc joiner primer (JDM25), and a Myc epitope-containing primer (MYC) (TableI). The resulting 674-base pair PCR product was introduced into theSmaI site of plasmid pRS316 (37Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by blunt-end ligation and verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting product was digested withBstXI and introduced into BstXI-digested pRSMOT1, yielding pRSMot1Myc. Addition of the Myc tag did not detectably alter Mot1 function since pRSMot1 fully complements amot1Δ mutation (data not shown). A Myc-tagged version of the dominant-negative ATPase-defectiveMOT1(D1408N) allele (28Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) was prepared in the same fashion, yielding pRSMot1(D1408N)Myc.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotide primers used for PCRNameSequence (5′ to 3′)JDM6AACCTCACTAGAACGTAGJDM25AAGTAGTTTTGAAATGCTGAGCTCCTCGTCJDM26GACATGGTTGAAAATGKHP5CGCTACGTTCTAGTGAGGKHP6GCCGCTCGAGTGGCTTAGCTTTAGAAGGATCKHP9CCGCTCGAGACCATGGCGGAAGAGGCTCAACTAAKHP12AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAGCATGGCAATCAATTCAGCCAAAGKHP13AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAGCATGGATCCTTCTAAAGCTAAGCKHP14AATGACCTTGTATACGCGTCKHP15AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAGCATGGAATCACAATATATTCTAAAGCCKHP16AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAGCATGGATCTATTGGCAAAGTTGTGCGKHP22AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAACCATGGCGTCACGAGTTTCGAGGCTGGKHP23AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAACCATGGTGAAGTTGGAACATGAAATGAA AATAMYCTTACCTCTTCCTGAGGAGGTCCTCTTCGCTGATTAATTTCTGCTCCTCGAGT7GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCG Open table in a new tab A series of truncations and internal deletions of MOT1Mycand MOT1(D1408N)Myc (see Fig. 4) expressed from the GAL1 promoter and carried onURA3-containing 2-μm DNA-based plasmids were generated, as appropriate, from plasmids, pKH7 or pKH14, respectively (28Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), as described below. To produce pKH23, pKH33, pKH34, pKH35, pKH43, and pKH45, plasmid pKH7 was digested with the restriction enzymesSalI-XhoI (pKH23),CelII-SalI (pKH33),BstEII-NruI (pKH34),NruI-CelII (pKH35),BspEI-NheI (pKH43), orBspEI-BstEII (pKH45), respectively. The resulting 5′-overhangs were filled in using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and dNTPs (except in the case of pKH23), and the plasmids were religated. Plasmids pKH44 and pKH46 were generated similarly to pKH43 and pKH45, respectively, except that they were derived from pKH14. Plasmid pJDSac was constructed by introducing the 2.4-kb SacI-SacI fragment from pRSMot1Myc into YEp352GAL (47Benton B.M. Eng W.K. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Sternglanz R. Fisher P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To create pKH1, pRSMot1Myc was digested withNheI and HpaI, treated with mung bean nuclease (Stratagene), and religated. Plasmid pKH24 was made by swapping the 2.4-kb XhoI-BspEI fragment from pKH1 into pKH7. Plasmids pKH36, pKH37, pKH41, pKH42, and pKH47 were generated by swapping the 3-kb D1408N mutation-containing NdeI fragment from pKH14 into pKH24, pKH34, pKH33, pKH35, and pJDSac, respectively. pKH25 was constructed by using PCR to introduce a XhoI site just 3′ to codon 1261 and then deleting theXhoI-XhoI fragment corresponding to the sequences coding for amino acids 1262–1867, but retaining the c-Myc epitope tag. A 472-base pair fragment of MOT1 was amplified using primers KHP5 and KHP6, digested with XhoI and AflII, and ligated to XhoI-AflII-digested pKH7, to generate pKH25. All deletions of MOT1 were sequenced to confirm that the junctions were in-frame and at the positions expected. MOT1and MOT1(D1408N) were transcribed from the T3 promoter using plasmids pKH21 and pKH22, respectively. pKH21 was constructed by swapping the 2.4-kbSacI fragment from pKH7 into pKH2 (28Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). pKH22 was made in an identical manner, except that the SacI fragment was derived from pKH14. As a negative control, a construct expressingRAD3 from the T3 promoter (48Bardwell L. Bardwell A.J. Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3926-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was transcribed.SPT15 (yeast TBP), with an in-frame N-terminal (His)6 tag, was transcribed from the T7 promoter in plasmid pKH19, which was constructed (39Hansen K. Biochemical and Genetic Characterization of Mot1 and Its Interaction with Components of the Basal Transcription Complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1996Google Scholar) by inserting a 1.5-kbNdeI-BamHI fragment containing theSPT15 coding sequence from pM1 (gift of Robert Tjian, University of California, Berkeley) intoNdeI-BamHI-digested pET15b (Novagen). Three TBP mutants, spt15(K133L K138L),spt15(K133L K145L), andspt15(K138T Y139A), were expressed from plasmids pKH39, pKH40, and pKH48, respectively, which were constructed by transferring the Bsu36I-BamHI fragment containing the appropriate portion of the SPT15 open reading frame (ORF) from pT7-IID(K133L,K138L), pT7-IID(K133L,K145L) (41Buratowski S. Zhou H. Science. 1992; 255: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and TBP(N2-1) (49Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Science. 1995; 269: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), respectively, into pKH19. pKH38 is identical to pKH39 and pKH40, except that it expresses wild-type SPT15 and was generated by swapping the Bsu36I-BamHI fragment from pT7-IID (41Buratowski S. Zhou H. Science. 1992; 255: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) into pKH19. The NdeI-BamHI fragment from pT7-IID(R105H) (gift of Dr. Steve Buratowski, Harvard Medical School) was transferred into NdeI-BamHI- digested pKH19 to yield plasmid pKH49, which expressesspt15(R105H) from the T3 promoter. pKH38 (instead of pKH19) was used to prepare wild-type TBP for those experiments in which normal TBP was compared with TBP mutants because pKH38 was constructed in parallel with the plasmids expressing the TBP mutants. To express MOT1, mot1(Δ25-243), mot1(Δ494-801), mot1(Δ802-1259), mot1(Δ1262-1867), andmot1(Δ1089-1867) by in vitro transcription, PCR was used to amplify sequences containing the MOT1 deletion mutants from plasmids pKH7, pKH43, pKH34, pKH35, pKH25, and pKH23, respectively. In each case, a 5′-primer (KHP22) that corresponds to a segment of the T3 promoter fused to theMOT1 translation start site was used in combination with a primer (T7) that anneals 3′ to the MOT1 ORF. C-terminal deletions (see Fig. 4) were constructed by linearizing plasmid pKH2 with restriction enzymes at sites within the ORF, allowing for run-off transcription. In the case of enzymes leaving 3′-overhangs, the 3′-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase was used to digest the overhanging ends to flush ends, so as to prevent spurious initiation by T3 RNA polymerase. The deletions and restriction enzymes used are as follows: Δ1823–1867, BstXI; Δ1676–1867,EcoNI; Δ1386–1867, NdeI; Δ1280–1867,HpaI; Δ1258–1867, CelII; Δ1203–1867,BspBI; Δ1167–1867, PvuI; Δ1120–1867,AflII; Δ1087–1867, SalI; Δ842–1867,MunI; and Δ800–1867, NruI. Most N-terminal deletions were made by PCR using T3 promoter-containing primers. The resulting PCR products were then transcribed directly. Themot1(Δ1-897) fragment was made with primers KHP12 and KHP14, using linearized pKH2 as the template. Themot1(Δ1-1253),mot1(Δ1-655), andmot1(Δ1-513) fragments were made in a similar manner except that primers, KHP13, KHP15, and KHP16, respectively, were used in place of KHP12. Primers KHP13 and KHP14 were used to make mot1(Δ1-1253). Themot1(Δ1-100) fragment was made using primers T7 and KHP23. Themot1(Δ1-1100) fragment was transcribed from plasmid pKH27 (39Hansen K. Biochemical and Genetic Characterization of Mot1 and Its Interaction with Components of the Basal Transcription Complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Berkeley1996Google Scholar), which was made by digesting pKH2 with XhoI and SalI and religating the vector. The PCR product generated using primers KHP9 and JDM6 with pKH2 as the template was digested with XhoI and SalI and introduced into pKH2 digested with the same enzymes to create plasmid pKH29, which expresses mot1(Δ1-1026) from the T3 RNA polymerase promoter. Proteins to be used in coimmunoprecipitation experiments were produced by coupled in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]Met (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the PromegaTNTTM Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, according to the manufacturer's directions. To increase yield, 0.2 mg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma) was added to each translation mixture. Prior to use, PCR-derived or linearized DNA templates were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. After translation, proteins were partially purified by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate (50Bardwell L. Cooper A.J. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which also allowed for quantification of translation yield as described in detail elsewhere (51Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, the concentration of translated protein can be estimated based on the percent incorporation of [35S]Met, the number of Met residues known to be present in the sequence of the protein, the molecular weight of the protein, and the concentration of unlabeled methionine in the extract (∼5–10 μm). The ammonium sulfate precipitates were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% Tween 20, and 12.5% glycerol) at a volume equal to the starting volume. Immunoprecipitations were performed following the procedures described (51Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3637-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins (∼0.5 pmol each), prepared by coupled in vitro transcription and translation as described above, were mixed in a final volume of 200 μl of Buffer A, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and then clarified by centrifugation at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min. In some experiments (see Fig. 1), unlabeled yeast TBP (yTBP), which was expressed in and purified from E. coli according to the method of Ref. 52Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, was used. After clarification, the resulting supernatant solution was withdrawn and mixed with 15 μl of a 50:50 slurry of protein A-agarose beads (Oncogene Sciences) in Buffer A and 2 μl of polyclonal anti-yTBP antibodies (gift of Dr. Grace Gill, Harvard Medical School) in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h on a roller drum, the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation for 5 s in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant solution was removed by aspiration using a 25-gauge needle, and the pellets were washed 3 times with 1 ml of ice-cold Buffer A. The bead-bound immune complexes were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, boiled, and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, along with a lane containing 14C-labeled molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After electrophoresis, gels were fixed for 30 min in 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid, dried under vacuum, and analyzed by autoradiography using x-ray film (Kodak Biomax MR) or quantified using a PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics). Cultures of strain W303-1A harboring plasmids containing the various MOT1Myc derivatives were grown to an approximate density of A 600 nm = 0.7 in SCRaf medium lacking uracil, induced by addition of Gal, and grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmDTT). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. An amount of cells (equivalent to 10 A 600 nm units) was resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer and lysed by vortex mixing with glass beads as described in detail (53Ma D. Cook J.G. Thorner J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 889-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and large cell debris were removed by low speed centrifugation (2000 rpm for 5 min in a Sorvall SS-34). For immunodetection of Mot1, a sample of the lysate equivalent to 30 μg"
https://openalex.org/W2136555294,"In vivo 32P-labeled yeast proteins from wild type and ppz1 ppz2 phosphatase mutants were resolved by bidimensional electrophoresis. A prominent phosphoprotein, which in ppz mutants showed a marked shift to acidic regions, was identified by mixed peptide sequencing as the translation elongation factor 1Bα (formerly eEF1β). An equivalent shift was detected in cells overexpressing HAL3, a inhibitory regulatory subunit of Ppz1. Subsequent analysis identified the conserved Ser-86 as the in vivo phosphorylatable residue and showed that its phosphorylation was increased inppz cells. Pull-down experiments using a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-EF1Bα fusion version allowed to identify Ppz1 as an in vivo interacting protein. Cells lacking Ppz display a higher tolerance to known translation inhibitors, such as hygromycin and paromomycin, and enhanced readthrough at all three nonsense codons, suggesting that translational fidelity might be affected. Overexpression of a GST-EF1Bα fusion counteracted the growth defect associated to high levels of Ppz1 and this effect was essentially lost when the phosphorylatable Ser-86 is replaced by Ala. Therefore, the Ppz phosphatases appear to regulate the phosphorylation state of EF1Bα in yeast, and this may result in modification of the translational accuracy. In vivo 32P-labeled yeast proteins from wild type and ppz1 ppz2 phosphatase mutants were resolved by bidimensional electrophoresis. A prominent phosphoprotein, which in ppz mutants showed a marked shift to acidic regions, was identified by mixed peptide sequencing as the translation elongation factor 1Bα (formerly eEF1β). An equivalent shift was detected in cells overexpressing HAL3, a inhibitory regulatory subunit of Ppz1. Subsequent analysis identified the conserved Ser-86 as the in vivo phosphorylatable residue and showed that its phosphorylation was increased inppz cells.

The elongation factor 1 (EF1)1 is responsible for the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacylated tRNA to the ribosomal A site in polypeptide chain elongation and participates in proofreading of the codon-anticodon match (1Hinnenbusch A.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 627-735Google Scholar)In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, EF1 consist of different subunits: EF1A (formerly EF1α) is encoded by two different genes (TEF1 and TEF2), and it binds aminoacyl-tRNA in a GTP-dependent manner. The exchange of GDP for GTP on EF1A is stimulated by a member of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor family, EF1Bα, which is encoded by a single gene (TEF5). An additional subunit of uncertain function is encoded by genes TEF3 and TEF4. Although lack ofTEF3 and TEF4 results in no observable defects in translation (2Kinzy T.G. Ripmaster T.L. Woolford Jr., J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2703-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), lack of TEF5 or simultaneous deletion ofTEF1 and TEF2 is lethal (3Hiraga K. Suzuki K. Tsuchiya E.

Components of EF1 have been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by diverse protein kinases in species different from yeast (5Janssen G.M. Maessen G.D. Amons R. Möller W. J. Biol.

For example, cells with increased expression of the EF1A subunit can bypass the lethality of cells lacking EF1Bα. However, these cells present a number of defects, including higher sensitivity to inhibitors of translation elongation and changes in translational fidelity (4Kinzy T.G. Woolford Jr., J.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 481-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in translational fidelity have been also produced by specific mutations in EF1Bα, as it has been documented by evaluation of sensitivity to drugs such as paromomycin and analysis of translational fidelity at nonsense codons (8Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fidelity of translation may be related, at least in part, to the requirement for nucleotide exchange, as it has been tested by mutations in the GTP-binding motif of yeast EF1A (9Carr-Schmid A.

Recently, we have identified the halotolerant determinant Hal3 as a negative regulatory subunit of Ppz1 that modulates the diverse physiological functions of the phosphatase (15De Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gómez N. Ariño J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).As an attempt to better understand the physiological role of the Ppz phosphatases, we have performed a two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of proteins from in vivo 32P-labeled wild type and ppz strains, in search for polypeptides that might display an altered phosphorylation state in the absence of the phosphatases. This approach has led us to establish a previously unsuspected link between the Ppz phosphatases and the translation elongation factor 1Bα.DISCUSSIONIn this report we demonstrate that, in the yeast S. cerevisiae, translation elongation factor 1Bα is a phosphoprotein. Phosphorylation site mapping and sequence analysis indicates that the Ser-86 is the only phosphorylatable residue in this protein, at least under standard growth conditions. It is remarkable that data base search reveals that the equivalent Ser residue (as well as its acidic environment) is also found in a large variety of organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, and human. Phosphorylation of EF1Bα has been reported in Artemia salina (5Janssen G.M. Maessen G.D. Amons R. Möller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11063-11066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wheat (6Matsumoto S. Mizoguchi T. Oizumi N. Tsuruga M. Shinozaki K. Taira H. Ejiri S. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the former case, phosphorylation was ascribed to Ser-89, which is equivalent to Ser-86 in yeast EF1Bα. Interestingly, phosphorylation has been correlated to changes in its catalytic nucleotide exchange activity, although reports are somewhat contradictory (5Janssen G.M. Maessen G.D. Amons R. Möller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11063-11066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Peters H.I. Chang Y.W. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Our data indicate that deletion of the ppz genes and overexpression of Hal3, a negative regulatory subunit of Ppz1 (15De Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gómez N. Ariño J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), result in increased phosphorylation of the EF1Bα protein, specifically at Ser-86. These results would be compatible with a role of Ppz1 in regulating the phosphorylation state of the translation factor and, possibly, its function. We also show here evidence that affinity-purified yeast EF1Bα contains significant amounts of bound Ppz1, by using an approach that was pivotal in the past to identify the Hal3 protein as a subunit of Ppz1 (15De Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gómez N. Ariño J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This could be taken as an indication that Ppz1 could be able to directly dephosphorylate EF1Bα. However, we have been unable to detect direct dephosphorylation of either in vivo labeled or CK-2 in vitrophosphorylated EF1Bα in the presence of bacterially expressed Ppz1. Although at this point we cannot provide direct evidence for the translation factor being a substrate for the phosphatase, this possibility formally remains. For instance, the phosphatase might require accessory proteins (absent in our in vitro assay) to effectively use EF1Bα as substrate. In this regard, there is a large body of evidence for the requirement of specific regulatory subunits (targeting subunits) for Ser/Thr phosphatases to localize at specific subcellular sites or to use a given phosphoprotein as an effective substrate (28Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 29Stark M.J. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1647-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It must be noted that dephosphorylation events have been previously related to the control of the accuracy of protein synthesis, as it is the case of the Ppq1/Sal6 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (30Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Vincent A. Newnam G. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1994; 138: 597-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the closest structural homologue of the Ppz phosphatases. However, the possible role of this phosphatase has not been worked out.We considered that if EF1Bα was a target (either direct or indirect) for Ppz1, it could be possible to establish some sort of functional connection between both proteins. Deletion of TEF5 is lethal for the cell, and high copy expression of TEF2 suppresses the lethal phenotype of tef5 mutants (4Kinzy T.G. Woolford Jr., J.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 481-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these cells are markedly sensitive to translational inhibitors, such as paromomycin and hygromycin B. It is remarkable that lack of Ppz phosphatases also results in a change in sensitivity to these compounds, although in this case yielding more tolerant cells. Because these drugs are aminoglycosides known to enter the yeast cell driven by the membrane potential, which is mostly maintained by the function of the membrane H+-ATPase (32Vallejo C.G. Serrano R. Yeast. 1989; 5: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that the increased tolerance could be an indirect effect due to altered proton efflux. However, this was ruled out by determining this parameter in wild type and ppz mutants and finding essentially identical values (data not shown).Changes in sensitivity to paromomycin have been related to altered translational fidelity (33Singh A. Ursic D. Davies J. Nature. 1979; 277: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 34Palmer E. Wilhelm J.M. Sherman F. Nature. 1979; 277: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), a phenotype also produced by changes in the dosage of EF1A (35Song J.M. Picologlou S. Grant C.M. Firoozan M. Tuite M.F. Liebman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4571-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent evidence (8Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been presented pointing out that mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region of EF1Bα results in increased sensitivity to translation inhibitors and that this effect was accompanied by enhanced translational fidelity (i.e. reduced readthrough at nonsense codons). These observations are in keeping with our finding that cells lacking Ppz phosphatases, which are more tolerant to certain translation inhibitors, show an increased readthrough at nonsense codons, most likely due to a decrease in translational fidelity.Further evidence for a functional interaction between EF1Bα and Ppz1 comes from the observation that overexpression of the translation factor strongly attenuates the growth defect, due to a delayed G1/S transition, of cells containing an excess of Ppz1 activity. Although we showed in the past that this defect correlates with a delay in G1/S cyclin mRNA expression (14Clotet J. Garı́ E. Aldea M. Ariño J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis of the protein level of different cyclins reveals that, at least in the case of Clb5, further post-transcriptional alterations (i.e. at the translation level) could exist. 2E. Nadal, R. P. Fadden, A. Ruiz, T. Haystead, and J. Ariño, unpublished results. Remarkably, a non-phosphorylatable version of EF1Bα was unable to counteract the effect of an excess of Ppz1, suggesting that in vivomodulation of the phosphorylation state of the factor is somehow involved in the regulation of its function. It has been reported that, when expressed from the powerful GAL promoter, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of EF1Bα, lacking Ser-86, was sufficient for normal growth and did not display dramatically altered drug or temperature sensitivity (8Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a strain containing a S86A version of EF1Bα as the only source for the factor is viable. 3L. Valente and T. G. Kinzy, personal communication. Therefore, it must be concluded that regulation of EF1Bα by phospho-dephosphorylation at Ser-86 (which, at least in part, would involve Ppz1) must affect the function of the translation factor in a subtle way. From our data, it can be hypothesized that changes in the phosphorylation state of EF1Bα would result in altered nucleotide exchange on EF1A. However, alternative mechanisms cannot be excluded, because it has been postulated that EF1Bα may have additional regulatory effects on EF1A (9Carr-Schmid A. Durko N. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Kinzy T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30297-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In any case, our data provides further support to the notion that phospho-dephosphorylation mechanisms are relevant for a proper regulation of protein synthesis.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been presented pointing out that mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region of EF1Bα results in increased sensitivity to translation inhibitors and that this effect was accompanied by enhanced translational fidelity (i.e. reduced readthrough at nonsense codons). These observations are in keeping with our finding that cells lacking Ppz phosphatases, which are more tolerant to certain translation inhibitors, show an increased readthrough at nonsense codons, most likely due to a decrease in translational fidelity.Further evidence for a functional interaction between EF1Bα and Ppz1 comes from the observation that overexpression of the translation factor strongly attenuates the growth defect, due to a delayed G1/S transition, of cells containing an excess of Ppz1 activity. Although we showed in the past that this defect correlates with a delay in G1/S cyclin mRNA expression (14Clotet J. Garı́ E. Aldea M. Ariño J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2408-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), immunoblot analysis of the protein level of different cyclins reveals that, at least in the case of Clb5, further post-transcriptional alterations (i.e. at the translation level) could exist. 2E. Nadal, R. P. Fadden, A. Ruiz, T. Haystead, and J. Ariño, unpublished results. Remarkably, a non-phosphorylatable version of EF1Bα was unable to counteract the effect of an excess of Ppz1, suggesting that in vivomodulation of the phosphorylation state of the factor is somehow involved in the regulation of its function. It has been reported that, when expressed from the powerful GAL promoter, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of EF1Bα, lacking Ser-86, was sufficient for normal growth and did not display dramatically altered drug or temperature sensitivity (8Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5257-5266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a strain containing a S86A version of EF1Bα as the only source for the factor is viable. 3L. Valente and T. G. Kinzy, personal communication. Therefore, it must be concluded that regulation of EF1Bα by phospho-dephosphorylation at Ser-86 (which, at least in part, would involve Ppz1) must affect the function of the translation factor in a subtle way. From our data, it can be hypothesized that changes in the phosphorylation state of EF1Bα would result in altered nucleotide exchange on EF1A. However, alternative mechanisms cannot be excluded, because it has been postulated that EF1Bα may have additional regulatory effects on EF1A (9Carr-Schmid A. Durko N. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Kinzy T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30297-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In any case, our data provides further support to the notion that phospho-dephosphorylation mechanisms are relevant for a proper regulation of protein synthesis. In this report we demonstrate that, in the yeast S. cerevisiae, translation elongation factor 1Bα is a phosphoprotein. Phosphorylation site mapping and sequence analysis indicates that the Ser-86 is the only phosphorylatable residue in this protein, at least under standard growth conditions. It is remarkable that data base search reveals that the equivalent Ser residue (as well as its acidic environment) is also found in a large variety of organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, and human. Phosphorylation of EF1Bα has been reported in Artemia salina (5Janssen G.M. Maessen G.D. Amons R. Möller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11063-11066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wheat (6Matsumoto S. Mizoguchi T. Oizumi N. Tsuruga M. Shinozaki K. Taira H. Ejiri S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 1740-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and reticulocyte (7Peters H.I. Chang Y.W. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the former case, phosphorylation was ascribed to Ser-89, which is equivalent to Ser-86 in yeast EF1Bα. Interestingly, phosphorylation has been correlated to changes in its catalytic nucleotide exchange activity, although reports are somewhat contradictory (5Janssen G.M. Maessen G.D. Amons R. Möller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11063-11066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Peters H.I. Chang Y.W. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that deletion of the ppz genes and overexpression of Hal3, a negative regulatory subunit of Ppz1 (15De Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gómez N. Ariño J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), result in increased phosphorylation of the EF1Bα protein, specifically at Ser-86. These results would be compatible with a role of Ppz1 in regulating the phosphorylation state of the translation factor and, possibly, its function. We also show here evidence that affinity-purified yeast EF1Bα contains significant amounts of bound Ppz1, by using an approach that was pivotal in the past to identify the Hal3 protein as a subunit of Ppz1 (15De Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gómez N. Ariño J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This could be taken as an indication that Ppz1 could be able to directly dephosphorylate EF1Bα. However, we have been unable to detect direct dephosphorylation of either in vivo labeled or CK-2 in vitrophosphorylated EF1Bα in the presence of bacterially expressed Ppz1. Although at this point we cannot provide direct evidence for the translation factor being a substrate for the phosphatase, this possibility formally remains. For instance, the phosphatase might require accessory proteins (absent in our in vitro assay) to effectively use EF1Bα as substrate. In this regard, there is a large body of evidence for the requirement of specific regulatory subunits (targeting subunits) for Ser/Thr phosphatases to localize at specific subcellular sites or to use a given phosphoprotein as an effective substrate (28Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 29Stark M.J. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1647-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It must be noted that dephosphorylation events have been previously related to the control of the accuracy of protein synthesis, as it is the case of the Ppq1/Sal6 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (30Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Vincent A. Newnam G. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1994; 138: 597-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the closest structural homologue of the Ppz phosphatases. However, the possible role of this phosphatase has not been worked out. We considered that if EF1Bα was a target (either direct or indirect) for Ppz1, it could be possible to establish some sort of functional connection between both proteins. Deletion of TEF5 is lethal for the cell, and high copy expression of TEF2 suppresses the lethal phenotype of tef5 mutants (4Kinzy T.G. Woolford Jr., J.L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 481-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these cells are markedly sensitive to translational inhibitors, such as paromomycin and hygromycin B. It is remarkable that lack of Ppz phosphatases also results in a change in sensitivity to these compounds, although in this case yielding more tolerant cells. Because these drugs are aminoglycosides known to enter the yeast cell driven by the membrane potential, which is mostly maintained by the function of the membrane H+-ATPase (32Vallejo C.G. Serrano R. Yeast. 1989; 5: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that the increased tolerance could be an indirect effect due to altered proton efflux. However, this was ruled out by determining this parameter in wild type and ppz mutants and finding essentially identical values (data not shown). Changes in sensitivity to paromomycin have been related to altered translational fidelity (33Singh A. Ursic D. Davies J. Nature. 1979; 277: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 34Palmer E. Wilhelm J.M. Sherman F.

The uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of a wide variety of carbohydrates into bacterial cells is, in many cases, accomplished by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev... 1993; 57: 543-594Google Scholar). In a cascade of phosphorylation reactions (Fig.1), the phosphoryl group is transferred from the energy donor phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)1 via the two general components EI and HPr to the carbohydrate-specific components (Enzyme II's), which transport and phosphorylate the carbohydrates (2Robillard G.T. Broos J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1999; 1422: 73-104Google Scholar). All EII's 2The nomenclature of the enzymes is: EII, carbohydrate-specific transport protein of the PTS; EIImtl, wild-type mannitol-specific EII of E. coli containing all four cysteines; SSCS, N-terminal His-tagged EIImtl with Cys110, Cys320, and Cys571 replaced with a serine; SSCS-S124C, SSCS with Ser124 in the C domain replaced with a cysteine; IIChis-CL, C-terminal His-tagged cysteine-less C domain with Cys110 and Cys320 replaced with serine; IIChis-S124C, IIChis-CL in which Ser124 is replaced with a cysteine.

This article deals with the mannitol-specific EII (EIImtl) of Escherichia coli, in which the three domains are covalently linked. HPr phosphorylates the A domain of EIImtl on His554, which subsequently phosphorylates Cys384 in the B domain. Mannitol in the periplasm is bound by the C domain, transported into the cell via C and, while bound at the cytoplasmic site of C, phosphorylated by the B domain. EIImtl is most likely a dimeric protein and the subunit interactions occur in the C domain (3Roossien F.F. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1984; 23: 5682-5685Google Scholar, 4Stephan M.M. Jacobson G.R.

Domain interactions and in particular the B/C domain interface play an important role in the catalytic cycle of EIImtl. The energy coupling mechanism involves conformational interaction between the B and C domain. The evidence for this notion is manifold. 1) Phosphorylation of the B domain increases the rate of transport 2–3 orders of magnitude (9Lolkema J.S. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Dijkstra D.S. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1991; 30: 6716-6721Google Scholar, 10Elferink M.G. Driessen A.J. Robillard G.T. J. Bacteriol... 1990; 172: 7119-7125Google Scholar). 2) Modification or mutagenesis of the phosphorylation site in the B domain as well as removal of the cytoplasmic domains changes the mannitol binding kinetics of the C domain (11Lolkema J.S. Dijkstra D.S. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1991; 30: 6721-6726Google Scholar, 12Boer H. Tenhoeveduurkens R.H. Lolkema J.S. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1995; 34: 3239-3247Google Scholar). 3) Time- resolved fluorescence and phosphorescence spectroscopy showed that, upon phosphorylation of the B domain, Trp109 in the C domain becomes immobilized whereas Trp30 in the C domain becomes more flexible (13Dijkstra D.S. Broos J. Visser A.J.W.G. Vanhoek A. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 4860-4866Google Scholar, 14Broos J. Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. Vos E.P. Koolhof M. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 10877-10883Google Scholar). 4) Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the thermal stability of the C domain is higher in the presence of the B domain (15Meijberg W. Schuurman Wolters G.K. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 7949-7956Google Scholar). 5) Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated that a significant part of the structural changes upon the binding of mannitol to the C domain reside in the B domain. Approximately 50–60 residues are removed from the bulk water upon binding of mannitol, which was much less when the same measurements were done after removal of the B domain (16Meijberg W. Schuurman Wolters G.K. Boer H. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 20785-20794Google Scholar). 6). Close proximity of the B and C domain has been suggested for another PTS transporter, that is the BglF system ofE. coli. 3O. Amster-Choder, personal communication. 3O. Amster-Choder, personal communication. To date, there is no structural information about the B/C domain or dimer interface of EIImtl or any other EII. The topological model of the C domain predicts 6 membrane-spanning α-helices and two large cytoplasmic loops (17Sugiyama J.E. Mahmoodian S. Jacobson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1991; 88: 9603-9607Google Scholar), which is in accordance with the recently resolved projection map of the C domain (7Koning R.I. Keegstra W. Oostergetel G.T. Schuurman Wolters G. Robillard G.T. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 287: 845-851Google Scholar). The location of the loops, however, is not known. A photocross-linking approach to identify the B/C domain interface suggested that the end of the first cytoplasmic C domain loop is located in the vicinity of Cys384 in the B domain. 4B. A. van Montfort, R. H. Duurkens, B. Canas, J. Godorac-Zimmerman, and G. T. Robillard, unpublished results. 4B. A. van Montfort, R. H. Duurkens, B. Canas, J. Godorac-Zimmerman, and G. T. Robillard, unpublished results. Here we describe the generation of disulfide bridges of cysteines within and between B and C domains. This work demonstrates that the first cytoplasmic loop of the C domain is in close proximity to the B domain active site and near the dimer interface. Decyl-polyethylene glycol (dPEG) was synthesized by B. Kwant (Kwant High Vacuum Oil Recycling and Synthesis, Bedum, The Netherlands). Bovine pancreas l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was from Sigma and endoproteinase Glu-C of Staphylococcus aureus V8 was from Fluka. The bimaleimides o-PDM and p-PDM were from Aldrich and BMH was obtained from Pierce. EI and HPr were purified as described previously (18Robillard G.T. Dooijewaard G. Lolkema J.S.

All chemicals used were analytical grade. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the Stratagene Quickchange mutagenesis kit. His-tagged EIImtlwith cysteines at positions 110, 320, and 571 replaced by serine (SSCS) was constructed in pMaHisMtlAPr, which carries the gene for the N-terminal His-tagged EIImtl. 5E. Vos, personal communication. Subsequently, SSCS-S124C was generated by replacing Ser124with a cysteine. IIChis-CL was generated by replacing Cys110 and Cys320 by serine in pMaMtlIICHis, which carries the gene for the C domain with a C-terminal His-tag (16Meijberg W. Schuurman Wolters G.K. Boer H. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 20785-20794Google Scholar). IIChis-S124C was then generated by replacing Ser124 by a cysteine as described above. Mutations were identified by introducing silent restriction sites and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Growth of E. coli LGS322 (F− thi-1, hisG1, argG6, metB1, tonA2, supE44, rpsL104, lacY1, galT6, gatR49, gatR50, Δ(mtlA′p), mtlD c , Δ(gutR′MDBA-recA)) carrying the various plasmids, and procedures to overexpress the mutant proteins were identical to those described for wild-type EIImtl (20Robillard G.T. Boer H. van Weeghel R.P. Wolters G. Dijkstra A. Biochemistry.. 1993; 32: 9553-9562Google Scholar). Inside-out (ISO) membrane vesicles containing the mutant proteins were obtained as described (21Broos J. ter Veld F. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 9798-9803Google Scholar). SSCS and SSCS-S124C were purified by Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography as described for 6HEIImtl (14Broos J. Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. Vos E.P. Koolhof M. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 10877-10883Google Scholar), except that dPEG was used as the detergent. IIChis-CL and IIChis-S124C were purified as described (16Meijberg W. Schuurman Wolters G.K. Boer H. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 20785-20794Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for mannitol binding and EII or IIC concentration in vesicles was determined by flow dialysis after solubilization with 0.25% dPEG (22Lolkema J.S. Dijkstra D.S. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1990; 29: 10659-10663Google Scholar) with some modifications as will be described elsewhere. 6E. Vos, J. Broos, and B. Poolman, unpublished data. The mannitol phosphorylation activity was determined at 1 mm mannitol (23Robillard G.T. Blaauw M. Biochemistry.. 1987; 26: 5796-5803Google Scholar). The concentration of purified SSCS and SSCS-S124C was determined with the pyruvate burst assay, which determines the amount of PTS phosphorylation sites (24Brouwer M. Elferink M.G. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1982; 21: 82-88Google Scholar). The activities of IIChis-CL and IIChis-S124 were determined after formation of a heterodimer with EIImtl-G196D, using 33 μm mannitol as described (25Boer H. Tenhoeveduurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 12901-12908Google Scholar). A solution of ∼6 μmenzyme in ISO vesicles or 1 μm purified protein was brought to a final concentration of 5 mm DTT and 20 mm EDTA from stocks of 0.1 and 0.5 m, respectively. If appropriate, 90 nm EI was added. After 15 min of incubation at 30 °C, DTT and EDTA were removed on a Bio Micro-spin 6 column (Bio-Rad), equilibrated with 50 mmNaPi, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, with (purified enzyme) or without (ISO vesicles) 0.25% dPEG. The buffer was deaerated with helium before addition of the detergent. Subsequently, HPr, MgCl2, dPEG, and PEP were added to phosphorylate the purified enzyme, provided EI was present; these additions increased the final volume by 50%. The same mixture without PEP was used to represent conditions in which the enzyme was not phosphorylated. The final concentrations of the components were 2 μm HPr, 5 mm PEP, and 5 mm MgCl2. After 5 min at 30 °C, disulfide bridge formation was initiated by oxidation with 0.1 volume of 3 mmCu(II)-(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (CuPhe), followed by incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 65 mm EDTA from a stock of 0.5 mNaEDTA, pH 8. The protein was partially digested with 20 μg of trypsin or 100 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C/ml of reaction mixture for 1 h at room temperature. The digestion of the vesicles with endoproteinase Glu-C was done in the presence or absence of 0.4% dPEG. The digestion was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE denaturation buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. If appropriate, reduction was accomplished by the addition of 10 mm DTT after digestion. Heterodimers between 3 μm SSCS and 1 μm IIChis-S124C or 0.2 μm SSCS-S124C and 3 μm IIChis-CL were formed by mixing purified proteins, followed by an incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. To promote heterodimer formation between SSCS-S124C and IIChis-CL, 170 mmNa3PO4 was added from a 1 m stock solution at pH 7.6. This lowers the cloudpoint of the detergent (dPEG), in which the protein is solubilized. This treatment results in dissociation of the initially homodimeric enzymes and thereby facilitates the mixing of the species (26Broos J. Hoeve Duurkens R.T. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 3865-3870Google Scholar). Subsequently, the heterodimers were treated as described above for the disulfide cross-linking procedure except that EI, HPr, MgCl2, and PEP were omitted from the mixture. 1 μm Purified IIChis-S124C was reduced and demetalated as described under “Disulfide Cross-linking.” Cross-linking was initiated by adding to the protein, in 50 mmNaPi, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA plus 0.25% dPEG, 5 μm o-PDM, p-PDM, or BMH from a 10 times concentrated stock solution inN,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction was stopped with 10 mm DTT after incubation at 30 °C for 30 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done with 10% acrylamide gels as described (27Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). A denaturation buffer without β-mercaptoethanol was used. The samples were not boiled in denaturation buffer, because this leads to aggregation. The proteins were visualized either by silver staining (28Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis.. 1987; 8: 93-99Google Scholar) or by immunodetection after the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry electrophoretic blotting. Detection, using the Western LightTMchemiluminescence detection kit with CSPDTM as the substrate, was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Tropix Inc.). The first antibody was an anti-His antibody from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the second antibody was an anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). A Coomassie-stained band containing the C domain, generated by tryptic digestion, was excised from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and completely destained with 50 mm NH4HCO3 in 40% ethanol. Subsequently, the gel piece was washed three times with 200 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 and cut into pieces of ∼1 mm3. A 200-μl volume of 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol in 25 mmNH4HCO3 was added and, after 2 h of mixing at room temperature, the peptides were extracted with two times 200 μl of 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid by 5 min of sonication in a bath sonicator. The β-mercaptoethanol solution and the extracts were pooled and dried in a SpeedVac. The last traces of ammonium bicarbonate were removed by adding 10 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid and subsequent drying in the SpeedVac. The dried samples were dissolved in 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and sonicated for 5 min. Aliquots of 0.75 μl were applied onto the MALDI target and allowed to air dry. Subsequently, 0.75 μl of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxysuccinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid was applied to the dried samples, which was then allowed to dry again. MALDI mass spectra were recorded with a Micromass Tofspec E MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometer operated in reflectron mode. Spectra were calibrated externally. Two His-tagged EIImtl mutants were constructed. SSCS is a single cysteine enzyme with only Cys384 in the B domain. SSCS-S124C contains Cys124 in the C domain in addition to Cys384. The phenotype of E. coli LGS322 expressing these mutants was analyzed on MacConkey agar plates with 1% d-mannitol. Both strains formed purple-red colonies, indicating that the mutants transport and ferment mannitol. Inside-out (ISO) membrane vesicles from LGS322 cells expressing both mutants were solubilized with 0.25% dPEG and analyzed for mannitol binding and phosphorylation activities. The dissociation constants for mannitol were 25 and 45 nm and the turnover values for phosphorylation of mannitol of these mutants were 5200 and 4900 min−1 for SSCS and SSCS-S124C, respectively. The turnover values for mannitol phosphorylation of purified SSCS and SSCS-S124C were 3200 and 2700 per min, respectively. These activities are similar to that of wild-type EIImtl(22Lolkema J.S. Dijkstra D.S. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1990; 29: 10659-10663Google Scholar, 29Dijkstra D.S. Broos J. Lolkema J.S. Enequist H. Minke W. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 6628-6634Google Scholar). ISO membrane vesicles bearing IIChis-CL or IIChis-S124C, solubilized with 0.25% dPEG, and analyzed for mannitol binding, displayed dissociation constants for mannitol of 32 and 70 nm, respectively. These dissociation constants are similar to previously determined values of the wild-type C domain generated by tryptic digestion of the complete protein (22Lolkema J.S. Dijkstra D.S. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1990; 29: 10659-10663Google Scholar) or of the separately expressed IIC (8Boer H. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Dijkstra A. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 17863-17871Google Scholar). In addition, IIChis-CL and IIChis-S124C could both complement the mannitol-binding defective EIImtl-G196D for phosphorylation activity in an in vitro assay, a result similar to that described for IIC (8Boer H. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Dijkstra A. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 17863-17871Google Scholar). Overall, these kinetic data clearly indicate that SSCS and SSCS-S124C are fully functional enzymes and that both mutant C domains can bind mannitol and form functional heterodimers with EIImtl. Fig. 2 A shows the results of CuPhe-induced oxidation of SSCS and SSCS-S124C in ISO membrane vesicles, as visualized by immunoblotting with an antibody raised against the N-terminal His-tag. The untreated proteins migrated as a major band at ∼60 kDa and are indicated as EII. The band at 36 kDa is a degradation product, whereas the one at 116 kDa (band 1) is most likely the dimer. This dimer has been observed previously upon extraction of the enzyme from the membrane (3Roossien F.F. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1984; 23: 5682-5685Google Scholar) and is most likely not held together by a disulfide bond, since it is resistant to reduction with DTT. The amount of this band 1 is the same in all lanes. The oxidation by CuPhe of both mutants resulted in the appearance of a higher molecular weight band (band 2). The molecular mass was ∼200 kDa but varied depending on the concentration of acrylamide that was used (not shown). The formation of this band was almost completely reversed by reduction of the sample with DTT, suggesting that it is stabilized by a disulfide bridge. The reduction with DTT is not complete in the particular sample in lane 5. However, inlane 11 of Fig. 2 A, lane 1 of Fig. 2 B, and in duplicate experiments complete reduction was observed. Both high molecular weight bands (1 and 2) have been observed previously and both were denoted as dimeric species (4Stephan M.M. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry.. 1986; 25: 4046-4051Google Scholar, 5Pas H.H. Ellory J.C. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1987; 26: 6689-6696Google Scholar, 30Roossien F.F. van Es-Spiekman W. Robillard G.T. FEBS Lett... 1986; 196: 284-290Google Scholar). Also in this paper we refer to band 2 as a dimeric species, but we cannot fully exclude the possibility that it represents another oligomeric state as will be discussed below. Since Cys384 is the only candidate for disulfide formation in SSCS, the enzyme is thus capable of forming a disulfide between the two Cys384 residues. This is an important observation, because the dimer contacts are between the C domains (8Boer H. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Dijkstra A. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 17863-17871Google Scholar). Partial digestion of EIImtl with endoproteinase Glu-C generated a band at 33 kDa, which corresponds to the C domain without the A and B domains. Endoproteinase Glu-C instead of trypsin was used, because it did not cleave off the N-terminal His-tag within the 1-h incubation period. The cleavage pattern of digested SSCS was the same irrespective of whether the disulfide was formed or not. In addition, the cleavage pattern was unchanged upon reduction. This shows that the disulfide bridge resides in the domains that were degraded, which is consistent with the location of Cys384 in the B domain. However, if the same oxidation and digestion procedure was followed with oxidized SSCS-S124C, a new band at 50 kDa appeared (Fig.2 A, indicated by the arrow), irrespective of whether the digestion was done in the presence or absence of the detergent dPEG. This band disappeared upon reduction of the sample with DTT. This excludes the possibility that the protein was only partially cleaved under the oxidizing conditions. Based on its size, this band is probably the result of a disulfide bridge between Cys124 of both monomers, indicating that residue 124 is at the dimer interface. Very vaguely, some other products, which could include a disulfide bridge between Cys384 and Cys124 (see below) might be visible as well. To further examine the nature of the Cys124-Cys124 disulfide bridge, the CuPhe-induced oxidation was repeated with purified SSCS-S124C. Fig.2 B shows the result of this experiment, visualized by immunoblotting. The same observations were made when the gel was silver-stained (not shown). The oxidation of purified SSCS-S124C also yields the reducible dimer band 2. Almost no band 1 was observed after purification, which probably indicates that the affinity between two monomers is decreased. Upon endoproteinase Glu-C digestion, the 50-kDa fragment was not observed. Instead, a His-tagged fragment of 42 kDa was visible in addition to the 33-kDa C domain band. This 42-kDa band disappeared upon reduction of the sample with DTT (compare lanes 3 and 4). Endoproteinase Glu-C digestion of the B domain will generate a 7.9-kDa fragment containing Cys384. The size of the 42-kDa band thus suggests that a disulfide bond is formed between the 33-kDa C domain harboring Cys124 and the 7.9-kDa B domain fragment with Cys384. In conclusion, the data in Fig. 2, A and B, point to the formation of two different disulfides, one intersubunit Cys124-Cys124 and one interdomain Cys124-Cys384. Further evidence for both disulfides will be supplied in the following sections. To elucidate the composition of the disulfide bridges, the CuPhe-induced oxidation was performed with purified SSCS-S124C and SSCS (Fig.3). The two higher molecular weight bands (1 and 2) were observed again with both proteins (lanes 2and 14). These bands were not present upon reduction with DTT and were much less intense or absent upon phosphorylation of the protein at His554 and Cys384, confirming that these bands, at least in SSCS, arise from a disulfide bridge between the two Cys384 residues in the dimeric complex. Instead of endoproteinase Glu-C, trypsin was used to define the cross-links. Trypsin first cleaves in the linker between the C and B domain and, subsequently, digests the A and B domain completely but leaves the C domain intact except for the N-terminal His-tag (22Lolkema J.S. Dijkstra D.S. ten Hoeve Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry.. 1990; 29: 10659-10663Google Scholar, 31Stephan M.M. Jacobson G.R. Biochemistry.. 1986; 25: 8230-8234Google Scholar). The proteolytically generated C domain can be observed on SDS-PAGE at 30 kDa, which is somewhat smaller than the endoproteinase Glu-C-generated C domain. This is consistent with the removal of the His-tag and a different cleavage site in the linker between the B and C domain. The tryptic B domain fragment with Cys384 has a calculated mass of ∼1.9 kDa. Tryptic digestion of CuPhe-oxidized SSCS-S124C also showed an ∼30-kDa band, which was significantly broadened upwards when the sample was not treated with DTT (compare lanes 6and 7). This suggests that the broadened 30 kDa comprises the C domain plus the 1.9-kDa fragment of the B domain, analogous with the 42-kDa band in Fig. 2 B. Consistent with this conclusion are the following observations: (i) the broadening is not observed with SSCS (Fig. 3: compare lanes 17 and 18); (ii) phosphorylation prior to oxidation prevented the occurrence of the broadening (compare lanes 6 and 8); and (iii) the broadening was not observed in wild-type EIImtl or in mutants of SSCS with cysteines at positions 158 or 199 (not shown). A tryptic-generated C domain of SSCS-S124C, not treated with CuPhe, also led to some broadening, which is probably due to spontaneous oxidation (compare lanes 5 and 6). Another point to note is that the addition of 100 μm mannitol did not have an effect on the occurrence of the broadening (lane 9). Finally, dimeric C domain was not observed in the tryptic digest of oxidized SSCS-S124C. Taken together, the broadening must be the result of a disulfide bridge between Cys384 and Cys124. To exclude the possibility that this disulfide bridge is an aspecific reaction between two accessible cysteines, another control experiment was performed (Fig. 3, lanes 11 and 12). With the sample inlane 11, oxidation was carried out after trypsin treatment, whereas in lane 12 it was carried out before trypsinolysis. Clearly, the broadening of the C domain band is no longer observed when the trypsin digestion preceded the oxidation. Thus, Cys124is not capable of reacting with just any cysteine-containing peptide, present at the same concentration. To demonstrate that the fragment, which caused the broadening of the tryptic-generated C domain, originated from the B domain, the protein was excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, reduced with β-mercaptoethanol to cleave the disulfide bond between the C domain and the B domain peptide, the peptides were extracted with organic solvents, and the extract was analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS. Fig. 4 shows the mass spectrum of the extracted peptides. The spectrum only contained 4 peaks, all of which could be assigned to tryptic B domain fragments that contain Cys384. The peak atm/z 1879.05 is the fully cleaved peptide with residues 380–399 (expected m/z 1878.92), and the peak at m/z 2007.05 represents the partially cleaved fragments of residues 379–399 and/or 380–400 (expectedm/z 2007.02). This partial cleavage is due to the presence of the RK and RKK sequences at the N and C terminus of these peptides, respectively, that cannot be fully cleaved by trypsin. The peaks at m/z 1954.79 and 2083.05 represent the same peptides but with a β-mercaptoeth"

Bradykinin rapidly activates NHE-1 in a concentration-dependent manner as assessed by proton microphysiometry of quiescent cells and by 2′-7′-bis[2-carboxymethyl]-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein fluorescence measuring the accelerated rate of pHi recovery from an imposed acid load. The activation of NHE-1 is blocked by inhibitors of the bradykinin B2 receptor, phospholipase C, Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM), and Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), but not by pertussis toxin or by inhibitors of protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that bradykinin stimulates the assembly of a signal transduction complex that includes CaM, Jak2, and NHE-1. CaM appears to be a direct substrate for phosphorylation by Jak2 as measured by an in vitro kinase assay. We propose that Jak2 is a new indirect regulator of NHE-1 activity, which modulates the activity of NHE-1 by increasing the tyrosine phosphorylation of CaM and most likely by increasing the binding of CaM to NHE-1.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5361-5369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Despite the potential importance of NHE-1 to many cellular functions, the processes involved in its regulation have not yet been fully elucidated. NHE-1 is nearly quiescent in resting cells but is activated by a variety of hormones, growth factors, and hypertonicity (3Barber D.L. Cell Signal. 1991; 3: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Growth factors activate NHE-1 by mechanisms that are either dependent or independent of phosphorylation of NHE-1 and/or NHE regulatory proteins. The phosphorylation reactions can be carried out by diverse kinases such as protein kinase C (5Sauvage M. Maziere P. Fathallah H. Giraud F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The rapid activation of NHE-1 is usually associated with an increase in its phosphorylation (13Sardet C. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19166-19171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but deletion of the phosphorylation sites contained within residues 636–815 of NHE-1 only reduces its response to growth factors by about 50% (14Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those results suggest that mechanisms of regulation of NHE-1 that do not involve its direct phosphorylation are important. The best characterized nonphosphorylation-dependent mechanism of regulation of NHE-1 involves Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM). NHE-1 has two calmodulin-binding domains. A high affinity CaM domain (residues 637–657) serves as an autoinhibitory domain (15Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13710-13715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of the low affinity domain (residues 664–684) is uncertain. To this point, clear links between CaM, phosphorylation, and activation of NHE-1 have not been identified. In this report, we studied the regulation of NHE-1 activity in the murine mIMCD-3 cell culture model of the kidney inner medullary collecting duct (17Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because cells in the inner medulla must be able to tolerate extremely high osmolarities, we reasoned that these cells would have highly responsive cell volume defense pathways including sodium-proton exchangers (18Paillard M. Exp. Nephrol. 1997; 5: 277-284PubMed Google Scholar). In that regard, native cells from the inner medullary collecting duct have been shown to express three subtypes of sodium-proton exchangers (NHE-1, NHE-2, and NHE-4) on their basolateral surfaces (19Sun A.M. Liu Y. Centracchio J. Dworkin L.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and mIMCD-3 cells contain mRNA for both NHE-1 and NHE-2 (20Soleimani M. Singh G. Bizal G.L. Gullans S.R. McAteer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27973-27978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we provided physiological data suggesting that functional B2 receptors were present in the inner medullary collecting ducts of rats (21Mukai H. Fitzgibbon W.R. Bozeman G. Margolius H.S. Ploth D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: R352-R360PubMed Google Scholar). Because B2 receptors have been shown to activate CaM (22Briand S.I. Bernier S.G. Guillemette G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Naidu P.S. Velarde V. Kappler C.S. Young R.C. Mayfield R.K. Jaffa A.A. Am. J.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C101-C110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we felt that B2 receptors were excellent candidates for regulating NHE-1 in mIMCD-3 cells. Thus, we evaluated mIMCD-3 cells for the expression of functional B2 receptors and determined whether they were coupled to NHE activation in those cells. Further, we explored the interactions between CaM and phosphorylation reactions in the process of activation of sodium-proton exchange after stimulation of the B2 receptors. The data presented herein support a link between Jak2-dependent phosphorylation of CaM and activation of NHE-1 by bradykinin. Fluo-3 and BCECF were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc.

Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This line retains many differentiated properties of terminal IMCD cells including the expression of an amiloride-inhibitable sodium channel, inhibition of apical to basal Na+ fluxes by atrial natriuretic peptide and amiloride, tolerance to high osmotic growth conditions, and accumulation of intracellular osmolytes in response to hypertonic stress. In addition, these cells form tight monolayers with high transepithelial resistance (∼1350 ohms × cm2). This high electrical resistance feature was recently shown also to be exhibited in primary cultures of rat IMCD cells, where resistance exceeded 1000 ohms × cm2 (25Ruhfus B. Bauernschmitt H.G.

Each of eight channels has two inlet ports for buffers, one of which usually contains a vehicle control, and the other of which carries the test substance. The cells are perfused with buffer, and valve switches and stop-start cycles are totally controlled by a programmable computer. Acidification rate data are transformed by a personal computer running Cytosoft™ version 2.0 and are presented as the extracellular acidification rate in μV/s, which roughly correspond to milli-pH units/min (Nernst equation). In order to facilitate comparison of data between two channels, values are expressed as a percentage of a base line determined by computerized analysis of the five data points prior to exposure of the cell monolayers to a test substance. For all of the experiments, mIMCD-3 cells were plated onto polycarbonate membranes (3-μm pore size, 12-mm size) at a density of 300,000 cells/insert the night prior to experimentation. After cells were attached to the membranes, they were growth-arrested in serum-free culture medium for 20 h before the experiment. The day of the study, cells were washed with serum-free, bicarbonate-free Ham's F-12 medium, placed into the microphysiometer chambers, and perfused at 37 °C with the same medium or balanced salt solutions. For most studies, the pump cycle was set to perfuse cells for 60 s, followed by a 30-s “pump-off” phase, during which proton efflux was measured from the 8th through the 28th second. Cells were exposed to the test agent for three or four cycles (270–360 s). Valve switches (to add or remove test agents) were performed at the middle of the pump cycle. Data points were then acquired every 90 s. The peak effect during stimulation was expressed as the percentage increase from base line. Total cellular RNA was isolated by a single-step guanidine isothiocyanate/phenol-chloroform extraction method (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63176) Google Scholar) from cultured mIMCD-3 cells using the RNA STAT-60 reagent (TEL-TEST B, Inc., Tyler, TX). Cell monolayers were lysed directly in the culture dish by adding RNA STAT-60 and passing the cell lysate several times through a Pasteur pipette. The crude homogenates were allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min. Chloroform was added to the homogenates (0.2 ml of chloroform/ml of RNA STAT-60). Samples were vortexed for 15 s and then allowed to stand at room temperature for 2–3 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the aqueous phase was removed into fresh tubes and extracted again with 1 ml of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Samples were recentrifuged as in the previous step, the aqueous phase was removed, and the RNA was precipitated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol (0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol/ml of the RNA STAT-60 used for sample homogenization). Samples were stored at room temperature for 5–10 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. The well-formed white pellet was washed using 75% ethanol by vortexing the mixture vigorously collected by subsequent centrifugation at 7,500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was air-dried for 20–30 min and then was dissolved in RNase-free water. The integrity of the RNA was tested directly by agarose gel electrophoresis. Ribonulease protection assay was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions provided with the Ambion RPA II kit. In brief, 20 μg of sample RNA was hybridized with 50 × 104 cpm of antisense riboprobe in hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide/100 mmsodium citrate (pH 6.4), 300 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.4), and 1 mm ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid) for 16–20 h at 48 °C. After hybridization, excess single-strand riboprobe and the unhybridized portion of sample RNA was digested away with ribonucleases A and T1 mixture (Solution Bx, Ambion) supplemented with 1% blue coprecipitant solution (Ambion) to visualize the pellet. The reaction mixture was incubated at 34 °C for 30 min. The ribonucleases were inactivated, and protected double-stranded RNA was precipitated in a single step by adding Solution Dx (Ambion) and incubating at −20 °C for 20 min. Samples were then centrifuged for 15 min, and the pellets were air-dried and reconstituted in 8 μl of gel loading buffer (8% sucrose, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol). The protected segments were isolated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR films for 4–16 h. β-Actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to normalize the mRNA loading on the gel. Dried gels were also exposed to a PhosphorImager intensifying screen for the same period for further analysis by the Storm 860 imaging system. (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageQuantTM supplied by the same manufacturer. We used a FLIPR™ fluorescence laser imaging plate reader (28Schroeder K.S. Neagle B.D. J. Biomol. Screening. 1996; 1: 75-80Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to measure intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in mIMCD-3 cells plated into 96-well microtiter plates. Cells were seeded (∼50,000 cells/well) in 96-well clear bottom black microplates (Corning Costar) and left overnight in CO2 incubator at 37 °C. On the day of assay, cells were loaded with 4 μm Fluo-3 for 1 h in Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm HEPES and 2.5 mmprobenecid. After loading, cells were washed four times with Hanks' balanced salt solution on an automated plate washer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). The plates were then placed into the FLIPR. The 96 wells were simultaneously illuminated for 0.4 s by an argon laser (488 nm) set at ∼0.3 watts (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Fluorescence emission readings were obtained using a 540-nm bandpass filter at 1-s intervals until a base line was obtained (about 10 readings). Then cells were simultaneously exposed to a range of BK concentrations (10−5 to 3 × 10−10m) in the presence or absence of B1 ([des-Arg10]HOE-140) or B2 (HOE-140) antagonists (29Hock F.J. Wirth K. Albus U. Linz W. Gerhards H.J. Wiemer G. Henke S. Breipohl G. Konig W. Knolle J. Scholkens B.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 102: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Fluorescence readings were then obtained from each well every second for a total of 2 min and then every 6 s for 2 min. Replicate readings were averaged. Each tracing was normalized using background fluorescence from wells treated with buffer controls. Tracings were acquired, averaged, and normalized using the FLIPR™ Control software program (Molecular Devices). Peak values from each tracing were then used to construct concentration-response plots for the various conditions. The FLIPR™ was also used to measure pHi in mIMCD-3 cells plated into 96-well microtiter plates. Cells were treated as described above and then were loaded with a dye (5 μm BCECF) in a loading buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm probenecid, and 1% fetal bovine serum) for 1 h at 37 °C. 20 min before the end of the loading phase, 20 mmNH4Cl was added to each well. Cells were then washed four times with the loading buffer containing 20 mmNH4Cl. In the FLIPR, cells were acid-loaded by an ammonium chloride prepulse protocol. In this method, the extracellular buffer contains NH 4+ and NH3 in an equilibrium that is essentially recapitulated in the cell interior. When the extracellular medium is changed to a buffer lacking NH4Cl, intracellular NH3 diffuses rapidly out of the cell, causing the cells to become acutely “loaded” with protons donated from NH4 (30Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: C61-C73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some cells were pretreated with 100 nm HOE-140 (B2 receptor antagonist) or with 100 nm [des-Arg10]HOE-140 (B1 receptor antagonist) for 10 min. Cells were allowed to recover from the acid load in the presence and absence of sodium and various test substances. Fluorescence excitation was obtained using an argon laser (488-nm wavelength at 300 milliwatts), and emission (>540 nm) was monitored kinetically. Calibration of the BCECF fluorescence to the intracellular pH was performed on similar 96-well plates using the electroneutral H+/K+ ionophore, nigericin. For calibration, cells were equilibrated with buffers of varied pH and 130 mm of KCl (the estimated intracellular concentration of K+). Calibration plots were then generated by equalizing intracellular and extracellular pH by adding 20 μmnigericin to cells in various pH buffers (31Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Quiescent mIMCD-3 cell monolayers were treated with 100 nm bradykinin or vehicle for 10 min, lysed in 1 ml/100-mm dish of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin at 1 μg/ml each). Cell lysates were precleared by incubating with a protein A-agarose bead slurry for 30 min at 4 °C. Precleared lysates (1 μg/μl total cell protein) were incubated with anti-Jak2/protein A-agarose, with anti-NHE-1 or anti-NHE-2 antibody or with polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody overnight at 4 °C. Phosphotyrosine, NHE-1, and NHE-2 immunoprecipitates were captured by the addition of protein A-agarose. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblot analysis with monoclonal anti-CaM or anti-phosphotyrosine IgG. The same Western blots were reprobed with the antibody used for immunoprecipitation to assure that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. Phosphorylation of Jak2 in response to BK was assessed using a Jak2 dual phosphospecific antibody. Quiescent cells were treated with 100 nm BK for 10 min and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. The lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions with 4–20% precast gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). After semidry transfer to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, membranes were blocked with a Blotto buffer and incubated with the phospho-Jak2 antibody (0.5 μg/ml). After incubation with alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were visualized by a chemiluminescent method (CDP StarTM, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) using preflashed Eastman Kodak Co. X-AR film and quantified using a GS-670 densitometer and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). To make sure that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane, blots were stripped and reprobed with control Jak2 antibody, which recognizes equally well phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Jak2. 10 μl of Jak2 enzyme-agarose complex was incubated in kinase assay buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate), containing 1 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP and 4 μg of purified CaM for different periods of time (5, 10, 15, and 30 min) at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography. Data analysis was performed with the Storm 860 Imagine system (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuantTM software. In order to demonstrate the presence of BK receptor mRNA in mIMCD-3 cells, we used an RNase protection assay. Using an antisense riboprobe of ∼400 nucleotides and total RNA isolated from mIMCD-3 cells, we obtained a single protected band on the autoradiogram (Fig.1 A). To confirm that the protected band corresponds to B2 receptor mRNA, we hybridized increasing quantities of in vitro transcribed sense strand B2 receptor mRNA with this riboprobe. The intensity and the size of the protected band confirmed the presence of B2 receptor mRNA in mIMCD-3 cells and suggested that receptor protein might also be expressed in those cells. We used a Cytosensor™ microphysiometer (Molecular Devices) to measure proton efflux from intact monolayers of mIMCD-3 cells plated onto polycarbonate membranes. The microphysiometer was designed to measure the rate of production of extracellular protons in the monolayers during stop-flow conditions by assessing in real time the rate of decrease in extracellular pH in intact cells (26McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). We have previously used the microphysiometer to specifically study Na+/H+ exchange in fibroblasts (34Garnovskaya M.N. Gettys T.W. van Biesen T. Prpic V. Chuprun J.K. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y. Raymond J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and enterocytes (36Prpic V. Fitz J.G. Wang Y. Raymond J.R. Garnovskaya M.N. Liddle R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G689-G695PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 Ashows that mIMCD-3 cells exposed to a sodium-free balanced salt solution (in which TMA is substituted for sodium) establish a relatively stable basal rate of proton efflux (extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)). When the perfusate is switched to a sodium-replete solution (in which sodium is substituted mmper mm for TMA), the mIMCD-3 cells produce a transient but vigorous burst of proton efflux, which peaks at 500% of basal values. This burst of sodium-dependent proton efflux could be blocked by preincubation with 1 μm EIPA (ethylisopropylamiloride), which is an inhibitor of sodium-proton exchangers types 1 and 2 (NHE-1 and NHE-2). Fig. 2 B shows results of a protocol in which an acid load was imposed upon mIMCD-3 cells by the ammonium chloride prepulse method. After removal of the ammonium chloride from the salt solution, intracellular pH dropped from a resting pHi of ∼7.24 to 6.67. In the presence of sodium, pHi recovered close to base line (>7.1) in ∼8 min. Most of the recovery of pHi could be blocked by removing sodium from the balanced salt solution or by including 1 μm EIPA in sodium-replete recovery solution. Although a small sodium-independent and EIPA-resistant recovery of pHi did occur (to pHi of ∼6.75 after 1 min of recovery and 6.8 after 8 min of recovery), >80% of the recovery appeared to be mediated by NHE-1 or NHE-2 as evidenced by its dependence on sodium and sensitivity to EIPA. Fig. 3 A shows that cells treated with 100 nm BK (open circles) had a rapid increase in extracellular acidification rate that did not occur when cells were exposed to vehicle (black circles) during the valve switch. The magnitude of the response depended upon the concentration of BK, as shown in Fig. 3 B, with half-maximal values occurring at 30–100 nm BK. Fig. 3 C shows that the stimulatory effect of BK occurred in sodium-containing Ham's F-12 medium or in sodium-containing balanced salt solution but not in a solution in which TMA was substituted for sodium. The effect could also be blocked by EIPA. Fig. 3 D shows studies in which two specific BK receptor antagonists were examined for inhibition of BK-stimulated ECAR in mIMCD-3 cells. These studies showed that the receptor is a B2 receptor because proton efflux was blocked by the B2 receptor antagonist (HOE-140, icatibant) but not by the B1 receptor antagonist [des-Arg10]HOE-140. Thus, Fig. 3 presents evidence that the B2 receptor in mIMCD-3 cells activates proton efflux through stimulation of a NHE (probably NHE-1 or NHE-2). Fig.4 A shows that 100 nm BK accelerated the rate of recovery from an acid load and that this effect was inhibitable by EIPA. In the presence of BK, pHi rose to ∼7.0 in the first minute and to >7.25 after 8 min, whereas in the absence of BK it rose to ∼6.8 in the first minute and to ∼7.15 after 8 min. Fig. 4 B shows that the B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant, but not the B1 receptor antagonist, [des-Arg10]HOE-140, blocked the increased rate of recovery of pHi induced by BK. Thus, Fig. 4 presents evidence that the B2 receptor in mIMCD-3 cells activates a sodium-dependent, EIPA-inhibitable pHi recovery pathway probably through stimulation of NHE-1 or NHE-2. Fig. 5shows studies in which various inhibitors were examined for effects on BK-stimulated ECAR in mIMCD-3 cells. These studies showed that the response is not sensitive to pertussis toxin. Two phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors (D609 and ET-18-OCH3) blocked proton efflux, suggesting that the B2 receptor couples to PLC in mIMCD-3 cells (Fig. 5 A). Similar results were obtained with another PLC inhibitor, U73122 (not shown). In contrast, PI-3′-kinase inhibitors (20 nm wortmannin and 50 μm LY294002) had no effect (not shown). Because PLC activation can lead to stimulation of PKC through the intermediate actions of diacylglycerol, we tested the effects of a PKC inhibitor (GF109203X) on BK-induced proton efflux. GF109203X (1 μm) did not attenuate BK-induced proton efflux but was able to inhibit PMA (1 μm)-elicited proton efflux. Those studies showed that a PKC inhibitor in a concentration that was adequate to block ECAR induced by direct activation of PKC by PMA did not block B2 receptor-elicited ECAR. That result is consistent with the noninvolvement of PKC in B2receptor-elicited ECAR in mIMCD-3 cells. PLC activation also leads to increases in intracellular Ca2+, which in turn can stimulate a number of cellular signaling targets. Thus, we next established that B2 receptors increase intracellular Ca2+ in mIMCD-3 cells. We used a FLIPR™ plate reader to simultaneously measure [Ca2+]i in mIMCD-3 cells plated into 96-well microtiter plates. Those experiments (Fig.6 A) show that BK induced a rapid and sustained elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in mIMCD-3 cells preloaded wit"
https://openalex.org/W2086670387,"Two novel, structurally and functionally distinct phosphatases have been identified through the functional complementation, by maize cDNAs, of an <i>Escherichia coli</i>diphosphonucleoside phosphatase mutant strain. The first, ZmDP1, is a classical Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Li<sup>+</sup>-sensitive diphosphonucleoside phosphatase that dephosphorylates both 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (3′-PAP) and 2′-PAP without any discrimination between the 3′- and 2′-positions. The other, ZmDP2, is a distinct phosphatase that also catalyzes diphosphonucleoside dephosphorylation, but with a 12-fold lower Li<sup>+</sup> sensitivity, a strong preference for 3′-PAP, and the unique ability to utilize double-stranded DNA molecules with 3′-phosphate- or 3′-phosphoglycolate-blocking groups as substrates. Importantly, ZmDP2, but not ZmDP1, conferred resistance to a DNA repairdeficient <i>E. coli</i> strain against oxidative DNA-damaging agents generating 3′-phosphate- or 3′-phosphoglycolate-blocked single strand breaks. ZmDP2 shares a partial amino acid sequence similarity with a recently identified human polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatase that is thought to be involved in DNA repair, but is devoid of 5′-kinase activity. ZmDP2 is the first DNA 3′-phosphoesterase thus far identified in plants capable of converting 3′-blocked termini into priming sites for reparative DNA polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2086819792,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-dependent drug pump that confers multidrug resistance (MDR). In addition to its ability to efflux toxins, P-gp can also inhibit apoptosis induced by a wide array of cell death stimuli that rely on activation of intracellular caspases for full function. We therefore hypothesized that P-gp may have additional functions in addition to its role in effluxing xenotoxins that could provide protection to tumor cells against a host response. There have been a number of contradictory reports concerning the role of P-gp in regulating complement activation. Given the disparate results obtained by different laboratories and our published results demonstrating that P-gp does not affect cell death induced by another membranolytic protein, perforin, we decided to assess the role of P-gp in regulating cell lysis induced by a number of different pore-forming proteins. Testing a variety of different P-gp-expressing MDR cell lines produced following exposure of cells to chemotherapeutic agents or by retroviral gene transduction in the complete absence of any drug selection, we found no difference in sensitivity of P-gp+ve or P-gp−ve cells to the pore-forming proteins complement, perforin, or pneumolysin.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). In the clinical setting, expression of P-gp on tumor cells confers resistance to a wide range of different chemotherapeutic agents constituting a multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype and a poor prognosis. The current working model maintains that P-gp removes xenotoxins in an energy (ATP)-dependent manner by intercepting the drug as it moves through the lipid membrane and flips the drug from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet and into the extracellular media (3Higgins C.F. Gottesman M.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 17: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Consistent with its toxin clearance role, P-gp is expressed on the surface of normal human cells found in the gut, liver, and kidney tubules, and at blood-tissue barriers (4Cordon-Cardo C. O'Brien J.P. Boccia J. Casals D. Bertino J.R. Melamed M.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). However, P-gp is also expressed in the adrenal gland, hemopoietic stem cells, natural killer (NK) cells, antigen-presenting dendritic cells, and T and B lymphocytes (5Klimecki W.T. Futscher B.W. Grogan T.M. Dalton W.S. Blood. 1994; 83: 2451-2458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Randolph G.J. Beaulieu S. Pope M. Sugawara I. Hoffman L. Steinman R.M. Muller W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies by our group and others have indicated that, in addition to its role as an efflux pump, P-gp also regulates programmed cell death mediated by some chemotherapeutic drugs, serum starvation, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and ligation of the cell surface death receptors Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor (7Robinson L.J.

The ability of P-gp to inhibit cell death mediated by these diverse apoptotic stimuli appears to be due to P-gp-mediated inhibition of caspase activation. In contrast, other stimuli such as the chemotherapeutic agent hexamethylene bisacetamide (10Ruefli A.A. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 2378-2385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (11Tainton K.M. Ruefli A.A. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Blood. 1999; 93: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which are fully functional in the absence of caspase activation, were not affected by P-gp. A number of groups have analyzed the potential effects of P-gp on cell lysis mediated by complement, a family of related pore-forming proteins necessary for antibody-mediated cytolysis. Initial studies focused on successfully using anti-P-gp antibodies and rabbit complement to purge autologous bone marrow grafts of residual P-gp+ve MDR cells (12Aihara M. Aihara Y. Schmidt-Wolf G. Schmidt-Wolf I. Sikic B.I. Blume K.G. Chao N.J. Blood. 1991; 77: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or complement fixing anti-P-gp antibodies to eliminate P-gp+ve tumors in mouse model systems (13Tsuruo T. Hamada H. Sato S. Heike Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 80: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies were those of Bomstein and Fishelson (14Bomstein Y. Fishelson Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that P-gp+ve tumor cell lines were more sensitive to complement-mediated lysis compared with matched P-gp−ve parental cells. However, in contrast to these findings were two reports demonstrating a role for functional P-gp in inhibiting membrane damage by complement (15Weisburg J.H. Curcio M. Caron P.C. Raghu G.

The authors of these studies presented evidence suggesting that P-gp-mediated intracellular alkalinization (pHi) and/or decreased plasma membrane potential (Vmax) resulted in a reduction in the rate of formation of the “membrane attack complex” (MAC) at the cell surface. Functional MACs consist of complement components C5b, C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules to form pores of ∼100 Å (17Morgan P.B. Harris C.L. Complement Regulatory Proteins. Academic Press, London1999: 1-31Crossref Google Scholar). Expression of functional P-gp was shown to correlate with a reduction in the rate of MAC formation rather than the molecular stoichiometry of MAC complexes (16Weisburg J.H. Roepe P.D. Dzekunov S. Scheinberg D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10877-10888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that altered pHi and/orVmax may somehow directly or indirectly affect C9 polymerization, resulting in a net loss of functional MAC formation (16Weisburg J.H. Roepe P.D.

Perforin is essential for death of virus-infected or malignant target cells by CTL and NK effector cells (18Trapani J.A. Davis J. Sutton V.R. Smyth M.J. Curr. Opin.

Perforin, expressed in the granules of CTL and NK cells mediates the transport of granzymes into the target cell to induce programmed cell death via a process known as granule exocytosis (18Trapani J.A. Davis J. Sutton V.R. Smyth M.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Following the initial cloning and characterization of perforin, it was demonstrated that there were structural and functional similarities between perforin and the C9 component of complement (19Young J.D. Cohn Z.A. Podack E.R. Science. 1986; 233: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20Tschopp J. Masson D. Stanley K.K. Nature. 1986; 322: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Both could form pores in lipid membranes, both had conserved amino acid motifs, and monoclonal antibodies raised against purified C9 and perforin showed cross-reactivity (19Young J.D. Cohn Z.A. Podack E.R. Science. 1986; 233: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 20Tschopp J. Masson D. Stanley K.K. Nature. 1986; 322: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated equivalent lysis of P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve CEM cells treated with perforin (9Johnstone R.W. Krasovskis E. Smyth M.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the structural and functional similarities between C9 and perforin and the contradictory findings by a number of groups regarding regulation of complement-mediated lysis by P-gp, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the role of P-gp in regulating pore formation. Using a number of matched P-gp−ve and P-gp+ve cell lines isolated following treatment of cells with chemotherapeutic agents, and different pore-forming proteins such as activated complement, purified recombinant perforin, and the bacterial toxin pneumolysin, we observed no effect of P-gp on cytolysis induced by these agents. These studies were confirmed using P-gp+ve multidrug-resistant cells produced by retroviral gene transduction and cloned by fluorescence-activated cell sorting in the complete absence of drug selection. Our data therefore indicate that P-gp does not affect the cytolytic effects of pore-forming proteins. The acute T cell leukemia cell line, CEM-CCRF, its doxorubicin (DOX)-selected and -resistant P-gp+ve line CEM-A7+, have been previously described (21Zalcberg J.R. Hu X.F. Wall D.M. Mirski S. Cole S.

K562 and vincristine-selected P-gp+ve Kvin2000 cells were kindly provided by Greg Woods (University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia). All cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μ g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cell surface expression of P-gp and Fas was confirmed and monitored by fluorescence analysis using the MRK 16 anti-P-gp (Kamiya Biochemical Co., Thousand Oaks, CA) and CH-11 anti-human Fas (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Drug efflux activities of P-gp and reversal with verapamil were assessed by rhodamine 123 exclusion assays as described (22Yamamoto T. Iwasaki T. Watanabe N. Oshimi K. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Kobayashi Y. Blood. 1993; 81: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MDR1 coding region was cloned into the retroviral vector plasmid MSCV. This bicistronic vector contains (i) the amphotropic retrovirus murine stem cell virus (MSCV) 5′-long terminal repeat, (ii) the encephalomyocarditis internal ribosomal entry site, (iii) the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA, and (iv) the MSCV 3′-long terminal repeat (23Zhou W. Clouston D.R. Wang X. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7662-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The plasmid was cotransfected with an amphotropic packaging plasmid into 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. After 48 h, the supernatant containing amphotropic particles was harvested, filtered, and added to CEM-CCRF cells every 8 h for 3 days. The cells were allowed to recover for 72 h and then analyzed for GFP expression by flow cytometry. The highest expressing 10% of cells were sterilely sorted, expanded, resorted, and subsequently expanded in oligoclonal pools. Cells were subsequently screened for expression of P-gp and sorted by flow cytometry using the MRK-16 monoclonal antibody (Kamiya Biochemical Co.). Human perforin was purified as described previously (24Froelich C.J. Turbov J. Hanna W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pneumococcal PLO was provided by Dr. James Paton (Childrens and Womens Hospital, Adelaide, Australia). Freshly prepared serum from naı̈ve rabbits was used as the source of hemolytic complement. Small aliquots of serum were stored at −70 °C and discarded after each use. Heat inactivation at 65 °C for 30 min caused total inhibition of the complement activity. DOX and vincristine were obtained from Dr. Phillip Kantharidis (Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, East Melbourne, Australia). Expression of the regulators of complement activation, CD35, CD46, CD55. and CD59, on the cell surface was determined by flow cytometry. Monoclonal antibodies against CD35 (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA), CD46 (E4.3, IgG2a), CD55 (clone 1H4, IgG1), and CD59 (clone MEM-43, IgG2a), kindly provided by Dr. S. Russell (Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Australia), or appropriate isotype control antibodies were incubated with P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve CEM cells on ice for 1 h. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse immunoglobulin for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed, and antibody binding was detected by flow cytometry using a FACScan (Beckton Dickinson). Cell death was assessed by51Cr release assays as described (8Smyth M.J. Krasovskis E. Sutton V.R. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7024-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The spontaneous release of 51Cr was determined by incubating the target cells with medium alone (or in the presence of anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody (mAb), verapamil, or caspase inhibitor where applicable). It should be noted, at the concentrations used, inhibitors alone did not cause release, nor did they affect the long term survival of cell lines. The maximum release was determined by adding SDS to a final concentration of 5%. The percentage of specific lysis was calculated as follows: 100 × [(experimental release − spontaneous release)/(maximum release − spontaneous release)]. To inhibit P-gp function, the labeled targets were preincubated for 30 min with UIC2 (IgG2a mAb; final, 0.1–5 μg/ml) (Coulter, Miami, FL) or verapamil (0.5–10 μm) (Knoll Australia, Lane Cove, Australia) prior to the cytotoxicity assay. Isotype control antibodies were included where applicable. To inhibit caspase activity, labeled target cells were preincubated for an additional 30 min with peptidyl fluoromethyl ketones (ZFA- and ZVAD-fluoromethyl ketones) (Enzyme System Products, Dublin, CA) (final, 50 μm). Complement-mediated lysis was assessed by treating 5 × 104 51Cr-labeled target cells with diluted active or heat-inactivated rabbit complement for 10–60 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of anti-CD71 (clone M-A712, IgG2a, BD PharMingen) or anti-FcγRII (clone 8.26, IgG2b) (25Ierino F.L. Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1794-1803PubMed Google Scholar) monoclonal antibodies where applicable. Lysis by perforin or pneumolysin was assessed by treating 5 × 104 51Cr-labeled target cells with diluted pore-forming proteins for 60 min at 37 °C. A previous study had shown that P-gp+ve K562 cells were less sensitive to complement-mediated lysis compared with parental P-gp−ve K562 cells (15Weisburg J.H. Curcio M. Caron P.C. Raghu G. Mechetner E.B. Roepe P.D. Scheinberg D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In that study, complement deposition was induced by activating the classical complement pathway following addition of an anti-CD71 antibody (15Weisburg J.H. Curcio M. Caron P.C. Raghu G. Mechetner E.B. Roepe P.D. Scheinberg D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To test this finding, we used matched P-gp−ve and P-gp+ve K562 cells derived following incubation of the parental cell line in vincristine, and anti-CD71 or anti-FcγRII mAbs to activate the complement cascade. Equivalent binding of both antibodies to their target antigens on P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve K562 cells was demonstrated (Fig.1). Addition of a single dose of complement to increasing concentrations of anti-CD71 (Fig.2 A, lanes 3–8) or anti-FcγRII (Fig. 2 A, lanes 13–18) mAbs resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cell lysis. Cell death was dependent on activated complement, as heat inactivation of the rabbit serum completely inhibited 51Cr release (Fig.2 A, lanes 9–12, 19, and20). The drug efflux function of P-gp expressed on the K562 cells was confirmed by addition of DOX to P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve cells. Only P-gp−ve K562 cells were sensitive to DOX-induced cell death (Fig. 2 A,lanes 21 and 22). To confirm these data and demonstrate that the dose of complement used in Fig.2 A did not overwhelm potential subtle differences in susceptibility of P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve K562 cells to complement-mediated lysis, a single dose of anti-FcγRII antibody was added to increasing concentrations of complement (Fig.2 B). Both P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve K562 cells were equally susceptible to lysis over the entire complement concentration range (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5–12). Once again, heat inactivation of the rabbit sera inhibited cell lysis (Fig. 2 B, lanes 13–16) and only the P-gp−ve K562 cells were susceptible to drug-induced death (Fig. 2 B, lanes 17 and18).Figure 2P-gp does not affect complement-mediated lysis of myeloid cells. A, 51Cr-labeled K562 (P-gp−ve) and Kvin (P-gp+ve) cells were incubated with rabbit serum containing active (C′) or heat-inactivated complement (HI C′) in the presence or absence of anti-CD71 or anti-FcγRII monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. As a control for P-gp function, cells were treated with doxorubicin (Dox, 100 ng/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C.B, 51Cr-labeled K562 and Kvin cells were incubated with anti-FcγRII monoclonal antibody and serially diluted (1:4–1:32) rabbit serum containing active complement (C′) or heat-treated rabbit serum (1:4) containing inactive complement (HI C′) for 1 h at 37 °C. As a control, cells were treated with doxorubicin (Dox, 100 ng/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C. Data are calculated as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate samples and are representative of a least two different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Complement activation can be inhibited by cell surface regulators of complement activation (RCA) proteins including CD35 (CR1), CD46 (MCP), CD55 (decay accelerating factor), and CD59 (17Morgan P.B. Harris C.L. Complement Regulatory Proteins. Academic Press, London1999: 1-31Crossref Google Scholar). To determine whether P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve K562 cells expressed equivalent levels of RCA proteins, fluorescence analyses using mAbs specific for the different RCA proteins were performed. As shown in Fig. 3, no significant difference in expression of CD35, CD46, CD55, or CD59 was observed between P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve K562 cells. To determine whether P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve K562 cells were equally susceptible to death induced by other pore-forming proteins, cells were treated with purified perforin (Fig. 4 A) or pneumolysin (Fig. 4 B). P-gp did not affect perforin- (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–12) or pneumolysin-mediated cell lysis (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–10), but did protect K562 cells against cell death induced by the chemotherapeutic agents vincristine (Fig. 4 A, lanes 13 and 14) and doxorubicin (Fig. 4 B, lanes 11 and12). These experiments were performed numerous times, and no statistically significant difference in susceptibility to death induced by these agents was observed in P-gp+ve versusP-gp−ve cells. These data therefore demonstrate that functional P-gp does not protect myeloid cells against cell lysis induced by a range of different membranolytic proteins. To ensure that the results obtained using the K562 erythoroblastoid lines were not specific to myeloid cells, P-gp+ve (A7) and P-gp−ve (CEM) T lymphoid cell lines were used. Cells were treated with activated complement (Fig. 5 A), purified perforin (Fig. 5 B), and pneumolysin (Fig. 5 C) and cell lysis assessed by 51Cr release assays. In all cases, both P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve CEM cells were equivalently susceptible to cell lysis induced by active pore-forming proteins. In contrast, only P-gp−ve CEM cells were susceptible to death induced by chemotherapeutic agents vincristine (Fig. 5, A and B) or doxorubicin (Fig.5 C). It should be noted that the rabbit sera used in this study contained significant levels of natural antibodies against both P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve CEM cell lines as assessed by flow cytometry (data not shown). This thereby eliminated the necessity for anti-CD71 or anti-FcγRII mAbs to be used in the complement activation assays. In addition, there was no significant difference in expression of cell surface CD35, CD46, CD55, and CD59 between CEM and A7 cells (data not shown). The P-gp+ve K562 and CEM cells used in the studies presented thus far were both produced following treatment of parental cells with vincristine and doxorubicin, respectively. It is therefore possible that any affect that P-gp may have on cell lysis induced by complement or other pore-forming proteins may be negated by other genetic defects introduced into these cells following drug treatment. To overcome this potential problem, we expressed P-gp on the surface of CEM cells by retroviral gene transduction in the complete absence of drug selection. CEM cells were transduced with virus expressing GFP and P-gp and were sorted by flow cytometry. Thus, cell lines expressing P-gp and/or GFP were obtained and used in the following studies. Expression of cell surface P-gp and intracellular GFP in CEM, A7, and retroviral transduced CEM cells was assessed by flow cytometry (Fig.6 A). P-gp was expressed on A7 and fluorescence-activated cell-sorted RP-gp+ve(GFP+ve/P-gp+ve) and not on CEM or RP-gp−ve (GFP+ve/P-gp−ve) cells (Fig. 6 A). The efflux function of P-gp was determined by123Rh efflux assays (Fig. 6 B). As123Rh, a demonstrated substrate for P-gp, is a fluorescent dye, an increase in fluorescence following incubation with cells indicates dye uptake (22Yamamoto T. Iwasaki T. Watanabe N. Oshimi K. Naito M. Tsuruo T. Kobayashi Y. Blood. 1993; 81: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following treatment of cells with123Rh, A7 and RP-gp+ve showed only a marginal increase in fluorescence over background compared with that seen with CEM and RP-gp−ve cells (Fig. 6 B). These data indicate that P-gp expressed on the surface of RP-gp+ve cells is capable of effluxing P-gp substrates. To determine whether P-gp expressed on the retroviral transduced cells confers MDR, the CEM, A7, RP-gp+ve, and RP-gp−ve cells were treated with chemotherapeutic agents vincristine and doxorubicin (Fig. 7). Both A7 and RP-gp+ve cells were resistant to various doses of vincristine and doxorubicin, whereas CEM and RP-gp−ve cells were sensitive to death induced by these agents. These data indicate that RP-gp+ve cells express functional P-gp and that P-gp expression alone is sufficient to induce an MDR phenotype in the CEM T cell line. We next assessed the sensitivity of RP-gp+ve and RP-gp−ve cells to cell lysis mediated by pneumolysin (Fig.8 A) and complement (Fig.8 B). Both cell lines were equivalently sensitive to death induced by these membranolytic agents, with RP-gp+ve cells demonstrating resistance to death induced by vincristine as a control for P-gp function in these assays (Fig. 8, A andB, lane 14). Both RP-gp+ve and RP-gp−ve cells expressed approximately equal levels of cell surface CD35, CD46, CD55, and CD59 (data not shown). To determine whether RP-gp+ve and RP-gp−ve cells may be lysed by activated complement with different kinetics, time-course experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 8 C, RP-gp+ve and RP-gp−ve cells were lysed by activated complement with very similar kinetics, indicating that, in this in vitro system, functional P-gp does not significantly affect the rate of complement deposition. The role of P-gp in regulating complement-mediated cell lysis has been a controversial one with different groups reporting conflicting data. One group correlated P-gp expression with increased sensitivity of cells to complement-mediated cell lysis (14Bomstein Y. Fishelson Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, two separate studies by another group demonstrated that functional P-gp inhibited the rate of complement deposition on the cell surface and provided evidence suggesting that P-gp inhibited the rate of formation of the complement MAC (15Weisburg J.H.

Scheinberg D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10877-10888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In an attempt to clarify this issue, we tested a number of different P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve cell lines, including cells transduced with retrovirus and selected in the absence of drug treatment, for sensitivity to cell membrane damage mediated by pore-forming proteins. The retroviral transduced P-gp+ve cells expressed levels of P-gp equivalent to that seen in drug selected CEM-A7 and Kvin cells and were equally insensitive to various chemotherapeutic drugs. This indicates that, in this system, expression of P-gp was necessary and sufficient to induce a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Cell lysis was induced with a diverse range of membranolytic agents including activated complement, purified human perforin, and the bacterial pore-forming protein pneumolysin. Our data indicate that functional P-gp does not significantly affect the rate or degree of membrane lysis irrespective of cell type, the manner by which P-gp expression was achieved, or the lytic agent used. Although the role of P-gp in effluxing xenotoxins out of cells has long been established, the physiological functions of P-gp have yet to be identified. Analysis of MDR1 gene knockout mice reveals an inability to clear certain neurotoxins (26Schinkel A.H. Smit J.J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L.

Expression of P-gp correlates with an increase in intracellular pH (pHi) and decreased plasma membrane potential (Vmax) (35Wadkins R.M. Roepe P.D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 121-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed by Roepe and colleagues (36Roepe P.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) that this effect on cell physiology indirectly affects the function of chemotherapeutic drugs that are not directly pumped by P-gp by “partitioning” drugs away from their intracellular targets. As stated above, a role for P-gp in positively or negatively regulating complement-mediated cell lysis has also been proposed. Whether or not any of these proposed roles of P-gp represent true physiological functions of the molecule remains to be thoroughly tested. It is presently unclear how or why different laboratories could produce such divergent findings with regards to the role of P-gp in regulating complement activation. The studies by Bomstein and Fichelson (14Bomstein Y. Fishelson Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) may merely correlate P-gp expression with increased sensitivity to complement-induced lysis. The authors did block P-gp function by addition of anti-P-gp mAb, resulting in a decrease in sensitivity of cells to complement attack. However, the MRK-16 antibody used (IgG2a) is capable of activating complement (13Tsuruo T. Hamada H. Sato S. Heike Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 80: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and one might have expected an increase in complement-mediated lysis or even a zero net effect rather than the decrease in complement activity observed. Interpretation of the results from these studies were made somewhat difficult, given the differences in expression of certain complement regulatory proteins observed between P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve cells. The studies by Weisberg and colleagues (15Weisburg J.H. Curcio M. Caron P.C. Raghu G. Mechetner E.B. Roepe P.D. Scheinberg D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2699-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Weisburg J.H. Roepe P.D. Dzekunov S. Scheinberg D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10877-10888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showing P-gp-mediated resistance to complement-induced cell lysis appeared well controlled, although the relative expression of complement regulatory proteins such as CD35, CD46, CD55, and CD59 on the different P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve cell lines was not assessed. We attempted to reproduce these findings using the same cell type (K562) and complement activating antibodies directed against the same cell surface antigen (CD71) used in those studies. However, we observed no difference in complement sensitivity between P-gp+ve and P-gp−ve cells. The cell lines used in our study expressed similar levels of complement regulatory proteins, and the drug efflux function of P-gp was confirmed in every assay. Weisberg et al. argue that altered intracellular pH may be the mechanism by which P-gp can affect complement-induced cell death and hypothesize that other pore-forming proteins such as a complement C9-like protein produced by Trypanosoma cruzi may be similarly affected. No data have yet been published supporting this hypothesis. In contrast, we demonstrate in our assay systems that neither purified human perforin which is also homologous to complement C9, nor the pneumococcal pore-forming protein, pneumolysin, was affected by functional P-gp. We have quantitated the pHi of our cells using the carboxy SNARF-1 acetate fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes) and flow cytometry. We observed an increase in intracellular pH in P-gp+ve (CEM-A7 = pHi 7.5, Kvin = pHi 7.7) compared with P-gp−ve cells (CCRF-CEM = pHi 7.2, K562 = pHi 7.5); however, no commensurate difference in membrane disruption by pore-formers was observed. A number of experiments performed in a variety of different laboratories have provided evidence for addition roles for P-gp other than its ability to efflux xenotoxins (see Ref. 37Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Smyth M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 289: 1-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (299) Google Scholar and references therein). The putative role of P-gp in regulating cell lysis mediated by pore-forming proteins on the cell surface has been the topic of some debate, and we have attempted to answer this question using a variety of different cell lines expressing P-gp tested against a range of different membranolytic proteins. From our data, we conclude that P-gp does not regulate cell lysis induced by activated complement, purified human perforin, or pneumolysin. We thank Drs. J. A. Trapani, V. Sutton, and S. M. Russell for helpful discussions and Dr. J. Patton for valuable reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2134241373,"Ligation of the tumor necrosis factor α receptor CD120a initiates responses as diverse as apoptosis and the expression of NF-κB-dependent pro-survival genes. How these opposing responses are controlled remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation by p42mapk/erk2 inhibits the apoptotic activity of CD120a while preserving its ability to activate NF-κB. Phosphorylated CD120a is re-localized from the Golgi complex to tubular structures of the endoplasmic reticulum wherein it recruits Bcl-2. Antisense-mediated down-regulation of Bcl-2 antagonized the localization of CD120a to tubular structures and reversed the protection from apoptosis conferred by receptor phosphorylation. We propose that phosphorylation of CD120a represents a novel, Bcl-2-dependent mechanism by which the apoptotic activity of the receptor may be regulated. Thus, oncogenic activation of p42mapk/erk2 may serve to inhibit the apoptotic activity of this death receptor while preserving NF-κB-dependent responses and may thus indirectly contribute to a failure to eliminate cells bearing oncogenes of the Ras-Raf-MEK-p42mapk/erk2pathway.

Thus, oncogenic activation of p42mapk/erk2 may serve to inhibit the apoptotic activity of this death receptor while preserving NF-κB-dependent responses and may thus indirectly contribute to a failure to eliminate cells bearing oncogenes of the Ras-Raf-MEK-p42mapk/erk2pathway. tumor necrosis factor-α TNF receptor-associated death domain protein Fas-associated death domain proteins mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase MAPK/ERK kinase constitutively active MEK1 FLICE-inhibitory protein inhibitor of apoptosis family of proteins Fas ligand death-inducing signaling complex phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling TNF receptor-associated factor-2 Engagement of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)1 receptor CD120a (p55) sets in motion the activation of signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis in certain cells (1Ashkenazi A.

Interaction with TNFα leads to trimerization of the receptor and to the binding of the adapter molecule TRADD through death domain·death domain interactions (2Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

The complex then recruits several signaling molecules, including TRAF2 and RIP, which stimulate MAPK and NF-κB activation pathways (3Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). The requirement of the FADD-caspase-8 pathway in CD120a-mediated apoptosis has been elegantly demonstrated by the resistance of cells derived from FADD-knock-out mouse embryos to TNFα-induced apoptosis (6Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. McCurrach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. Lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 leads to the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of Bid to generate a truncated, pro-apoptotic fragment (tBid) capable of inducing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (7Li H.

Fas ligand (Fas-L) and to a lesser extent TNFα-mediated apoptosis have been shown to be negatively regulated by several molecules, including Casper/FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) (8Shu H.B.

In contrast, IAP proteins have been shown to interact with, and inhibit, caspases 3, 7, and 9. In addition, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are capable of binding to TRAF1 and TRAF2, although the mechanism by which they promote survival is poorly understood (11Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). The family of Bcl-2-related proteins comprises both death-inducing (Bax, Bak, Bcl-xS, Bad, Bid, Bik, and Hrk) and death-inhibiting (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1, Mcl-1, and Boo) members (13Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), and, although the mechanism of action of death-inducing Bcl-2 family members is rapidly emerging, the mechanism underlying the death-inhibiting properties of Bcl-2 family members is only partly understood. The ratio of death antagonists to agonists has been proposed to regulate the death-life rheostat within the cell (13Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). In addition, several Bcl-2 family members are regulated by subcellular localization (7Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Although Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are essential components of the general apoptosis regulatory machinery, they are relatively poor inhibitors of the death signals induced by TNFα and Fas-L in cells that efficiently activate caspase-8 at the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (so-called “type I” cells), but effectively block apoptosis in cells that poorly activate caspase-8 at the DISC (“type II” cells) (13Kroemer G.

When present, the survival influence of Bcl-2 family proteins in Fas-L or TNFα-induced apoptosis generally occurs downstream of the activation of caspase-8 through the inhibition of cytochromec release from mitochondria (12Kawahara A. Kobayashi T. Nagata S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2549-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Perez D. White E. J.

The MAPKs comprise three major sub-families in mammalian cells: 1) the p38mapk subfamily; 2) the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) p44mapk/erk1 and p42mapk/erk2; and 3) the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK). In work previously reported from this laboratory, we have shown that specific members of each MAPK sub-family are rapidly and transiently activated in response to stimulation of mouse macrophages with TNFα (24Winston B.W. Riches D.W.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1525-1533PubMed Google Scholar, 25Winston B.W. Chan E.D. Johnson G.L. Riches D.W.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4491-4497PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chan E.D.

Moreover, whereas the targets of these kinases include transcription factors involved in the inflammatory response, recent studies have also shown these targets to include CD120a itself (27Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32975-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that activation of p42mapk/erk2 by other receptors,e.g. growth factor receptors, also promotes phosphorylation of CD120a. (28Van Linden A.A. Cottin V. Leu C. Riches D.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6996-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As a result of phosphorylation, CD120a expression, especially in the Golgi complex, is down-regulated and the receptor is redistributed to tubular structures associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (27Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32975-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the phosphorylation of CD120a by p42mapk/erk2 may represent a broad mechanism by which TNFα, growth factors, and other stimuli may regulate the activity of CD120a. Recent studies have suggested that the activation of p42mapk/erk2 in the context of other pro-apoptotic signals confers a dominant pro-survival advantage (29Yeh J.H. Hsu S.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For example, activation of MEK1, an upstream activator of p42mapk/erk2, has been shown to antagonize Fas-triggered cell death through the up-regulation of Casper/FLIP (29Yeh J.H. Hsu S.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Activation of p42mapk/erk2has also been shown to be protective against TNFα-induced apoptosis of L929 cells (31Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells (32Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar), and UV-induced apoptosis in human primary neutrophils (33Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, the p42mapk/erk2 substrates involved in the survival responses are not known. Given the finding that CD120a itself is phosphorylated upon activation of p42mapk/erk2 (27Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32975-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we have investigated the influence of CD120a phosphorylation on TNFα-induced apoptosis. We report herein that the phosphorylation of CD120a by p42mapk/erk2 inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells through a Bcl-2-dependent mechanism. In contrast, the ability of the receptor to activate NF-κB is unaffected by phosphorylation. As we will show, these findings shed new light on how phosphorylation of CD120a may contribute to the regulation of the multiple functions of this death receptor. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl-xL (Ab 1690), goat polyclonal anti-CD120a (Ab 1069), anti-TRADD (Ab 1165), and mouse monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (Ab 7382) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The hamster monoclonal agonistic (Ab 80-4004-01) and antagonistic anti-CD120a (Ab 80-4005-01) antibodies and the monoclonal anti-CD120b antibody (Ab 80-4009-01) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-myc and anti-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Mouse monoclonal anti-caspase-8 (Ab 66231A) and anti-FADD (Ab 65751A) were from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was from Kodak-Scientific Imaging Systems (Rochester, NY). The mouse monoclonal phosphospecific anti-ERK antibody (E10) was from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The expression vector encoding CD120a has been described previously (27Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32975-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All deletion and point mutants were constructed using overlapping polymerase chain reaction (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) and verified by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequencing. The expression vectors for p42mapk/erk2 and MEK1.ca were a generous gift from Dr. Lynn Heasley, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. The vector expressing Bcl-xL was kindly provided by Dr. Hong Zhou, Boston, MA. The vector expressing Bcl-2 in pcDNA3 was a gift from Dr. Gary Johnson, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO. The vectors expressing myc-TRADD and FLAG-FADD were provided by Dr. Hong-Bing Shu, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Approximately 6 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 12-well plates containing 18-mm glass coverslips and grown in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with 250 ng of DNA the following day using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies). 14 h after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 15 min at room temperature in a solution containing 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 3% (w/v) sucrose in PBS (pH 7.5), washed again, and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were then washed, blocked for 30 min in Hank's balanced salt solution (without Mg2+, Ca2+, or phenol red, pH 7.2) containing 5% normal donkey serum and then incubated with the primary antibodies (1:100) in blocking solution for 2 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with Cy3- and/or fluorescein-conjugated donkey secondary antibodies (1:200). Staining for CD120a was performed using a primary hamster monoclonal antibody (1:200), and a Cy3-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-hamster IgG in blocking solution containing 5% normal goat serum. The coverslips were incubated overnight in PBS supplemented with 0.02% sodium azide and mounted in a solution containing 90% glycerol, 10% Tris-HCl 0.1m, pH 8.5, and 20 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine as an anti-fading agent. To visualize the nuclei, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 together with the secondary antibodies. Cells were observed with a Leica DMR/XA fluorescence microscope using a 100× plan objective. Digital images were captured using a SensiCam camera, deconvolved using the software Slidebook 2.6 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO) to remove fluorescence that was not in focus, and processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). HeLa cells grown on coverslips and transfected 18–24 h earlier with the appropriate expression vectors were washed with PBS, fixed and permeabilized as described above, and incubated with terminal transferase reaction solution containing fluorescein-conjugated dUTP for 1 h at 37 °C as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). The cells were washed three times with 0.03 m sodium citrate, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 m sodium chloride, to remove unbound nucleotides, then washed with PBS. Cells were then blocked and incubated with antibodies as above. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells among transfected cells was determined by counting at least 200 cells with a confocal microscope. 2 × 105 cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 500 ng of DNA using the LipofectAMINE reagent. 18 h after transfection, the cells were washed and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Post-nuclear supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Procaspase-8 was detected by Western blotting, and quantified by scanning densitometry using the IMAGE 1.6 software (National Institutes of Health). Activation of NF-κB was determined by a reporter gene assay. Briefly, 2.1 × 105 HEK293GT cells/well were seeded in 6-well cluster plates. The following day, the media were replaced 1 h prior to transfection with 0.5 μg/ml NF-κB-luciferase reporter gene plasmid and varying amounts of CD120a constructs using the calcium phosphate method as previously described (35Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The cells were then maintained for 18–24 h prior to stimulation in fresh media with 0.5 μg/ml agonist hamster anti-CD120a monoclonal antibody or an irrelevant IgG as control for 6 h prior to lysis and determination of luciferase activity (36Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 1.25 × 106 HEK293GT cells/well were seeded on 100-mm plates and grown in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected the following day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfected cells were lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Post-nuclear supernatants were precleared for 1 h with 25 μl of protein A/G+ beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 3 μg of monoclonal hamster anti-CD120a, or 3 μg of monoclonal hamster anti-CD120b or non-immune hamster antibody as controls. Immune complexes were precipitated with 50 μl of protein A/G+ beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer. The precipitates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and subsequent Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously (27Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32975-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Antisense DNA oligonucleotides with a phosphorothioate backbone were synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). The oligonucleotides were 3′-biotinylated to allow staining and to prevent them from interfering with the TUNEL assay. The 20-mer antisense oligonucleotide (2009) targeted against the coding region of thebcl-2 gene, and the scrambled-sequence oligonucleotide with a similar nucleotide content (sc48), were described previously (37Ziegler A. Luedke G.H. Fabbro D. Altmann K.H. Stahel R.A. Zangemeister-Wittke U. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A BLASTN search of the NCBI DNA data base revealed no homology of the oligonucleotides to other human genes. The sequences were as follows: antisense, 5′-AATCCTCCCCCAGTTCACCC-3′; scrambled, 5′-CTCATTCCTACCGACACCCC-3′. Oligonucleotides were transfected for 24 h using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies). Medium was changed 7 h after the transfection. Results shown for all experiments are representative of at least three separate experiments. Given the striking changes in the subcellular distribution of CD120a that result from its phosphorylation by p42mapk/erk2 (27Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32975-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of phosphorylation on receptor function and signaling, including CD120a-mediated apoptosis and NF-κB activation. To address this question, we used HeLa cells, because previous studies have shown these cells to undergo apoptosis through the endogenous receptor (38Miura M. Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8318-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and hence they express the necessary signaling pathways to mediate this response. In previous studies we induced receptor phosphorylation by co-transfection with constitutively active MEK1 and p42mapk/erk2. However, these kinases have been shown to affect the balance between apoptosis and survival (29Yeh J.H. Hsu S.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 31Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14560-14566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 32Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar) and thus the activation of p42mapk/erk2, per se, may affect the ability of CD120a to induce apoptosis in a CD120a phosphorylation-independent fashion in cells co-transfected with p42mapk/erk2 and MEK1.ca. Therefore, to address the role of phosphorylation of CD120a on TNFα-induced apoptosis in the absence of potential artifacts introduced by activated p42mapk/erk2, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding wild type CD120a and CD120a.4D/E, a mutant receptor that we have previously shown to mimic the phosphorylated receptor by being redistributed to the endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of p42mapk/erk2 (27Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32975-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 14 h later, the cells were stimulated with TNFα and cycloheximide (50 ng/ml and 10 μg/ml, respectively) for 4 h, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for CD120a under conditions that did not permit the detection of the endogenous receptor. Apoptotic cells were quantified on the basis of characteristic changes in the morphology of the nucleus stained with the Hoechst dye 33342 (Fig.1 a). As expected, transfection of wild type CD120a induced a robust increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells, both in the presence and in the absence of TNFα and cycloheximide. In contrast, transfection of the CD120a.4D/E mutant receptor completely abolished apoptosis as compared with that induced by the transfected wild type receptor. To confirm these results, apoptotic cells were also identified by TUNEL staining. Similar results were obtained when the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells among CD120a-transfected cells was quantified by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 b). In addition, the inability of the transfected CD120a.4D/E mutant to induce apoptosis was similar to that of CD120a.L351N, a receptor bearing a point mutation in the death domain known to abolish the apoptotic activity of the receptor (39Tartaglia L.A. Merrill Ayres T. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). In contrast, the CD120a.4A (T236A, S240A, S244A, S270A) mutant receptor, in which the four p42mapk/erk2 consensus sites had been mutated to Ala residues, did not protect the cells from the induction of apoptosis (data not shown). To further confirm the effect of phosphorylation of CD120a on the activation of the apoptotic process, transfected HeLa cells were lysed and equal amounts of proteins from post-nuclear lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting for procaspase-8 using an antibody that specifically recognizes uncleaved and inactive procaspase-8. As shown in Fig.1 c and as expected, expression of wild type CD120a induced the processing of procaspase-8 (as did TRADD, which was used as an alternative positive control). In contrast, expression of the CD120a.4D/E mutant receptor did not induce the processing of procaspase-8. To determine if the phosphorylation of CD120a simply rendered the receptor non-functional we investigated the effect of phosphorylation on the ability of CD120a to activate NF-κB using an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene assay. Three approaches were taken. First, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression constructs for wild type CD120a and CD120a.4D/E under conditions that led to constitutive activation of NF-κB as a result of receptor overexpression. As can be seen in Fig.2 a, transfection of equal amounts of both wild type CD120a and the phosphorylation mimic CD120a.4D/E led to approximately equivalent levels of NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression. Second, we expressed low levels of both receptors in HEK293 and specifically activated the transfected receptors by cross-linking with an agonistic hamster anti-mouse CD120a monoclonal antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 2 b, cross-linking of the transfected receptors also resulted in approximately equivalent increases in luciferase reporter gene activity, whereas a control hamster monoclonal antibody (anti-mouse CD120b) was without effect. Third, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with the NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct and equivalent amounts of either wild type CD120a, CD120a.4D/E, or empty vector (2.5 ng/ml) for 18 h prior to stimulation with mouse TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 6 h. As can be seen in Fig. 2 c, although transfection with the reporter gene and empty vector led to a low level of luciferase expression, transfection with wild type CD120a or CD120a.4D/E led to a similar increase in basal luciferase expression. However, stimulation with mouse TNFα resulted in a ligand-dependent increase in reporter gene expression that was equivalent for both receptors. Thus, although the induction of apoptotic activity was lost as a consequence of CD120a phosphorylation, the ability to activate NF-κB was preserved. Furthermore, specific ligation of the transfected receptors using both agonistic antibodies and TNFα resulted in the activation of NF-κB thus indicating that both the wild type and the phosphorylated receptors are available for signaling this response. Following the binding of TNFα to CD120a, the adapter molecule TRADD binds through its death domain to the death domain of CD120a (2Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

We found that Spo12p is imported into the nucleus by the karyopherin Kap121p. A complex containing Spo12p and Kap121p was isolated from cytosol and was also reconstituted with recombinant proteins, indicating that this interaction is direct. Spo12p was mislocalized to the cytosol inpse1–1, a temperature-sensitive strain harboring a mutation of Kap121p, at the permissive temperature, confirming an essential role for Kap121p in Spo12p import. Spo12p was also mislocalized in a pse1–1/pse1–1 homozygous strain, suggesting it is imported via the same pathway in diploid cells. Furthermore, we found that pse1–1/pse1–1 shows a sporulation defect similar to that ofspo12Δ/spo12Δ. In addition, we have characterized the Spo12p nuclear localization signal, mapped it to residues 76–130, and identified residues within this region that are important for nuclear localization signal function.

In addition to docking at the NPC, karyopherins bind cargo to be transported into and out of the nucleus (see Refs. 1Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar and 2Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar for a review). They recognize specific sequence elements in their cognate transport substrates that constitute the signal for import (nuclear localization sequence, or NLS) or export (nuclear export sequence, or NES). Kapβ1 needs an adapter (Kapα) in order to bind to most substrates. Kapα recognizes proteins containing a classical NLS (cNLS), which consists of one or two stretches of basic amino acid residues (3Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 4Conti E. Kuriyan J. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In yeast, there is one Kapα and 14 Kapβs (herein referred to as kaps). The kaps share a low but significant identity (about 20%), most striking at the amino terminus (1Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 2Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To date, all yeast kaps except Kap120p have been shown to function in import or in export. The involvement of a kap in both processes has recently been discovered (6Yoshida K. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and it remains to be elucidated whether more share the same ability. There are hundreds of yeast nuclear proteins or proteins with a nuclear life style, but only 14 kaps. This necessarily means that some kaps will be responsible for the transport of a large number of cargoes. Sequences of the NLSs that have been mapped so far do not resemble the cNLS or each other. Hence, the basis for kap/substrate specificity and the overall mechanism of substrate recognition by karyopherins remain to be further elucidated. Meiosis is one of the few differentiation pathways in yeast, and its regulation necessarily depends on the expression control of subsets of genes. Regulation of nuclear transport has been increasingly recognized as an important mechanism for the control of gene expression (see Ref.7Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar for a review). It is not known how most of the proteins involved in meiosis are transported into the nucleus to participate in its regulation. Spo12p was first identified as a protein whose absence causes sporulating diploid cells to skip one meiotic division, leading to the formation of two diploid spores (8Klapholz S. Esposito R.E. Genetics. 1980; 96: 567-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, its overexpression has been found to suppress a number of late mitotic mutants (9Jaspersen S.L. Charles J.F. Tinker-Kulberg R.L. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2803-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 10Aerne B.L. Johnson A.L. Toyn J.H. Johnston L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in exit from mitosis, cells in G2/M are over-represented in a spo12Δpopulation (11Parkes V. Johnston L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Spo12p is synthetically lethal with Dbf2p, a kinase required for events in anaphase/telophase and has been suggested by genetic studies to be an activator of Dbf2p and its relative Dbf20p (12Toyn J.H. Johnston L.H. Genetics. 1993; 135: 963-971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its biological function remains unknown, and its functional differences in mitosis and meiosis await further clarification. Spo12p has been shown to be nuclear in both haploid and diploid cells (13Grether M.E. Herskowitz I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3689-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we report that in haploid cells Spo12p is imported into the nucleus by Kap121p. Kap121p is a previously characterized karyopherin, first implicated in ribosomal protein import (14Rout M.P. Blobel G. Aitchison J.D. Cell. 1997; 89: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and mRNA export (15Seedorf M. Silver P.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8590-8595Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and later shown to be responsible for import of the transcription factors Pho4p and Pdr1p (16Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17Delahodde A. Pandjaitan R. Corral-Debrinski M. Jacq C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Evidence for import of Spo12p by Kap121p includes binding to Kap121p both in vivo and in vitro and mislocalization of Spo12p to the cytosol in pse1–1, a temperature-sensitive strain of Kap121p. We have also characterized the Spo12p NLS and identified residues within this region that are important for NLS function. Since Spo12p has a role in both mitosis and meiosis, we sought to determine whether the import pathway differs in diploid cells. In this case, we found that Spo12p was mislocalized in apse1–1/pse1–1 homozygous strain, indicating that it is imported using the same pathway in both haploid and diploid cells. The procedures for yeast manipulation were as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A diploid strain expressing Spo12p-Protein A (PrA) was obtained by integrative transformation of DF5 (19Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) with the coding sequence of four and a half IgG binding repeats of Staphylococcus aureus protein A immediately upstream of the SPO12 stop codon as described (20Titov A. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Haploid strains were obtained by sporulation and tetrad dissection.

After sporulation and tetrad dissection of pse1–1/KAP121, pse1–1 (mating type α) was obtained. A pse1–1/pse1–1 homozygous diploid strain was generated by mating pse1–1 with pse1–1(α). The entire coding region of SPO12 was PCR-amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and inserted into pYX242-GFP (26Rosenblum J.S. Pemberton L.F. Bonifaci N. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using primer-encoded EcoRI andHindIII sites to generate an in-frame fusion with the green fluorescent protein (GFP), pSpo12-GFP. pSpo12-GFP derivatives pSpo121–143-GFP, pSpo121–90-GFP, pSpo1276–173-GFP, pSpo1291–173-GFP, pSpo12116–173-GFP, pSpo1276–143-GFP, pSpo1276–130-GFP, pSpo1276–115-GFP, and pSpo1291–130-GFP were generated similarly. A PCR fragment containing a deletion of amino acids 76–130 of Spo12p (Δ76–130) was created by the overlap extension method and cloned into pYX242-GFP as described above to generate pSpo12Δ76–130-GFP. Alanine-scanning mutants in the region 76–130 in pSpo12-GFP were generated by the same method. Oligonucleotides that sequentially introduced five alanine codons in place of wild-type sequences were used. Detailed information on plasmid construction is available upon request. Yeast strains were transformed with plasmids via the lithium acetate method or electroporation (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Spo12p fragments 1–173, 76–130, and Δ76–130 were PCR-amplified from pSpo12-GFP, pSpo1276–130-GFP, and pSpo12Δ76–130-GFP, and ligated into the bacterial expression vector pGEX4TTev (27Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) using primer-encodedEcoRI and SalI sites, resulting in N-terminal fusions with GST. All constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. hLa-GFP and Lhp1-GFP (26Rosenblum J.S. Pemberton L.F. Bonifaci N. Blobel G. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1813-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were described previously. XL1-blue and BL21 gold (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used for general cloning and expression purposes. Bacterial strains were transformed by heat shock. Post-nuclear, post-ribosomal cytosol was prepared from a strain expressing Spo12p-PrA grown to an A600 of 1.8 as described (23Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Spo12p-PrA-interacting proteins were immunoisolated by overnight incubation of cytosol with IgG-Sepharose at 4 °C. After washing with transport buffer (TB: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20), proteins were eluted with a step gradient of MgCl2 and concentrated using methanol-chloroform precipitation prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and proteins of interest were excised, digested, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) (29Gharahdaghi F. Kirchner M. Fernandez J. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Gels were also transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotting procedures and subsequent ECL detection were as described (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7 in Luria Broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 20 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors (Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche). After sonication, cell debris was pelleted at 15,000 rpm for 15 min and the cleared supernatant incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 20 min at room temperature. Beads were washed with NETN and proteins eluted with glutathione. In the case of Kap121p and Kap114p, beads were washed and resuspended in TB containing 0.1 m CaCl2 and, respectively, 5 units of thrombin or 10 units of factor Xa protease. Cleavage proceeded overnight at 4 °C. Thrombin was deactivated by addition of 5 units of hirudin. All proteins were quantified by the Bradford method. 2 μg of purified recombinant GST and GST-Spo12p were immobilized on 25 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose equilibrated in TB by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, Sepharose was incubated with 2 μg of Kap121p or Kap114p for 30 min in TB containing 3 mm EGTA and protease inhibitors. The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of TB, and bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Binding assays using GST, GST-Spo12p, GST-Spo12p76–130, and GST-Spo12pΔ76–130 were performed similarly. GFP was visualized after overnight growth of yeast strains in medium or on agar selective for the respective plasmid. 5 μl of culture or one colony resuspended in 5 μl of water was placed on a slide. All images were viewed with a 63× oil objective on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Images were collected with a Hamamatsu video imaging system, using Openlab software, and transferred to Adobe Photoshop. Spo12p was previously localized to the nucleus (13Grether M.E. Herskowitz I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3689-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Kap proteins involved in import form stable complexes with their substrates in the cytosol, prior to their import into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, specific factors disrupt the complex, leading to the deposition of the cargo and the recycling of the empty kap to the cytosol for another round of import. To determine which karyopherins play a role in Spo12p import, we isolated proteins interacting with the cytosolic pool of Spo12p. To do so, we first genomically tagged the Spo12p C terminus in frame with the IgG binding domain of S. aureus PrA. This resulted in the endogenous expression of Spo12p-PrA from the SPO12 promoter. We then prepared a post-nuclear, post-ribosomal cytosolic fraction of this strain. After incubation with IgG-Sepharose, bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient of MgCl2. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The results of a typical experiment are shown in Fig.1 A. Spo12p-PrA, by virtue of the high affinity of PrA to IgG, is expected to elute only with high salt concentrations. Although a band of the expected size of Spo12-PrA is evident throughout the elution (indicated by an asteriskin Fig. 1 A), immunoblot analysis indicated that Spo12-PrA eluted only in the expected fractions (Fig. 1 B). A fortuitously comigrating band eluted at lower MgCl2concentrations. A protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼116 kDa consistently eluted in the 0.1–1 m fractions, the typical range of MgCl2 concentrations needed to disrupt the kap/cargo complex (Fig. 1 A). The band was excised, digested with trypsin, and resulting peptides submitted to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. 27 peaks of a total of 29 were consistent with the mass of peptides resulting from the theoretical digest of Kap121p. The amount of isolated Kap121p appears to be in excess of Spo12p-PrA. However, since this is a semiquantitative assay, we cannot comment on the complex stoichiometry. Some proteins have decreased solubility in high concentrations of MgCl2, which results in a lack of correlation between the amount of isolated proteins and the amount visible on the gel. We also sought to determine what fraction of cytosolic Kap121p was associated with Spo12p. After isolation of Spo12p-PrA in the manner described above, fractions were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis with a Kap121p antibody show that the majority of Kap121p present in the cytosol remains in the unbound fraction and is not, therefore, associated with Spo12p (Fig.1 C). Since the Spo12p/Kap121p complex was isolated from cytosol, it is possible that this interaction is bridged by another protein. Therefore, we investigated whether the interaction between Spo12p and Kap121p is direct. IgG-Sepharose-bound Spo12p-PrA purified from yeast cytosol was incubated with purified recombinant GST-Kap121p, washed, and bound proteins eluted with sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, we detected binding of GST-Kap121p in addition to the endogenous Kap121p (data not shown). We next immobilized bacterially expressed GST and GST-Spo12p on glutathione-Sepharose and then incubated with recombinant Kap121p or Kap114p, which was used as a control. The resin was washed, bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. As seen in Fig.2, we found that Kap121p bound to GST-Spo12p. We did not detect either kap bound to GST alone, while only a small quantity of Kap114p bound to GST-Spo12p relative to Kap121p. We conclude that Spo12p and Kap121p interact directly. To determine the role of Kap121p in Spo12p nuclear import, we examined the localization of Spo12p fused to GFP in vivo. In an initial attempt, the fusion was expressed under the control of the SPO12natural promoter from a low copy number (CEN) plasmid, but no fluorescence was observed (data not shown). We then constructed a plasmid to overexpress Spo12p fused to GFP from a high copy number (2μ) plasmid, which was found to be nuclear in wild-type cells andkap114Δ (Fig. 3), as well askap120Δ, kap119Δ, kap122Δ,kap142Δ, kap104Δ, kap123Δ,kap111Δ, and kap108Δ (not shown). In contrast, significant mislocalization to the cytoplasm was observed inpse1–1, a temperature-sensitive strain bearing a mutation in Kap121p, at the permissive temperature (Fig. 3). Human La andS. cerevisiae Lhp1p (also known as Yla1p), which are imported via the Kap95p and Kap108p pathways, respectively (26Rosenblum J.S. Pemberton L.F. Bonifaci N. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), were correctly targeted to the nucleus in pse1–1, showing that other import pathways were not affected in this strain (data not shown). We investigated whether Kap121p is also responsible for Spo12p import into the nucleus of diploid cells. We found that Spo12p accumulated in the nucleus of a wild-type diploid strain and was slightly mislocalized in apse1–1/KAP121 heterozygous strain (Fig.4). However, significant mislocalization to the cytoplasm was observed in a pse1–1/pse1–1homozygous strain (Fig. 4), suggesting the import pathway is the same in both haploid and diploid cells. We next investigated whether pse1–1/pse1–1 exhibits a sporulation phenotype similar to that ofspo12Δ/spo12Δ. We found that, among the cells that had sporulated, the number of asci containing two spores was at least 3 times greater in pse1–1/pse1–1 than in wild-type cells (Table I).Table IPercentage of asci with two sporesColonyWild-typepse1–1/pse1–1A10.432.4B530C8.642.2D9.526Average9.5 ± 0.929.5 ± 3.2Approximately 100 asci in each of four different colonies were counted for each strain. The outstanding values (underscored) were ignored and the remaining three averaged. Open table in a new tab Approximately 100 asci in each of four different colonies were counted for each strain. The outstanding values (underscored) were ignored and the remaining three averaged. In order to identify regions in Spo12p that are necessary for import, we constructed several deletion mutants of Spo12p in frame with GFP and analyzed their localization in vivo (Fig. 5 A). We found the region containing amino acids 76–130 to be both necessary (Spo12pΔ76–130-GFP) and sufficient (Spo12p76–130-GFP) for import into the nucleus (Fig.5 B). However, we detected some mislocalization of Spo12p76–130-GFP to the cytoplasm. This was decreased or abolished when larger constructs were used (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that larger domains might stabilize the kap/substrate interaction, leading to higher transport efficiency. The fusion Spo12p76–130-GFP is mislocalized to the cytosol in pse1–1 (Fig. 5 B), indicating that it is targeted to the nucleus in a Kap121p-dependent manner. To further address this point, we determined whether this region was also necessary and sufficient for direct interaction with Kap121p. Purified recombinant GST, GST-Spo12p, GST-Spo12p76–130, and GST-Spo12pΔ76–130 were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated with purified recombinant Kap121p. After washing, bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.6). GST-Spo12p76–130 was purified as a doublet. The doublet was observed even in whole cell extracts, after detection of the GST tag by Western blot (data not shown), suggesting that this protein contains a protease sensitive site. Note that there was binding of Kap121p observed to this fusion and not to GST-Spo12pΔ76–130, even though there was more GST-Spo12pΔ76–130 than GST-Spo12p76–130 or even GST-Spo12p. In order to more clearly define which residues of Spo12p76–130 contribute to NLS function, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis by sequentially substituting stretches of 5 residues in this region with alanine. These mutants were expressed in frame with GFP, and their localization assessed in living cells (Fig.7 A). As shown in Fig.7 B, we found that mutation of residues 91–95 (LVKKT) to alanine leads to significant mislocalization to the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, the localization of the other mutants was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type protein (Fig.7 A). We present evidence that Kap121p is the kap used for import of Spo12p. Kap121p was first described as a karyopherin whose overexpression was able to substitute for Kap123p in the import of the ribosomal protein L25 NLS (14Rout M.P. Blobel G. Aitchison J.D. Cell. 1997; 89: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Later, also suggesting an overlapping pathway with Kap123p, mRNA export was shown to be defective in apse1–1/kap123Δ double mutant but notkap123Δ or pse1–1 (15Seedorf M. Silver P.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8590-8595Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the observed defect may be indirect. It may be that deficient import of a protein involved in mRNA export inpse1–1/kap123Δ would result in the observed phenotype. More recently, Kap121p was shown to import transcription factor Pho4p under phosphate starvation conditions. This role was not dependent on Kap123p, since Pho4p did not interact with Kap123p nor was it mislocalized in kap123Δ (16Kaffman A. Rank N.M. O'Shea E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This was the first time Kap121p and Kap123p were attributed separate functions. While this report was under revision, Kap121p was shown to be responsible for import of transcription factor Pdr1p (17Delahodde A. Pandjaitan R. Corral-Debrinski M. Jacq C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have shown that Spo12p is imported by Kap121p. We have coimmunoisolated the two proteins from yeast cytosol and reconstituted this complex with recombinant proteins, which indicates this interaction is direct. Spo12p is mislocalized in pse1–1, but not in any of the other kap mutant strains tested (includingkap123Δ) supporting a primary role for Kap121p in Spo12p import. The fact that some nuclear accumulation of Spo12p was still observed in pse1–1 remains to be clarified. One hypothesis is that since almost 50% of Kap121p remains in this strain at the permissive temperature (15Seedorf M. Silver P.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8590-8595Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the Kap121p still present is sufficient for import of some of the Spo12p-GFP fusion. In fact, when we studied Spo12p localization in diploid cells, a slight accumulation of the fusion in the cytosol of pse1–1/PSY581 was observed, whereas there was none in wild-type cells and comparable levels inpse1–1/pse1–1 and haploid pse1–1. This seems to suggest a connection between the amount of Kap121p and the extent of Spo12p nuclear accumulation, consistent with this hypothesis. There is also the possibility that another karyopherin imports Spo12p in this strain. It has been suggested that some kaps can compensate for the absence of others, suggesting they can function in overlapping pathways and that family members have redundant functions (14Rout M.P. Blobel G. Aitchison J.D. Cell. 1997; 89: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 21Pemberton L.F. Rosenblum J.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since Kap121p is essential, a complex of Spo12p with another kap in the absence of Kap121p could not be identified in vivo. Spo12p absence in sporulating diploid cells results in the formation of dyads (a rather unique characteristic). We found that diminished activity of Kap121p in sporulating diploid cells leads to an increased number of asci containing two spores. This observation is consistent with deficient import of Spo12p in pse1–1/pse1–1; nonetheless, we cannot claim it is directly related. Kap121p associates with a large number of proteins in the cytosol (data not shown). These proteins might constitute additional substrates. Identification of these substrates should provide more insight into Kap121p's distinctive cellular roles and why it is essential for viability. Kap121p might be responsible for import of essential substrates or constitute a backup pathway in the import of a large number of proteins, and thus be vital in compensating for the loss or malfunction of other kaps (for example, see Ref. 21Pemberton L.F. Rosenblum J.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We have characterized the Spo12p NLS and determined that the region containing residues 76–130 is both necessary and sufficient for import and for direct binding to Kap121p. When we attempted to determine which residues were important for NLS function by alanine scan mutagenesis, we only identified 1 group (out of 11 generated) of five residues, which, if mutated, led to mislocalization of Spo12p to the cytoplasm (91LVKKT95). One explanation for this observation is that many residues throughout the entire NLS interact with Kap121p. Since the mapped NLS is large, it could be that mutation of five residues to alanine was not sufficient in order to observe a phenotype. On the other hand, the fact that we could not obtain a shorter deletion mutant with nuclear accumulation could mean that a large domain of the protein is needed in order to provide the proper structure necessary for interaction with Kap121p. This study emphasizes the caution one must use while performing NLS analysis. The need for a large domain to confer complete nuclear accumulation has been reported previously. For instance, the region containing residues 112–224 of Lhp1p confers Kap108-dependent import. However, some cytoplasmic signal is observed, in contrast with the full-length protein (26Rosenblum J.S. Pemberton L.F. Bonifaci N. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, residues 283–414 of Npl3p are necessary and sufficient for import and binding to its import receptor, Kap111p. Again, more accumulation in the cytoplasm is observed in comparison with the full-length protein (30Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The Spo12p NLS is located between residues 76 and 130, but only a structural analysis will fully elucidate which residues are required for interaction with Kap121p and thus constitute the actual/minimal NLS. It is, nonetheless, clear that it is different from the cNLS. It is larger, and even though there are some stretches of basic residues in the mapped NLS, these are not sufficient for nuclear accumulation, nor does mutation of these residues lead to mislocalization. Although a large number of proteins have predicted cNLSs, it should not be assumed that they will be imported via the Kapα/β heterodimer. The mapped Spo12p NLS and the Pho4p NLS do not bear any noticeable resemblance, so a pattern of substrate recognition by Kap121p could not be derived. The Rpl25p and the Pdr1p NLSs were not shown to bind Kap121p directly; nonetheless, they also do not reveal any sequence similarities. NLS mapping of additional substrates might reveal a pattern of recognition by Kap121p. As is the case for Kap121p, other kaps likely recognize numerous dissimilar NLSs. It is, however, probable that only after structures of a large number of kap/substrate complexes are known might we start to better understand nature's solution to this daunting molecular recognition problem.

Early in biosynthesis, Ii associates with MHCII molecules and directs their intracellular transport to endocytic compartments where vesicular proteinases sequentially release Ii from the MHCII heterodimer. The detachment of Ii makes the MHCII groove susceptible for binding of antigenic peptides. We investigated the role of N-linked glycosylation in the controlled intracellular degradation of Ii. Motifs for asparagine-linked glycosylation were altered, and mutated Ii (IiNmut) was transiently expressed in COS cells. The half-life of IiNmut was strongly reduced compared with wild-type Ii although the sensitivity of the N glycan-free polypeptide to in vitro proteinase digestion was not substantially increased. Inhibition of vesicular proteinases revealed endosomal degradation of IiNmut. Intracellular proteolysis of IiNmut is substantially impaired by serine proteinase inhibitors. Thus, a considerable amount of IiNmut is degraded in nonacidic intracellular compartments. The data suggest that N-linked glycosylation of Ii hinders premature proteolysis in nonacidic vesicles resulting in Ii degradation in acidic MHC class II-processing compartments.

MHC class II (MHCII)1antigen presentation to CD4 T cells is a prerequisite for an antibody response against T cell-dependent antigens. In addition to Th2 cells, which help B cells to produce Ab, MHCII molecules activate Th1 cells that play a role in the cellular immune response. To achieve their function as peptide receptors, MHCII molecules undergo several stages of maturation (1Busch R. Doebele R.C. Patil N.S. Pashine A. Mellins E.D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Early in biosynthesis, MHCII heterodimers assemble in the ER with an invariant chain (Ii) trimer to form a nonameric complex (2Roche P.A. Marks M.S. Cresswell P. Nature. 1991; 354: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Ii binds to the peptide binding groove of MHCII dimers and prevents premature binding of unfolded polypeptides that are available from biosynthesis of soluble and membrane proteins in the ER (3Busch R. Cloutier I. Sekaly R.P. Hammerling G.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Hitzel C. van Endert P. Koch N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1048-1056PubMed Google Scholar). Ii promotes folding of MHCII dimers and rescues them from aggregation (5Anderson M.S. Miller J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2282-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6Germain R.N. Rinker A.G.J. Nature. 1993; 363: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The trimer of Ii contains a cytoplasmic sorting signal that directs transport of the MHCII/Ii complex from the secretory pathway to the endocytic route (7Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar,8Arneson L.S. Miller J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In endocytic vesicles, Ii is degraded, and the MHCII groove becomes able to bind antigenic peptides that are generated from internalized antigen on route to lysosomal degradation (9Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Dobberstein B. Ploegh H.L. Pieters J. Nature. 1994; 369: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 10Amigorena S. Drake J.R. Webster P. Mellman I.

Med. 1995; 181: 1729-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The regulated cleavage of Ii is accomplished when a set of peptides from Ii (CLIP; class II-associated Ii peptides) is produced, which remain bound to MHCII molecules. This peptide is displaced from mouse Ia haplotypes (murine MHCII) with a low off-rate for CLIP with the catalytic assistance of H2-M (12Wolf P.R. Tourne S. Miyazaki T. Benoist C. Mathis D. Ploegh H.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2605-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ii plays multiple roles in the MHCII-processing pathway. A dissection of certain segments revealed that functional domains of Ii could be grouped to sequences encoded by relatively short exons of theIi gene (13Koch N. Lauer W. Habicht J. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1677-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Exon 1 encodes the sorting sequence of Ii that is based on a Leu-Ile motif responsible for interaction with cytoplasmic components (14Bremnes T. Lauvrak V. Lindqvist B. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8638-8645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The stretch of Ii that spans the cell membrane is encoded by exon 2. This sequence contains a noncleavable leader sequence, which is important for insertion of Ii, as a type II transmembrane protein into the ER membrane (15Singer P.A. Lauer W. Dembic Z. Mayer W.E. Lipp J. Koch N. Hammerling G. Klein J. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A luminal part of Ii encoded by exon 3 interacts with MHCII dimers (16Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Koch N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9703-9706Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Within this segment, the residues amino acids 91–99 of human Ii associate with the polymorphic peptide binding groove of MHCII molecules (17Ghosh P. Amaya M. Mellins E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1995; 378: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). This interaction is stabilized by residues 81–87 (18Stumptner P. Benaroch P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5807-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and mediates promiscuous binding of Ii to the various MHCII allo- and isotypes (19Siebenkotten I.M. Carstens C. Koch N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3355-3362PubMed Google Scholar). Beyond the MHCII binding site of Ii follows the trimerization sequence (20Bertolino P. Staschewski M. Trescol Biemont M.C. Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Chretien I. Forquet F. Gerlier D. Rabourdin Combe C. Koch N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5620-5629PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jasanoff A. Wagner G. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6812-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Bijlmakers M.J. Benaroch P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A sequence between the MHCII binding site and the trimerization domain of Ii contains two N-linked glycosylation motifs. These two N-glycan binding sequences are conserved in the sequence of homologous forms of Ii, found in human, mouse, rat, and cattle. A sequence C-terminal to theN-linked glycosylation sites of Ii interacts with the ribosome-associated membrane protein 4, which plays a role in the ER translocation machinery. It was speculated that this interaction controls glycosylation of Ii and may contribute to the efficiency of antigen processing (23Schroder K. Martoglio B. Hofmann M. Holscher C. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4804-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The role of N-linked glycosylation of Ii is not completely understood. The proximity of the carbohydrates to other functional domains suggests that the glycans may control degradation of Ii and be important for the function of MHCII molecules. It is possible that glycosylation of Ii regulates the stepwise degradation of Ii, which is critical for binding of antigenic peptide to the MHCII groove. Inhibition of initial glycosylation by tunicamycin treatment alters the cellular degradation pathway by up-regulating ER-associated proteolysis. To avoid aberrant proteolysis by inhibition of glycosylation, we mutated the two N-linked glycosylation sites of Ii that are at the junction of the MHCII groove binding segment and the trimerization domain. Inhibition of various vesicular proteinases was conducted and intracellular degradation of the mutated invariant chain was assessed. The results suggest that the carbohydrates of Ii prevent proteolysis of Ii by proteinases that are active at neutral conditions. Protection by carbohydrates against premature digestion may facilitate degradation of Ii in acidic-processing compartments only and thus after release of CLIP antigenic peptides bind to the MHCII cleft. In 1 is a rat mAb directed against the N terminus of murine Ii (24Koch N. Koch S. Hammerling G.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 644-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). MAR18.5 is directed against mouse kappa and was used as a sandwich mAb to bind In1 to protein A-Sepharose. The mAb Bu45 is directed against a C-terminal domain of human Ii (25Wraight C.J. van Endert P. Moller P. Lipp J. Ling N.R. MacLennan I.C. Koch N. Moldenhauer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5787-5792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chloroquine, leupeptin, pepstatin A, brefeldin A, lactacystin, cathepsin B, cathepsin D, and TLCK was supplied by CalBiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). E64d was purchased from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany) and Pefabloc (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-fluoride-hydrochloride) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany). Horseradish-peroxidase coupled Abs and ECL Western blotting detection reagent were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Concanamycin B was a kind gift from Dr. J. Villadangos, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne. Cross-linking of oligomerized Ii was performed by using the chemical cross-linker dithiobis-succinimidyl-propionate (DSP). Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4 containing proteinase inhibitors and 2 mm iodoacetamide to quench intracellular reducing agents. Lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 40 min). DSP was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the lysates in concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 mm. After an incubation period of 1 h on ice, 50 mm glycine, pH 7, was added, and incubation was continued on ice for 1 h. Subsequently the samples were analyzed by Western blotting. The Ii cDNA was mutated as described earlier (26Brosterhus H. Post-translational Modifications of the MHC Class II-associated Invariant Chain , Thesis. Universität Bonn, Germany1994Google Scholar). A phosphorylated oligonucleotide (AAGAACGTTAACAAGTACGGCAGCATGACCCAG) containing the mutation of the twoN-linked glycosylation sites of Ii was hybridized to the Ii plasmid (Ii cDNA cloned into the polylinker region of pUC18). This oligonucleotide contains an unique HpaI site. A second oligonucleotide (AGGATCGCCGGGTAC) that hybridizes to the plasmid sequence deletes a BamHI site. After transformation, mutant clones were selected by restriction digest of the nonmutated plasmid byBamHI. Mutated clones were identified by HpaI restriction digest. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated murine Ii cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of the expression vector pcEX-V3 (27Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), and the Ii protein product of the plasmid in which asparagine-linked glycosylation sites were mutated was designated IiNmut. For metabolic labeling, 5 × 106 transfected cells were cultured for 45 min in methionine-free RPMI 1640, followed by a 20-min pulse with 50 μCi [35S]methionine. In some experiments, the cells were recultured in medium containing 150 μg/ml cold methionine for the indicated times. YOK-1 human B lymphoma cells were incubated for 12 h in 10 μg/ml of tunicamycin. Subsequently, cells were biotinylated by a standard protocol. In brief, cells were suspended in 1 ml of biotinylation buffer (50 mm boric acid, 150 mm NaCl), 10 μl (10 mg/ml in H2O) of sulfosuccinimidyl-6′-biotinamido-6-hexanamidohexanoate were added and incubated for 15 min. Reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 100 mm NH4Cl. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, and lysates were precleared by ultracentrifugation (100,000 ×g for 40 min) and by precipitation with CL4B-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose and 50 μl of 20-fold-concentrated hybridoma supernatant. The protein A-bound material was washed several times with 0.25% Nonidet P-40/TBS containing proteinase inhibitors and was subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, cell lysates were prepared as described above, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk and subsequently probed with the indicated primary antibody. Detection of nitrocellulose-bound primary Ab was performed with horseradish-peroxidase-coupled secondary Ab followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Ii and IiNmut were proteolytically digested in vitro by cathepsins B and D. For this purpose, Ii and IiNmut were isolated from metabolically-labeled cells by immunoprecipitation but were not yet dissociated from the beads. Cathepsins were diluted in citric acid buffer (40 mm, pH 5). 15 μl of each proteinase dilution was added to the Sepharose-bound proteins. For activation of the cysteine proteinase, 5 mml-cysteine and 1 mmdithiothreitol were added. After 1-h incubation at 37 °C with gentle agitation, 2 μl of Tris/HCl (2 m, pH7.5) and 17 μl of reducing sample buffer were added, and immediately the samples were boiled to stop the digestion. Samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Brefeldin A, dissolved in ethanol, was added to cells to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. A solution of lactacystin in Me2SO was added to transfected cells to a final concentration of 5, 7.5, and 10 μm. Cells were preincubated with 250 μm chloroquine. Concanamycin B (stock in ethanol), Pefabloc (stock in phosphate-buffered saline), and TLCK (stock in 0.05 m 3-morpholino-ethansulfonic acid, pH 5.5) were present 12 h before labeling at concentrations of 20 nm, 0.5 mm, and 100 μm. TLCK (100 μm) was additionally added before biosynthetic labeling. The inhibitors E64d and pepstatin A were dissolved in Me2SO (final concentration 200 μm and 1 μg/ml) and added 12 h before labeling to COS7 cells. All inhibitors were present during labeling and pulse-chase periods. The sequence of the Ii31 isoform contains twoN-linked glycosylation sites in positions 113 and 119 (Fig.1 A). Functional domains of Ii flank the two carbohydrates. C-terminal to the second carbohydrate adjoins a trimerization domain of Ii that is essential for assembly of the functional nonameric MHCII/Ii complex. The binding sequence of Ii to the MHCII groove is adjacent to the first N-bound carbohydrate toward the N terminus. A release of Ii from associated MHCII molecules, which is important for activation of the MHCII heterodimer is initiated by proteolytic cleavage at Met103or nearby residues of Ii. The vicinity of the cleavage site to the position of the N-bound oligosaccharides (amino acids 113 and 119) could be important for control of proteolytic cleavage of Ii. We introduced point mutations into the glycosylation motifs and changed Thr115 to Asn and Asn119 to Ser (Fig.1 A). In the targeted sequence the Asn113 residue is retained, which could be of importance for cleavage of the mutated Ii by asparagine-specific endopeptidases (28Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The structural integrity of IiNmut was confirmed. Chemical cross-linking of IiNmut from cell lysates revealed that the mutated polypeptide forms trimers demonstrated for N-glycosylated Ii (29Gedde Dahl M. Freisewinkel I. Staschewski M. Schenck K. Koch N. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8281-8287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Lysates of Ii or IiNmut transfected COS7 cells were cross-linked with dithiobis-succinimidyl-propionate and the covalently linked protein complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE. Subsequently Ii oligomers were detected by Western blotting with mAb In1. With increasing cross-linker concentrations, dimeric and trimeric forms of Ii and of IiNmut are detected whereas the monomeric Ii declines (Fig.1 B). The difference in size of IiNmut and of Ii is caused by Asn-linked glycans, which can be demonstrated by inhibition with tunicamycin (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of cotransfected MHCII molecules showed association of IiNmut with MHCII heterodimers (data not shown). This result is consistent with experiments with Ii deletions and with Ii from tunicamycin treated cells that both lack the two N-linked carbohydrates. In these studies it was shown that deglycosylated Ii associates with MHCII molecules (20Bertolino P. Staschewski M. Trescol Biemont M.C. Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Chretien I. Forquet F. Gerlier D. Rabourdin Combe C. Koch N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5620-5629PubMed Google Scholar, 30Romagnoli P. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that structures of Ii important for trimerization and for association to MHCII heterodimers are maintained in IiNmut and suggest that the glycans are not required for the formation of functional Ii. The glycosylation mutant IiNmut was used to explore Ii degradation pathways and to characterize proteinases against whose action the carbohydrates may protect the Ii polypeptide. It was possible that the lack of the two N-linked oligosaccharides in IiNmut affects its intracellular degradation. We investigated whether cellular degradation of IiNmut deviates from that of wild-type Ii. Ii- and IiNmut-expressing cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min with [35S]methionine and subsequently chased for up to 5 h. We analyzed for Ii decay by SDS-PAGE separation of immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2). Densitometric scans of these bands are displayed in Fig. 2(below). Wild-type Ii has a cellular half-life that exceeds that of IiNmut by at least five times. Mean half-lives were calculated from four experiments yielding t 12 IiNmut = 35 min (S = 12 min) and t 12 Ii = 162 min (S = 16 min). Enhanced rates of degradation of non-N-glycosylated Ii had also been demonstrated by Romagnoli and Germain (30Romagnoli P. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). They found that in tunicamycin-treated cells after a 5-min pulse labeling and 15 min of chase, 60% of the initially labeled pool of nonglycosylated Ii remained detectable. This is shorter then the cellular half-life that we determined for IiNmut, which could indicate up-regulated ER-associated proteolysis in tunicamycin-treated cells. The rapid cellular degradation of IiNmut suggests that glycosylation of Ii prevents premature degradation. It is possible that the lack of carbohydrate site chains makes the mutant more susceptible for proteolytic degradation. We employed a cysteine and an aspartate proteinase, cathepsins B and D that play a role in antigen presentation. The sensitivity of IiNmut compared with wild-type Ii was assayed by in vitro digestion with cathepsin B or D (Fig. 3). With increasing units of cathepsins B and D a complete digest of Ii and of IiNmut was achieved. Comparison of dose-dependent degradation of Ii and of nonglycosylated Ii however did not indicate an abundantly increased sensitivity of IiNmut to cathepsin B or D digest that would explain the observed difference of half-life in living cells. Thus, we conclude that the lower half-life of IiNmut is not because of an increased sensitivity against proteinase digestion. We studied a potential ER-associated degradation of IiNmut. This possibility was first addressed by blocking export of newly synthesized proteins out of the ER. Cells were treated with brefeldin A for 5 h and subsequently labeled in the presence of the inhibitor with [35S]methionine. Fig.4 A illustrates a SDS-PAGE separation of Ii immunoprecipitates. Over a chase time of 4 h neither wild-type Ii with high mannose Asp-linked glycans nor mutant Ii were significantly degraded in brefeldin A-treated cells. This result suggests that in untreated cells, IiNmut is degraded after leaving the ER. In addition, we tested cytoplasmic degradation by proteasomes upon a potential translocation of Ii to the cytosol (Fig.4 B). Cells were incubated with increasing amounts of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Subsequently cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min with [35S]methionine and chased for 2 h. Without inhibition, at 2-h chase, Ii is partially degraded whereas IiNmut disappeared almost completely. Inhibition of proteasome activity by lactacystin did not abolish the decline of Ii independent of its glycosylation. From these data we conclude that IiNmut degradation is not ER-associated. Ii was previously detected on the cell surface (CD74) of human B lymphoma cells (31Koch N. Moldenhauer G. Hofmann W.J. Moller P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2643-2651PubMed Google Scholar). If non-N-glycosylated Ii is found on the cell surface this would indicate export from the ER to the cell membrane. We treated the human B lymphoma cell line JOK-1 for 12 h with tunicamycin and subsequently labeled the cell surface with biotin. Cells were lysed, and Ii was immunoprecipitated with mAb Bu45. Surface biotinylated Ii was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4 C). Both non-N-glycosylated and fully glycosylated surface Ii were stained by a streptavidin-peroxidase-mediated reaction. This result was confirmed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting staining of tunicamycin and untreated JOK-1 cells with mAb Bu45 (not shown). Surface expression of non-N-glycosylated Ii may suggest that after internalization N-glycan-free, Ii is degraded in endosomal/lysosomal vesicles. Various reagents with impact on endosomal transport, acidic pH, or proteolytic activity had been used to block degradation of Ii (32Villadangos J.A. Bryant R.A. Deussing J. Driessen C. D.umenil A.M. Riese R.J. Roth W. Saftig P. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Peters C. Ploegh H.L. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We used chloroquine that elevates the pH in endosomes and inhibits proteinase activity. As shown in Fig.5 A (right) treatment of cells with 250 μm of chloroquine almost completely arrests degradation of Ii, indicating that the enzymes involved in Ii proteolysis are pH sensitive. Inhibition of IiNmut degradation by chloroquine (Fig. 5 A, left) indicates endosomal degradation, and this was further investigated with additional proteinase inhibitors. The different proportion of inhibition of Ii and IiNmut degradation that was observed after chloroquine treatment may suggest that proteinases are involved in the decay of the mutated Ii that are hindered by the carbohydrates in degradation of wild-type Ii. It has been reported that cleavage of Ii is initiated by aspartate proteinases whereas subsequent release of Ii from MHCII depends on cysteine proteinases (33Maric M.A. Taylor M.D. Blum J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We utilized pepstatin A and E64d as asparagine and cysteine proteinase inhibitors, respectively. The impact of these inhibitors on Ii and on IiNmut degradation after various times of labeling with [35S]methionine is shown in Fig. 5,B and C. Pepstatin A (Fig. 5 B) and E64d (Fig. 5 C), both strongly impede degradation of Ii, demonstrating a role of aspartate and of cysteine proteinases in Ii degradation. Both inhibitors impair the decay of IiNmut, although to a lower degree than of wild-type Ii. In the presence of inhibitors the half-life of IiNmut is substantially shorter than that of wild-type Ii. It is interesting to note, that the aspartate proteinase inhibitor pepstatin A only doubles the half-life of IiNmut. This result may suggest unlike the initial cleavage of Ii, which involves aspartate proteinases, other proteinases account for degradation of IiNmut. We explored the impact of concanamycin B, an antibiotic that highly selectively inhibits vacuolar H+-ATPase, on degradation of IiNmut. Concanamycin B raises the pH in endosomal/lysosomal compartments, thus interrupting the early endosomal/late endosomal/lysosomal transition (34Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 Dillustrates inhibition of Ii degradation by concanamycin B. Cellular degradation of Ii is almost completely blocked by concanamycin B, greatly exceeding the efficacy of chloroquine. In the presence of concanamycin B, IiNmut is stabilized to a half-life of about 200 min. Inhibition of the decline of IiNmut by several inhibitors of acidic endosomal proteinases indicates a vesicular degradation in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. The incomplete block of acidic proteolysis (Fig. 5, A–D) of IiNmut may suggest that nonacidic proteinases play a role. Thus, it is possible that enzymes such as serine proteinases, which are active at a neutral pH, are involved. We tested Pefabloc and TLCK, inhibitors of serine proteinases (Fig. 5, E and F). Remarkably, the degradation of IiNmut was extensively inhibited by Pefabloc and by TLCK, and both exceeded the impact of pepstatin A (Fig. 5 B) and E64d (Fig. 5 C). Both Pefabloc and TLCK also affect decay of Ii, indicating that in addition to neutral proteinases, acidic proteinases responsible for Ii degradation are impaired. The degree of inhibition of IiNmut degradation by concanamycin B and by Pefabloc suggests a complementary function of the affected proteinases. In fact, inhibition of IiNmut degradation by a combination of concanamycin B and of Pefabloc almost completely blocked proteolysis (data not shown). Consideration of the known functions of N-linked glycosylation (35Kundra-R Kornfeld-S J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31039-31046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 36Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) leads us to postulate several possible roles for the N-linked carbohydrates of Ii. The presence of Ii glycans influences transient association to calnexin in the ER and the stability of the MHCII/Ii complex. IiNmut forms trimers and associates to MHCII complexes despite the lack of calnexin interaction (30Romagnoli P. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 2N. Schach and N. Koch, unpublished results. The role of calnexin may be to retain glycosylated Ii in the ER in order to provide excess Ii for association to newly synthesized MHCII molecules (30Romagnoli P. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ii is degraded intracellularly to generate functional MHCII heterodimers and is a very proteolytically sensitive protein. Thus, theN-linked glycans may be essential to protect from immediate degradation while committing the Ii substrate to a controlled proteolysis. As shown in this paper, the N-linked carbohydrates affect degradation at neutral pH, conditions that are present in early endosomes. The intact MHCII/Ii complex is transported from early endosomes to more acidic compartments. There proteolytic release of Ii occurs and subsequent binding of antigenic peptides to empty MHCII heterodimers is facilitated by an acidic pH. TheN-linked carbohydrates thus may play a key role in directing the route of Ii degradation to MHCII-processing compartments. Activation of protein complexes by proteolysis is a common mechanism in cell biology and is also found in the innate immune system. Several components of the complement system acquire activity upon partial proteolytic digestion. Such regulated degradation also plays a role in the antigen-specific immune system and accounts for activation of the immature MHCII complex. Recent findings indicate that MHCII dimers appear in two conformations (37Rabinowitz J.D. Vrljic M. Kasson P.M. Liang M.N. Busch R. Boniface J.J. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). One of these isomeric forms is active for binding of peptides. The release of the Ii fragment CLIP from MHCII dimers generates the peptide-receptive isomer. Thus the regulated degradation of Ii and the generation of CLIP are important for subsequent binding of peptides by MHCII molecules. An increasing number of endosomal proteinases involved in MHCII antigen processing have been identified (38Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 2000; 12: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These proteinases shape the repertoire of antigenic peptides that are captured by MHCII heterodimers. Some of these proteinases are in addition to fragmentation of protein antigens involved in processing of the MHCII/Ii nonameric complex. A first cleavage of Ii occurs at the C terminus of the MHCII groove-binding segment (39Riese R.J. Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Enzymes that under physiological conditions initiate cleavage of the homotrimeric Ii and generate the C-terminal truncated Ii fragment LIP (leupeptin-induced peptide), have not yet been identified. There is some evidence that degradation of Ii is started by an aspartate proteinase (33Maric M.A. Taylor M.D. Blum J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Two proteinases, cathepsin S and L were specific for subsequent cleavage of LIP. The cysteine proteinase cathepsin S cleaves Ii after amino acids 78 or 80 of the Ii sequence and presumably generates the N terminus of CLIP (40Villadangos J.A. Riese R.J. Peters C. Chapman H.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In mice deficient for cathepsin S or L, LIP accumulates that still associates with MHCII molecules (41Nakagawa T. Roth W. Wong P. Nelson A. Farr A. Deussing J. Villadangos J.A. Ploegh H. Peters C. Rudensky A.Y. Science. 1998; 280: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 42Nakagawa T.Y. Brissette W.H. Lira P.D. Griffiths R.J. Petrushova N. Stock J. McNeish J.D. Eastman S.E. Howard E.D. Clarke S.R. Rosloniec E.F. Elliott E.A. Rudensky A.Y. Immunity. 1999; 10: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Macrophages express cathepsin F that also appears to be involved in Ii degradation (43Shi G.P. Bryant R.A. Riese R. Verhelst S. Driessen C. Li Z. Bromme D. Ploegh H.L. Chapman H.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Because the Asn-linked glycans separate the trimerization site from the MHCII binding site of Ii, it is possible that the carbohydrate moiety directs the proteolytic cleavage towards the boundaries of the MHCII groove. It is conceivable that this cleavage site is only available under acidic conditions. The carbohydrates may influence intracellular transport and sorting of Ii. Possibly IiNmut is aberrantly sorted to neutral endocytic compartments where it is degraded. Villandangos et al. (44Villadangos J.A. Driessen C. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 882-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) described recently a novel MHCII processing pathway. Characteristic of this pathway is that it is independent of H2-M and that degradation of MHCII-associated Ii cannot be blocked by concanamycin B. Inhibition by concanamycin B demonstrated two components of the endocytic pathway. In one of these pathways the release of Ii from MHCII does not depend on cysteine proteinases. Because, as has been shown here, degradation of IiNmut is not completely blocked by concanamycin B, it is possible that this novel MHCII-processing pathway accounts for the partial decay of IiNmut in the presence of concanamycin B. We demonstrated in this report, that N-linked glycosylation plays a key role in the controlled endosomal degradation of Ii. In the sequential degradation of Ii, N-glycans provide a signal for acidic degradation in MHCII processing compartments.

https://openalex.org/W2057522428,"In this study we reveal regions of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase that are involved in cation selectivity. A chimeric enzyme in which transmembrane hairpin M5-M6 of H+,K+-ATPase was replaced by that of Na+,K+-ATPase was phosphorylated in the absence of Na+ and showed no K+-dependent reactions. Next, the part originating from Na+,K+-ATPase was gradually increased in the N-terminal direction. We demonstrate that chimera HN16, containing the transmembrane segments one to six and intermediate loops of Na+,K+-ATPase, harbors the amino acids responsible for Na+ specificity. Compared with Na+,K+-ATPase, this chimera displayed a similar apparent Na+ affinity, a lower apparent K+affinity, a higher apparent ATP affinity, and a lower apparent vanadate affinity in the ATPase reaction. This indicates that theE 2K form of this chimera is less stable than that of Na+,K+-ATPase, suggesting that it, like H+,K+-ATPase, de-occludes K+ions very rapidly. Comparison of the structures of these chimeras with those of the parent enzymes suggests that the C-terminal 187 amino acids and the β-subunit are involved in K+ occlusion. Accordingly, chimera HN16 is not only a chimeric enzyme in structure, but also in function. On one hand it possesses the Na+-stimulated ATPase reaction of Na+,K+-ATPase, while on the other hand it has the K+ occlusion properties of H+,K+-ATPase. In this study we reveal regions of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase that are involved in cation selectivity.

On one hand it possesses the Na+-stimulated ATPase reaction of Na+,K+-ATPase, while on the other hand it has the K+ occlusion properties of H+,K+-ATPase. Enzymes that belong to the family of P-type ATPases can facilitate active transport of cations across the plasma membrane (1Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Na+,K+-ATPase and gastric H+,K+-ATPase are two particular members of this family, since they possess a β-subunit and couple ATP hydrolysis to counter-transport of cations. The latter process can be described by the Albers-Post scheme (2Albers R.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1967; 36: 727-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 3Post R.L. Kume S. Tobin T. Orcutt B. Sen A.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 54: 306s-326sCrossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Although Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase have many structural and functional similarities, they differ in cation specificity. Both enzyme activities need K+, but the Na+,K+-ATPase activity is stimulated by Na+ and that of H+,K+-ATPase by H+. A major difference between the two enzymes is that the occlusion of K+ can easily be measured in Na+,K+-ATPase (4Beaugé L.A. Glynn I.M. Nature. 1979; 280: 510-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), whereas in H+,K+-ATPase one needs very special conditions to measure this (5Rabon E.C. Smillie K. Seru V. Rabon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8012-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference is due to the much faster rate of the E 2K → E 1K conversion in the latter enzyme (6Faller L.D. Diaz R.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Farley R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3503-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Rabon E.C. Bassilian S. Sachs G. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

With the exception of a single residue in M6 1The abbreviations used are: Mtransmembrane segmentX+Na+ or H+SfSpodoptera frugiperda (Asp804 in Na+,K+-ATPase; Glu820 in H+,K+-ATPase), these amino acid residues are similar in both ATPases. Their analogous residues in SERCA1a Ca2+-ATPase also play a role in Ca2+ binding as revealed by the recently published crystal structure (14Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). transmembrane segment Na+ or H+ Spodoptera frugiperda The catalytic α1-subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase and that of gastric H+,K+-ATPase share a high degree of identity (63%) in contrast to their heavily glycosylated β1-subunits, which are only 30% identical. Assembly of the α- and β-subunits is essential for enzyme activity (15Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11604-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and occurs before the subunits are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (16Geering K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although the α-subunits can form functional complexes with both β-subunits, they have a preference for their own β-subunit (15Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11604-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This preference is probably determined by the C-terminal half of the extracellular loop between transmembrane segments seven and eight of the α-subunit where the αβ interaction occurs (17Wang S.G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Melle-Milovanovic D. Milovanovic M. Nagpal S. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The similarity between the catalytic subunits of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase made it possible to prepare chimeras and to test their catalytic properties. Because of the postulated role of the M5-M6 hairpin in cation binding, we first prepared a chimeric enzyme from gastric H+,K+-ATPase in which only this hairpin was replaced by that of Na+,K+-ATPase. ATP could phosphorylate this chimeric enzyme, but no K+-stimulated ATPase activity could be measured (19Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, Na+ ions did not stimulate the phosphorylation reaction. We next prepared chimeras in which the part originating from Na+,K+-ATPase was gradually increased into the N-terminal direction. In all these chimeras the C-terminal part, including the last four transmembrane segments and the β-subunit, originated from the gastric H+,K+-ATPase. In this study we show that only chimeras that contain all six N-terminal transmembrane domains and their intervening loops display Na+ activation of the ATPase activity and the ATP phosphorylation reaction. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a role of the C-terminal region in K+ de-occlusion. The rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase α- and β-subunits and the rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1- and β1-subunits were cloned into the pFastbacdual vector (Life Technologies, Inc., Breda, The Netherlands) as described previously (15Koenderink J.B.

We used the Altered Sites II in vitromutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) to introduce silent mutations to generate MunI, DraI, PvuI,NheI, VspI, and SstII restriction sites in the cDNA of the H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunits. These restriction sites were chosen in the intracellular domain close to putative transmembrane helices. A NarI restriction site was already present in both α-subunits. Thereafter, theVspI-SstII fragment, theNarI-SstII fragment, theNheI-SstII fragment, thePvuI-SstII fragment, theDraI-SstII fragment, theMunI-SstII fragment, and the N terminus untilSstII were replaced by the similar fragments of Na+,K+-ATPase, resulting in the chimeras HN56, HNn6, HN46, HN36, HN26, HN16, and HNN6, respectively (Fig. 1). The sequence of all mutants was verified. Competent DH10bacEscherichia coli cells (Life Technologies, Inc., Breda, The Netherlands) harboring the baculovirus genome (bacmid) and a transposition helper vector were transformed with the pFastbacdual transfer vector containing different cDNAs. Upon transition between the Tn7 sites in the transfer vector and the bacmid, recombinant bacmids were selected and isolated (20Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, Sf9 insect cells were transfected with recombinant bacmids using Cellfectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 3 days, the recombinant baculoviruses were harvested and used to infect Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Four days after infection, the amplified viruses were harvested. As a mock a baculovirus not expressing the α- and β-subunit of H+,K+-ATPase or Na+,K+-ATPase was prepared. Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in 100-ml spinner flask cultures (21Klaassen C.H.W.

The Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended at 0 °C in 0.25m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 25 mmHepes/Tris (pH 7.0). The membranes were sonicated twice for 30 s at 60 watts (Branson Power Co., Danbury, CT), after which the disrupted cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the pelleted membranes were resuspended in the above mentioned buffer and stored at −20 °C. Protein was determined with the modified Lowry method described by Peterson (23Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The ATPase activity was determined with a radiochemical method (10Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M.

For this purpose Sf9 membranes were added to 100 μl of medium, which contained under standard conditions 50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmTris-N3, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP. Other conditions are indicated in the legends of the Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6. After incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl 10% (w/v) charcoal in 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and after incubation at 0 °C, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 s (10,000 × g). To 200 μl of the clear supernatant, containing the liberated inorganic phosphate (32Pi), 4 ml of OptiFluor (Canberra Packard, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was added, and the mixture was analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. Blanks were prepared by incubating in the absence of enzyme.

Sf9 membranes were incubated at 21 °C in 50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 6.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm MgCl2 and 0–300 mm NaCl in a volume of 50 μl. After 30–60 min preincubation 10 μl of 0.6 μm[γ-32P]ATP was added and incubated for 10 s at 21 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in 0.1 m phosphoric acid, and the phosphorylated protein was collected by filtration over a 0.8-μm membrane filter (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). After repeated washing, the filters were analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. The specific phosphorylation level is presented as the phosphorylation level obtained with the expressed enzyme minus that of the mock. The K 0.5 value is defined as the concentration of effector giving the half-maximal activation and the IC50 as the value giving 50% inhibition of the maximal activation. Data are presented as mean values with S.E. of the mean. Differences were tested for significance by means of the Student's t test. The rat cDNA clones of the H+,K+-ATPase α- and β-subunits and the rat and sheep cDNA clones of the Na+,K+-ATPase α1- and β1-subunits were provided by Drs. G. E. Shull and J. B Lingrel, respectively. All enzymes used for DNA cloning were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci·mmol−1) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Seven chimeric constructs were produced after introduction of six unique restriction sites in both the cDNAs of the rat gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and the rat Na+,K+-ATPase α1-subunit. First, the transmembrane hairpin M5-M6 of H+,K+-ATPase was exchanged by the similar region of Na+,K+-ATPase, generating the chimeric ATPase HN56. Next, the part originating from Na+,K+-ATPase was progressively increased in the N-terminal direction, generating the chimeric ATPases HNn6, HN46, HN36, HN26, HN16, and HNN6 (Fig. 1). These chimeric α-subunits were introduced in the genome of a baculovirus together with the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit. As controls the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase (HK and NaK) were also expressed. The recombinant baculoviruses were used to infect Sf9 insect cells, and the membrane fractions of these cells expressing the ATPase proteins were isolated.

Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (directed against the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit), was used to check the produced proteins. This analysis revealed similar expression levels for the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase, Na+,K+-ATPase, and the chimeras HNn6, HN46, HN36, HN26, HN16, and HNN6. The expression level of chimera HN56, however, was slightly lower than that of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase (data not shown). Both Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase hydrolyze ATP to actively transport cations across the plasma membrane. This ATPase activity was measured at 100 μm ATP in the absence of K+and Na+, in the presence of 10 mmK+, and in the combined presence of K+ (10 mm) and Na+ (100 mm). The ATPase activity of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase was stimulated by K+, but inhibited when Na+ was additionally present (Fig. 2). The chimeras HN56, HNn6, HN46, HN36, and HN26 did not possess significant ATPase activity above that of the mock-infected cells, either in the absence or the presence of K+. Addition of Na+in the presence of K+ also had no effect on the activity of the latter chimeras. In contrast to H+,K+-ATPase, the ATPase activities of the chimeras HN16 and HNN6 were only slightly stimulated by the addition of K+, whereas similarly to that of the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase, the activities were strongly stimulated by the combined presence of Na+ and K+. The ATPase activity levels, expressed per milligram of protein, of H+,K+-ATPase, Na+,K+-ATPase, HNN6, and HN16 at 100 μm ATP were rather similar. We compared the Na+ dependence of the overall ATPase activity of Na+,K+-ATPase, H+,K+-ATPase, and the chimeras HNN6 and HN16 in the presence of 10 mm K+ at 100 μm ATP (Fig. 3). The H+,K+-ATPase activity was not stimulated by the addition of Na+. Increasing concentrations of Na+, however, gradually inhibited the activity of this enzyme (apparent IC50 = 66 mm). Na+,K+-ATPase activity was stimulated by the addition of Na+ (apparent K 0.5 = 4.7 mm). Na+ also raised the K+-stimulated ATPase activity of the chimeras HNN6 and HN16 with similar apparent K 0.5 values (8.5 and 6.1 mm, respectively). At very high Na+concentrations the K+-stimulated ATPase activities of Na+,K+-ATPase and the chimeras HN16 and HNN6 were also inhibited. Thus the Na+ activation curves of HN16 and HNN6 are rather similar to that of Na+,K+-ATPase. To compare the K+ activation characteristics of the two ATPases and the active chimeras, ATPase activity measurements were carried out with 100 μm ATP using 30 mmNa+, which is almost optimal for Na+,K+-ATPase, whereas the H+,K+-ATPase activity is still 70% of the maximal activity. All ATPases showed a biphasic K+activation curve (Fig. 4). The increasing parts of these curves are due to K+ activation of the dephosphorylation step. The decreasing parts are due to inhibition by K+ of the E 2 toE 1 transition. The K+ inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase is enhanced by using lower than optimal ATP concentrations. In the absence of K+ and the presence of 30 mm Na+, the H+,K+-ATPase activity was already 41% of the maximal ATPase activity, which is likely to be due to a K+-like effect of Na+ on the dephosphorylation reaction (29Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7890-7895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The apparent K 0.5 value of the increasing part of this curve was 0.2 mm K+. The K+-activated ATPase curve of Na+,K+-ATPase (apparentK 0.5 = 0.4 mm) was shifted to the right compared with the curve of H+,K+-ATPase. The apparent K+ sensitivities of the chimeras HNN6 and HN16 were considerably lower (1.3 and 1.6 mm, respectively). To determine whether the ATP affinity of these chimeras was changed compared with that of the wild-type enzymes, we measured the ATPase activity at 10 mm K+, 30 mmNa+, and varying concentrations of ATP (1–3,000 μm) (Fig. 5). The apparent ATP affinity of H+,K+-ATPase (38 μm) was higher than that of Na+,K+-ATPase (113 μm), and the affinities of the chimeras HNN6 and HN16 were even higher (13 and 8 μm, respectively). Since it is known that ATP drives the enzyme from the E 2K to theE 1 conformation, this suggests that theE 2K conformers of HNN6 and HN16 are less stable than those of Na+,K+-ATPase. This was confirmed by studies with vanadate. This compound reacts with theE 2K conformation of the enzyme and forms a stable intermediate that inhibits enzyme activity. The longer the enzyme is in this conformation during the reaction cycle the lower the vanadate concentration needed for 50% inhibition (30Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7361-7368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows that the chimeras, which have a high apparent affinity for ATP, have a very low affinity for vanadate, suggesting that the observed high ATP affinity is due to a preference of the chimeras HNN6 and HN16 for the E 1conformation. A characteristic property of P-type ATPases is the formation of an acid-stable phosphorylated intermediate during the catalytic cycle. We measured the phosphorylation capacity of the wild-type enzymes and the chimeras with 0.1 μm ATP in the absence of K+, with and without 100 mm Na+ at 21 °C and pH 6.0 (Fig. 7). The ATP concentration used was approximately four and eight times theK 0.5 for ATP in the phosphorylation reaction of H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase, respectively (15Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11604-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The chimeras HN56 and HNn6 that showed no K+-stimulated ATPase reaction could be phosphorylated. The chimera HNn6 and H+,K+-ATPase were both phosphorylated to a level of 6.2 pmol of EP mg−1protein, whereas the phosphorylation level of chimera HN56 was only 2.6 pmol EP mg−1 protein. The addition of 100 mm Na+ decreased the phosphorylation level of these enzymes. The amounts of phosphoenzyme of HN46, HN36, and HN26 were not significantly different from that of the mock-infected cells. Chimeras HN16 and HNN6 were phosphorylated to a level of about 2 pmol EP mg−1 protein. The addition of 100 mm Na+ increased this phosphorylation level to 3.1 and 3.6 pmol EP mg−1protein, respectively. Phosphorylation of the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase did hardly occur in the absence of added Na+ and was stimulated by this cation up to a maximal level of 1.6 pmol EP mg−1protein. Na+ stimulated the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate of Na+,K+-ATPase as well as of the chimeras HNN6 and HN16, whereas it decreased the phosphorylation level of H+,K+-ATPase and the chimeras HNn6 and HN56. In Fig. 8 we used different concentrations of Na+ to investigate the cation dependence of the phosphorylation process. The phosphorylation levels of H+,K+-ATPase and chimeras HN56 and HNn6 were dose-dependently decreased by Na+ (Fig.8 A), which is probably due to K+-like effects of Na+ on the dephosphorylation reaction (29Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7890-7895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation levels of the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase and the chimeras HN16 and HNN6 were dose-dependently increased by Na+. The phosphorylation level of the chimeras HNN6 and HN16 at 20 mm Na+ was almost three times the level measured in the absence of added Na+ and was higher than that measured at a Na+ concentration of 100 mm(Fig. 7). The phosphorylation level of the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase was gradually stimulated by Na+, until it reached a maximum at 100 mmNa+ (Fig. 8 B) (10Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Hermsen H.P.H. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9959-9966Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The different kinetics of these activation curves makes comparison difficult. It is likely that the difference is due to the fact that the chimeras are in theE 1 form, whereas wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase is in theE 2 conformation. Part of the added Na+ is therefore needed to drive the latter enzyme in theE 1 form before it can be phosphorylated. The first high resolution structure of a P-type ATPase (Ca2+-ATPase) has been elucidated recently (14Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). This huge step forward does, however, not answer all questions regarding the structure-function relationship of P-type ATPases. The cation-binding residues present in the occlusion pocket might not be fully responsible for the cation specificity of P-type ATPases. Indeed, many reports demonstrate that regions outside the proposed occlusion pocket influence the cation selectivity (31Schneider H. Scheiner-Bobis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16158-16165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Canfield V.A. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7509-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 33Blostein R. Dunbar L. Mense M. Scanzano R. Wilczynska A. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18374-18381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 34Mense M. Dunbar L.A. Blostein R. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study we shed some light on the regions involved in the cation specificity of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase. We demonstrate that only chimeras containing transmembrane segments one to six and the intervening regions of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit harbor the amino acids responsible for the Na+ stimulation of the ATPase activity in the presence of K+. On the other hand the C-terminal part of the α-subunit, together with the β-subunit, most likely determines the difference in K+ de-occlusion properties between both parental ATPases. The crystal structure of SERCA1a Ca2+-ATPase revealed all residues that coordinate the Ca2+ atoms (14Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). According to this model, the complete cation binding pocket of H+,K+-ATPase was replaced by that of Na+,K+-ATPase when both transmembrane hairpins M3-M4 and M5-M6 were exchanged. This chimera (HN34/56), however, possessed a (H+,)K+-ATPase activity that could not be stimulated by Na+ (19Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not likely that only these residues are responsible for the Na+activation of Na+,K+-ATPase. Because of the postulated role of the M5-M6 hairpin in cation binding (35Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), we first prepared a chimeric H+,K+-ATPase in which only this hairpin was replaced by that of Na+,K+-ATPase (HN56). We demonstrated that ATP could phosphorylate this chimera, but K+ did"
