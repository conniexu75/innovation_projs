https://openalex.org/W1515982653,"Protein C is activated rapidly when thrombin binds to a specific cell surface cofactor protein, thrombomodulin. Studies were initiated to determine the influence of thrombin-thrombomodulin complex formation on the substrate specificity of thrombin. When thrombin binds to thrombomodulin, the resultant complex retains less than 1% of the fibrinogen clotting activity of free thrombin. Permanent alteration of the thrombin molecule is not involved since full clotting activity is regenerated by incubation of the complex with excess diisopropyl phosphothrombin. Unlike the activation of protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex which is dependent on Ca2+, inhibition of fibrinogen clotting activity is not dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions. Formation of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex also inhibits thrombin activation of factor V. Despite these changes in macromolecular substate specificity, no significant change in the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrates p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester and N alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester is detected upon formation of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Formation of this complex results in a slight increase in the Km (from 9.0 +/- 0.4 to 10.2 +/- 0.6 microM) and Vmax (from 230 +/- 10 to 270 +/- 10 mol/s/mol of thrombin) for the specific thrombin substrate H-D-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide. These studies suggest that thrombomodulin has two distinct anticoagulant functions: 1) to inhibit the ability of thrombin to clot fibrinogen and to activate factor V; and 2) to accelerate the formation of the anticoagulant, activated protein C."

https://openalex.org/W1962690668,"The monoclonal antibody OKT9 reacts specifically with the receptors for transferrin on human cells (Sutherland, D. R., Delia, D., Schneider, C., Newman, R. A., Kemshead, J., and Greaves, M. F. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 4515-4519; in Leukemia Markers (Knapp, W., ed) pp. 157-160, Academic Press, New York) and has been used to isolate and characterize this receptor. The receptor is a dimeric glycoprotein (Mr = 180,000) composed of two subunits (Mr = 90,000) and has a pI of approximately 5.2. The transferrin receptor appears to be a transmembrane molecule and is phosphorylated, the phosphate group being predominantly on serine residues. The cell surface form of the molecular possesses both complex and high mannose oligosaccharide chains, which do not appear to have a direct role in antibody (OKT9) binding. The molecule can be cleaved into a Mr = 70,000 fragment from the cell surface, suggesting that the major part of the receptor is exposed to the extracellular environment. The released Mr = 70,000 fragments are not disulfide-linked and possess the antibody (OKT9)- and transferrin-binding sites. Cross-linking studies using radiolabeled transferrin suggest that two molecules of transferrin are bound to each Mr = 180,000 receptor dimer."

https://openalex.org/W1592240896,"Starvation and diabetes both caused a marked increase in the concentration of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate caroboxykinase mRNA while the administration of insulin to diabetic rats or refeeding glucose to starved animals caused a marked reduction in the levels of enzyme mRNA as measured by hybridization using a cDNA probe.l The Administration of dibutyryl cAMP to a starved-refed cat caused an 8-fold induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA in 1 h. Triamcinolone plus acidosis induced the levels of enzyme mRNA in kidney 3-fold within 6 h, however, starvation for 24h had only marginal effects. In all of the above conditions, the levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA measured by hybridization assay agreed well with the relative levels of translatable mRNA for the enzyme. The half-time of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA, determined after the administration of either alpha-amanitin or cordycepin to starved animals, was approximately 40 min. However, cycloheximide either alone or together with cordycepin, not only prevented the decrease in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA sequence abundance, but induced it 2-fold. Cycloheximide itself, when injected into 21-day fetal rats in utero caused an induction of enzyme mRNA equal to that noted when dibutyryl cAMP was administered. The mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is approximately 2.8 kb in length, but nuclei from the livers of diabetic rats contain a number of putative precursor RNA species for the enzyme, up to 6.5 kb in size, all containing a poly(A) tail. Two hours after refeedng glucose to a starved rat, these nuclear RNA species could no longer be detected by hybridization to our cDNA probe."
https://openalex.org/W1542282967,"Fibrinogen binding to receptors on stimulated platelets is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation. In order to identify the platelet fibrinogen receptor, we modified fibrinogen with the photoreactive, heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent methyl 4-azidobenzoimidate (MABI). MABI-fibrinogen was fully clottable and able to support platelet aggregation. To photoaffinity label the fibrinogen receptor, gel-filtered human platelets were incubated at 37 degrees C in the dark with 200 micrograms/ml of MABI-fibrinogen, 10 microM ADP, and 0.5 mM calcium. Irradiation of these platelets with ultraviolet light resulted in the incorporation of MABI-fibrinogen into the platelet surface. Incorporation could be prevented by excess native fibrinogen suggesting that MABI-fibrinogen had interacted with the fibrinogen receptor before photolysis. Examination of the irradiated platelets by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the photoactivated MABI-fibrinogen had been incorporated into a 105,000 molecular weight membrane polypeptide that also contained the PlA1 antigen. Thus, this polypeptide has the characteristics of the membrane glycoprotein IIIa. Previous studies have shown that thrombasthenic platelets lack this glycoprotein and fail to bind fibrinogen after stimulation by ADP. Consequently, our data suggest that glycoprotein IIIa constitutes at least one component of the platelet fibrinogen receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1550638578,"Low density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism was studied using WHHL rabbits, an inbred strain deficient in LDL receptor activity and, thus, an animal model for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. WHHL and normal rabbits were injected with [14C]sucrose-LDL and the tissue sites of LDL degradation were determined 24 h later. On degradation of [14C]sucrose-LDL, the [14C]sucrose ligand remains trapped within tissues as a cumulative measure of degradation. The fractional catabolic rate of [14C]sucrose-LDL in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits was reduced (0.024 +/- 0.010 versus 0.063 +/- 0.026 h-1) but, by virtue of the increased plasma pool, total LDL flux was increased (33.5 +/- 9.6 versus 10.6 +/- 4.4 mg of LDL protein/kg/day). Liver was the predominant site of catabolism in both WHHL and normal rabbits (52.7 +/- 6.9 and 56.6 +/- 6.2% of total degradation). About 90% of hepatic catabolism was attributable to parenchymal cells in both cases. Thus, Kupffer cells, a major component of the reticuloendothelial system, do not play a major role in LDL catabolism in WHHL rabbits. Despite receptor deficiency, the relative contribution of various tissues to overall LDL degradation was not greatly altered and the absolute rate of delivery of LDL to all tissues was increased with the exception of the adrenal. Thus, there was no evidence that the increased degradation occurred in any special subset of cells. Nevertheless, local scavenger cell uptake may be critically important, especially in atherogenesis. If it is assumed that receptor-independent degradation occurs at the same rate in the tissues of WHHL and normal rabbits and that catabolism in the absence of receptors is a linear function of concentration, then one can estimate the fraction of uptake in normal tissues mediated by receptors. The difference in the fraction of the plasma LDL pool cleared per unit of time in normal and WHHL rabbits would reflect the contribution of receptors to fractional clearance. By this calculation, receptor-mediated degradation in normal rabbits was 62% overall, 63% in liver, 92% in adrenal, and 83% in gut."
https://openalex.org/W1544586151,"Homogenization of TCRC-2 cells yielded a phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase with a specific activity approximately 10-=fold higher in particulate than in soluble fractions. Over 90% of the phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase associated with the particles was solubilized with 1.0% Nonidet P-40. Chromatography of the detergent-solubilized particulate fraction on either wheat germ lectin-Sepharose or histone-Sepharose columns separated two major components of phosphatase activity. One peak (eluted with 200 mM NaCl from histone-Sepharose or with N-acetylglucosamine from the lectin column) contained both phosphotyrosyl- and phosphoseryl-protein phosphatase as well as p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activities. The other peak (eluted with 1.0 M NaCl from histone-Sepharose or not bound to the lectin column) contained essentially only phosphoseryl-protein phosphatase activity. Various agents (EDTA, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, fluoride) showed considerable differences in their ability to inhibit the two phosphatase fractions; of these, the most potent and selective inhibitor was orthovanadate. At micromolar concentrations, vanadate inhibited the fraction containing phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase and failed to inhibit the fraction containing only phosphoseryl-protein phosphatase activity. These data show that the particulate forms of phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase and p-nitrophenyl phosphatase represent the activities of very similar or identical proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1534119891,"We constructed a gene library from a murine cell line with amplified dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) genes by inserting random segments of DNA into lambda Ch4A. From this library, the dhfr gene and 30 kilobase pairs of surrounding DNA were cloned, and the restriction map was determined. All of the coding regions were sequenced and show that the gene spans a total of 31 kilobase pairs and has five intervening sequences in the coding portion of the gene. In addition, two classes of variant dhfr genes were found in the amplified line, which were amplified and present at levels of 10 to 30% of the normal dhfr genes. Numerous repeated sequences were located throughout the gene region, some of which share homology with previously defied families of repeats."

https://openalex.org/W1541136019,"Leader (signal) peptidases cleave the NH2-terminal leader sequences of newly synthesized secreted and membrane proteins during, or shortly after, they insert across the membrane. We have constructed a plasmid, pPS9, in which the structural gene for Escherichia coli leader peptidase is under transcriptional control of a lambda promoter, PR. pPS9 also codes for a temperature-sensitive lambda repressor, causing repression of expression of the plasmid leader peptidase gene at 30 degrees C and rapid synthesis of this enzyme at 42 degrees C. Under appropriate growth regimens, leader peptidase is overproduced 75-fold. Leader peptidase from this strain has been purified to homogeneity. It consists of a 37,000-dalton polypeptide which co-migrates with enzyme activity on DEAE-cellulose and chromatofocusing chromatography. Antibody to this leader peptidase is described."
https://openalex.org/W1487738788,"The alpha subunit of the sodium channel purified from rat brain is rapidly and selectively phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to a level of 3 to 4 mol of 32P/mol of saxitoxin-binding activity. The rate of phosphorylation is comparable to that of the synthetic peptide analog of the phosphorylation site of pyruvate kinase, one of the best substrates for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. An endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase that is present in the partially purified sodium channel preparations also selectively phosphorylates the alpha subunit. The specificity and rapidity of the phosphorylation reaction are consistent with the hypothesis that the alpha subunit is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2303695898,"The binding of the human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to Swiss mouse 3T3 cells have been investigated. The binding is specific and reversible. The dissociation constant is approximately 0.7 x 10(-9) M with approximately 400,000 binding sites/cell. Two forms of PDGF, PDGF I (Mr = 31,000) and PDGF II (Mr = 28,000), previously identified (Deuel, T. F., Huang, J. S., Proffitt, R. T., Baenziger, J. U., Chang, D., and Kennedy, B. B. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 8896-8899 and Deuel, T. F., Huang. J. S., Proffitt, R. T., Chang, D., and Kennedy, B. B. (1981) J. Supramol. Cell Biochem. 5 (Suppl.), 128) bind equally well to 3T3 cells. Polylysine and histone, but not cytochrome c, partially inhibit the binding of PDGF to 3T3 cells. Protamine sulfate blocks binding in a competitive manner and is capable of displacing PDGF previously bound to the cell surface. EDTA influenced neither the binding of PDGF to the cell surface nor the displacement of cell-bound PDGF. At 37 degrees C, PDGF bound to the cell surface is lost and iodotyrosine is released free into the supernatant, with each process having a t 1/2 of approximately 90 min. The binding activity of the putative PDGF receptor is markedly reduced by previous incubation with PDGF, thereby apparently regulating its activity in a manner similar to epidermal growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1638928527,"An enzyme activity that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate from the C-2 position of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate has been detected in rat liver cytoplasm. The S0.5 for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was about 15 microM and the enzyme was inhibited by fructose 6-phosphate (Ki 40 microM) and activated by Pi (KA 1 mM). Fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity was purified to homogeneity by specific elution from phosphocellulose with fructose by specific elution from phosphocellulose with fructose 6-phosphate and had an apparent molecular weight of about 100,000, 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase activity copurified with fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase activity at each step of the purification scheme. Incubation of the purified protein with [gamma-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase resulted in the incorporation of 1 mol of 32P/mol of enzyme subunit (Mr = 50,000). Concomitant with this phosphorylation was an activation of the fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase and an inhibition of the 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase activity. Glucagon addition to isolated hepatocytes also resulted in an inhibition of 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase and activation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase measured in cell extracts, suggesting that the hormone regulates the level of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by affecting both synthesis and degradation of the compound. These findings suggest that this enzyme has both phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase activities i.e. that it is bifunctional, and that both activities can be regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1485357293,"The binding of thiol, thiolate, thioether, and disulfide sulfur donor ligands to ferric cytochrome P-450-CAM and myoglobin has been investigated by UV-visible absorption, magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and EPR spectroscopy. For ferric P-450, the binding of all sulfur donors is competitive with substrate binding. Addition of thiols to P-450 leads to interconvertible thiol or thiolate-bound species depending on the thiol acidity (pKa) and the solution ph; ligation of thiols lowers their pKa by about 4 units. In contrast, only the thiolate-bound form is seen for myoglobin regardless of thiol acidity or solution pH (5.5-11.0), indicating that the heme iron of myoglobin is less electron-rich than that of P-450. Thiolate ligands show much higher affinity (Kd approximately 10(-6) M) for ferric P-450 than do thiols (Kd approximately 10(-3) M). The affinity of thioethers for P-450 (Kd approximately 10(-3) M) is pH-independent (pH 5.5-9.0). The observed disulfide coordination to P-450 represents the first example of disulfide ligation to heme iron; no significant evidence for thioether or disulfide binding to myoglobin is seen. Except for the thiolate complexes, the UV-visible and MCD spectral properties of the other sulfur donor . P-450 complexes are similar to, although distinguishable from, those of native P-450. The ferric P-450 . thiolate complexes exhibit MCD spectra resembling that of ferrous P-450 . CO; both also exhibit unique hyperporphyrin (split Soret) UV-visible spectra. The EPR spectra of all P-450 complexes examined display very narrow spread g-values such as are characteristic of native P-450, indicating that the endogenous cysteinate axial ligand is retained upon complex formation. The dissimilarities observed between P-450 and myoglobin in their reactivity toward sulfur donor ligands at least partly reflect the variation in heme iron electron density resulting from their different endogenous axial ligands and may, in turn, help to explain their respective physiological functions of oxygen activation and reversible oxygen binding."
https://openalex.org/W1555567251,"These studies were done in the rat to correlate the ability of low and high density lipoproteins of rat (rLDL and rHDL) and human (hLDL and hHDL) origin to bind in vivo to specific tissues with the rates at which these same lipoprotein fractions were cleared from the circulation. The adrenal gland and liver manifested the greatest amounts of rLDL binding in vivo, but activity also was found in spleen, lung, kidney, ovary, and intestine. In contrast, little or no such binding was found utilizing either methyl-rLDL or hLDL. rHDL containing E apoprotein bound to the same group of tissues although in lesser amounts, except in the case of ovary and adrenal gland which bound disproportionately greater amounts of rHDL than rLDL. In keeping with these marked differences in tissue binding, the clearance of rLDL from the plasma equaled 847 +/- 36 microliters/h/100 g of rat while that of methyl-rLDL and hLDL was only 368 +/- 8 and 363 +/- 11 microliters/h/100 g of rat, respectively. When the steady state plasma level of rLDL was raised 2.5-fold, the clearance decreased slightly to 705 +/- 20 microliters/h/100 g of rat. The clearance of hLDL remained constant, however, at about 350 microliters/h/100 g of rat even when the plasma hLDL level was raised to very high values. The clearance of rHDL and hHDL equaled 644 +/- 16 and 408 +/- 13 microliters/h/100 g of rat, respectively, reflecting the more similar rate of binding of rHDL and hHDL to the tissues of the rat. Rates of whole animal sterol synthesis were lowered from 28 mumol/h to 8.8 mumol/h or 13 mumol/h by fasting and cholesterol feeding, respectively, and stimulated to 71 mumol/h by cholestyramine treatment. Under these same conditions, hepatic cholesterol synthesis could be lowered from the normal rate of 15 mumol/h to 4.2 mumol/h and raised to 50 mumol/h. None of these treatments, however, affected the plasma clearance of rLDL and rHDL. In contrast, treatment with ethinyl estradiol increased by 3-fold both the hepatic binding and the whole animal plasma clearance of rLDL. Following resection of approximately two-thirds of the liver under carefully controlled metabolic conditions, there was no change in the rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis or rLDL binding in the remaining liver, but the clearance of chylomicrons, rLDL, and rHDL diminished by 67%, 26%, and 17%, respectively, suggesting that in the rat the liver was responsible for the degradation of approximately 97%, 39%, and 27%, respectively, of these lipoprotein fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1563696082,"The relative importance of alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways and of their respective intracellular mediators, calcium and cAMP, in the stimulation of phosphorylase alpha induced by catecholamines was studied in hepatocytes isolated from mature male and female rats. The fractional efflux of 45Ca was used as an index of intracellular calcium activity. Our results show that, in females: 1) the activation of phosphorylase alpha induced by 10(-8) to 10(-5) M epinephrine correlates with a rise in cellular cAMP as well as with an increase in 45Ca fractional efflux, 2) both alpha- and beta-agonists stimulate phosphorylase, 3) neither alpha- nor beta-antagonists effectively block the rise in phosphorylase caused by epinephrine, and 4) propranolol suppresses the rise in cAMP while phenoxybenzamine blocks the rise in calcium efflux. On the other hand, we found that in the male: 1) phosphorylase alpha activity is exclusively correlated with a rise in fractional calcium efflux, 2) epinephrine (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) does not increase cAMP and it causes a greater rise in calcium efflux than in the female at all concentrations, 3) phenylephrine increases calcium efflux and phosphorylase activity without affecting cAMP, 4) phenoxybenzamine totally blocks epinephrine action, and 5) beta-agonists and beta-antagonists are without effects. We conclude that, in females, epinephrine utilizes both alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways which activate phosphorylase by calcium or cAMP, respectively, while, in adult male rats, epinephrine increases phosphorylase alpha activity by an alpha-mediated, calcium-dependent and cAMP-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1518458269,"Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is catabolized by both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent pathways; methylated LDL (MeLDL) is catabolized only by receptor-independent mechanisms. Rats were injected with either LDL or MeLDL labeled with [14C]sucrose and the tissue sites of degradation were determined 24 h later. On degradation, the 14C-labeled ligand remains trapped intracellularly as a cumulative measure of degradation. The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of [14C]sucrose-MeLDL was lower than that of [14C]sucrose-LDL (0.056 +/- 0.015 versus 0.118 +/- 0.025 h-1, p less than 0.01). Liver was the predominant site of catabolism of both LDL and MeLDL; more than 85% of catabolism was attributable to parenchymal cells in both cases. The fraction of the plasma LDL pool cleared per tissue weight per unit of time was determined for individual tissues. The differences in these rates for LDL and MeLDL are an approximation of receptor-mediated uptake of LDL. According to this method, 67.4% of hepatic uptake was attributable to receptors, as was 69.5% of adrenal, 65.4% of ovarian, 52.4% of intestinal, and 44.2% of renal uptake. In other studies, rats were continuously infused with LDL to down-regulate and saturate receptor prior to injection of labeled LDL or MeLDL. Rats infused with LDL exhibited a lower FCR for [14C]sucrose-LDL compared to controls (0.077 versus 0.120 h-1); the FCR for sucrose-MeLDL was unchanged by LDL infusion. The fractional degradation rate of [14C]sucrose-LDL by individual tissues was lowered by LDL infusion in liver, adrenal, ovary, and intestine (41.4, 57.3, 23.1, and 32.4% lower than controls, respectively). The determination of receptor dependency by this independent approach supports the conclusions reached using [14C]sucrose-LDL and [14C]sucrose-MeLDL in normolipemic animals."
https://openalex.org/W1495002664,"A synthetic quinone, 5-n-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole (UHDBT), inhibits electron transfer reactions in the cytochrome b-c1 segment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Addition of UHDBT to isolated succinate-cytochrome c reductase complex has effects on reduction of the cytochromes b and c1 by succinate similar to those which result from removal of the iron-sulfur protein from the b-c1 complex. Thus, UHDBT inhibits reduction of cytochrome c1 by succinate and, if antimycin is added before succinate, UHDBT inhibits reduction of cytochrome b in addition to c1. UHDBT increases the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein of the b-c1 complex from +280 to +350 mV at pH 7.2. The inhibitor also shifts the gx peak in the EPR spectrum of the iron-sulfur protein from g = 1.80 to 1.76 and shifts the gz peak from g = 2.02 to 2.03. It causes only a slight shift in the central gy = 1.90 signal. The efficacy of inhibition of cytochrome c reductase activity of isolated reductase complex by UHDBT appears to depend on the oxidation-reduction poise of some component(s) in the b-c1 complex. Inhibition is decreased and there is an extensive lag in the onset of inhibition under conditions favoring oxidation of the b-c1 complex; inhibition increases and the lag is eliminated under conditions favoring reduction of the b-c1 complex. The titer for inhibition of cytochrome c reductase activity of isolated reductase complex is one UHDBT per b-c1 complex. With reductase complex from which the iron-sulfur protein of the b-c1 complex is reversibly resolved, the titer for inhibition is proportional to the amount of iron-sulfur protein reconstituted to the complex. These results suggest that UHDBT inhibits mitochondrial respiration by binding to the iron-sulfur protein of the b-c1 complex, possibly at a site which is otherwise involved in binding ubiquinone, and that this binding is enhanced when the iron-sulfur protein is reduced."

https://openalex.org/W1480147693,"The purpose of this work has been to examine the organization of the intramembranous portion of the alpha-subunit of membrane-bound (Na,K)-ATPase. Covalent labeling of the alpha-subunit and its tryptic fragments from within the lipid bilayer with [125I]iodonaphthylazide was combined with covalent labeling with 32P from [gamma-33P]ATP at the cytoplasmic surface and with [3H]N-(ouabain)-N'-(2-nitro-4-azidophenyl)ethylenediamine from the extra cellular surface. In control experiments using extensive proteolysis and reduced glutathione, it is confirmed that iodonaphthylazide labels segments of the protein within the lipid bilayer. The labeled segments of the alpha-subunit, produced by extensive proteolysis, are selectively extracted by organic solvents. Both at a low and at a high concentration of iodonaphthylazide, about 50% of label added to the medium is covalently attached to protein and lipid. At the low iodonaphthylazide concentration, the NH2-terminal Mr = 46,000 (46K) fragment of the alpha-subunit is preferentially labeled, while at the higher concentration of the 46K fragment, the 78K fragment, and the COOH-terminal 58K fragment are labeled. 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP is incorporated into the 46K fragment while [3H]N-(ouabain)-N'-(2-nitro-4-azido-phenyl)ethylenediamine from the extracellular surface labels all the major fragments, 78K, 58K, and 46K. The data provide evidence for a model of the path of the polypeptide chain with multiple traverses of the alpha-subunit across the bilayer and the NH2-terminal and three trypsin-sensitive bonds exposed at the cytoplasma surface."
https://openalex.org/W1588442114,"We have examined in some detail the chromatin structure of a 6.2 kilobase pair (kbp) chromosomal region containing the chicken beta-globin gene. The chromatin structure was probed with three nucleases, DNase I, micrococcal nuclease, and DNase II, and the rate of digestion of specific subfragments of the region was compared with the rate of bulk DNA digestion. We have characterized the rate of digestion of each fragment in terms of a sensitivity factor which measures the sensitivity of a fragment to a particular nuclease relative to bulk DNA. The sensitivity factors were determined by a least squares curve fitting method based on target analysis. In nuclei isolated from 14-day-old chicken embryo red blood cells, the entire 6.2-kbp region shows approximately a 10- to 20-fold increase in sensitivity to DNase I, a 3-fold increased sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease, and a 6-fold increased sensitivity to DNase II. In addition to the adult beta-globin gene, this region contains 5' and 3' flanking sequences, the 5' half of the inactive, embryonic globin gene, epsilon, and some repeated sequences. There is no obvious correlation between these genetic elements and the overall chromatin structure as measured by the nuclease sensitivity. This same region shows little or no special sensitivity in nuclei isolated from 14-day-old chicken embryo brain. Furthermore, fragments of the inactive ovalbumin gene show little or no sensitivity in either red blood cells or brain. These results support the conclusion that the entire 6.2-kbp region is largely packaged as active chromatin in 14-day-old chicken embryo red blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W1589368915,"The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of chloroperoxidase Compound I and native enzyme are compared. Upon the formation of Compound I, the g = 2.62, 2.26, and 1.82 signals associated with native enzyme disappear and are replaced by two new EPR signals, a sharp signal at g = 2.008 and a broad signal at g = 1.73. The g = 2.008 signal accounts for only 2% of the theoretical spins while the broad signal at g = 1.73 accounts for 60 to 70% of the theoretical spins in Compound I. The g = 1.73 broad signal is reminiscent of the broad EPR signal associated with horseradish peroxidase Compound I. however, the chloroperoxidase Compound I signal has a significantly different g value. The results suggest that the g = 1.73 signal represents a porphyrin pi cation radical which has a stronger coupling to the heme ferryl iron than is the case with horseradish peroxidase Compound I."
https://openalex.org/W1509852412,"Five modifications of the preparative procedure for isolating iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) from the molybdenum-iron (MoFe) protein of Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase have been developed. This variety of isolation methods has established that no single component of the original isolation protocol, i.e. Tris, Cl-, citrate, HPO4(2-), N,N-dimethylformamide, and N-methylformamide, is essential for the effective isolation and/or structural stability of FeMoco, although any of them may act as ligands to FeMoco when present. The acid-bse status (effective pH) of the extracting solvent is a key adjustable parameter in the isolation procedure. The new procedures produced FeMoco with yields, metal analysis, charge, EPR spectrum, and specific activity (after reconstituting crude extracts from A. vinelandii UW45 mutant cells) essentially identical with FeMoco isolated by the original procedure. After purification, FeMoco apparently contains molybdenum, iron, and sulfide in a 1:7:4 ratio with N-methylformamide as a ligand but no amino acid residues, common sugars, coenzyme A, or lipoic acid. Reaction with o-phenanthroline allows quantitation of both adventitious and FeMoco-associated iron. Correlations of total activity after UW45 reconstitution with molybdenum, total iron, and o-phenanthroline-resistant iron contents show that only the last gives a consistent relationship of 35 +/- 5 nmol of C2H4/min/ng atom of Fe. Both o-phenanthroline and EDTA interact with FeMoco to abolish its EPR signal in reactions reversible by additions of Fe2+ or Zn2+, respectively. These and related reactions point against the presence of an endogenous organic component in FeMoco and toward the presence of exogenous ligands and imply a relatively labile coordination sphere whose nature may be determinable by a systematic investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1526682279,"The effect of hydroxyperoxyoctadecadienoic acid, e.g. 13-hydroperoxy-cis,9,trans-11-octadecadienoic acid, on the autooxidation of linoleic acid induced by superoxide radical was examined in a system containing xanthine oxidase, acetaldehyde, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid dissolved in an aqueous phosphate buffer containing 10% ethanol. The superoxide radical is required for autooxidation, as shown by essentially complete inhibition on the addition of superoxide dismutase. Pure linoleic acid was not readily oxidized, but the addition of lipid hydroperoxide markedly stimulated the autooxidation. Addition of 2.8 microM FeCl3 did not produce an increase in the rate of xanthine oxidase-induced autooxidation. Spontaneous autooxidation, a process slower than xanthine oxidase-induced autooxidation, was detectable on the time scale of these observations but was slower than the xanthine oxidase-induced autooxidation. Initiation of linoleic acid autooxidation is postulated to result from a reaction between superoxide and lipid hydroperoxide. The nature of this reaction is uncertain, but it does not appear to depend on iron catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1482092913,"A stable cell line derived from mouse bone (cell line MMB-1) has been used for studies of the cellular receptor for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in osteoblasts. Previous studies have demonstrated that collagen synthesis in the MMB-1 cell line is specifically inhibited by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 as well as by other bone-regulating hormones. Incubation of cell homogenates with [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 indicated the presence of a specific receptor which was located primarily in the chromatin fraction. Optimum conditions for the receptor assay required the inclusion of 500 kallikrein-inactivating units of Trasylol/ml and 10 mM NaMoO4. Under these conditions the receptors were stable for 2 h at 23 degrees C and for 24 h at 4 degrees C. Cellular content of receptors was dependent upon the state of confluency of the cells: fully confluent cells contained minimal concentrations of receptors. In cultures of 70-80% confluency, the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors demonstrated linear Scatchard plots with Kd = 0.4 nM. Peak receptor activity was found at 3.7 S in linear sucrose gradient fractions of cell homogenates. The synthesis of collagen by MMB-1 cells was inhibited by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in direct proportion to the concentration of cellular receptors at varying levels of culture confluence. The data indicate that MMB-1 cells contain cytoplasmic/nuclear receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 which are similar to the receptors found in other target tissues for this hormone and suggest that these receptors are mediators of the effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on collagen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1530556621,"Complex III was isolated and purified from bakers' yeast by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography on Ultrogel AcA 34. The purified complex contained 7.03 nmol/mg of protein and 4.24 nmol/mg of protein of cytochromes b and c1, respectively. The specific activity of the complex was 17.1 mumol/min/mg of protein, using the decyl analog of coenzyme Q as substrate. Electrophoresis of the purified complex revealed the presence of seven polypeptides with molecular weights ranging from 15,500 to 50,000. Polypeptides having molecular weights lower than 15,000 were not observed, except when the complex was dissociated in the absence of proteolytic inhibitors, suggesting that these low molecular weight species arise as a result of proteolytic digestion of the complex. The isoelectric points of the subunits of complex III and their stoichiometry wee determined. Trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion of the oxidized and reduced forms of the isolated complex suggested that the two high molecular weight core proteins are embedded within the complex and hence are inaccessible to the exogenous proteases, while cytochromes b and c1, the iron-sulfur protein, and the 17,500-dalton subunit are substantially exposed to the surface of the complex. The iron-sulfur protein appears to undergo a conformational change upon reduction of the complex, rendering it less susceptible to trypsin digestion. The core proteins and the iron-sulfur protein were purified, and antibodies against these proteins were raised. Immunoinhibition studies with these antibodies also indicated that the antigenic sites of the core proteins were embedded in the complex."
https://openalex.org/W1541490236,"Rat steroidogenic tissues take up cholesterol, and it has been suggested that this process plays a regulatory role in steroid hormone synthesis. To provide evidence for this hypothesis, we carried out studies in lipoprotein-deficient rats. Lipoprotein deficiency, achieved by treating male rats with pharmacological amounts of estradiol, led to profound lowering of plasma cholesterol (8 +/- 2 versus 54 +/- 4 mg/dl) and adrenal cholesteryl ester content (113 +/- 57 versus 747 +/- 108 micrograms/organ). Basal serum corticosterone levels were decreased by 50%, and the response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was totally abolished. Injection of high density lipoprotein (HDL) to estradiol-treated animals restored the response of corticosterone to ACTH. Comparable in vitro studies with adrenal cell suspensions obtained from lipoprotein-deficient rats confirmed the in vivo data. Measurement of [14C]acetate incorporation and uptake of both HDL- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in these adrenal cells showed a progressive increase with the duration of estradiol treatment, and neither of these two phenomena was altered by ACTH. These results provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for the hypothesis that normal adrenal steroidogenesis depends upon cholesterol delivery from plasma. Furthermore, under the conditions studied, ACTH does not stimulate adrenal de novo cholesterol biosynthesis nor the uptake of either HDL- or LDL-cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1570115519,"Prostaglandin (PG) release from rat inner medullary tissue has been shown to be stimulated by angiotensin II, bradykinin, and arginine vasopressin. PG release from inner medullary has also been demonstrated to be a Ca2+-dependent process. We performed the following studies in an attempt to determine the mechanism by which angiotensin II stimulates PG release and to identify the lipid source serving as the donor for arachidonic acid (AA) in the Ca2+-dependent reaction. After 5 min of incubation, slices of inner medulla prelabeled with [14C]AA released 2.0-fold as much radiolabel into the media in the presence of Ca2+ as in the absence of Ca2+. After 30 min of incubation, the neutral lipids lost 6.1% of their [14C]AA label, phosphatidylethanolamine lost 12.5%, phosphatidylcholine 13.3%, and phosphatidylinotisol (P[I) 27%. The divalent ionophore A23187 (5 microM) increased 3.7-fold the formation of immunoassayable prostaglandin E2 at 30 min in the presence of Ca2+. Angiotensin II increased immunoassayable PGE2 formation 1.3-fold at 2 min and 1.5- to 1.8-fold by 30 min. In addition, angiotensin II rapidly increased the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate to significantly higher values into PI, phosphatidic acid, diphosphoinositol, and triphosphoinositol by 30 s, returning to control values by 2 min of incubation. The data suggest that PI may be a major source of arachidonic acid in the Ca2+-dependent release of PG, that angiotensin II stimulates a smaller or different pool of AA release than the divalent ionophore, and the angiotensin II stimulation of PG is a Ca2+-mediated process associated with increased phosphatidylinositol-polyphosphoinositide turnover in the rat inner medulla."
https://openalex.org/W1508437467,"A myosin phosphatase has been purified to homogeneity from bovine aortic smooth muscle. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme eluted from nondenaturing gels revealed two subunits (Mr = 67,000 and 38,000). Densitometric scans of the subunits indicated a molar ratio of 1:1. Several phosphoproteins were substrates for the phosphatase including histone II-A, isolated 20,000-dalton smooth muscle myosin light chains, phosphorylase a, and smooth muscle myosin. In the presence of 0.25 M NaCl and a substrate concentration of 2 microM, myosin was preferentially dephosphorylated. The specific activity of the phosphatase for myosin at a concentration of 10 microM was found to be 5 mumol/mg/min. The phosphatase required Mn2+ or Co2+ ions for activity. Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mg-ATP would not substitute for Mn2+ or Co2+ at equimolar concentrations. This phosphatase may play an important role in regulating actin-myosin interaction in smooth muscle by serving to dephosphorylate myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1569927643,"When radiolabeled serine is incubated with a particulate fraction from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, radioactivity is incorporated initially into phosphatidylserine and gradually appears in phosphatidylethanolamine. Because decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine is blocked by hydroxylamine, phosphatidylserine synthase can be assayed separately. The yeast phosphatidylserine synthase activity 1) exhibits a divalent cation requirement; 2) is stimulated by exogenous CDP-diolein (apparent Km = 0.17 mM); 3) has an apparent Km = 4 mM for L-serine; 4) has a neutral pH optimum; 5) is inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate; and 6) is reversible in the presence of 5'-CMP, but not 2'-CMP, 3'-CMP, or 5'-AMP. The phospholipid-synthesizing activity is solubilized with Triton X-100 and the enzymatic parameters have been compared with the particulate form of the enzyme. Detergent extracts catalyze the conversion of exogenous purified [31P]CDP-diglyceride to [32P]phosphatidylserine in the presence of Mn2+ and L-serine. Enzyme preparations from cells grown in the presence of choline, that have reduced phospholipid methylation activity (Waechter, C. J., Steiner, M. R., and Lester, R. L. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3419-3422), also have substantially less phosphatidylserine synthase activity compared to identical preparations grown in the absence of choline. When choline, phosphocholine, CDP-choline, and phosphatidylcholine are present in vitro, there is no direct inhibitory effect on phosphatidylserine synthase activity. While the inclusion of choline in the growth medium caused a significant reduction in phosphatidylserine synthase activity, it did not appreciably effect the apparent Km values for L-serine and CDP-diglyceride. These results are consistent with choline-grown cells containing less phosphatidylserine synthase activity because of lower amounts of enzyme present or perhaps less active enzyme due to covalent modification."

https://openalex.org/W1491790057,"Three mutations, each of which causes overproduction of iso-2-cytochrome c, were characterized biochemically. Two, CYP3-4 and CYP3-15, were previously shown to be cis-dominant and map to the CYC7 locus which encodes the iso-2 protein, while the third, cyp1-16, maps to an unliked locus. All three mutations caused dramatically increased levels of transcription of the CYC7 gene, and the CYC7 mRNA in mutant cells was found to be the same size as that in wild type cells. The CYP3-4 mutation was found to be caused by the integration of a transposable element, Tyl, 269 base pairs 5' to the coding sequences. The CYP3-15 mutation was also found to alter the DNA, probably through a deletion or inversion with one endpoint 285 base pairs upstream from the coding sequence. The CYC7 gene in both wild type and mutant cells was not subject to catabolite repression."

https://openalex.org/W1530480814,"Single strand specific mung bean nuclease was used to probe for regions of altered secondary structure in supercoiled PM2 DNA. Supercoiled DNA is cleaved greater than or equal to 10,000 times faster than the relaxed topoisomer. Catalytic quantities of enzyme convert supercoiled DNA to both nicked-circular and unit length linear forms at pH 5 but to predominantly the nicked-circular form near neutral pH. At the elevated enzyme concentrations required to cleave relaxed DNA, unit length linear DNA and smaller fragments are produced from pH 5 to 7. One nick per supercoiled DNA molecule is introduced at pH 6.6. The nicks are repairable by DNA ligase and are not strand-specific. Snake venom phosphodiesterase selectively cleaves the strand opposite the nicks, permitting restriction endonuclease mapping. The nicks occur at three specific sites. Sites at 0.75 and 0.76 map units are cleaved with equal frequency, while a site at 0.82 is cleaved less frequently. The former sites map near one of the eight known early denaturation regions of PM2 DNA, while the latter does not. Since most early denaturation sites are not cleaved, sites other than these dA + dT-rich regions may be the preferred locations of strand unwinding and separation in supercoiled PM2 DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1549724659,"Tubulin was first treated with alkaline phosphatase-agarose to vacate the exchangeable nucleotide binding site and then tested for manganese binding sites by Mn(II) EPR. Buttlaire et al. ((1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2164-2168) have shown that high affinity manganese binding occurs at a single site normally occupied by magnesium. We report that the number of high affinity manganese binding sites per mol of tubulin depends on the number of occupied exchangeable nucleotide binding sites. Thus, removal of nucleotides results in a loss of high affinity manganese binding sites. The EPR spectra of manganese bound to tubulin and to GTP are found to be qualitatively similar. These data indicate that high affinity manganese binding is the result of the formation of a metal-nucleotide complex at the exchangeable nucleotide binding site. In addition it was found that zinc, cobalt, and magnesium bind with approximately equal affinity to this site whereas calcium binds only weakly."
https://openalex.org/W1568293155,"T4 DNA polymerase converts (Sp)-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-(1-thio[1-18O2]triphosphate) to 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-[18O]-phosphorothioate in the presence of poly(d(A-T).poly(d(A-T)) template-primer. Control experiments involving either omitting the poly(d(A-T)).poly(d(A-T) template-primer or employing the (Rp)-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) diastereomer showed no reaction. It is assumed, therefore, that this conversion as in the P--O case involves incorporation of the thionucleotide into the poly(d(A-T)) followed by hydrolysis resulting from the 3' goes to 5'-exonuclease activity. The 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-[18O] phosphorothioate was converted to (Sp)-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-O-(1-thio[1-18O]triphosphate), with no change in the configuration at P alpha by using the coupled adenylate kinase-pyruvate kinase enzyme system. A 31P NMR spectrum of the product showed that the 18O was entirely in the nonbridging position, indicating an overall retention in the net turnover process (i.e. incorporation followed by excision). Since the incorporation process involves an inversion of configuration around the phosphorus (Romaniuk, P. J., and Eckstein, F. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7684-7688), it must be inferred that the 3' goes to 5'-exonuclease activity of T4 polymerase proceeds with inversion of configuration at the phosphorus atom, most simply via a direct displacement mechanism. This finding represents the first example of phosphodiester hydrolysis catalyzed by an exonuclease that does not involve a covalent phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate (Knowles, J. R. (1980) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 49, 877-919)."

https://openalex.org/W1498972643,"The binding of calcium ions by the isolated asialoglycoprotein receptor of hepatocytes and the inter-relationship between the calcium ion concentration and receptor function have been studied. The isolated receptor binds calcium ions only in the presence of asialoglycoprotein. The asialo-glycoprotein receptor complex binds 4 calcium ions; the binding exhibits marked positive cooperativity, and the association constant at half-saturation of the binding sites was of the order of 10*5) M-1 as determined from a Hill plot. The isolated receptor was almost saturated at a calcium ion concentration of 0.1 mM. The binding capacity of isolated hepatocytes for asialo-glycoproteins increased, however, even when the calcium concentration was increased above this level. This may be explained by the exposure of increasing numbers of functional receptors on the surface of the cell with increasing membrane potential, and this explanation is supported by analogous observations in the presence of 5 mM La3+."

https://openalex.org/W1507240357,"We have determined that the restriction endonuclease Eco RI contains 1.0 ± 0.1 eq of zinc/monomeric enzyme. DNA cleavage by Eco RI is inhibited by ortho-phenanthroline after preincubation of the enzyme with the chelating agent. A similar inhibition by the nonchelating meta-phenanthroline is not seen. The sensitivity of the inhibition by the neutral ligand ortho-phenanthroline to preincubation is consistent with the tightly bound and inaccessible nature of the metal site. Extensive dialysis against the ortho-phenanthroline inhibitor leads to the release of the bound metal with the concomitant loss of enzyme activity. The tightly bound Zn^(2+) cation, then, appears to be necessary for enzyme function. The finding of zinc in Eco RI further illustrates the ubiquity of Zn^(2+) to DNA-protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1552940826,"A DNase, designated Exonuclease II, has been purified 2,000-fold from whole cell extracts of bakers' yeast. It degrades single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA. The enzyme has a pH optimum around 8 and requires at least 2 mM Mg2+ for activity. It is slightly stimulated by dithiothreitol and inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting that --SH groups are essential for activity; heparin also inhibits the activity. With 0.1 enzyme unit the Km has been determined to 4 nM of DNA ends and Vmax to 0.52 pmol of liberated nucleotides per min. The Mr is around 120,000. The enzyme does not degrade circular single-stranded M13 DNA, whereas linearized M13 DNA is degraded. The products are 5'-deoxyribomononucleotides exclusively. Using 5'-end labeled and 3'-end labeled DNA fragments as substrates, partially degraded DNA is only detectable in the latter case, showing that the exonuclease solely attacks DNA from the 5'-end. This distinguishes Exonuclease II from other exonucleases degrading DNA from the 5'-end, since they all either produce a mixture of 5'-mono- and oligonucleotides or 3'-mononucleotides. Analysis of 3'-end labeled fragments after incubation shows that the rate of exonucleolytic cleavage was dependent on the DNA sequence at the 5'-end."
