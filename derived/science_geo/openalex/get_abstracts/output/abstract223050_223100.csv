Our understanding of the IL-1 family has recently expanded to include six novel members named IL-1F5 to IL-1F10. Recently, it was reported that IL-1F9 activated NF-ÎşB through the orphan receptor IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)-related protein 2 (IL-1Rrp2) in Jurkat cells (Debets, R., Timans, J. C., Homey, B., Zurawski, S., Sana, T. R., Lo, S., Wagner, J., Edwards, G., Clifford, T., Menon, S., Bazan, J. F., and Kastelein, R. A. (2001) J. Immunol. 167, 1440â€“1446). In this study, we demonstrate that IL-1F6 and IL-1F8, in addition to IL-1F9, activate the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB in an IL-1Rrp2-dependent manner in Jurkat cells as well as in multiple other human and mouse cell lines. Activation of the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB by IL-1F6 and IL-1F8 follows a similar time course to activation by IL-1Î˛, suggesting that signaling by the novel family members occurs through a direct mechanism. In a mammary epithelial cell line, NCI/ADR-RES, which naturally expresses IL-1Rrp2, all three cytokines signal without further receptor transfection. IL-1Rrp2 antibodies block activation of the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB by IL-1F6, IL-1F8, and IL-1F9 in both Jurkat and NCI/ADR-RES cells. In NCI/ADR-RES cells, the three IL-1 homologs activated the MAPKs, JNK and ERK1/2, and activated downstream targets as well, including an IL-8 promoter reporter and the secretion of IL-6. We also provide evidence that IL-1RAcP, in addition to IL-1Rrp2, is required for signaling by all three cytokines. Antibodies directed against IL-1RAcP and transfection of cytoplasmically deleted IL-1RAcP both blocked activation of the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB by the three cytokines. We conclude that IL-1F6, IL-1F8, and IL-1F9 signal through IL-1Rrp2 and IL-1RAcP. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) plays a prominent role in immune and inflammatory reactions.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1)Â 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; IL-1RAcP or AcP, accessory protein; AcPL, accessory protein-like; IL-1Rrp2 or rp2, IL-1R-related protein 2; IL-1R, IL-1 receptor; IL-18R, IL-18 receptor; IL-1ra, IL-1 receptor antagonist; SIGIRR, single Ig IL-1R-related molecule; F5â€“F9, IL-1F5 to IL-1F9, respectively; MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TIR, Toll-IL-1R; AcP-/-MEF, AcP null mouse embryonic fibroblast; CT, cycle threshold; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. is a pleiotropic cytokine that is involved in the initiation of immune and inflammatory responses in virtually every tissue in the body. IL-1 exerts its effects through activation of a set of transcription factors including NF-ÎşB and AP-1, as well as MAPKs such as JNK and p38, leading to the production of numerous cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and enzymes (e.g. cycloxygenase and nitric-oxide synthetase) (2Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. Science's STKE. 2003; 171 (re3)Google Scholar). The activity of IL-1 resides in two separate cytokines, IL-1Î± and IL-1Î˛, which bind to the same receptor and initiate identical responses. Binding of IL-1Î± and IL-1Î˛ to the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) results in recruitment of the IL-1R homolog, IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1RAcP or AcP), which does not directly bind the ligands but is required for signal transduction (3Sims J.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 117-122Google Scholar). A third IL-1 family member, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), negatively regulates IL-1 activity by competing with IL-1 for binding to the receptor. Binding of IL-1ra to the IL-1R does not result in the recruitment of AcP and therefore does not generate a signal (4Dinarello C.A. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 457-499Google Scholar). An additional level of regulation of IL-1 activity is imposed by the type II IL-1R, which binds to and sequesters IL-1 but does not signal. Based on sequence similarity, gene structure, and predicted tertiary structure, IL-18 is also part of the IL-1 family of ligands. IL-18 is a cytokine acting on Th1 and NK cells, which induces interferon-Îł production, especially in combination with IL-12 (5Micallef M.J. Ohtsuki T. Kohno K. Tanabe F. Ushio S. Namba M. Tanimoto T. Torigoe K. Fujii M. Ikeda M. Fukuda S. Kurimoto M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1647-1651Google Scholar, 6Yoshimoto T. Takeda K. Tanaka T. Ohkusu K. Kashiwamura S. Okamura H. Akira S. Nakanishi K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3400-3407Google Scholar, 7Okamura H. Tsutsi H. Komatsu T. Yutsudo M. Hakura A. Tanimoto T. Torigoe K. Okura T. Nukada Y. Hattori K. Akita K. Motoshi N. Tanabe F. Konishi K. Fukuda S. Kurimoto M. Nature. 1995; 378: 88-91Google Scholar). Signaling by IL-18 is very similar to signaling by IL-1Î±/Î˛ although IL-18 utilizes a completely different receptor. IL-18 binds to an IL-1R family member, IL-1R-related protein (rp1 or IL-18R), and as with IL-1, IL-18 signaling is dependent upon association of a second IL-1R family member, IL-1RAcPL (or AcPL for AcP-like) (8Born T.L. Thomassen E. Bird T.A. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29445-29450Google Scholar). A soluble IL-18-binding protein acts as a negative regulator of IL-18 activity by binding to and sequestering IL-18 (9Novick D. Kim S.H. Fantuzzi G. Reznikov L.L. Dinarello C.A. Rubinstein M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 127-136Google Scholar). Recently, six new members of the IL-1 family have been identified primarily through use of DNA data base searches for homologs to IL-1. These proteins are termed IL-1F5 to IL-1F10 and are classified as IL-1 family members based on amino acid sequence similarity, identity of gene structure, and predicted or known three-dimensional structure (3Sims J.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 117-122Google Scholar, 10Sims J.E. Nicklin M.J. Bazan J.F. Barton J.L. Busfield S.J. Ford J.E. Kastelein R.A. Kumar S. Lin H. Mulero J.J. Pan J. Pan Y. Smith D.E.

Gearing D.P. O'Neill L.A. Pei X.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10938-10944Google Scholar). All of the new genes map to human chromosome 2 as do IL-1Î±, IL-1Î˛, and IL-1ra. The genes for IL-1F5 to IL-1F10 are located between the IL-1Î˛ and the IL-1ra loci (11Dunn E. Sims J.E. Nicklin M.J. O'Neill L.A. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 533-536Google Scholar, 13Nicklin M.J.

Genomics. 2002; 79: 726-733Google Scholar), suggesting that they arose from a common ancestral gene that later became duplicated. Little is known about the receptors, signaling, or function of these new IL-1 family members. IL-1F7 (F7) has been reported to bind to IL-18R with low affinity but does not result in the formation of a ternary complex with AcPL and does not produce any IL-18-like signaling activities (15Pan G. Risser P. Mao W. Baldwin D.T. Zhong A.W. Filvaroff E. Yansura D. Lewis L. Eigenbrot C. Henzel W.J. Vandlen R. Cytokine. 2001; 13: 1-7Google Scholar, 16Kumar S. Hanning C.R. Brigham-Burke M.R. Rieman D.J. Lehr R. Khandekar S. Kirkpatrick R.B. Scott G.F. Lee J.C. Lynch F.J. Gao W. Gambotto A. Lotze M.T. Cytokine. 2002; 18: 61-71Google Scholar). F7 also does not antagonize IL-18 through binding to the IL-18R; therefore, the significance of this interaction is unknown (16Kumar S. Hanning C.R. Brigham-Burke M.R. Rieman D.J. Lehr R. Khandekar S. Kirkpatrick R.B. Scott G.F. Lee J.C. Lynch F.J. Gao W. Gambotto A. Lotze M.T. Cytokine. 2002; 18: 61-71Google Scholar). Others have reported that F7 binds to IL-18-binding protein and enhances the ability of IL-18-binding protein to inhibit IL-18 activities (17Bufler P. Azam T. Gamboni-Robertson F. Reznikov L.L. Kumar S. Dinarello C.A. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13723-13728Google Scholar). Recently, F7 was shown to have anti-tumor effects following adenoviral gene transfer of F7 into murine fibrosarcomas (18Gao W. Kumar S. Lotze M.T. Hanning C. Robbins P.D. Gambotto A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 107-113Google Scholar). Even less is known about the activities of the other new IL-1 family members. IL-1F10 has been reported to bind to soluble IL-1R, but the significance of this interaction is unknown (19Lin H. Ho A.S. Haley-Vicente D. Zhang J. Bernal-Fussell J. Pace A.M. Hansen D. Schweighofer K. Mize N.K. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20597-20602Google Scholar). No binding of IL-1F5, IL-1F6, IL-1F8, or IL-1F9 to any IL-1R homolog has been demonstrated to date. However, IL-1F9 (F9) was reported to activate NF-ÎşB through the orphan receptor, IL-1R-related protein 2 (IL-1Rrp2 or rp2), and IL-1F5 potently antagonized this response (1Debets R. Timans J.C. Homey B. Zurawski S. Sana T.R. Lo S. Wagner J. Edwards G. Clifford T. Menon S. Bazan J.F. Kastelein R.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1440-1446Google Scholar). No binding, interactions, or signaling have been reported for IL-1F6 (F6) or IL-1F8 (F8). Similar to the IL-1 family of ligands, there are multiple IL-1R homologs, many of which are orphans. The IL-1R family members are characterized by the presence of three extracellular immunoglobulin domains and an intracellular Toll-IL-1R (TIR) domain, which they share with the 10 mammalian Toll-like receptors, Drosophila Toll and 18-Wheeler, and several recently identified adaptor molecules involved in IL-1R/Toll-like receptor signaling (2Dunne A. O'Neill L.A. Science's STKE. 2003; 171 (re3)Google Scholar). Other than IL-1R, AcP, and the IL-18 receptors, IL-18R and AcPL, the IL-1R family contains the orphan receptors IL-1Rrp2, T1/ST2, TIGIRR, APL, and single Ig IL-1R-related molecule (SIGIRR) (3Sims J.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 117-122Google Scholar). There is no known ligand for T1/ST2; however, it is expressed on type 2 T helper cells and appears to play a role in the regulation of type 2 T helper cell function (20Coyle A.J. Lloyd C. Tian J. Nguyen T. Erikkson C. Wang L. Ottoson P. Persson P. Delaney T. Lehar S. Lin S. Poisson L. Meisel C. Kamradt T. Bjerke T. Levinson D. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 895-902Google Scholar, 21Walzl G. Matthews S. Kendall S. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Coyle A.J. Openshaw P.J. Hussell T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 785-792Google Scholar, 22Lohning M. Stroehmann A. Coyle A.J. Grogan J.L. Lin S. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Levinson D. Radbruch A. Kamradt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6930-6935Google Scholar). TIGIRR and APL are located on the X-chromosome and share a high degree of sequence similarity (23Born T.L. Smith D.E. Garka K.E. Renshaw B.R. Bertles J.S. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41528Google Scholar). There is no known ligand for TIGIRR or APL. APL is expressed in the brain, and mutations in APL are associated with a nonsyndromic X-linked mental retardation (24Carrie A. Jun L. Bienvenu T. Vinet M.C. McDonell N. Couvert P. Zemni R. Cardona A. Van Buggenhout G. Frints S. Hamel B. Moraine C. Ropers H.H. Strom T. Howell G.R. Whittaker A. Ross M.T. Kahn A. Fryns J.P. Beldjord C. Marynen P. Chelly J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 25-31Google Scholar). SIGIRR differs from the other IL-1R family members in that it contains only one immunoglobulin domain in its extracellular region (25Thomassen E. Renshaw B.R. Sims J.E. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 389-399Google Scholar). In addition, SIGIRR along with TIGIRR and APL have unusually long cytoplasmic domains with roughly 100 additional amino acids at their carboxyl termini, reminiscent of the structure of Drosophila Toll. There is no known ligand for SIGIRR, but recent evidence suggests that SIGIRR plays an inhibitory role in IL-1 signaling (26Wald D. Qin J. Zhao Z. Qian Y. Naramura M. Tian L. Towne J. Sims J.E. Stark G.R. Li X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 920-927Google Scholar). Chimeric molecules of the IL-1R family members containing the extracellular and transmembrane domain of either IL-1R or AcP and the cytoplasmic domain of each IL-1R family member have been constructed (23Born T.L. Smith D.E. Garka K.E. Renshaw B.R. Bertles J.S. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41528Google Scholar). These molecules were expressed in every possible combination, and the ability of each receptor chimera combination to activate NF-ÎşB following IL-1 stimulation was assessed. Through these experiments, the IL-1R family member cytoplasmic domains were characterized as IL-1R-like (primary receptor) or AcP-like (accessory receptor). IL-1R, IL-18R, IL-1Rrp2, and T1/ST2 were classified as IL-1-like, whereas only AcP and AcPL were characterized as AcP-like. TIGIRR, APL, and SIGIRR did not fall into either category. IL-1F9 has recently been demonstrated to activate NF-ÎşB in Jurkat T cells in an IL-1Rrp2-dependent manner (1Debets R. Timans J.C. Homey B. Zurawski S. Sana T.R. Lo S. Wagner J. Edwards G. Clifford T. Menon S. Bazan J.F. Kastelein R.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1440-1446Google Scholar). We were able to replicate these results and extend them to demonstrate that F6 and F8 were also able to activate the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB in Jurkat cells transfected with rp2 but not with other IL-1R family members. Transfection of rp2 into a number of different human and mouse cell lines conferred responsiveness to F6, F8, and F9. We identified a cell line that naturally responds to F6, F8, and F9 in an rp2-dependent manner. In addition, F6, F8, and F9 were demonstrated to activate similar signaling responses to IL-1 including activation of MAPKs and secretion of cytokines. We also provide evidence that signaling by F6, F8, and F9 not only is dependent upon rp2 but also requires the accessory protein, AcP. Identification of the receptor subunits involved in signaling through the previously orphan ligands, F6 and F8, will direct experiments designed to assess the role of F6, F8, and F9 in physiology. Biological Reagents and Cell Cultureâ€”Recombinant human IL-1Î˛ and murine IL-3 were produced at Amgen Corp. (Seattle, WA). Recombinant human IL-18 was provided by Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Human and murine IL-1F6, IL-1F8, and IL-1F9 were cloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusions. A Factor Xa recognition sequence was placed immediately upstream of the first methionine of each IL-1F gene. The resulting constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B by induction with 100 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î˛-d-galactopyranoside. Lysates from cultures were run over glutathione-Sepharose (Novagen, Madison, WI) columns to capture the glutathione S-transferase/IL-1F fusion proteins and then subjected to on-column cleavage with Factor Xa (Novagen). The cleaved IL-1F proteins were eluted with PBS, and the Factor Xa was removed using a specific affinity agarose (Novagen). The IL-1F proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75HR column. Purified proteins were then quantitated by amino acid analysis. The Jurkat E6.1 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA), HepG2 (ATCC), and BA/F3 (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, and antibiotics. BA/F3 cells were supplemented with 50 ng/ml murine IL-3. NCI/ADR-RES cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS, glutamine, and antibiotics. IL-1RAcP null MEFs (AcP-/-MEFs) are primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts generated from the IL-1RAcP knockout mice (27Cullinan E.B. Kwee L. Nunes P. Shuster D.J. Ju G. McIntyre K.W. Chizzonite R.A. Labow M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5614-5620Google Scholar), which were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories induced mutant resource program. The IL-1RAcP null MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, glutamine, and antibiotics. Rabbit anti-phospho-ERK, anti-total ERK, anti-phospho-JNK, and anti-total JNK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

The murine IL-1RAcP cytoplasmic deletion construct contains amino acids 1â€“400 of murine IL-1RAcP (GenBankâ„˘ accession number NP_032390), and the human IL-1RAcP cytoplasmic deletion contains amino acids 1â€“386 of human IL-1RAcP (GenBankâ„˘ accession number NP_002173). Both deletion constructs were subcloned into pDC304. The LacZ plasmid encodes Î˛-galactosidase driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter subcloned into the pDC304 vector. The IL-8 promoter reporter plasmid consists of nucleotides -130 to +44 of the human IL-8 promoter (36Gayle M.A. Slack J.L. Bonnert T.P. Renshaw B.R. Sonoda G. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5784-5789Google Scholar) fused to luciferase in the pGL2 Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Reporter Assaysâ€”Jurkat E6.1 cells (1 Ă— 106) and HepG2 cells (4 Ă— 105) were transiently transfected via FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were transfected with 200 ng of reporter plasmid and 400 ng of receptor or Î˛-galactosidase plasmids with a 1:3 DNA/FuGENE 6 ratio. NCI/ADR-RES cells (7 Ă— 105) were transfected with 500 ng of reporter plasmid alone with a 1:3 DNA/FuGENE 6 ratio. AcP-/-MEFs (4 Ă— 104) were transfected with 50 ng of reporter plasmid and 75 ng of each receptor or Î˛-galactosidase plasmids with a 1:3 DNA/FuGENE 6 ratio. BA/F3 cells (2 Ă— 106) were transfected via electroporation with 2 ÎĽg of reporter plasmid and 4 ÎĽg of receptor or Î˛-galactosidase plasmids. Twenty hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with the indicated cytokines for 5 h (Jurkat cells) or 6 h (HepG2, BA/F3, AcP-/-MEF, and NCI/ADR-RES cells). Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assessed using reporter lysis buffer (Promega) (Jurkat and BA/F3 cells) or passive lysis buffer (Promega) (HepG2, NCI/ADR-RES and AcP-/-MEF cells) and luciferase assay reagent (Promega). All results reported represent duplicate samples in each of at least two independent experiments. In the antibody-blocking reporter assays, Jurkat or NCI/ADR-RES cells were transfected as above. Twenty hours after transfection, cells were preincubated with the anti-human IL-1Rrp2 mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody M145 or M146 (Amgen) or the anti-human IL-1RAcP mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody, M49 (Amgen) for 15 min before the addition of the indicated ligands. Anti-human IL-1R type II or anti-human CD40 ligand (CD40L) mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (Amgen) were used as irrelevant control antibodies in this assay. F6 Antibody Depletionâ€”Human F6 was diluted to 360 ng/ml in Jurkat cell medium. 3-ml aliquots of each dilution were incubated with 75 ÎĽg of either mouse-anti-human IL-1F6 antibody M624 (Amgen), mouse-anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Amgen), or PBS alone. 160 ÎĽl of 2Ă— protein G-agarose was added to each and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The immune complexes were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were transferred to a new tube. This procedure was repeated five times with the last incubation at 4 Â°C for 17 h. The samples were assayed via Western blot for removal of human F6 using a specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Amgen) to F6. Expression Analysisâ€”For the human tissue expression analyses, commercially available RNAs (Ambion (Austin, TX), Clontech, and Stratagene) were utilized. RNAs were DNase-treated (Ambion) and reverse transcribed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications using random hexamers to prime. Samples were distributed on plates at 20 ng/well and run in triplicate. TaqMan primer/probe sets for the control genes and F6, F8, F9, and rp2 were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Forward and reverse primer concentrations for all primer sets were optimized. 6-Carboxyfluorescein-labeled probe (Applied Biosystems) was used at 200 nm. Threshold cycle values (CT) were determined using Sequence Detector software (Applied Biosystems) and transformed to 2-Î”CT for relative expression comparison of rp2, F6, F8, or F9 with control. For reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using the Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer's instruction using random primers (Invitrogen). cDNAs were then amplified for the IL-1Rs using primers that span introns and HotStar Taqâ„˘ Master Mix (Qiagen). Products were analyzed via agarose gel electrophoresis. FACS Analysisâ€”NCI/ADR-RES cells (1 Ă— 106) were washed in FACS buffer (3% normal goat serum, 3% normal rabbit serum, 3% FBS in PBS) and resuspended in FACS buffer containing a 10 ÎĽg/ml concentration of the anti-human IL-1Rrp2 antibody (M145) for 30 min on ice. Specific binding was detected with an allophycocyanin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, also at 10 ÎĽg/ml (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). After staining, cells were analyzed for rp2 expression using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblottingâ€”NCI/ADR-RES cells (2 Ă— 106 cells/well) were plated into 6-well tissue culture dishes. The following day, cells were stimulated with F6, F8, or F9 at 1 ÎĽg/ml or IL-1Î˛ at 10 ng/ml for 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 min. Following incubation, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4, scraped, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and centrifuged for 5 min in the cold at 5000 rpm. Cells were resuspended in 100 ÎĽl of 1Ă— cell lysis buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm NaF. After 15 min on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in the cold. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes containing an equal volume of 2Ă— SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins (20 ÎĽl) were separated on 1-mm-thick, 8â€“16% Tris/glycine gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the filters overnight at 4 Â°C. After washing with TBST, the filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) at 1:3000 in 1% nonfat milk in TBST. Filters were washed extensively with TBST, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Cytokine Assayâ€”NCI/ADR-RES cells (5 Ă— 104) were plated into 24-well dishes. The following day, cells were stimulated with F6, F8, and F9 at 1 or 5 ÎĽg/ml or IL-1Î˛ at 10 ng/ml. Supernatants were collected 48 h after the addition of the cytokines and were analyzed for the presence of IL-1Î˛, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interferon-Îł, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor using the Beadlyteâ„˘ human multicytokine detection system 3 from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the multicytokine 3 standard was resuspended in assay buffer and then serially diluted from 2500 to 15.6 pg/ml. 50 ÎĽl of standard or sample was added to each well of a 96-well plate with 25 ÎĽl of the bead solution and was incubated overnight at 4 Â°C. The Beadlyteâ„˘ reporter solution was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h. Beadlyteâ„˘ streptavidin-phycoerythrin was diluted 1:25 in assay buffer and was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before the addition of the Beadlyteâ„˘ stop solution. The plate was then analyzed on the Luminex100 LabMAPâ„˘ system (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) and analyzed using Masterplex QT software (MiraBio Inc., Alameda, CA). IL-1F6, IL-F8, and IL-1F9 Activate the Pathway Leading to NF-ÎşB in an IL-1Rrp2-dependent Manner in Multiple Cell Typesâ€”Previously, Debets et al. (1Debets R. Timans J.C. Homey B. Zurawski S. Sana T.R. Lo S. Wagner J. Edwards G. Clifford T. Menon S. Bazan J.F. Kastelein R.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1440-1446Google Scholar) demonstrated that F9 activates NF-ÎşB in rp2-transfected Jurkat T cells. We tested the ability of human F5, F6, F8, and F10, as well as F9, to activate the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB in an rp2-dependent manner in Jurkat cells. F6, F8, and F9 activated the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB in Jurkat E6.1 cells transiently transfected with rp2 but not in cells transfected with empty vector, demonstrating the necessity of rp2 for this activation (see Fig. 1A). F5 or F10 stimulation of Jurkat cells transfected with rp2 or empty vector did not lead to activation of the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Transfection of Jurkat cells with the other orphan IL-1R-like molecules, TIGIRR, SIGIRR, APL, or T1/ST2, did not confer responsiveness to F6, F8, or F9 (data not shown). In addition, transfection of Jurkat cells with IL-1R or IL-18R plus IL-1RAcPL, conditions that render Jurkat cells responsive to IL-1Î˛ and IL-18, respectively, did not enable the cells to respond to F6, F8, or F9 (data not shown). Since activation of the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB by IL-1 and IL-18 is dependent upon association of two IL-1R homologs, we transfected Jurkat cells with IL-1Rrp2 in combination with the other IL-1R family members in order to see whether co-transfection would boost the response. Transfection of Jurkat cells with rp2 in combination with any of the other IL-1R homologs did not increase the activation of the pathway leading to NF-ÎşB elicited by F"
https://openalex.org/W2100090670,"How bacterial or viral infections trigger flares of autoimmunity is poorly understood. As toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 activation by exogenous or endogenous CpG-DNA may contribute to disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus, we examined the effects of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) or DNA derived from Escherichia coli (E. coli) on the course of nephritis in MRL(lpr/lpr) mice. In kidneys of these mice, TLR9 localized to glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and perivascular infiltrates. After intraperitoneal injection labeled CpG-ODN localized to glomerular and interstitial macrophages and dendritic cells in nephritic kidneys of MRL(lpr/lpr) mice but not in healthy MRL controls. Furthermore, murine J774 macrophages and splenocytes from MRL(lpr/lpr) mice, but not tubular epithelial cells, renal fibroblasts, or mesangial cells, expressed TLR9 and up-regulated CCL5/RANTES mRNA upon stimulation with CpG-ODN in vitro. In vivo both E. coli DNA and CpG-ODN increased serum DNA autoantibodies of the IgG2a isotype in MRL(lpr/lpr) mice. This was associated with progression of mild to crescentic glomerulonephritis, interstitial fibrosis, and heavy proteinuria. CpG-ODN increased renal CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL5/RANTES expression associated with increased glomerular and interstitial leukocyte recruitment. In contrast control GpC-ODN had no effect. We conclude that TLR9 activation triggers disease activity of systemic autoimmunity, for example, lupus nephritis, and that adaptive and innate immune mechanisms contribute to the CpG-DNA-induced progression of lupus nephritis."
https://openalex.org/W2062594481,"N-Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing signals are the vital elements of bacterial quorum-sensing systems, which regulate diverse biological functions, including virulence. The AHL-lactonase, a quorumquenching enzyme encoded by aiiA from Bacillus sp., inactivates AHLs by hydrolyzing the lactone bond to produce corresponding N-acyl homoserines. To characterize the enzyme, the recombinant AHL-lactonase and its four variants were purified. Kinetic and substrate specificity analysis showed that AHL-lactonase had no or little residue activity to non-acyl lactones and noncyclic esters, but displayed strong enzyme activity toward all tested AHLs, varying in length and nature of the substitution at the C3 position of the acyl chain. The data also indicate that the amide group and the ketone at the C1 position of the acyl chain of AHLs could be important structural features in enzyme-substrate interaction. Surprisingly, although carrying a 104HX- HXDH109 short sequence identical to the zinc-binding motif of several groups of metallohydrolytic enzymes, AHL-lactonase does not contain or require zinc or other metal ions for enzyme activity. Except for the amino acid residue His-104, which was shown previously to not be required for catalysis, kinetic study and conformational analysis using circular dichroism spectrometry showed that substitution of the other key residues in the motif (His-106, Asp-108, and His-109), as well as His-169 with serine, respectively, caused conformational changes and significant loss of enzyme activity. We conclude that AHL-lactonase is a highly specific enzyme and that the 106HXDH109∼H169 of AHL-lactonase represents a novel catalytic motif, which does not rely on zinc or other metal ions for activity.

Many host-associated bacteria produce, release, and respond to small signal molecules to monitor their own population density and control the expression of specific genes in response to change in population density. This type of gene regulation, which controls diverse biological functions including virulence and biofilm formation, is known as quorum-sensing (QS) 1The abbreviations used are: QS, quorum-sensing; AHL, acyl homoserine lactone; Acyl-HS, acyl homoserine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy; HSL, homoserine lactone.

In general, each individual bacterial cell produces a basal level of QS signals. The signals accumulate to a threshold concentration as the cells proliferate and interact with their cognate transcription factors to activate gene expression. Several groups of QS signals have been identified. Among them, N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) comprise a family of QS signals identified in many Gram-negative bacteria, in particular, Proteobacteria. Different bacterial species may produce different AHLs, which vary in the length and substitution of the acyl chain but maintain the same homoserine lactone moiety (1Fuqua C. Parsek M.R. Greenberg E.P. Ann. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 439-468Google Scholar, 3Miller B. Bassler B.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 165-199Google Scholar, 4Whitehead N.D. Barnard A.M.L. Slater H. Simpson N.J.L. Salmond G.P.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 365-404Google Scholar). These structural variations could constitute the basis of signaling specificity of AHL molecules (5Welch M. Todd D.E. Whitehead N.A. McGowan S.J. Bycroft B.W. Salmond G.P.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 631-641Google Scholar, 6Zhang L.H. Murphy P.J. Kerr A. Tate M.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 446-448Google Scholar). The AHL-dependent QS system has drawn considerable attention over the last 10 years, as it is involved in the regulation of diverse and important biological functions, in particular, the virulence gene expression in a range of animal (including human) and plant bacterial pathogens such as Erwinia carotovora and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7Jones S.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1391-1405Google Scholar). Being a key attribute that determines virulence gene expression in pathogenic bacteria, the AHL signaling system has been regarded as a promising target for developing novel approaches to controlling bacterial infections. Several anti-QS mechanisms have been identified in recent years. AHL antagonists were found to interfere with bacterial QS signaling by inducing accelerated degradation of the AHL-dependent transcription factor (15Givskov M. de Nys R. Manefield M. Gram L.

Givskov M. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 1119-1127Google Scholar). Two groups of enzymes, i.e. the acyl-homoserine lactonase (AHL-lactonase) and acyl-homoserine lactone acylase (AHL-acylase), which degrade AHL by hydrolyzing, respectively, the lactone bond and the amide linkage (Fig. 1), were identified from numerous bacterial isolates (17Dong Y.H.

Genetically modified E. carotovora and P. aeruginosa expressing AHL-lactonase or AHL-acylase showed decreased production of virulence factors and attenuated virulence (17Dong Y.H. Xu J.L. Li X.Z.

Wang L.H. Ong S.L. Leadbetter J.R. Zhang L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 849-860Google Scholar). Plants expressing AHL-lactonase quenched pathogen QS signaling and showed significantly enhanced resistance to E. carotovora infection (18Dong Y.H. Wang L.H. Xu J.L. Zhang H.B. Zhang X.F. Zhang L.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 813-817Google Scholar). These findings highlight the promising potential for establishing a generic “quorum-quenching” approach to control bacterial infections, that is, to paralyze the quorum-sensing of bacterial pathogens through inactivation of QS systems (18Dong Y.H. Wang L.H. Xu J.L. Zhang H.B. Zhang X.F. Zhang L.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 813-817Google Scholar, 25Zhang L.H. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 238-244Google Scholar). AHL-lactonase appears to be a potent enzyme. It works well at physiologically relevant concentrations of AHL signals and hydrolyzes the four tested AHLs (C4-HSL, 3-oxo-C6-HSL, 3-oxo-C8-HSL, and 3-oxo-C12-HSL) effectively (18Dong Y.H. Wang L.H. Xu J.L. Zhang H.B. Zhang X.F. Zhang L.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 813-817Google Scholar). The enzyme contains a conserved short sequence 104HXHXDH109, which is identical to the Zn2+-binding motif of several metallohydrolases (26Melino S Capo C. Dragani B. Aceto A. Petruzzelli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 381-382Google Scholar, 27Carfi A. Pares S Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frere J.M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Google Scholar, 28Crowder M.W. Maiti M.K. Banovic L. Makaroff C.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 351-354Google Scholar). Within the sequence, three amino acid residues, His-106, Asp-108, and His-109, plus His-169, which is also conserved in the metallohydrolases (17Dong Y.H. Xu J.L. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3526-3531Google Scholar), have proven to be essential for the AHL-lactonase activity (17Dong Y.H. Xu J.L. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3526-3531Google Scholar, 19Dong Y.H. Gusti A.R. Zhang Q. Xu J.L. Zhang L.H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1754-1759Google Scholar). It is not clear whether Zn2+ or other ions are required for the catalytic function of AHL-lactonase. Little is known about its substrate specificity and enzyme properties. In this study, we have investigated the catalytic activity of AHL-lactonase against a range of AHL derivatives and related compounds. To probe the enzymatic mechanism, the metal ion composition of the enzyme and effect of ions on enzyme activity have also been determined. Furthermore, four AHL-lactonase variants deficient in enzyme activity have been purified for kinetic assay and conformational analysis using circular dichroism spectrometry in an attempt to reveal the structural features governing substrate-enzyme interaction and catalytic efficiencies. Synthesis of AHLs and Derivatives—AHLs were synthesized as described (6Zhang L.H. Murphy P.J. Kerr A. Tate M.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 446-448Google Scholar), except that 3-hydroxylbutanoyl l-homoserine lactone was purchased from Quorum Sciences Inc. The acyl homoserines (Acyl-HSs) were prepared by incubating the corresponding acyl homoserine lactones in 1:1 ratio of 1 m NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v) for 12 h at room temperature. The solution was neutralized to pH 6.5 with 1 m NaH2PO4 and then dried under vacuum. These synthetic AHLs and Acyl-HSs were purified using silica gel column chromatography and C18 reservephase HPLC and confirmed structurally by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Purification of AHL-lactonase and Its Variants—The aiiA gene encoding AHL-lactonase and its variants H106S, D108S, H109S, and H169S contained in the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector were amplified, respectively, by PCR using forward primer 5′-ATCGGATCCATGACAGTAAAGAAGCTTTATTTCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTCGAATTCCTCAACAAGATACTCCTAATGATGT-3′ (17Dong Y.H. Xu J.L. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3526-3531Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested by BamHI and EcoRI and fused in-frame to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene under the control of the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible tac promoter in GST fusion vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli containing different constructs was cultured at 30 °C in 5-liter LB medium containing 100 μg·ml-1 ampicillin. The GST-AHL-lactonase fusion protein and its variants were expressed by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mm after the optical density of bacterial culture reached 0.4–0.5 at 600 nm; the culture was then incubated at 28 °C overnight. The cells, harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4), were disrupted twice with a chilled French pressure cell at 2000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (11,000 × g for 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was added to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). The GST fusion proteins were bound to the affinity matrix, and AHL-lactonase and its variants were separated from GST by digestion with the protease thrombin overnight at room temperature. After digestion, the eluates containing AHL-lactonase were combined, and the purity was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The purified AHL-lactonase and its variants were stored at -80 °C prior to use. The enzyme concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm based on their corresponding molar extinction coefficients (for example, ϵAHL-lactonase)= 18970 m-1·cm-1. AHL Hydrolysis and Product Analysis—The purified AHL-lactonase (0.4 μm) was mixed with AHL (1 mm) in 1 ml of 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 8), and the mixture was incubated at 28 °C for 10 min with gentle shaking. After incubation, the mixture was immediately analyzed by HPLC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, using the same conditions described previously (18Dong Y.H. Wang L.H. Xu J.L. Zhang H.B. Zhang X.F. Zhang L.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 813-817Google Scholar). AHL-lactonase Enzyme Property Analysis—The reaction mixtures containing AHL-lactonase and substrate in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were incubated in water baths at the specified temperatures. Ali-quots were taken at various time points, and the reaction was stopped by adding 10% SDS to a final concentration of 2%. The remaining AHL was quantified by HPLC or bioassay analysis as described (18Dong Y.H. Wang L.H. Xu J.L. Zhang H.B. Zhang X.F. Zhang L.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 813-817Google Scholar). AHL-lactonase activity was defined as the hydrolyzed micromoles of AHL per minute per microgram of AHL-lactonase. The effect of pH on AHL-lactonase activity was determined by the same procedure, except that the hydrolysis mixtures were incubated at 22 °C in 0.1 m phosphate buffer ranging from pH 5 to pH 9. To examine the thermal stability of AHL-lactonase, the enzyme solution in 1× PBS buffer (pH 7.4) was allowed to stand for 2 h at various temperatures, and then the residual activity was measured as described above. The effects of various metal ions and divalent metal-chelating reagents on the enzyme activity were examined by incubating AHL-lactonase solution (3 μm) with different reagents as indicated in 1× PBS buffer at 22 °C for 30 min. The remaining enzyme activity was measured under the standard conditions described above. Metal Ion Determination—The metal ion composition of AHL-lactonase were determined on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences SCIEX ELAN 6100 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Mass discrimination, auxiliary argon, and coolant gas flow rates were controlled automatically by the instrument. The other operating conditions were adjusted to maximize the signal for analyte ion using standard solutions. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD study of AHL-lactonase and its variants was carried out on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter at 22 °C in the wavelength range between 185 and 260 nm under constant nitrogen flush, using 1-mm path length quartz cells. The spectra were derived from an average of five scans recorded at 50 nm·min-1, along with a 1-s time constant. Each spectrum was corrected against blank, smoothed, and analyzed using the software package provided by JASCO. The instrument was regularly calibrated using ammonium d-(+)-10-camphorsulfonate following the manufacturer's recommendations. Baseline was corrected with 1× PBS buffer in the absence of enzyme. The fraction of secondary structure was estimated using the method described previously (29Yang J.T. Wu C.-S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Google Scholar). Enzyme Kinetics and Specificity of AHL-lactonase—To determine enzyme kinetics, AHL-lactonase was added at a final concentration of 1 μm to AHL solution (0.3–20 mm)in0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with a final volume of 96 μl. The reactions were incubated at 22 °C, stopped by adding 24 μl of 10% SDS, and subjected to HPLC analysis. The residual AHL and its hydrolysis product were quantified by HPLC. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and all velocities were determined at time points at which no more than 10% of the substrate had been consumed. The kcat and Km values were calculated based on Michaelis-Menten equation. The enzyme specificity was determined by the same procedure, except that the substrate and enzyme concentrations were fixed at 3 mm and 0.5 μm, respectively, and the reaction time was 10 min. Substrate Binding Assay—To determine the substrate binding ability of the enzymes, 2-ml solutions containing 20 μm enzyme and 10–200 μm 3-oxo-C8-HSL were transferred to Centricon-10 tubes (Amicon, Millipore) and centrifuged at 5000 × g until the volume of concentrate was ∼60–80 μl. The concentrations of 3-oxo-C8-HSL in the final concentrate and the filtrate were quantified separately by bioassay analysis. Purification and Properties of AHL-lactonase—The GST-AiiA fusion protein was expressed in E. coli following IPTG induction and purified by routine GST affinity chromatography procedure. The recombinant AiiA (AHL-lactonase), which has two extra amino acid residues (Gly and Ser) at the N terminus than does the native AiiA, was separated from GST by thrombin digestion. The recombinant enzyme was purified 86-fold with a yield of ∼7.3% of the total proteins. The SDS-PAGE analysis indicates that the purity of the obtained recombinant AHL-lactonase (7 μg loaded) should be >98.5%, because staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, which can detect as little as 0.1 μg of protein, did not reveal other protein bands (Fig. 2). The SDS-PAGE analysis showed the size of the purified AHL-lactonase enzyme is ∼28 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of 28,036 Da (17Dong Y.H. Xu J.L. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3526-3531Google Scholar). The optimal pH for AHL-lactonase activity was examined using 3-oxo-C8-HSL as substrate. AHL-lactonase activity, enhanced with pH increasing from 6 to 8, reached the maximum at pH 8, then declined slightly at pH 9 (Fig. 3A). The potential interference of non-enzymatic pH-dependent lactone hydrolysis was precluded by analysis of the controls in which corresponding AHL was incubated in the same reaction buffer without the enzyme. The enzyme appeared unstable at low pH, which was confirmed by CD analysis as described in the next section; no or little activity was detected when pH was adjusted to 5 or below. AHL-lactonase exhibited excellent thermal stability at temperatures below 37 °C, and the purified enzyme, kept at 4 and 21 °C for 10 days, still maintained >99% activity. But the enzyme is less stable at higher temperatures; its activity was decreased sharply after incubation for 2 h at >45 °C (data not shown). The effect of temperature on enzyme catalytic activity was analyzed using 3-oxo-C8-HSL as substrate. Up to a maximum of 37 °C, the enzyme activity displayed typical temperature dependence as shown in the Arrhenius plot in Fig. 3B, whereas at 45 °C enzyme inactivation was noticed. In the range between 6–37 °C, the activation energy Ea was calculated to be 52.4 kJ·mol-1 from the slope (Ea/R) of the graph. The enthalpy ΔH* and entropy ΔS* of activation were calculated to be 49.9 kJ·mol-1 and -53.7 J·mol-1·K-1, respectively. The free energy ΔG* of activation at 25 °C was calculated to be 65.9 kJ·mol-1. These thermodynamic parameters were calculated by the equations ΔG* = -RTln(kcath/kBT), ΔH* = Ea - RT, and ΔS* = (ΔH* - ΔG*)/T, where kB, h, and R are Boltzmann, Plank, and universal gas constants, respectively. Several metal ions, including Mg2+,Ca2+,Mn2+,Co2+,Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+, showed no effect on enzyme activity at 0.2 and 2mm, respectively (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, AHL-lactonase was partially inhibited by Cr2+ (72%), Pb2+ (67%), and Fe2+ (48%) at 2 mm and completely inhibited by Cu2+ and Ag+ at 0.2 mm, possibly due to reaction of sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme with Cu2+ and Ag+ (30Lehninger A.L. Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Principles of Biochemistry, 2nd Ed. Worth Publishers, New York,1993: 198-239Google Scholar). The chelating reagents such as EDTA, 2,2′-bipyridine, and o-phenanthroline at a concentration of 2 mm had no effect on enzyme activity. The Conformational Structure of AHL-lactonase Is pH-dependent—The AHL-lactonase encoded by the aiiA gene is an acidic protein with its isoelectric point at 4.7 (17Dong Y.H. Xu J.L. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3526-3531Google Scholar). The pH-dependent pattern of the enzyme activity shown in Fig. 3A suggests that the electrostatic interactions between the charged amino acid residues of AHL-lactonase could play important roles in maintenance of the overall structural conformation and the local electrostatic potentials at the catalytic center, which is critical for enzyme activity. We used CD spectrometry to determine the effect of pH on AHL-lactonase conformational structure. Fig. 4 shows that pH has a drastic effect on the conformational structure of AHL-lactonase. The asymmetric conformational structure of AHL-lactonase remained unchanged in pH ranging from 7 to 9 and slightly changed at pH 6, but significantly changed at pH 5.5 and completely lost at pH 5. The data are consistent with the pH-dependent enzyme activity pattern of AHL-lactonase (Fig. 3A). AHL-lactonase Is Not a Metalloenzyme—Sequence alignment suggested that AHL-lactonase contains a motif similar to the Zn2+ binding motif of metalloenzymes (17Dong Y.H. Xu J.L. Li X.Z. Zhang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3526-3531Google Scholar). To determine whether it is a metalloenzyme, we measured Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ metal ion contents in AHL-lactonase by ICP-MS. Surprisingly, no metal ion was detectable except for a trace mount of Zn2+. The zinc content was ∼0.08 mol per mol of protein, inconsistent with the notion that it is a metallohydrolase. Moreover, the zinc-free AHL-lactonase, generated by treatment with chelating reagent EDTA and dialysis and confirmed by ICP-MS analysis, maintained the same level of enzymatic activity as the untreated enzyme. AHL Hydrolysis by AHL-lactonase—To compare the enzyme activity of AHL-lactonase toward different AHLs, we synthesized and tested 10 AHL molecules. These AHLs differ in acyl chain length and substitution at the C3 position of the acyl chain (Fig. 5). AHL-lactonase showed an excellent ability to accommodate these structural differences regardless of which AHL was used as a substrate. More than 80% of AHL was degraded by AHL-lactonase in 1:2500 molar ratio of enzyme to substrate in the first 10 min of reaction, and only one new fraction was found after the enzyme reaction by HPLC analysis. The new fraction showed the identical HPLC retention time and molecular mass as the corresponding Acyl-HS (data not shown). The Acyl-HSs had not been detected in the enzyme-free control, indicating that the non-enzymatic turnover of AHLs, such as pH-dependent lactonolysis or alkalization (31Byers J.T. Lucas C. Salmond G.P.C. Welch M. J Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1163-1171Google Scholar, 32Yates E.A. Philipp B. Buckley C. Atkinson S. Chhabra S.R. Sockett R.E. Goldner M. Dessaux Y. Camara M. Smith H. Williams P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5635-5646Google Scholar), was negligible in this time scale. The AHL lactonolysis by AHL-lactonase led to a sharp decrease (>1500-fold) in biological activity, and several products failed to show any activity even at the concentration up to 10 mm (Table I) when assayed using an A. tumefaciens tra gene-based reporter strain (33Piper K.R. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K. Nature. 1993; 362: 448-450Google Scholar). In all cases, the hydrolyzed N-acyl homoserine could not be relactonized to form active AHL signals in neutral aqueous solution, even after a prolonged incubation for 1 week.Table IBiological activity of AHL hydrolysis products Samples were diluted, and the minimum concentration of each AHL hydrolysis product (Acyl-HS) required to induce formation of a visible blue colony on the bioassay plate was presented.

The enzyme and substrate was mixed in a 1:6000 molar ratio and incubated for 10 min. Fig. 5 shows that the AHL-lactonase exhibited high relative activities toward all of the tested AHLs. Differences in acyl chain length and substitution did not significantly affect the enzyme activity, indicating that AHL-lactonase has a broad catalytic spectrum toward AHLs. Within a narrow margin, AHL-lactonase worked better against AHLs without 3-oxo substitution than did the substituted derivatives. In contrast, AHL-lactonase showed only residual activity to non-acyl lactones, including lactones of different members and substituted lactones (Fig. 5). Noticeably, AHL-lactonase showed little activity toward γ-decanolactone, which has a 6-carbon alkane side chain. Several lactonases were also known to digest p-nitrophenyl acetate (34Hucho F. Wallenfels K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 176-179Google Scholar), which is a non-cyclic ester substrate. However, AHL-lactonase did not hydrolyze any of the tested non-cyclic esters, including ethyl acetate, phenyl acetate, p-nitrophenyl acetate, and α-naphthyl acetate (Fig. 5). Kinetic Analysis of AHL-lactonase—Hydrolysis kinetics was determined by plotting velocity versus substrate concentration. The kcat and Km values were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Table II). AHL-lactonase showed comparable catalytic activity against a range of structurally different AHLs with kcat and Km values ranging 20.22–37.63 s-1 and 1.43–7.51 mm, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 22 °C. Within these narrow ranges, the enzyme showed higher affinity (Km), slower hydrolysis rate (kcat), and stronger catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) toward the AHLs with longer acyl side chain than the shorter derivatives. Additionally, the enzyme displayed higher kcat and kcat/Km values against the AHLs with fully reduced acyl chains than their corresponding derivatives containing 3-oxo substitution (Table II).Tabled 1AHLskcataThe data are means from triplicate experimentsKmaThe data are means from triplicate experimentskcat/KmaThe data are means from triplicate experimentss-1mmmm-1·s-13-Oxo-C4-HSL28.634.077.033-Oxo-C6-HSL22.682.957.693-Oxo-C8-HSL22.172.289.723-Oxo-C10-HSL20.221.4314.13-Oxo-C12-HSLNDbND indicates not determined due to poor solubility of the substrate in phosphate bufferNDNDC4-HSL37.635.117.36C6-HSL35.673.839.31C8-HSL27.532.6110.5C10-HSLNDbND indicates not de"
https://openalex.org/W2158019652,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and depletion of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum. Progress in the search for effective therapeutic strategies that can halt this degenerative process remains limited. Mechanistic studies using animal systems such as the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) rodent PD model have revealed the involvement of the brain's immune cells and free radical-generating processes. We recently reported that dextromethorphan (DM), a widely used anti-tussive agent, attenuated endotoxin-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in vitro. In the current study, we investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of DM and the underlying mechanism of action in the MPTP rodent PD model. Mice (C57BL/6J) that received daily MPTP injections (15 mg free base/kg body weight, s.c.) for 6 consecutive days exhibited significant degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. However, the MPTP-induced loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons was significantly attenuated in those mice receiving DM (10 mg/kg body weight, s.c.). In mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures, DM significantly reduced the MPTP-induced production of both extracellular superoxide free radicals and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Because NADPH oxidase is the primary source of extracellular superoxide and intracellular ROS, we investigated the involvement of NADPH oxidase in the neuroprotective effect of DM. Indeed, the neuroprotective effect of DM was only observed in the wild-type but not in the NADPH oxidase-deficient mice, indicating that NADPH oxidase is a critical mediator of the neuroprotective activity of DM. More importantly, due to its proven safety record of long-term clinical use in humans, DM may be a promising agent for the treatment of degenerative neurological disorders such as PD."
https://openalex.org/W2071045330,"TRPC3 has been suggested as a key component of phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ signaling. Here we investigated the role of TRPC3-mediated Na+ entry as a determinant of plasmalemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Ca2+ signals generated by TRPC3 overexpression in HEK293 cells were found to be dependent on extracellular Na+, in that carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ entry into TRPC3 expressing cells was significantly suppressed when extracellular Na+ was reduced to 5 mm. Moreover, KB-R9743 (5 μm) an inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) strongly suppressed TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry but not TRPC3-mediated Na+ currents. NCX1 immunoreactivity was detectable in HEK293 as well as in TRPC3-overexpressing HEK293 cells, and reduction of extracellular Na+ after Na+ loading with monensin resulted in significant rises in intracellular free Ca2+ (Ca2+i) of HEK293 cells. Similar rises in Ca2+i were recorded in TRPC3-overexpressing cells upon the reduction of extracellular Na+ subsequent to stimulation with carbachol. These increases in Ca2+i were associated with outward membrane currents at positive potentials and inhibited by KB-R7943 (5 μm), chelation of extracellular Ca2+, or dominant negative suppression of TRPC3 channel function. This suggests that Ca2+ entry into TRPC3-expressing cells involves reversed mode Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Cell fractionation experiments demonstrated co-localization of TRPC3 and NCX1 in low density membrane fractions, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments provided evidence for association of TRPC3 and NCX1. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments revealed that NCX1 interacts with the cytosolic C terminus of TRPC3. We suggest functional and physical interaction of nonselective TRPC cation channels with NCX proteins as a novel principle of TRPC-mediated Ca2+ signaling.

We suggest functional and physical interaction of nonselective TRPC cation channels with NCX proteins as a novel principle of TRPC-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Members of the canonical TRP (transient receptor potential) subfamily (TRPC family) have recently been suggested as key components of phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ signaling in mammalian cells (1Vennekens R. Voets T. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 253-264Google Scholar). In particular, TRPC3 has been repeatedly shown to form nonselective cation channels that allow permeation of both Na+ and Ca2+ (2Hurst R.S. Zhu X. Boulay G. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 333-338Google Scholar, 3Zitt C. Obukhov A.G. Strubing C. Zobel A. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1333-1341Google Scholar, 4Lintschinger B.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48149-48158Google Scholar). Stimulation of TRPC3 channels under physiological conditions gives rise to large Na+ inward currents, which cause substantial membrane depolarization and Na+ loading. The role of TRPC3 channels in cellular Ca2+ signaling is complex and incompletely understood. Recent evidence suggests that TRPC3 contributes significantly to Ca2+ entry by forming multiple types of Ca2+ entry channels including store-operated Ca2+ entry channels that are linked to the filling state of the endoplasmic reticulum (5Thyagarajan B. Poteser M. Romanin C. Kahr H. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48149-48158Google Scholar, 6Trebak M. Bird G.S. McKay R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21617-21623Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the most prominent electrophysiological phenomenon observed in TRPC3 expressing cells is a depolarizing Na+ inward current that has so far largely been neglected in terms of functional consequences. A Ca2+ transport system that is sensitive to changes in both intracellular Na+ and membrane potential is the plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). 1The abbreviations used are: NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; KB-R7943, (2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulfonate); GST, glutathione S-transferase; CCh, carbachol; HA, hemagglutinin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. This system is well known to contribute to efficient Ca2+ extrusion during activation of cardiac muscle, neurons, and endocrine cells and may contribute to Ca2+ entry as well because of operation in reversed mode (7Sham J.S. Cleemann L. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 121-125Google Scholar, 8Sage S.O. van Breemen C. Cannell M.B. J. Physiol. 1991; 440: 569-580Google Scholar, 9Crespo L.M. Grantham C.J.

Na+ entry and membrane depolarization as a typical result of TRPC3 activation is expected to exert substantial impact on NCX, leading to either reduced Ca2+ extrusion or to Ca2+ entry upon shift of the exchanger to reversed mode. Notably, both TRPC3 and NCX proteins appear to be tightly linked to Ca2+ homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and may thus both be targeted to a domain of the plasma membrane that communicates with these intracellular Ca2+ stores (5Thyagarajan B. Poteser M. Romanin C. Kahr H. Zhu M.X. Groschner K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48149-48158Google Scholar, 11Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E.

Here we tested the hypothesis of cross-signaling between TRPC3 channels and NCX in HEK293 cells, a cell type that has been extensively used as an expression system for the characterization of TRPC3 function. We present evidence for physical and functional coupling of TRPC3 and NCX1 and suggest TRPC3-mediated Na+ entry and Na+ accumulation at the cytoplasmic face of TRPC-associated NCX proteins as a key mechanism by which TRPC3 governs global and local Ca2+ signaling. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells stably transfected with the coding region of HA-tagged TRPC3 (accession number U47050; designated as T3-9), with an N-terminal YFP fusion of TRPC3 (YFP-TRPC3; designated as YT3-2; TRPC3 was subcloned using BamHI/XbaI into the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech)), or with pEYFP only (designated as HEK-VT; controls) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.178 g/liter Geneticin (G418 sulfate). In case of control cells, different clones were pooled together and cultured as specified above. Some experiments were performed with wild type HEK293 cells that were cultured in the absence of G418 and transiently transfected by electroporation with either YFP-TRPC3 or pEYFP (controls). Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ and Membrane Currents—The cells were loaded with fura-2/pentaacetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Thereafter, the cells were washed and constantly perfused during experiments with buffers containing either 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (nominally Ca2+ free); 5 mm NaCl, 150 mm N-methylglucamine, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (nominally Ca2+ free); or 5 mm NaCl, 150 mm N-methylglucamine, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2. The free Ca2+ concentration of this nominally Ca2+-free solution was determined using a Ca2+-sensitive electrode and was ∼20 μm (15–30 μm). Excitation light was supplied via a Polychrome II polychromator (TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany), and emission was detected by a Sensicam CCD camera (PCO Computer Optics, Kelheim, Germany). Ca2+-sensitive fura-2 fluorescence was measured ratiometrically at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths, and emission was collected at 510 nm. The digital image recordings were analyzed using Axon Imaging Work-bench (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For simultaneous measurements of membrane conductances and intracellular free Ca2+, the membrane currents were recorded in fura-2-loaded cells with the perforated patch technique (13Poteser M. Wakabayashi I. Rosker C. Teubl M. Schindl R. Soldatov N.M. Romanin C. Groschner K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 888-896Google Scholar) using amphotericin B (Sigma; dissolved in Me2SO at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml in the pipette solution). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Clark, Electromedical Instruments), had a resistance of 3–5 MΩ, and were filled with a solution containing 120 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 20 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl, 0.1 mm EGTA with pH of 7.4 adjusted with N-methylglucamine. The currents were recorded at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The signals were low pass filtered at 1 kHz and digitized with 5 kHz. Voltage clamp protocols (voltage ramps from -100 to +80 mV/0.6 V/s, 0.2 Hz, holding potential -70 mV) were controlled by pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). All of the experiments were performed at room temperature. Sucrose Density Gradient Fractionation of Cell Membranes—T3-9 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off from the dishes in 5 ml of PBS, centrifuged at 4 °C, and resuspended in 850 μl of 0.5 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. The cells were homogenized by sonication, and 850 μl of 90% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm MES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.5) was added. Afterward the mixture was placed in a AH-650 ultracentrifuge tube, overlaid by 1.7 ml of 35% and 1 ml of 5% sucrose (each prepared in MBS containing 0.25 m sodium carbonate), and centrifuged for 20 h at 134,000 × g. The fractions, starting at the top of the gradient, were collected to yield a total of nine fractions: 1 ml (from the top) was collected as fraction 1, and subsequently 0.4-ml fractions were collected as fractions 2–9. The proteins in the fractions were precipitated with 25% (v/v) of 50% trichloroacetic acid for 25 min on ice. After centrifugation, the precipitated proteins were dissolved in 0.1 ml of 2× Laemmli buffer for immunoblotting experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—T3-9 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off from the dishes in 5 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (complete; Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 15 min on ice. The cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 134,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific bindings were removed by preincubation of supernatants with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared supernatants were incubated with either 10 μl of anti-NCX or with 10 μl of anti-HA overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the immune complex for 2 h at 4 °C. Control was performed in the absence of precipitated antibody, adding only protein A-Sepharose beads to the supernatant. The beads were pelleted, washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. The cell lysates and immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose sheets were then preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with TBST buffer (25 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0,1% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 1% Bio-Rad blocking reagent and incubated with primary antibody against either HA (1:1,000; Roche Applied Science), NCX (1:5,000; Swant), or caveolin-1 (1:5,000; BD Transduction Laboratories) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST buffer, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat (against HA) and anti-rabbit (against NCX and caveolin-1) were used as secondary antibodies. The blots were developed using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Glutathione S-Transferase Pull-down Assay—An N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–302) as well as a C-terminal fragment (amino acids 742–848) of TRPC3 were cloned into the GST fusion protein vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21, which then were grown in 250 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Synthesis of the fusion proteins, termed as GST-T3N and GST-T3C, was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science). Resuspended cells were sonicated on ice and lysed by adding Triton X-100 (Merck) to a final concentration of 1%. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was kept, and the pellet was again resuspended in PBS, sonicated, and centrifuged, as described above. The supernatants were pooled and incubated with 500 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and finally washed three times with PBS. An aliquot of beads (80 μl) was removed, and the bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione, analyzed on 12% SDS page stained with Coomassie Blue. Wild type HEK293 cells or T3-9 cells were lysed as described above (method for immunoprecipitation). GST pull-down experiments were performed by mixing 10 μl of HEK293 cell lysate (500 μg of total protein) with beads (80 μl) charged either with GST or the GST-T3N or GST-T3C fusion protein in a final volume of 500 μl of lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The GST beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 70 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS page and immunoblotting. The blots were probed with anti-NCX antibody (1:5,000, overnight at 4 °C) and finally developed using the ECL detection system. Chemicals—The chemicals were purchased from the following suppliers: Tissue culture medium was from Invitrogen; fura-2/pentaacetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands); DEANO was from Alexis (Switzerland), and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Statistical Analysis—The results were expressed as the mean values ± S.E. The differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 using Student's t test for unpaired values. TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ Entry into HEK293 Cells Is Na+-dependent and Inhibited by KB-R7943—Transient or stable overexpression of TRPC3 in HEK cells has repeatedly been shown to result in enhanced phospholipase-dependent Ca2+ entry, which is clearly discernable in classical Ca2+ readdition protocols. Fig. 1A shows typical intracellular Ca2+ signals in the stably TRPC3 expressing cell line T3-9. The cells were stimulated with carbachol (CCh; 200 μm) in nominally Ca2+-free solution, and extracellular Ca2+ was subsequently elevated to 2 mm to initiate Ca2+ entry. Ca2+ readdition-induced signals were substantially suppressed in the presence of 5 μm KB-R7943, an inhibitor of Na+/Ca2+ exchange with preference for the reversed mode, and significantly diminished when experiments were performed at low extracellular Na+ (5 mm). Similar results were obtained with cells stably expressing YFP-TRPC3 (YT3-2; Fig. 1B). By contrast, Ca2+ entry into wild type HEK293 cells or vector-transfected controls was independent of the extracellular Na+ concentration (Fig. 1B). Na+ Entry Affects a Na+/Ca2+ Exchanger in HEK293 Cells— We hypothesized that TRPC3-mediated Na+ loading and membrane depolarization may affect Na+/Ca2+ exchange in HEK293 cells, leading to either diminished Ca2+ extrusion or even Ca2+ entry via reversed mode exchange. Na+ entry and membrane depolarization during TRPC3 activation is expected to be negligible at reduced extracellular Na+. Hence, despite the fact that reduction of extracellular Na+ is an intervention that increases the driving force for reversed mode NCX at a given level of intracellular Na+, this situation is expected to inhibit Ca2+ entry via NCX when Na+ loading and membrane depolarization are the key triggers for initiation of reversed mode NCX, as hypothesized for stimulation of TRPC3 channels. This concept might explain the observed suppression of TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ signaling at low extracellular Na+. To test this hypothesis we screened for the expression of functional NCX in HEK293 cells. Fig. 2A illustrates that an anti-NCX antibody recognizes an NCX1 typical pattern of proteins (14Frank J.S. Chen F. Garfinkel A. Moore E. Philipson K.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 532-533Google Scholar, 15Teubl M. Groschner K. Kohlwein S.D. Mayer B. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29529-29535Google Scholar), comprised of a prominent band at 70 kDa as well as a haze of bands in the range of 110–130 kDa corresponding to the expected size of native NCX1. The 70-kDa protein represents a short form of NCX1, which may reflect either a proteolytic cleavage product or a functional, truncated form of NCX1 (16Van Eylen F. Kamagate A. Herchuelz A. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 191-198Google Scholar). Functional NCX in HEK293 cells was demonstrated in experiments in which cellular Na+ gradients were altered to elicit Ca2+ entry via reversed mode NCX. Reduction of extracellular Na+ subsequently to cellular Na+ loading generates a substantial shift in the equilibrium for Na+/Ca2+ exchange, allowing for operation of NCX in reversed mode. Fig. 2B shows that a reduction of extracellular Na+ to 5 mm after Na+ loading of the cells with monensin (10 μm) results indeed in a significant elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Ca2+i). This elevation of Ca2+i was clearly dependent on extracellular Ca2+, inhibited by 5 μm KB-R7943 and similarly observed after stimulation of phospholipase C with carbachol (Fig. 2C). Na+ reduction-induced rises in Ca2+i of Na+ loaded cells were inhibited by KB-R7943 (5 μm). Thus, HEK293 cells clearly display a Ca2+ entry mechanism that is dependent on the transmembrane Na+ gradient consistent with NCX operation in reversed mode. To further test the hypothesis that Na+ entry through TRPC3 channels is linked to Ca2+ homeostasis via promotion of reversed mode NCX, we performed experiments in which TRPC3 channels were stimulated in nominally Ca2+-free, Na+-containing solution, to allow TRPC3-mediated Na+ loading, followed by reduction of extracellular Na+. Fig. 3 illustrates that reduction of extracellular Na+ to 5 mm subsequent to stimulation with CCh at normal extracellular Na+ is indeed sufficient to cause significant rises in Ca2+i, which are inhibited by KB-R7943 (5 μm; Fig. 3A). Increases in Ca2+i evoked by subsequent elevation of extracellular Ca2+ were significantly smaller in the presence of KB-R7943 (230 ± 76 nm, n = 53) as compared with controls (957 ± 224 nm, n = 61). Ca2+i signals recorded during Na+ reduction were clearly dependent on extracellular Ca2+, because lowering of extracellular Ca2+ from ∼20 μm (nominally free) to a level below 1 μm by addition of 0.1 mm EGTA abolished the Na+ reduction-induced increases in Ca2+i (Fig. 3B). Reduction of extracellular Na+ to 5 mm induced rises in Ca2+i of T3-9 cells as well as in HEK293 cells that expressed YFP-TRPC3 transiently (Fig. 3B). Co-expression of TRPC3 with a dominant negative fragment of TRPC3 that is known to suppress channel function (17Groschner K. Hingel S. Lintschinger B. Balzer M. Romanin C. Zhu X. Schreibmayer W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 101-106Google Scholar) eliminated the Ca2+ signals induced by reduction of extracellular Na+ (Fig. 3B). Thus, TRPC3 expression promotes a Na+-dependent Ca2+ entry pathway in HEK293 cells. We suggest that TRPC3-mediated Ca2+ entry is in part the consequence of Na+ entry that is converted to intracellular Ca2+ signals by a KB-R7943-sensitive mechanism.Fig. 3TRPC3-mediated Na+-loading enables Ca2+signals via reversed mode Na+/Ca2+exchange in HEK293 cells. A, time courses of Ca2+-sensitive fura-2 fluorescence ratios (F340/380) recorded using a combined Na+ reduction/Ca2+ readdition protocol. The cells were kept in nominally Ca2+-free solution containing 137 mm NaCl and stimulated after 200 s with 200 μm CCh, at 400 s Na+e was reduced to 5 and 2 mm Ca2+ was added after 600 s. The data points represent the mean values obtained in the absence (filled circles) and presence (open triangles) of KB-R7943 (n = 53–61). B, Na+ reduction-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ in different cell types: vector transfected controls (HEK-VT; n = 119), cells stably expressing HA-TRPC3 (T3-9; n = 62) and transiently expressing YFP-TRPC3 (HEK+YFP-TRPC3; n = 117). The mean values ± S.E. of the maximum Na+ reduction induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ are given in nm for nominally Ca2+ free solution, a solution containing 0.1 mm EGTA (T3-9+EGTA) as well as in T3-9 cells transfected to express YFP-NTRP3 (T3-9+NTRP). The asterisks denote statistically significant differences versus the response obtained in T3-9 cells under control conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TRPC3-dependent Ca2+ Entry Induced by Reduction of Extracellular Na+ Is Associated with a KB-R7943-sensitive Outward Current—To further characterize the TRPC3-dependent, KB-R7943-sensitive Ca2+ entry pathway, we performed simultaneous measurements of Ca2+i and membrane currents with the perforated patch technique in T3-9 cells as well as in cells transiently transfected to express a YFP-TRPC3 fusion protein. Fig. 4 shows typical recordings obtained in the absence (control) and presence of 5 μm KB-R7943. Administration of CCh increased membrane conductance as evident from increases in membrane currents measured at -70 mV (Fig. 4A, time point 2). Similar responses were observed in a set of experiments using CCh concentrations as low as 1 μm (n = 3). Occasionally, an additional transient component of membrane conductance was detectable during mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (Fig. 4A, time point 3). The cell responses to reduction of extracellular Na+ were consistent throughout all experiments, displaying an increased Ca2+i and a biphasic change in membrane conductance. The changes in membrane currents were comprised of an initial decrease of inward currents (Fig. 4A, time point 5) followed by a more slowly developing increase in outward currents at positive potentials (Fig. 4A, time point 6). A comparison of the current to voltage relations recorded during CCh stimulation and Na+ reduction is illustrated in Fig. 4C. Substantial outward currents were recorded at depolarization above -20 mV during prolonged reduction of extracellular Na+ (Fig. 4C, lower right panel). The current to voltage relation obtained under these conditions was clearly different from that of the classical CCh-stimulated nonselective conductance of TRPC3-expressing cells (Fig. 4C, upper and lower left panels), which allowed for large inward currents carried by Na+ (Fig. 4C, lower left panel). The typical TRPC3-mediated, CCh-induced inward currents at -70 mV (hatched boxes) were not affected by 5 μm KB-R7943 (n = 6), and acute application of KB-R7943 failed to inhibit CCh-induced Na+ inward currents in T3-9 cells (n = 2; data not shown), indicating that TRPC3 channels are not a target of KB-R7943 action. By contrast, the outward currents initiated by Na+ removal representing a biophysical hallmark of reversed mode Na+/Ca2+ exchange as well as the associated increases in Ca2+i were completely abolished by KB-R7943 (Fig. 4B). Fig. 5A shows a comparison of averaged current responses measured at +50 mV in CCh-stimulated cells during reduction of extracellular Na+ in the absence and the presence of 5 μm KB-R7943. Na+ reduction-induced outward currents were not detectable in wild type HEK293 or vector controls (n = 3), consistent with the observed lack of Na+ reduction-induced Ca2+ signals (Fig. 2C, control). Thus, expression of TRPC3 promotes a Ca2+ entry pathway that is dependent on extracellular Na+, sensitive to the NCX inhibitor KB-R7943 and associated with outward currents at positive potentials. These findings strongly suggest a functional coupling between NCX and TRPC3 via cellular Na+ gradients.Fig. 5Na+ reduction induces a KB-R7943-sensitive outward current in carbachol-stimulated T3-9cells. A, time courses of averaged currents measured at + 50 mV in carbachol (200 μm)-stimulated T3-9 cells during reduction of extracellular Na+ to 5 mm (-Nae) in the absence (control, n = 5) and presence of KB-R7943 (n = 4). B, Na+e reduction-induced increases in current density measured at + 50 mV in controls (black columns; n = 5) and in cells treated with 5 μm KB-R7943 (+KB-R; n = 4). The asterisk denotes statistically a significant difference versus the response obtained in T3-9 cells under control conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TRPC3 and NCX1 Are Co-localized in Low Density Membranes of HEK293 Cells—Because TRPC3 channels are targeted to cholesterol-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane, presumably caveolae (18Lockwich T. Singh B.B. Liu X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42401-42408Google Scholar), which can be separated from other membranes based on their low density, we performed cell fractionation experiments using gradient centrifugation as a further test for a possible co-localization of TRPC3 and NCX proteins. As illustrated in Fig. 6, TRPC3 immunoreactivity in terms of the major 70-kDa band was indeed detected predominantly in the caveolin-1 containing, low density membrane fractions (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). These low density fractions clearly displayed enrichment in NCX1. It is of note that NCX1 immunoreactivity was detected also in higher density fractions, presumably corresponding to intracellular membranes. These results supported the concept of a close spatial relationship between TRPC3 and NCX1 in the plasma membrane and prompted us to test for a possible link between these two ion transport systems in terms of protein-protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 7, significant amounts of TRPC3 were precipitated using an anti NCX antibody, and immunoblotting of precipitates derived with an antibody directed against the HA tag of the TRPC3 construct expressed in T3-9 cells displayed clear NCX1 immunoreactivity as shown for the 70-kDa band. Thus, a specific fraction of cellular NCX1 is suggested to associate with TRPC3 to form a Ca2+ signaling complex.Fig. 7NCX and HA-TRPC3 co-immunoprecipitate from T3-9cell lysates. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-NCX (left panel) or anti-HA (right panel), and immunoblotted to detect HA-TRPC3 or NCX, respectively. Lane 1, proteins from total cell lysates; lane 2, proteins immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibody. These results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) NCX1 Binds to the C Terminus of TRPC3—To further analyze the physical interaction between NCX1 and TRPC3, we performed GST pull-down experiments using the cytosolic N- and C-terminal domains of the TRPC3 protein as bait. As shown in Fig. 8, NCX1 immunoreactivity, in terms of both NCX1 typical bands (70 and 120 kDa), was retained from HEK293 homogenates by the C terminus (amino acids 742–848) but not by the N terminus (amino acids 1–302) or in GST control experiments. Thus, the C terminus of TRPC3 is able to interact with NCX1, suggesting association of the two ion transport systems in HEK293 cells. Our results provide evidence for a novel type of Ca2+ signaling complex that is comprised of the two Na+ and Ca2+ transporting proteins TRPC3 and NCX1. We propose a tight functional coupling between the two ion transport pathways based on both local ion gradients and physical association within a signaling complex.

EC-SOD participates in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species by catalyzing the dismutation of superoxide radicals. The tissue distribution of the enzyme is particularly important because of the reactive nature of its substrate, and it is likely essential that EC-SOD is positioned at the site of superoxide production to prevent adventitious oxidation. EC-SOD contains a C-terminal heparin-binding region thought to be important for modulating its distribution in the extracellular matrix. This paper demonstrates that, in addition to binding heparin, EC-SOD specifically binds to type I collagen with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 200 nm. The heparin-binding region was found to mediate the interaction with collagen. Notably, the bound EC-SOD significantly protects type I collagen from oxidative fragmentation. This expands the known repertoire of EC-SOD binding partners and may play an important physiological role in preventing oxidative fragmentation of collagen during oxidative stress.

Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Google Scholar, 2Stadtman E.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 22-38Google Scholar). Because ROS damage DNA, proteins, lipids and the extracellular matrix (ECM), several defense mechanisms have evolved to protect against oxidant injury. Central to these defenses are the antioxidant enzymes. These include catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Three SOD isoenzymes are known in humans, including CuZn-SOD found in the cytoplasm and nucleus (3Crapo J.D. Oury T. Rabouille C. Slot J.W. Chang L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10405-10409Google Scholar), a mitochondrial Mn-SOD (4Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Google Scholar), and extracellular SOD (EC-SOD) (5Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7634-7638Google Scholar). EC-SOD is a tetrameric protein found primarily in the ECM and, to a lesser extent, in the extracellular fluids (6Fattman C.L. Schaefer L.M. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 236-256Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the human EC-SOD subunit exists in two forms, each with a distinct disulfide bridge pattern. One form is enzymatically active (aEC-SOD), whereas the other displays no SOD-activity (iEC-SOD) (7Petersen S.V. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Hojrup P. Crapo J.D. Enghild J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13875-13880Google Scholar). This novel property is likely to significantly impact the function of EC-SOD in vivo, although the physiological consequences of the observation remain to be described. An important feature of EC-SOD is its high avidity for heparin, which is thought to anchor EC-SOD to the cell surface and the extracellular matrix. The interaction is facilitated by a cluster of positively charged amino acid residues near the C-terminal of the protein (8Sandstrom J. Carlsson L. Marklund S.L. Edlund T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18205-18209Google Scholar). Purified EC-SOD is heterogeneous with respect to heparin affinity, and three populations of EC-SOD have been identified, including type A (no affinity), type B (intermediate affinity), and type C (high affinity) (8Sandstrom J. Carlsson L. Marklund S.L. Edlund T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18205-18209Google Scholar, 9Adachi T. Marklund S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8537-8541Google Scholar). The heterogeneous affinity for heparin is caused by proteolytic removal of the heparin-binding regions and, thus, reflects the ratio of cleaved and intact subunits in the tetramer. The proteolytic event occurs intracellularly and is most likely carried out by a member of the furin family of proprotein convertases (10Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Hojrup P. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14818-14822Google Scholar, 11Bowler R.P. Nicks M. Olsen D.A. Thogersen I.B. Valnickova Z. Hojrup P. Franzusoff A. Enghild J.J. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16505-16511Google Scholar). The affinity for heparin is believed to be important in regulating the distribution of EC-SOD in the ECM, and recent reports indicate that enhanced proteolysis of the heparin-binding region of EC-SOD significantly alters the tissue distribution during pathologic processes (12Fattman C.L. Chu C.T. Kulich S.M. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1198-1207Google Scholar, 13Oury T.D. Schaefer L.M. Fattman C.L. Choi A. Weck K.E. Watkins S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L777-L784Google Scholar) EC-SOD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen with a forward rate constant that is almost diffusion limited (>109m-1 s-1) (14Forman H.J. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 396-400Google Scholar). The hydrogen peroxide is subsequently metabolized by catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are not considered to be the most damaging ROS. Hydroxyl radicals are several orders of magnitude more reactive than superoxide, are among the most reactive molecules known, and react rapidly with any molecule in its vicinity (15Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Google Scholar, 16Buettner G.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 535-543Google Scholar). Significantly, hydroxyl radicals may be generated in vivo as a consequence of forming superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Through Fenton chemistry, peroxide readily reacts with transition metals like ferrous iron to form hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, ferric iron will accept an electron from superoxide and cycle back to the ferrous state, thereby making it available for another peroxide molecule. Experiments examining oxidative protein fragmentation using radiolysis have demonstrated that the number of peptides formed is directly proportional to the number of proline residues in the protein, suggesting that hydroxyl radicals may react with proline residues and lead to peptide bond cleavage (17Schuessler H. Schilling K. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 1984; 45: 267-281Google Scholar). The mechanism of peptide bond cleavage is not clear, but it seems to involve the formation of 2-pyrrolidone (18Uchida K. Kato Y. Kawakishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 265-271Google Scholar, 19Kato Y. Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23646-23651Google Scholar). Notably, collagen contains 16% proline residues, whereas average human proteins contain only 5.6% (20Doolittle R.F. Of Urfs and Orfs: A primer on How to analyze Derived Amino Acid sequences. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1986: 55Google Scholar). Collagen may thus be particularly sensitive to oxidative degradation (21Monboisse J.C. Braquet P. Randoux A. Borel J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 53-58Google Scholar, 22Monboisse J.C. Gardes-Albert M. Randoux A. Borel J.P. Ferradini C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 965: 29-35Google Scholar). In addition to the hydroxyl radical, superoxide may directly cleave collagen peptide bonds (21Monboisse J.C. Braquet P. Randoux A. Borel J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 32: 53-58Google Scholar, 22Monboisse J.C. Gardes-Albert M. Randoux A. Borel J.P. Ferradini C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 965: 29-35Google Scholar, 23Monboisse J.C. Borel J.P. EXS. 1992; 62: 323-327Google Scholar). Immunochemical studies have shown previously that EC-SOD strongly co-localizes with type I collagen in the ECM of airspaces and blood vessels (24Oury T.D. Chang L.Y. Marklund S.L. Day B.J. Crapo J.D. Lab. Investig. 1994; 70: 889-898Google Scholar). This location would be ideal for preventing oxidative fragmentation of type I collagen. In fact, mouse EC-SOD has recently been shown to inhibit oxidative fragmentation of proteins at proline residues in a model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, supporting the hypothesis that its association with collagen is important in protecting it from oxidative fragmentation (25Fattman C.L. Chang L.Y. Termin T.A. Petersen L. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 763-771Google Scholar). In this study, we show that human EC-SOD is not only associated with type I collagen but that it binds directly and reduces oxidative fragmentation of this structural protein. The interaction with collagen is mediated by the C-terminal region of EC-SOD, suggesting that this part of the protein functions as a ligand for both heparin and collagen. Although the affinity of EC-SOD for collagen is relatively low, the high concentration of collagen in the extracellular space makes it likely that this interaction affects the distribution of EC-SOD in the ECM. Reagents—Sequence-grade porcine trypsin was purchased from Promega. Bovine serum albumin, heparin-agarose (H-6508), o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate, hydrogen peroxide (H-1009), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig, and proteinase inhibitors were from Sigma-Aldrich. HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (P0260) was from DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark. Mono Q 5/5 HR and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Biosciences. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum produced against recombinant EC-SOD and a monoclonal antibody developed against native EC-SOD were used for Western blotting and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed in 5–15% gradient gels using the glycine/2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol-HCl system (26Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Google Scholar). All samples were denatured by boiling in 1% SDS and, when indicated, reduced by the addition of 30 mm dithiothreitol. Immunoblotting—Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene diflouride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) in 10 mm CAPS, 10% (v/v) methanol, pH 11, as described (27Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar). The membrane was subsequently blocked for 1 h in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl and 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk). Primary anti-EC-SOD antibody was diluted in TBS-T containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated with the membrane for 1 h. The membrane was washed in TBS-T and bound a primary antibody subsequently detected by using an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody diluted in TBS-T and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of EC-SOD—EC-SOD was purified as described previously, omitting cation exchange chromatography (28Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼250 g of human aorta was homogenized in cold 50 mm potassium phosphate and 0.3 m potassium bromide, pH 7.4, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture consisting of 1,10-ortophenantroline, E-64, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was filtered through cheese-cloth and centrifuged, and the supernatant was dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. The material was then applied to a heparin-agarose column, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Fractions containing EC-SOD activity were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and fractionated by anion exchange using a Mono Q column. Fractions containing EC-SOD activity were pooled without further separation. EC-SOD activity was determined using the spectrophotometric cytochrome c reduction assay as described by McCord and Fridovich (29McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6056-6063Google Scholar) and modified by Spitz and Oberley (30Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 8-18Google Scholar). Purification of Type I Collagen—Fetal calfskin was obtained from the local slaughterhouse. Type I collagen was purified from calfskin by a series of acid extractions and salt precipitation steps as described (31Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. Briefly, the skin was cleaned from fat, cut into small pieces, washed three times in cold 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, and left in the buffer overnight. Collagen was extracted from the tissue by stirring in 0.5 m acetic acid for 24 h. The NaCl concentration of the supernatant was adjusted to 5% (w/v), and the collagen was allowed to precipitate for 16 h. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 10000 × g for 30 min and dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid. The solubilized protein was precipitated by dialysis into 20 mm Na2HPO4, and the material (type I collagen) was subsequently collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid, and 5% (w/v) NaCl was subsequently added. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, and the pellet was dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid. The collagen was then dialyzed against water followed by 5 mm acetic acid and stored at -20 °C until further use. The concentration was estimated to be 1 mg/ml by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Binding of EC-SOD to Collagen-Sepharose—Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B was rehydrated and washed as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The coupling of collagen was performed as described by the manufacturer using a density of 3 mg of soluble collagen per milliliter of resin. A human aorta homogenate was prepared as described above and applied to a 3.5-ml collagen-Sepharose column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The column was washed until the absorbance at 280 nm was below 0.05. Bound proteins were stepwise eluted with ∼3 column volumes of 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. Amino Acid Analysis—Protein concentration for Biacore analysis was determined using amino acid composition analysis. Samples (∼500 pmol) were hydrolyzed for 24 h at 110 °C in 6 n HCl containing 0.1% phenol and analyzed as described before (32Meltzer N.M. Tous G.I. Gruber S. Stein S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 356-361Google Scholar, 33Barkholt V. Jensen A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 318-322Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—The dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction between EC-SOD and type I collagen was determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). The immobilization of native-type collagen fibrils in the flow cells of the sensor chips is not feasible. Hence, purified and soluble type I collagen was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip as described previously using N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccimide (34Birn H. Verroust P.J. Nexo E. Hager H. Jacobsen C. Christensen E.I. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26497-26504Google Scholar). The resultant density of collagen was 71 fmol/mm2. The binding analysis was performed in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Kinetic parameters were determined by the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (Biacore). The concentration of EC-SOD was determined by amino acid analysis and used to calculate Kd, fitting the data to a 1:1 binding model. ELISA—Maxisorb microtiter wells (Nunc, Denmark) were coated with 0.1 μg of collagen in 100 μl of 30 mm NaH2PO4, 30 mm TES, and 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, overnight at 23 °C. This buffer is known to induce fibril formation of soluble collagen (35Williams B.R. Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6578-6585Google Scholar). The wells were emptied, and residual binding-sites were blocked by the addition of 200 μl of 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS for 1 h. A 2-fold dilution series of EC-SOD or trypsin-treated EC-SOD were made in 20 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v), and Tween 20, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). Limited digestion of EC-SOD with trypsin (100:1 w/w) removes the C-terminal heparin-binding region (28Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Google Scholar). The reaction proceeded for 30 min at 37 °C, and the trypsin was subsequently inhibited by the addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The reaction was monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis. For collagen competition studies, 2500 ng/ml EC-SOD was incubated with the indicated concentrations of soluble collagen for 1 h at 23 °C in buffer A. During the incubation, the collagen formed visible fibrils at concentrations of 100, 50, and 25 μg/ml. To the wells were added 100 μl of the reaction mixtures, and EC-SOD was allowed to bind to the collagen surface for 90 min at 23 °C. All samples were done in doublet. After washing the wells three times in buffer A, 0.1 μg of monoclonal anti-EC-SOD antibody in 100 μl of buffer A was added and allowed to bind for 90 min at 23 °C. Wells were washed in buffer A and bound a primary antibody subsequently detected by the addition of HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig antibody. Wells were developed using the o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride system and read at 450 nm. Protection of ROS-mediated Collagen Degradation by EC-SOD—ROS were generated by the Cu(II)/H2O2 system. This system was chosen because it generates both superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals. The reaction mechanism, shown below in Reaction 1, Reaction 2, Reaction 3, H2O2+Cu(II)→Cu(I)+O2˙-+2H+Reaction 1 Cu(II)+O2˙-→Cu(I)+O2Reaction 2 H2O2+Cu(I)→Cu(II+OH·+OH-Reaction 3 has been proposed previously (36Zhao F. Ghezzo-Schoneich E. Aced G.I. Hong J. Milby T. Schoneich C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9019-9029Google Scholar, 37Kato Y. Kitamoto N. Kawai Y. Osawa T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 624-632Google Scholar). The first reaction proceeds faster at alkaline pH (preferably >11) but was carried out at pH 7.4 to lower the reaction rate. Reconstituted native-type collagen fibrils were made by incubating ∼6 μg of purified collagen at 0.1 mg/ml 30 mm NaH2PO4, 30 mm TES, and 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 for 16 h at 26 °C (35Williams B.R. Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6578-6585Google Scholar). Several tubes were incubated for analysis. The visible fibrils were recovered by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. The supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining to verify that equal amounts of native-type collagen fibrils were generated in each tube. To the collagen fibrils were added 30 μl of 0.1 m NaH2PO4, pH 7.4 containing 50 μm CuSO4 and EC-SOD at the indicated concentrations. Formation of ROS was initiated by the addition of 5 mm H2O2. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 23 °C and stopped by the addition of 5 mm EDTA. The reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein Identification by Nano Liquid Chromatography and Tandem Mass Spectrometry (nanoLC MS/MS)—The excised protein bands were digested with trypsin (Promega) essentially as described (38Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). For nanoLC MS/MS, an LCPackings Ultimate HPLC system was coupled directly to a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. The tryptic peptides were loaded onto C18 PepMap nano-pre-columns (LCPackings) and eluted into the mass spectrometer through a 75-μm-inner diameter fused silica emitter (New Objective, Cambridge, MA) packed with 3 μm of Nucleosil C18 reverse-phase material (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The column was developed using a linear gradient from 0.4% acetic acid/0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid in water (Solvent A) to 90 acetonitrile/0.4% acetic acid/0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid in water (solvent B). MS/MS spectra were searched against Swiss Protein Database using the MASCOT software (Matrix Science, London, UK). Binding of EC-SOD to Type I Collagen—The interaction between collagen and EC-SOD was investigated by affinity chromatography. An aorta homogenate was applied to a collagen-Sepharose column, and the bound proteins were subsequently eluted by NaCl (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the collected fractions by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 1B) revealed that EC-SOD bound to the column and was eluted with 100 mm NaCl. This suggests that the interaction is weak and electrostatic in nature. To examine the level of nonspecific binding, an underivatized Sepharose column was prepared. No binding of EC-SOD could be detected using the same conditions as were used for the collagen-Sepharose column (data not shown). We conclude that the interaction between EC-SOD and collagen-Sepharose was facilitated by specific interactions between the collagen and EC-SOD. Determination of the Dissociation Constant Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—The interaction between EC-SOD and collagen was further examined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The analysis displayed concentration-dependent response curves. The dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction was estimated to be 200 nm. This is in agreement with the data obtained by collagen-Sepharose affinity chromatography, suggesting that EC-SOD specifically binds type I collagen, but with relatively low affinity. The Heparin-binding Region of EC-SOD Is Involved in the Collagen Interaction—To further characterize the EC-SOD/collagen interaction, we used ELISA. EC-SOD bound in a concentration-dependent manner to microtiter wells coated with native-type collagen fibrils (Fig. 3A, closed circles). To verify the structural integrity of the bound collagen, a competition assay was performed. The assay showed that native soluble collagen was able to inhibit the binding of EC-SOD to the immobilized collagen (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the binding site for EC-SOD on the collagen fibrils remains structurally intact when immobilized in the microtiter wells. To study the involvement of the heparin-binding region in collagen binding, the region was removed by limited proteolysis with trypsin as described previously (28Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Google Scholar). This produces a truncated EC-SOD tetramer without the C-terminal heparin-binding regions corresponding to type A. When this form of EC-SOD was subjected to the ELISA analysis, we did not detect any binding to the immobilized collagen (Fig. 3A, open circles). This suggests that the heparin-binding region of EC-SOD is responsible for the binding to type I collagen. EC-SOD Protects Collagen against ROS-mediated Degradation—To examine the functional relevance of the EC-SOD/collagen interaction, we exposed a fixed amount of native-type I collagen fibrils to ROS in the presence of increasing amounts of EC-SOD. The degradation of the collagen was followed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). It is apparent that EC-SOD protects collagen from ROS-mediated modifications, because the intensity of the collagen bands decreases in the absence of EC-SOD. However, as the Cu(II)/H2O2 system also generates the hydroxyl radical, the complete inhibition of collagen degradation by EC-SOD could not be observed. Upon extended ROS exposure, collagen was completely degraded (not shown). It has been shown previously by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry studies that EC-SOD is localized in tissue areas containing high amounts of type I collagen (24Oury T.D. Chang L.Y. Marklund S.L. Day B.J. Crapo J.D. Lab. Investig. 1994; 70: 889-898Google Scholar). In the present study, the direct interaction between these two proteins was verified by affinity chromatography using collagen-Sepharose and by surface plasmon resonance analysis. The Kd of the interaction was determined to be 200 nm. Taken together, these analyses imply that the interaction between EC-SOD and type I collagen is specific but of low affinity. This suggests that a dynamic relationship exists where transient interactions are favored. However, considering the repetitive nature of the collagen molecule, which may present several epitopes for EC-SOD binding, and the high concentration of collagen in the ECM, it is likely that EC-SOD is associated with collagen in the extracellular space. The Kd for the interaction between recombinant EC-SOD and heparin was determined to be 120 nm (39Lookene A. Stenlund P. Tibell L.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 230-236Google Scholar). The affinities for these two EC-SOD binding partners are comparable, and it is thus likely that EC-SOD is distributed equally between collagen and heparan sulfate in the ECM. The dual binding capacity influences the distribution in the ECM and is likely important for the regulation of the local oxidant/antioxidant level. In addition to facilitating the interaction with cell surface heparan sulfate and heparin, the C-terminal region of EC-SOD (Arg-210 to Ala-222) proved to be important for the collagen binding. The antiangiogenic protein pigment epithelium-derived factor has the capacity to bind both heparin and type I collagen. It has recently been shown that the amino acid residues involved in binding are located at distinct areas on the protein, suggesting that the binding-activities can be regulated independently (40Meyer C. Notari L. Becerra S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45400-45407Google Scholar). In contrast, the heparan sulfate and the collagen binding activities of EC-SOD both reside in the C-terminal region. Consequently, it is not possible to regulate the ligand binding activity independently by the intracellular proteolytic removal of this region (10Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Hojrup P. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14818-14822Google Scholar). The high content of charged amino acid residues in the C terminus (seven Arg/Lys and two Glu) and the fact that the interaction between EC-SOD and collagen-Sepharose can be disrupted by 100 mm NaCl suggests that ionic interactions are at least partly responsible for the binding. It has been shown recently that substitution of Arg or Lys residues with Ala in the C-terminal region reduces the affinity for heparin (41Stenlund P. Lindberg M.J. Tibell L.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3168-3175Google Scholar). In addition, substitution of Glu residues with Ala increased the affinity. This suggests that the binding of EC-SOD to heparin is largely dependent on charge density and that the structural conformation of the C-terminal region may be of less importance. Whether the ionic interaction of EC-SOD with collagen relies on specific epitopes defined by secondary structural elements is not known. However, because the structure of collagen fibrils is repetitive in nature, EC-SOD might be able to bind several places along the collagen fibrils and thus provide global protection. Because the C-terminal region of EC-SOD supports the interaction with both heparin/heparan sulfate and collagen, we suggest the term “ECM-binding region” to indicate the multiple binding characteristics of this region. The damage exerted by ROS, especially the hydroxyl radical, is confined to a small area because of their high reactivity toward other molecules. It is thus important that free radical scavengers are situated in the vicinity of the ROS production site. The binding of EC-SOD type B and C to heparan sulfate anchors EC-SOD to the cell surface, whereas the ability to bind collagen likely affects the distribution in a different way. In particular, the EC-SOD/collagen interaction is likely to protect collagen from ROS-mediated degradation. The ability of EC-SOD to protect proteins from oxidative fragmentation at proline residues was recently illustrated in vivo using EC-SOD knock-out mice (25Fattman C.L. Chang L.Y. Termin T.A. Petersen L. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 763-771Google Scholar). In this study, it was found that the lung tissue of ec-sod null mice subjected to oxidative stress contained elevated amounts of 2-pyrrolidone as compared with wild-type animals. As the presence of 2-pyrrolidone indicates oxidative cleavage of prolyl peptide bonds (18Uchida K. Kato Y. Kawakishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 265-271Google Scholar, 19Kato Y. Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23646-23651Google Scholar), the effect was presumed to reflect an increased level of oxidative collagen fragmentation based on the fact that EC-SOD strongly colocalizes with type I collagen and on the high content of proline residues in this molecule. In this paper we have demonstrated that human EC-SOD does in fact reduce oxidative degradation of native-type collagen fibrils. Because the Cu(II)/H2O2 system generates both hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, the presence of EC-SOD does not result in protection of collagen during extended incubation in vitro (19Kato Y. Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23646-23651Google Scholar). However, it is likely that it may slow down the reaction kinetics as observed previously (25Fattman C.L. Chang L.Y. Termin T.A. Petersen L. Enghild J.J. Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 763-771Google Scholar, 36Zhao F. Ghezzo-Schoneich E. Aced G.I. Hong J. Milby T. Schoneich C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9019-9029Google Scholar). Thus, in physiological conditions the EC-SOD/collagen interaction could attenuate the production of collagen fragments that act as chemoattractants for neutrophils and thereby diminish the inflammatory reaction (42Laskin D.L. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Riley D.J. Berg R.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1986; 39: 255-266Google Scholar, 43Malone J.D. Richards M. Jeffrey J.J. Matrix. 1991; 11: 289-295Google Scholar, 44Laskin D.L.

https://openalex.org/W2148129434,"Endoglin is a membrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in cardiovascular development and angiogenesis. We examined the role of endoglin in the control of vascular tone by measuring nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation in haploinsufficient mice (Eng+/-) and their Eng+/+ littermates. The vasodilatory effect of acetylcholine, bradykinin, and sodium nitroprusside was assessed in anesthetized mice; in isolated, perfused hindlimbs; and in aortic rings. The substantial hypotensive and vasodilatory response induced by acetylcholine and bradykinin in Eng+/+ was markedly reduced in Eng+/- mice. Both kinds of animals had similar responses to sodium nitroprusside, suggesting that the deficient vasodilatory effect is not due to a NO response impairment. Urinary and plasma concentrations of nitrites, a NO metabolite, were lower in Eng+/- than in Eng+/+ mice. The levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in kidneys and femoral arteries were about half in Eng+/- than in Eng+/+ mice and were also reduced in primary cultures of aortic endothelial cells from Eng+/- compared with those from Eng+/+ mice. Furthermore, overexpression or suppression of endoglin in cultured cells induced a marked increase or decrease in the protein levels of eNOS, respectively. Thus, our results in vivo and in vitro demonstrate a relationship between endoglin and NO-dependent vasodilation mediated by the regulation of eNOS expression."
https://openalex.org/W2169164259,"α1-Adrenergic receptors (ARs) belong to the large Class I G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and comprise three subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D). Previous work with heterologously expressed C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged α1-ARs showed that α1A- and α1B-ARs localize to the plasma membrane, whereas α1D-ARs accumulate intracellularly. We recently showed that α1D- and α1B-ARs form heterodimers, whereas α1D- and α1A-ARs do not. Here, we examined the role of heterodimerization in regulating α1D-AR localization using both confocal imaging of GFP- or CFP-tagged α1-ARs and a luminometer-based surface expression assay in HEK293 cells. Co-expression with α1B-ARs caused α1D-ARs to quantitatively translocate to the cell surface, but co-expression with α1A-ARs did not. Truncation of the α1B-AR extracellular N terminus or intracellular C terminus had no effect on surface expression of α1D-ARs, suggesting primary involvement of the hydrophobic core. Co-transfection with an uncoupled mutant α1B-AR (Δ12α1B) increased both α1D-AR surface expression and coupling to norepinephrine-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization. Finally, GFP-tagged α1D-ARs were not detected on the cell surface when expressed in rat aortic smooth muscle cells that express no endogenous ARs, but were almost exclusively localized on the surface when expressed in DDT1MF-2 cells, which express endogenous α1B-ARs. These studies demonstrate that α1B/α1D-AR heterodimerization controls surface expression and functional coupling of α1D-ARs, the N- and C-terminal domains are not involved in this interaction, and that α1B-AR G protein coupling is not required. These observations may be relevant to many other Class I G protein-coupled receptors, where the functional consequences of heterodimerization are still poorly understood. α1-Adrenergic receptors (ARs) belong to the large Class I G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and comprise three subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D).

Interestingly, membrane expression correlates with differences in coupling efficiencies for α1-AR subtypes (α1A > α1B ≥ α1D) in transfected cells (13Chalothorn D. McCune D.F. Edelmann S.E.

Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with high potencies and intrinsic activities. We reported previously that N-terminal truncation increased α1D-AR binding, functional responses, and surface membrane expression (17Pupo A.S. Uberti M.A. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 462: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Hague C. Chen Z. Pupo A.S. Schulte N.A. Toews M.L. Minneman K.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

It seems more likely that difficulties in heterologous expression of α1D-ARs relate to the lack of accessory trafficking proteins. There are now many reports of homo- and hetero-dimerization of GPCRs (22Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 23Heldin C.H.

In fact, it now appears that the majority of GPCRs can form dimers, often with distantly related receptors (28Lavoie C. Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Umapathy D. Breit A. Villeneuve L.R. Zhu W.Z.

Cell. 2001; 106: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar), where hetero-oligomerization is required to form a single functional receptor, GPCR dimerization only rarely results in clearly observable changes in pharmacology or functional responses. Thus the functional significance of Class I GPCR dimerization remains a matter of active debate. We previously reported that epitope-tagged α1-ARs exist as both monomers and dimers (36Vicentic A. Robeva A. Rogge G. Uberti M. Minneman K.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization between these receptors has now been widely reported (37Stanasila L. Perez J.B. Vogel H. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40239-40251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38Carrillo J.J. Pediani J. Milligan G. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We found in previous studies that α1-AR heterodimerization is subtype-specific, with α1B-ARs interacting with α1A- or α1D-ARs, but with no detectable interactions between α1A- and α1D-ARs (39Uberti M.A. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, heterodimerization did not alter apparent ligand-binding properties but, rather, resulted in increased receptor expression (39Uberti M.A. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In particular, α1B/α1D-AR heterodimerization increased surface expression of α1D-ARs as monitored by a luminometer assay (39Uberti M.A. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). From these data, we hypothesized that α1B/α1D-AR heterodimerization might help traffic α1D-ARs to the plasma membrane where they would be accessible to their hydrophilic ligands. In this study, we used a combination of N- and C-terminally tagged α1-ARs to investigate the role of α1-AR dimerization in regulating receptor localization and function. We found that co-expression of α1B/α1D-AR heterodimers quantitatively promotes surface expression of α1D-ARs and also increases coupling to intracellular Ca2+ release. This interaction is subtype-specific, does not require the N- or C-terminal domains of the receptor, and is not dependent on α1B-AR G protein coupling. These data provide a clear example of the physiological importance of heterodimerization for a Class I GPCR subtype, the α1D-AR, which has been difficult to study functionally due to its predominantly intracellular localization when expressed alone in many cell types.

Construction of Tagged and Truncated α1-ARs—Human α1-AR cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pDT containing in-frame N-terminal hexahistidine and FLAG epitope tags as previously described (36Vicentic A. Robeva A. Rogge G. Uberti M. Minneman K.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Uberti M.A. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After sequencing, unique restriction sites were used to replace the FLAG-hexahistidine tag in pDT with the HA-epitope tag using complementary annealed oligonucleotides with appropriate overhangs. N-terminally truncated human α1B-ARs (Δ1-38α1B) were generated by PCR using specific primers on human α1B-AR cDNA in pDT, subcloned, and sequenced. C-terminal truncated α1B-ARs (Δ366-519α1B) were generated using PCR to insert a stop codon ∼20 amino acids after the predicted seventh transmembrane domain at the conserved glutamine at position 366. To create CFP-tagged α1A-AR, α1B-AR and α1D-ARs, the pECFP-N1 vector was modified by removing one nucleotide (C667). In brief, pECFP-N1 was digested with KpnI and AgeI, gel-extracted, and annealed to a double-stranded linker oligonucleotide with appropriate overhangs (forward: CGCCGGGCCGGGATCCA; reverse: CCGGTGGATCCCGGCCCGCGGTAC), minus the cytosine at position 667. The absence of C667 resulted in destruction of the ApaI restriction site, which was used as a diagnostic test. α1A-, α1B-, and α1D-AR coding sequences were then cut from pEGFP-N3 using EcoRI and KpnI, gel-extracted, and ligated into the modified pECFP-N1 vector in-frame with the CFP tag. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293, DDT1MF-2, and RASM cells were propagated in DMEM with sodium pyruvate supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Confluent plates were subcultured at a ratio of 1:5 for transfection. HEK293 and DDT1MF-2 cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA of each construct for 3 h using SuperFect® transfection reagent, and cells were used for experimentation 48-72 h after transfection. Because of the extremely low plasmid transfection efficiency, RASMs were transfected with infectious retroviral supernatants harvested from transfected Phoenix producer cells generated by a helper virus-free protocol as described previously (43Abbott K.L. Robida A.M. Davis M.E. Pavlath G.K. Camden J.M. Turner J.T. Murphy T.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 391-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Luminometer Based Surface Expression Assay—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG- or HA-N-terminal-tagged human α1-AR subtypes with SuperFect® for 24 h. Cells were split into poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were then rinsed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and rinsed 3× with PBS. Cells were then incubated in blocking buffer (2% nonfat milk in PBS, pH 7.4) for 30 min, and then incubated with the appropriate concentrations of HRP-conjugated M2-anti-FLAG or HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed 3× with blocking buffer, 1× with PBS, and then incubated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ECL reagent (Pierce) for 15 s. Luminescence was determined using a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). For internalization assays, cells were first rinsed and then stimulated with or without 100 μm norepinephrine (NE) in DMEM for 1 h before the above procedure. Mean values ± S.E. were calculated as percent absorbance in arbitrary units and statistically compared using the unpaired t test, with a p value less then 0.05 considered significant. Laser Confocal Microscopy—Cells transiently transfected with HA-, CFP-, or GFP-tagged constructs were grown on sterile coverslips, fixed for 30 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and rinsed 3× with PBS containing 0.5% normal horse serum (PBS+). For anti-HA immunostaining, fixed coverslips were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA, 5% normal horse serum) containing 0.01% Triton X-100 to permeabilize cells. Anti-HA antibody was added to coverslips overnight at 4 °C at 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer, washed 3× with PBS+, and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature at 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed 3× with PBS+ and mounted onto slides using Vectashield mounting medium. Cells were scanned with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) as described previously (44Volpicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47590-47598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For detecting GFP and CFP, fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was excited using an argon laser at a wavelength of 488 nm, and the absorbed wavelength was detected for 510-520 nm for GFP and 480-490 nm for CFP. For detecting Texas Red, rhodamine fluorescence was excited using a helium-neon laser at a wavelength of 522 nm. The pinhole size was maintained at 1 airy unit for all images. Measurement of Ca2+ Mobilization—Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was measured after preloading with fura-2 as described previously (16Theroux T.L. Esbenshade T.A. Peavy R.D. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1376-1387PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, confluent 150-mm plates of transiently transfected HEK293 cells were washed with biological salt solution (BSS) (in mm: NaCl, 130; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1.5; HEPES, 20; glucose, 10; with 0.1% BSA), gently detached using trypsin in Ca2+-free Hanks' solution, and centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 0.05% BSA and incubated with 1 μm fura-2/AM for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then diluted, centrifuged, and resuspended into 3-ml aliquots (2.0 × 106 cells/ml) and placed on ice. Prior to use, cells were warmed to 37 °C, pelleted at 1000 × g for 2 min, resuspended in 3 ml of BSS, transferred to a cuvette, and placed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 luminescence spectrofluorometer (Beaconsfield, Buckingshamshire, UK). Excitation wavelengths were 340 and 380 nm, and the emission wavelength was 510 nm. Calculation of [Ca2+]i was performed by equilibrating intra- and extracellular Ca2+ with 30 μm digitonin (Rmax) followed by addition of 9 mm EGTA, 1 m Tris, pH 9.0 (Rmin), and using a KD of 225 nm for fura-2. 100 μm NE was used to stimulate α1-AR-induced Ca2+ mobilization and was normalized to [Ca2+]i stimulated by 100 μm UTP. Mean values ± S.E. were calculated and were statistically compared using the unpaired t test, with a p value less then 0.05 considered significant. Measurement of [3H]InsP Formation—Accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates (InsPs) was determined in confluent 96-well plates. Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol for 48 h, and production of [3H]InsP was determined by modification of a protocol described previously (45Wilson K.M. Gilchrist S. Minneman K.P. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After prelabeling, medium containing myo-[3H]inositol was removed, and 100 μl of Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer (in mm: NaCl, 120; KCl, 5.5; CaCl2, 2.5; NaH2PO4, 1.2; MgCl2, 1.2; NaHCO3, 20; glucose, 11; Na2EDTA, 0.029) containing 10 mm LiCl was gently added to each well. Cells were incubated with or without 100 μm NE for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 20 mm formic acid, and samples were sonicated for 10 s. Samples were subjected to anion exchange chromatography to isolate [3H]InsPs, which were quantified by scintillation counting. Total [3H]inositol incorporation in each sample was determined by removing 5-μl aliquots prior to chromatography and counting. Percent hydrolysis of total myo-[3H]inositol into [3H]InsPs was calculated as cpm of [3H]InsP divided by total cpm of [3H]inositol incorporated, and expressed as mean ± S.E. Mean values were compared using the unpaired t test, with a p value less then 0.05 considered significant. Cellular Localization of α1-AR Subtypes—To provide an overview of the subcellular localization patterns of individually expressed α1-AR subtypes, α1-ARs tagged at the C terminus with either GFP or CFP were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, fixed on coverslips, and examined using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table I, both GFP- and CFP-tagged α1A- and α1B-ARs were primarily located at the plasma membrane, whereas α1D-ARs showed almost exclusively intracellular localization, as reported previously (13Chalothorn D. McCune D.F. Edelmann S.E. Garcia-Cazarin M.L. Tsujimoto G. Piascik M.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Hague C. Chen Z. Pupo A.S. Schulte N.A.

Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of α1B-/α1D-AR heterodimerization on cellular localization, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged α1D-ARs and HA-tagged α1B-ARs, or with GFP-tagged α1B-ARs and CFP-tagged α1D-ARs. As shown in Fig. 2A, confocal imaging of fixed cells demonstrated that co-expression of α1B- and α1D-ARs resulted in complete translocation of α1D-ARs from intracellular sites to the plasma membrane. This was observed in all cells that expressed both constructs (data not shown). To study this using a different technique, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged α1D-ARs and HA-tagged α1B-ARs, and cell surface expression of FLAG-α1D-ARs was quantified using a luminometer-based assay (Fig. 2C). In comparison to transient expression of α1D-ARs alone, co-expression of α1B- with α1D-ARs resulted in a significant increase (6.7-fold) in α1D-AR cell surface expression, which is strikingly similar to the -fold increase (6.6-fold) in α1D-AR cell surface expression observed with cell counts (Table I). Because the cell counts were performed only with GFP fluorescence, we could not distinguish cells that expressed only one receptor subtype from those that expressed both, probably accounting for the only partial α1D-AR translocation. These data clearly demonstrate that α1B-AR/α1D-AR dimerization facilitates quantitative translocation of α1D-ARs to the cell surface. Co-expression of α1A-/α1D-ARs Does Not Result in Surface Localization of α1D-ARs—Our previous data showed that epitope-tagged α1A- and α1D-ARs do not form heterodimers (39Uberti M.A. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that co-expression of α1A- and α1D-ARs would not result in differences in cellular localization of either α1-AR subtype. Using the same protocol used in α1B-/α1D-AR co-transfections, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged α1D-ARs and HA-tagged α1A-ARs, or with GFP-tagged α1A-ARs and CFP-tagged α1D-ARs. As shown in Fig. 2B, confocal imaging revealed that co-transfection of α1A- and α1D-ARs resulted in a primarily intracellular localization of α1D-ARs, whereas α1A-ARs were almost exclusively found on the plasma membrane. These results were again supported using the luminometer-based cell surface assay to compare expression of FLAG-tagged α1D-ARs expressed alone or in combination with HA-tagged α1A-ARs (Fig. 2C). Unlike co-expression with α1B-ARs, co-expression with α1A-ARs resulted in no significant increase in surface expression of α1D-ARs, in comparison to transient expression of FLAG-α1D-ARs alone. Therefore, these data suggest that co-expression of α1A- and α1D-ARs does not alter the cellular localization of α1D-ARs. Role of the α1B-AR N- and C-terminal Domains in Heterodimerization—Previous work using N- and C-terminal truncation constructs has indicated that α1B-AR homo- and heterodimerization does not involve either the N or C terminus (37Stanasila L.

https://openalex.org/W2094618951,"Werner's syndrome (WS) is an inherited disease characterized by genomic instability and premature aging. The WS gene encodes a protein (WRN) with helicase and exonuclease activities. We have previously reported that WRN interacts with Ku70/80 and this interaction strongly stimulates WRN exonuclease activity. To gain further insight on the function of WRN and its relationship with the Ku heterodimer, we established a cell line expressing tagged WRNH, a WRN point mutant lacking helicase activity, and used affinity purification, immunoblot analysis and mass spectroscopy to identify WRN-associated proteins. To this end, we identified three proteins that are stably associated with WRN in nuclear extracts. Two of these proteins, Ku70 and Ku80, were identified by immunoblot analysis. The third polypeptide, which was identified by mass spectrometry analysis, is identical to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1(PARP-1), a 113-kDa enzyme that functions as a sensor of DNA damage. Biochemical fractionation studies and immunoprecipitation assays and studies confirmed that endogenous WRN is associated with subpopulations of PARP-1 and Ku70/80 in the cell. Protein interaction assays with purified proteins further indicated that PARP-1 binds directly to WRN and assembles in a complex with WRN and Ku70/80. In the presence of DNA and NAD+, PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates itself and Ku70/80 but not WRN, and gel-shift assays showed that poly-(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Ku70/80 decreases the DNA-binding affinity of this factor. Significantly, (ADP-ribosyl)ation of Ku70/80 reduces the ability of this factor to stimulate WRN exonuclease, suggesting that covalent modification of Ku70/80 by PARP-1 may play a role in the regulation of the exonucleolytic activity of WRN.

The third polypeptide, which was identified by mass spectrometry analysis, is identical to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1(PARP-1), a 113-kDa enzyme that functions as a sensor of DNA damage. Biochemical fractionation studies and immunoprecipitation assays and studies confirmed that endogenous WRN is associated with subpopulations of PARP-1 and Ku70/80 in the cell. Protein interaction assays with purified proteins further indicated that PARP-1 binds directly to WRN and assembles in a complex with WRN and Ku70/80. In the presence of DNA and NAD+, PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates itself and Ku70/80 but not WRN, and gel-shift assays showed that poly-(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Ku70/80 decreases the DNA-binding affinity of this factor. Significantly, (ADP-ribosyl)ation of Ku70/80 reduces the ability of this factor to stimulate WRN exonuclease, suggesting that covalent modification of Ku70/80 by PARP-1 may play a role in the regulation of the exonucleolytic activity of WRN. Werner's syndrome (WS) 1The abbreviations used are: WS, Werner's syndrome; WRN, Werner's syndrome protein; Ku, Ku70/80 heterodimer; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; IRES-GFP, internal ribosome entry site-green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: WS, Werner's syndrome; WRN, Werner's syndrome protein; Ku, Ku70/80 heterodimer; PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; IRES-GFP, internal ribosome entry site-green fluorescent protein. is a human genetic disease with many features of premature aging (1Epstein C.J. Martin G.M. Schultz A.L. Motulsky A.G. Medicine. 1966; 45: 177-221Google Scholar, 2Dyer C. Sinclair A. Age and Ageing. 1998; 27: 73-80Google Scholar). The first signs of this disorder appear soon after puberty, with the symptoms becoming fully evident in individuals between 20 and 30 years old. Individuals with WS display a high incidence of diseases associated with normal aging, including atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, type II diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Myocardial infarction and cancer are the most common causes of death among WS patients. The median age of death is ∼47 years (1Epstein C.J. Martin G.M. Schultz A.L. Motulsky A.G. Medicine. 1966; 45: 177-221Google Scholar, 3Matsumoto T. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 335-336Google Scholar). Cells isolated from WS patients show genomic instability and a shorter replicative life span (4Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 213-220Google Scholar). The genomic instability is characterized by an elevated rate of chromosomal translocations and extensive genomic deletions (5Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5893-5897Google Scholar). These findings suggest that genomic instability underlies the development of the diseases associated with WS. Cultured cells from WS patients are also hypersensitive to some DNA damaging agents (4Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 213-220Google Scholar), suggestive of a defect in the repair of specific DNA lesions. Werner's syndrome is caused by mutations within a single gene, which is located on chromosome 8 (6Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Google Scholar). The cDNA encodes a protein (Werner's syndrome protein, WRN) with strong homology to a class of enzymes called RecQ helicases (7Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Google Scholar). In addition, the amino-terminal region of WRN is highly homologous to the nuclease domain of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and ribonuclease D (8Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Google Scholar). Helicase and exonuclease activities with a 3′ to 5′ directionality have been demonstrated in vitro using recombinant WRN (9Gray M.D. Wang L. Youssoufian H. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Exp.

A nuclear localization signal is found near the carboxyl-terminal end of WRN (4Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 213-220Google Scholar). All of the WRN mutations in individuals with Werner's syndrome result in non-sense mutations or frameshifts leading to truncated proteins. The prevailing hypothesis is that the aberrant proteins do not enter the nucleus and are rapidly degraded. Consistent with this idea, cell lines from WS patients show no detectable WRN polypeptide (15Moser M.J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Jacob J.E. Bennett S.E. Oshima J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 648-654Google Scholar). A number of studies have indicated that WRN binds to proteins that are involved in DNA replication and repair, such as the replication protein A, topoisomerase I, DNA polymerase δFen-1, p53, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and Rad 52 (11Kamath-Loeb A.S.

Otterlei M. Bjoras M. von Kobbe C. Bohr V.A. Seeberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36476-36486Google Scholar). Although some of these proteins have been shown to influence WRN catalytic activities in vitro, the physiological significance of these interactions remains largely unknown. In previous studies, we reported that WRN binds to Ku70/80 heterodimer (Ku) (23Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Google Scholar), a factor involved in the repair of doublestrand DNA breaks by non-homologous end joining (reviewed in Ref. 24Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Google Scholar). Remarkably, our studies showed that Ku recruits WRN to DNA ends and alters the properties of the WRN exonuclease (23Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Google Scholar, 25Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9896-9902Google Scholar). Other studies have also indicated that Ku70/80 is required for the WRN-mediated hydrolysis of DNA molecules containing lesions mimicking oxidative DNA damage (26Orren D.K. Machwe A. Karmakar P. Piotrowski J. Cooper M.P. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1926-1934Google Scholar). A functional interaction between WRN and Ku70/80 is also supported by genetic studies showing that Ku80-null mice display genomic instability and shortened life span (27DiFilippantonio M.J. Zhu J.

Lim D.S. Karsenty G. Finegold M. Hasty P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10770-10775Google Scholar). Thus, biochemical and genetic evidence suggest that Ku80 and WRN may function together in a DNA repair pathway required for the maintenance of genome integrity. In this study, we report the identification of a cellular WRN complex composed of WRN, Ku70/80, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). PARP-1 is nuclear factor implicated in the control of genomic stability and mammalian life span (32Burkle A. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 725-728Google Scholar, 33de Murcia G. Menissier de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Google Scholar). Our results indicate that a subpopulation of PARP-1 coelutes over ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography and coimmunoprecipitates with WRN and Ku70/80. Further biochemical analyses show that PARP-1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates Ku70/80 but not WRN in vitro, and ADP-ribosylation of Ku70/80 reduces its DNA-binding activity and weakens its ability to stimulate the exonuclease activity of WRN. Lentiviral Vectors and Stable Cell Lines—We subcloned Flag-tagged wild type and helicase mutant (WRNH, K577M; A → G transition at position 1730 of WRN open reading frame; Ref. 34Gray M. Shen J.C.

Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Google Scholar) WRN cDNAs (excluding the polyadenylation signal and 3′ untranslated sequences) into the polylinker sequence of a lentiviral transfer vector pRRLsin.hCMV-Puro. To generate pRRLsin.hCMV-Puro, the internal ribosome entry site-green fluorescent protein (IRES-GFP) region of the vector pRRLsin.hCMV-IRES-GFP (35Sakoda T. Kasahara N. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 2037-2047Google Scholar) was replaced by a minimal SV40 promoter driving the expression of the puromycin N-acetyl transferase gene. We produced recombinant lentivirus preparations by three-plasmid transient co-transfection of human 293T cells as described by Naldini et al. (36Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Google Scholar). For lentiviral infection, 293T cell cultures were trypsinized, seeded onto 60-mm plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The supernatant containing viral particles was collected and added to cultures that were 30–40% confluent. After a 6-h incubation at 37 °C, the supernatant was removed, the cells were washed twice and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Essential medium containing 10% serum at 37 °C. Transduced cells expressing Flag-WRN and Flag-WRNH were selected in media supplemented with puromycin (10 μg/ml). The expression of Flag epitope-tagged proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag antibodies (Sigma). Construction of Plasmids and Production of Recombinant Proteins— Recombinant WRN and Ku70/80 heterodimer were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described previously (23Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Google Scholar). The pVL1392 Flag-PARP-1 vector for expression of the recombinant Flag-PARP-1 protein in Sf9 cells was constructed by PCR cloning. First, the region of the open reading frame from amino acids 1–232 was amplified from a PARP-1 cDNA clone (Open Biosystems) by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CTAGGGGCATAGGCGGAGTCTTC-3′/5′-GGGCTTTTTCAAGCTTACTATCC-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and HindIII and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/HisA vector. A HindIII fragment containing the carboxyl-terminal portion of PARP-1 was cloned into pcDNA3.1/HisA-Flag-PARP-1-N. The full-length PARP-1 cDNA was then subcloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites of a pVL1392-Flag vector. pVL1392-Flag-PARP-1 was cotransfected with linearized baculogold DNA (BaculoGold, Pharmingen) into Sf9 cells to generate the recombinant baculovirus. For the purification of recombinant Flag-PARP-1, baculovirus-infected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and Flag-PARP-1 was purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and anti-Flag resin columns. Purification of the WRN Complex—100 mg of nuclear extracts prepared from cells expressing Flag-WRNH were incubated with anti-Flag beads at 4 °C for one hour. After extensive washes, bound proteins were eluted with BCO buffer (1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) (23Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by silver staining. For the identification of the 120-kDa associated factor by mass spectrometry, we isolated the WRN complex from ∼1.0 g of nuclear extracts prepared from 293T-WRNH cells. After the immunopurification of the WRN complex, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. The gel was extensively destained, and the protein bands were excised from the gel and shipped to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer Facility and W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University for tryptic peptide digestion and sequencing by mass spectrometry. Twenty-four peptides matched PARP-1 amino acid sequences (see Table I).Table IPARP-1 peptides identified by mass spectrometryIEREGECQRSKLPKPVQDLIKVVDRDSEEAEIIRMIFDVESMKKLQLLEDDKENRIAPPEAPVTGYMFGKAMVEYEIDLQKQQVPSGESAILDRVVSEDFLQDVSASTKGDEVDGVDEVAKKPPLLNNADSVQAKMVDPEKPQLGMIDRSWGRVGTVIGSNKHPDVEVDGFSELREELGFRPEYSASQLKGGSDDSSKDPIDVNYEKFYPLEIDYGQDEEAVKGGAAVDPDSGLEHSAHVLEKNREELGFRPEYSASQLKTGNAWHSKAEPVEVVAPREDAIEHFMKGIYFADMVSKTLGDFAAEYAK Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts from 293T cells were prepared as described previously (23Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation of cellular WRN was carried out using antibody generated by immunization of rabbits with a recombinant WRN amino-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–423). Rabbit immunization and sera production were contracted to an outside company (Bethyl Inc.). Immunoprecipitation products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analyses were performed by using antibodies raised against WRN, Ku70, and Ku80 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PARP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and poly(ADP-ribose) (Trevigen). Chromatographic Analysis of WRN, Ku70/80, and PARP-1—Nuclear extracts (5 ml, 4 mg/ml) prepared according to the standard protocol of Dignam et al. (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) were loaded onto a 1-ml DEAE-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.0 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture) containing 150 mm KCl. The flow-through (containing WRN, PARP-1, and Ku70/80) was then applied to a 1.0-ml SP-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) column, which was step-eluted in buffer A containing 0.4 KCl. An equal volume (15 μl) of the nuclear extract, DEAE-Sepharose flow-through, SP-Sepharose flow-through (SP-0.15), and 0.4 m KCl eluate (SP-0.4) were loaded onto an SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with WRN, Ku70, and PARP-1 antibodies. The flow-through from the SP-Sepharose column (SP-0.15) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and 1 ml of the supernatant was loaded onto a Superose 6 column (SP-0.15 Superose, 90 ml). The column was run at 0.4 ml/min with buffer A containing 150 mm KCl, and eluates were collected in 0.6-ml fractions. Aliquots (15 μl for the Ku70/80 immunoblot; 100 μl for the WRN immunoblot) from alternate fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies raised against WRN and Ku70. For the analysis of WRN, 100 μl of the indicated fractions were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation prior to loading on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Likewise, the 0.4 m KCl eluate from the SP-Sepharose column (SP-0.4) was dialyzed in buffer A containing 0.15 m KCl, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and 1 ml of the supernatant was loaded onto a Superose 6 column (SP-0.4 Superose, 90 ml). The column was run as described above. Aliquots (15 μl for PARP-1 and Ku70/80 immunoblots; 100 μl for WRN immunoblot) from alternate fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-WRN, PARP-1, and Ku70 antibodies. Quantitation of signal intensities was performed by densitometry scanning of x-ray films. For the immunoprecipitation reactions, 0.8 ml of combined fractions 45–46 and 0.8 ml of combined fractions 47–48 from the appropriate gel-filtration column (SP-0.15 Superose 6 or SP-0.4 Superose 6) were incubated with 5 μg of anti-WRN antibody and 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h. The immunoprecipitated products were washed extensively, released by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, resolved on an SDS-8% PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblots with antibodies raised against WRN, PARP-1, and Ku70. Exonuclease Assay—WRN exonuclease activity was analyzed as described previously (23Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28349-28352Google Scholar, 25Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9896-9902Google Scholar) using a 20-oligomer A1 (CGCTAGCAATATTCTGCAGC) and a 46-oligomer A2 (GCGCGGAAGCTTGGCTGCAGAATATTGCTAGCGGGAAATCGGCGCG) partially complementary to A1. Oligonucleotide A1 was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ32P]ATP and T4 DNA kinase. The oligonucleotides were annealed by boiling and cooled gradually to room temperature. Reaction mixtures contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 fmol of DNA substrates (100,000 cpm), and increasing amounts (50, 100, and 200 fmol) of Ku70/80 or poly-(ADP-ribose)ated Ku70/80 and WRN in a final volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and each reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 μl of a formamide solution. After incubation at 95 °C for 3 min, the reaction products were resolved by 16% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis, visualized by autoradiography and phosphoimager analyzer, and quantified with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A 20-mer A1 was labeled using [γ32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed to a partially complementary 46-mer A2. Radiolabeled double-strand oligonucleotides (80 fmol, 200,000 cpm) were incubated with increasing amounts (100–300 fmol) of unmodified Ku70/80 or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Ku70/80 in 15 μl of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) at 25 °C for 10 min. The samples were resolved by electrophoresis at 10 V/cm through a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The gel was dried, and reaction products were visualized by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analyzer and quantified by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). (ADP-ribosyl)ation of Proteins—20 μg of purified Flag-PARP-1 was incubated with 2 μg His-Ku70/80 or His-WRN in a reaction mixture (500 μl) containing 100 mm Tris pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 ng/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 20 μm NAD+. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the salts concentration in the reaction was adjusted to 400 mm KCl, and the reaction mixture was incubated with anti-Flag beads at 4 °C for one hour. The supernatant was collected and incubated with metal affinity resin (Talon, Clontech) at 4 °C for one hour. After extensive washes with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors, Ku70/80 or WRN were eluted with buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, dialyzed, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, silver staining, and immunoblotting, or snap frozen at -80 °C. Isolation of WRN-associated Proteins from Cells Stably Expressing Flag-WRNH—To assist in the purification of a native WRN protein complex, we generated stable 293T cells using recombinant, replication-defective, lentivirus vectors expressing either wild-type Flag-WRN or Flag-WRNH, a WRN protein carrying a point mutation (K577M) that inactivates the helicase activity (25Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9896-9902Google Scholar, 34Gray M. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A. Blank A. Sopher B. Martin G. Oshima J. Loeb L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Google Scholar). Because Flag-WRN is expressed at extremely low levels (Fig. 1A, lane 1), this cell line is not particularly useful for biochemical studies. One possible explanation for this effect is that the increased level of functional WRN may be toxic to the cell. On the other hand, the level of expression of Flag-WRNH (lane 2), which is comparable with that of the endogenous WRN (data not shown), is sufficient for the isolation and biochemical characterization of WRNH from cell extracts. Thus, we prepared nuclear extracts from the 293T-WRNH cells and purified the tagged protein by affinity chromatography on anti-Flag resin. In parallel, extracts from 293T cells that were infected with a control lentivirus were subjected to the same purification procedure. Proteins bound to the affinity column were eluted with high salts and examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. This analysis revealed the presence of three polypeptides of ∼70, 90, and 120 kDa, respectively. These proteins were eluted specifically from the resin incubated with the 293T-WRNH nuclear extract and were absent from the eluate of the control resin (Fig. 1). The 70- and 90-kDa polypeptides were identified as Ku70 and Ku80, respectively, by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1C). To identify the 120-kDa polypeptide, the protein band was excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, subjected to proteolytic digestion, and analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Data base searches indicated that the 120-kDa polypeptide is identical to PARP-1 (see Table I), an enzyme that is activated by DNA damage and utilizes NAD+ to catalyze the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) on target proteins. The initial identification was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with monoclonal anti-PARP-1 antibody (Fig. 1C). Physical Interaction between WRN and PARP-1 in Human Cells—To provide further evidence that PARP-1 interacts with endogenous WRN in vivo, we immunoprecipitated WRN from nuclear extracts prepared from 293T cells using anti-WRN antibodies. As a control, the same nuclear extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody against β-actin. The products of the immunoprecipitation reactions were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. The results indicate that PARP-1 coimmunoprecipitates with WRN but not with β-actin (Fig. 2A). The Ku70/80 complex is also detected in the immunoprecipitation reaction with anti-WRN antibodies, confirming the results of the immunopurification of Flag-WRNH. Treatment of the nuclear extract with DNase I prior to the immunoprecipitation yielded identical results (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that PARP-1 binds to Ku70/80 (38Galande S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20521-20528Google Scholar, 39Ruscetti T. Lehnert B.E. Halbrook J. Le Trong H. Hoekstra M.F. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14461-14467Google Scholar); therefore, it is possible that Ku70/80 mediates the interaction between WRN and PARP-1. To determine whether WRN binds directly to PARP-1, recombinant Flag-PARP-1 was immobilized on anti-Flag beads and incubated with recombinant WRN (His-WRN). In parallel reactions, immobilized Flag-PARP1 was incubated with Ku70/80 or with a mixture containing Ku70/80 and WRN. After washing the beads, the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against WRN, Ku70/80, and PARP-1. As shown in Fig. 2B, WRN binds to PARP-1 in the absence of Ku70/80 (lane 6), suggesting that the interaction between WRN and PARP-1 in the WRN complex is mediated, at least in part, by direct interaction between these two proteins. Similarly, WRN binds to PARP-1 in the presence of Ku70/80 (lane 8). These results suggest that these factors can individually associate with each other and can form a trimeric complex in vitro. Analysis of the WRN Complex by Ion Exchange and Gel Filtration Chromatography—To further examine the relationship among WRN, Ku70/80, and PARP-1 and determine whether there is evidence for the existence of a stably associated complex in vivo, we performed a three-step fractionation of the nuclear extracts using a DEAE ion-exchange column, SP-Sepharose ion-exchange column, and Superose 6 gel-filtration columns (Fig. 3). The flow-through of the DEAE column, which contains PARP-1, WRN, and Ku70/80 as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B, lane 2), was applied to an SP-Sepharose column. Immunoblot analysis of the fractions from the step-eluted SP-Sepharose column indicates that WRN and Ku70 elute in both the flow-through (SP-0.15) (lane 3) and the 0.4 m KCl fraction (SP-0.4) (lane 4), whereas PARP-1 elutes in the 0.4 m KCl fraction (SP-0.4) (lane 4). The SP-Sepharose flow-through (SP-0.15) and 0.4 m KCl fraction (SP-0.4) were then individually fractionated further on Superose 6 gel-filtration columns. The analysis of the fraction eluted from the Superose 6 column loaded with the SP-Sepharose flow-through fraction (SP-0.15 Superose 6) indicates that WRN and a portion of Ku coelute in fractions 44–50 (Fig. 3C, top panel). The immunoblot analysis also indicates that a minor fraction of Ku70 elutes in the void volume, possibly suggesting the presence of high molecular weight Ku complexes or aggregates. A similar analysis of the fractions eluted from the Superose 6 column loaded with the SP-Sepharose 0.4 m KCl fraction (SP-0.4 Superose 6) shows that WRN coelutes with a portion of PARP-1 and Ku in fractions 44–52 (Fig. 3C, bottom panel). Note that these data are only suggestive of complex formation. Complex formation per se was then tested by direct immunoprecipitation of these fractions by using anti-WRN antibodies and by probing the precipitated proteins for immunoreactivity against WRN, PARP-1, and Ku70. As shown in Fig. 3D, Ku70 coimmunoprecipitated with WRN from pooled fractions 45/46 and fractions 47/48 of the SP-0.15 Superose 6 column (Fig. 3D, lanes 1 and 2), and Ku70 and PARP-1 coimmunoprecipitated with WRN from pooled fractions 45/46 and fractions 47/48 of the SP-0.4 Superose 6 column (lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that two WRN complexes may exist in vivo, one with Ku and another with both Ku and PARP-1. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation Reduces Ku70/80 DNA-binding Activity—PARP-1 is a nuclear protein that binds to DNA strand breaks and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of itself and other nuclear proteins by using NAD+ as a cofactor. This catalytic activity requires DNA. To establish that our preparation of purified recombinant PARP-1 was able to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate itself in a DNA-dependent manner, we incubated recombinant PARP-1 in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of DNA and NAD+. As shown in Fig. 4A, recombinant PARP-1 becomes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated"
https://openalex.org/W2154959571,"Macroautophagy is the major mechanism that eukaryotes use to recycle cellular components during stressful conditions. We have shown previously that the Atg12-Atg5 conjugation system, required for autophagosome formation in yeast, is necessary for Dictyostelium development. A second conjugation reaction, Aut7/Atg8 lipidation with phosphatidylethanolamine, as well as a protein kinase complex and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex are also required for macroautophagy in yeast. In this study, we characterize mutations in the putative Dictyostelium discoideum orthologues of budding yeast genes that are involved in one of each of these functions, ATG1, ATG6, and ATG8. All three genes are required for macroautophagy in Dictyostelium. Mutant amoebae display reduced survival during nitrogen starvation and reduced protein degradation during development. Mutations in the three genes produce aberrant development with defects of varying severity. As with other Dictyostelium macroautophagy mutants, development of atg1-1, atg6-, and atg8- is more aberrant in plaques on bacterial lawns than on nitrocellulose filters. The most severe defect is observed in the atg1-1 mutant, which does not aggregate on bacterial lawns and arrests as loose mounds on nitrocellulose filters. The atg6- and atg8- mutants display almost normal development on nitrocellulose filters, producing multi-tipped aggregates that mature into small fruiting bodies. The distribution of a green fluorescent protein fusion of the autophagosome marker, Atg8, is aberrant in both atg1-1 and atg6- mutants.

The distribution of a green fluorescent protein fusion of the autophagosome marker, Atg8, is aberrant in both atg1-1 and atg6- mutants. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, starvation is a signal for the initiation of multicellular development. Starving amoebae aggregate in response to cAMP to form mounds. Within these cell aggregates, intercellular signals direct the formation of a multicellular slug that migrates to a suitable location for formation of a fruiting body. The fruiting body is composed of a spore mass held aloft on a stalk composed of cells that vacuolate and die. Development is an energy-intensive process and requires that amoebae cease production of growth-related proteins and lipids and initiate a developmental program (reviewed in Ref. 1Kessin R.H. Dictyostelium: Evolution, Cell Biology, and the Development of Multicellularity. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2001: 89-98Google Scholar). One mechanism employed by Dictyostelium and other eukaryotes to mobilize resources required for development is macroautophagy. Macroautophagy is required for sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), differentiation in the yeast Podospora anserina (3Pinan-Lucarre B. Paoletti M. Dementhon K. Coulary-Salin B. Clave C. Mol.

Science. 2003; 301: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In this transport process, bulk cytoplasm and organelles are sequestered in double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes/autophagic vacuoles) that fuse with and deliver their content to the lytic compartment of the cell, the lysosome or vacuole. Genetic studies in S. cerevisiae have identified 15 APG genes that are required for the formation of these double membrane autophagosomes (2Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 6Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). A new unified nomenclature for autophagy-related genes was introduced recently (8Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar), and we will use the atg designation henceforth. The genes can be grouped into several classes that function in the localization of autophagy components to the site(s) of autophagosome biogenesis, termed the preautophagosomal structure (PAS) 1The abbreviations used are: PAS, preautophagosomal structure; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NC, nitrocellulose; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; MAP-LC3, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3. 1The abbreviations used are: PAS, preautophagosomal structure; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NC, nitrocellulose; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; MAP-LC3, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3. in yeast, and in the generation of double-membrane vesicles (reviewed in Ref. 9Huang W.P. Klionsky D.J. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Three signaling complexes are required for macroautophagy: a Tor-kinase complex, an Atg1-phosphoprotein kinase complex, and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. Tor is a phosphatidylinositol kinase-related Ser/Thr kinase that functions in the control of protein metabolism in response to nutritional status (reviewed in Ref. 10Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In addition to increasing protein synthesis by multiple mechanisms, Tor also functions in macroautophagy by signaling to Atg1, a Ser/Thr kinase that forms a signaling complex with Atg13 and Atg17 (11Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 12Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Tor influences the phosphorylation status of Atg13, which in turn alters the affinity of the Atg13-Atg1 association. During starvation, Tor is inactive, and Atg13 is hypophosphorylated and binds tightly to and activates Atg1 kinase. However, enhanced Atg1-kinase activity during starvation is apparently dispensable for induction of macroautophagy, suggesting that the Atg1 function in autophagy may be structural (13Abeliovich H. Zhang C. Dunn Jr., W.A. Shokat K.M. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy in yeast also requires a protein complex containing a class III PI3K, Vps34, a membrane-bound Ser/Thr kinase, Vps15, and a coiled-coil protein Vps30/Atg6 (14Kametaka S. Okano T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22284-22291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 15Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). This core complex functions both in macroautophagy and vacuolar protein sorting. Pathway-specific components are required for the localization or targeting of the PI3K activity; Vps38 is sorting-specific, whereas the small coiled-coil protein Atg14 functions in macroautophagy (15Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and is thought to target the PI3K complex to the PAS in yeast (16Kim J. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The human homologue of ATG6, beclin 1, encodes a Bcl-2-interacting protein that plays a role in negatively regulating mammalian cell growth and tumorigenesis (18Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B. Levine B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar). Beclin 1 binds to the human Vps34 homologue, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and both proteins localize to the trans-Golgi network, suggesting that the macroautophagy function of Beclin 1 may be related to protein sorting (20Kihara A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Two novel post-translational modifications are essential for efficient autophagosome formation. Atg12 is conjugated to Atg5 in an ubiquitination-like reaction requiring the E1-like enzyme Atg7 (21Yuan W. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Tanida I. Mizushima N. Kiyooka M. Ohsumi M. Ueno T. Ohsumi Y. Kominami E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and the E2-like enzyme Atg10 (23Shintani T. Mizushima N. Ogawa Y. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In yeast, the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate binds a coiled-coil protein, Atg16, that mediates formation of a 350-kDa oligomeric complex (24Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3888-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and localization of the complex to the PAS (17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In mammals and other eukaryotes (including Dictyostelium), the Atg16 orthologue, Apg16-like protein (Apg16L), contains both a coiled-coil motif and WD repeats (25Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Mouse Apg16L functions similarly to Atg16 in yeast, forming 800-kDa oligomers with the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, and targeting the complex to the forming autophagosome, the cup-shaped isolation membrane. In the second conjugation reaction, Atg8 is lipidated by phosphatidylethanolamine, through the action of the E1-like and E2-like enzymes, Atg7 and Atg3, respectively (26Kirisako T. Ichimura Y. Okada H. Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi M. Takao T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 27Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Lipidated Atg8, Atg8-PE, is localized to the PAS in yeast but in addition is incorporated into the forming autophagosome membrane and completed autophagosomes (28Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Atg8 synthesis is strongly induced by starvation, whereas disrupting Atg8 synthesis or function results in the production of small, physiologically inefficient autophagosomes (29Abeliovich H. Dunn Jr., W.A. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). There are three Atg8 homologues in humans: GATE-16 (Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa), GABARAP (γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein), and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (MAP-LC3). Only MAP-LC3 has been demonstrated to function in autophagy (30Tanida I. Tanida-Miyake E. Ueno T. Kominami E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1701-1706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Finally, a membrane protein complex composed of the binding partners Atg9 and Atg2 is required for autophagosome formation (31Wang C.W. Kim J. Huang W.P. Abeliovich H. Stromhaug P.E. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30442-30451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These two proteins localize to the PAS in yeast, but otherwise their function is poorly understood. Suzuki et al. (17Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) examined the localization of GFP-Atg8 and Atg5-GFP in different autophagy mutants in an attempt to order the function of the groups of autophagy proteins. The Atg6-containing PI3K complex and Atg9 are required for localization of Atg5 to the PAS. The Atg5-Atg12 conjugation system is required for recruitment of Atg8-PE to the PAS, whereas the Atg1-containing phosphoprotein kinase complex and Atg2 function after the recruitment of Atg8-PE to the PAS. Two distinct autophagy protein complexes exist at the PAS, one containing the Atg1 complex and Atg9, the other containing the conjugation proteins and Aut7/Atg8 (16Kim J. Huang W.P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). D. discoideum provides a simple yet powerful model for studying the role of macroautophagy in multicellular development. We have used Dictyostelium to study the requirement for macroautophagy in the establishment of a replicative vacuole for the intracellular bacterial pathogen, Legionella pneumophila (32Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Clarke M. Lu H. Anderson O.R. Hilbi H. Shuman H.A. Kessin R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in two Dictyostelium macroautophagy genes representative of the Atg12 conjugation system, atg5 and atg7, produce severe developmental defects (33Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17636-17645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The mutants produce aberrant fruiting bodies that are devoid of mature, detergent-resistant spores. Both mutations produce macroautophagy defects and developmental phenotypes of similar severity. We asked whether mutations in macroautophagy genes representative of the other functional classes produce an arrest at a similar stage in multicellular development. We generated mutations in representatives of the phosphoprotein kinase complex (atg1), the PI3K-signaling complex (atg6), and the lipidation system (atg8). We chose atg1 and atg6 because these two genes are the only representatives of the cognate complexes that have been identified in D. discoideum. We chose atg8 because it is the only structural component identified in the Atg8 lipidation system. We show that atg1, atg6, and atg8 genes are also required for macroautophagy in Dictyostelium. The three mutations produce defects in survival, recycling of cytoplasm and organelles during nitrogen starvation, and protein degradation during development. Additionally, development is aberrant in all three mutants. Mutation of atg1 produces the most severe macroautophagy and developmental defects, whereas mutations in atg6 and atg8 permit a further progression in development. Strains—All mutations were created in the strain DH1, which is a uracil auxotroph. Strains were grown in HL5 medium supplemented with uracil (20 μg/ml) or on lawns of Klebsiella pneumoniae (34Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Development and Spore Production Assays—Multicellular development was examined on nitrocellulose (NC) filters, on non-nutrient agar, or in plaques on bacterial lawns. For NC filters, axenically grown cells in mid-log phase (2-4 × 106 cells/ml) were washed twice in cold Sorensen C (SorC) buffer (16.7 mm Na2H/KH2PO4, 50 μm CaCl2, pH 6.0). The cells were resuspended in SorC buffer and plated on 25-mm diameter (0.45-μm pore size) nitrocellulose filters (Millipore Corp.), which rested on SorC-soaked Whatman Grade 17 filter pads, at a density of ∼3.3 × 106 cells/cm2 or 1.6 × 107cells/filter (34Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). For development on non-nutrient agar, cells were resuspended at 107 cells/ml, and 100 μl of these cells were plated on 35-mm SorC-1% Phytagel (Sigma) agar plates and allowed to dry. For development on bacterial lawns, 25-50 amoebae were mixed with 150 μl of an overnight culture of K. pneumoniae and plated on SM plates. Phenotype was examined after 5 days of incubation at 22 °C. For spore production assays, the same protocol was followed as for development on NC filters. Filters were transferred to 5 ml of SorC in 15-ml Falcon tubes 28-32 h after initiating development, and all developing structures and cells were dislodged by vigorous vortexing. The harvested structures were incubated for 5 min in 0.3% Triton X-100 to kill amoebae but leave mature spores intact. Spores were counted with a hemacytometer, and appropriate dilutions were plated on K. pneumoniae lawns to determine viability. Gene Disruption—Gene disruptions were created by insertion of a selectable marker into the coding sequence of the genes. A 2316-bp fragment of atg1 lacking only the C-terminal 18 bp was obtained by PCR with primers 1-1 (ATAAATGAAACGAGTAGGAG) and 1-4 (ACTATTGGTATTCAAAACTG) and ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The blasticidin-resistance cassette was removed from pBsR519 with BamHI and cloned into the BglII site (position 705) of the atg1 PCR product. A 5′ 1646-bp portion of atg6 obtained by PCR with primers KO6-1A (ACTCACACCCTTCAACTGTC) and 6-6 (GTATCTCTGGTAAAATCCTT) was ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The blasticidin-resistance cassette was removed from pBsR519 with BamHI and was cloned into the BamHI site (position 435) of atg6. A 1454-bp portion of the atg8 locus, encompassing the entire atg8 coding sequence, 367 bp upstream of the translational start codon, and 490 bp downstream of the translational stop codon, was obtained by PCR with primers 8-5 (CCAAACCAGTTAATAAAAAA) and 8-4 (ACAAAGAAGGATAATTGAAC) and was ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The blasticidin-resistance cassette was removed from pBsR519 with HindIII and was cloned into the HindIII site of atg8, 12 bp after the translational start codon. The three gene-targeting constructs were linearized with ApaI prior to electroporation into DH1 cells by the method of Kuspa and Loomis (35Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8803-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected with blasticidin (5 μg/ml) in HL5 medium for 1 week, harvested from Petri dishes, and plated onto SM plates, and clones of mutant or wild-type phenotype were selected for further analysis. Homologous recombination of the targeting construct with the endogenous locus was confirmed by PCR or by Southern blot. Fusion Constructs—The GFP-Atg8 fusion was constructed as described previously (33Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17636-17645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, the full-length coding sequence of atg8 was obtained by PCR from a genomic DNA template. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega), cut from pGEM-T Easy with SacI, and ligated into SacI-digested, dephosphorylated pTX-GFP. The expression of atg8 is under control of the constitutively active actin 15 promoter. Cyan fluorescent protein obtained by PCR of pECFP (Clontech) with primers XFP-5′ (GGTACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG) and XFP-3′ (GAGCTCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT) was cloned into pGEM-T Easy. The insert was removed from pGEM-T Easy with KpnI and SacI and cloned into KpnI/SacI-digested pDXA-HC (36Manstein D.J. Schuster H.P. Morandini P. Hunt D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to produce pDXA-HC-CFP. The atg1 coding sequence was generated by PCR from genomic DNA with primers 1-5GFP (GAGCTCATGAAACGAGTAGGAGAT) and 1-3GFP (GAGCTCTGTATTATTTTGAATACT), cloned into pGEM-T Easy, and digested with SacI for cloning into SacI-digested, dephosphorylated pDXA-HC-CFP. Amoebae were transfected by electroporation (35Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8803-8807Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected with G418 (5 μg/ml) in HL5 medium for 1 week. Transformants were harvested from Petri dishes and plated onto SM + G418 (60 μg/ml) plates, and individual clones were selected for further analysis. We confirmed that a protein of the correct size was produced in transformed strains by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against GFP (Molecular Probes). Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was conducted as described previously (37Podgorski G.J. Franke J. Faure M. Kessin R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3938-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were deposited on nitrocellulose filters for development, and a filter was harvested every 4 h for RNA extraction. Five μg of total RNA was glyoxylated, size-fractionated on 1% agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with random primer-labeled DNA probes. Probes were obtained by isolation of appropriate restriction fragments following separation on low-melting temperature agarose gels. The atg1 probe consisted of an ∼700-bp 5′ BglII-SacI fragment of the 1-1/1-4 PCR product in pGEM-T Easy. The atg8 probe consisted of the ∼800-bp 3′ ClaI-EcoRI fragment of the 8-5/8-4 PCR product in pGEM-T Easy. Protein Turnover Assays—Protein turnover assays were based on those of White and Sussman (38White G.J. Sussman M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 53: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Developing cells were recovered from Millipore filters in SorC buffer, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.9) containing protease inhibitors (Complete, Mini, Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by freeze-thaw before determining protein levels by using the Pierce Coomassie® Plus Protein Assay Reagent, following the manufacturer's instructions. Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy procedures were as described previously (39Anderson O.R. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1994; 41: 124-128Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 2% phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde (pH 7.2), followed by 0.5-2% osmium tetroxide fixation in the same buffer, sedimented by centrifugation, and enrobed in agar, dehydrated with an aqueous/acetone series, and embedded in TAAB Epon resin (Energy Beam Sciences, Agawam, MA). Fluorescence Microscopy—To examine the localization of GFP fusion proteins, axenic cells were incubated overnight in HL5 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml G418 in 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp.). The following day, the medium was replaced with SorC 1-6 h prior to visualization (starving cells) or visualized directly (growing cells). GFP-expressing cells were viewed under a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope, and images were captured with a cooled CCD camera and processed using Metamorph 5 imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Chimeric development was conducted as previously described (33Otto G.P. Wu M.Y. Kazgan N. Anderson O.R. Kessin R.H. J. Biol.

Structural Features of atg1, atg6, and atg8 Genes in D. discoideum—We previously identified putative Dictyostelium orthologues for Atg1 (AY191011), Atg6 (AY191013), and Atg8 (AY191015) (33Otto G.P.

In addition, a putative open reading frame with homology to Atg6, which we call atg6B, was recently identified on chromosome 5 by the Dictyostelium Genome Sequencing Project at Baylor College of Medicine (dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/locus.pl?locus=apg6B). Atg1 is a serine-threonine kinase initially identified in budding yeast (40Straub M. Bredschneider M. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3875-3883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Atg1 is composed of an N-terminal kinase domain (see narrow arrowheads in Fig. 1A) and a C-terminal domain containing no recognizable motifs. Protein kinases contain 12 conserved subdomains that mediate ATP binding, binding of the substrate, and phosphotransfer (41Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). All 12 subdomains are present in the Atg1 orthologues of S. cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, and D. discoideum. The putative Atg1 orthologues from mammalian cells (42Yan J. Kuroyanagi H. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Tokumitsu H. Tomoda T. Shirasawa T. Muramatsu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 43Yan J. Kuroyanagi H. Tomemori T. Okazaki N. Asato K. Matsuda Y. Suzuki Y. Ohshima Y. Mitani S. Masuho Y. Shirasawa T. Muramatsu M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5850-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis (44Hanaoka H. Noda T. Shirano Y. Kato T. Hayashi H. Shibata D. Tabata S. Ohsumi Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) have not been shown experimentally to function in autophagy, whereas the C. elegans Atg1 orthologue, unc-51, does function in autophagy (5Melendez A. Talloczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B. Science. 2003; 301: 1387-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The homology between the Atg1 orthologues is highest in the N-terminal kinase domain and lower in the poorly conserved C terminus. The predicted 668-residue Dictyostelium Atg1 has an asparagine-rich stretch immediately following the kinase domain. Poly-asparagine repeats are common in Dictyostelium proteins, but their function is unknown. Additionally, a large 29-residue glutamine-rich stretch is present in the C-terminal half of the protein. The Dictyostelium Atg1 kinase domain shares highest homology with its Arabidopsis counterpart (44% identity over 268 residues). The homology of the C-terminal domain is also highest with the Arabidopsis protein (19% over 331 residues). The Dictyostelium protein lacks the predicted coiled-coil motif present at the C terminus of S. cerevisiae Atg1 (13Abeliovich H. Zhang C. Dunn Jr., W.A. Shokat K.M. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), as do the C. elegans and A. thaliana Atg1 orthologues when analyzed using the COILS server (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html (45Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar)). Dictyostelium contains two putative Atg6 orthologues, atg6 and atg6B. The predicted 1368-residue Atg6 and 855-residue Atg6B proteins are significantly larger than the 450-550-residue proteins in other organisms, due to an extended N terminus (Fig. 1B shows an alignment of the C termini of Atg6 proteins). The N terminus of Atg6 contains numerous stretches of asparagine residues of unknown function that are widespread in D. discoideum proteins (190/671 N-terminal residues (28%) are asparagine). This part of the protein also contains many serine residues (85/671 residues or 13%). Atg6B contains 3 poly-glutamine stretches and is rich in serine and threonine residues (12 and 10% by frequency, respectively). Both Dictyostelium Atg6 orthologues are more similar to the plant (31%/303 and 38%/331 residues) and human (32%/309 and 39%/327 residues) orthologues than to the yeast orthologue (24%/425 and 25%/419 residues) or each other (24%/643 residues). Atg6 is predicted to contain a single coiled-coil (using the COILs server at www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html), a feature described for orthologues in other organisms (14Kametaka S.

In this study we have quantitatively analyzed and compared their activity toward nine oxidative base lesions and an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site using defined oligonucleotide substrates. hNTH1 and hNEIL1 but not hNEIL2 excised the two stereoisomers of thymine glycol (5R-Tg and 5S-Tg), but their isomer specificity was markedly different: the relative activity for 5R-Tg:5S-Tg was 13:1 for hNTH1 and 1.5:1 for hNEIL1. This was also the case for their Escherichia coli homologues: the relative activity for 5R-Tg:5S-Tg was 1:2.5 for Endo III and 3.2:1 for Endo VIII. Among other tested lesions for hNTH1, an AP site was a significantly better substrate than urea, 5-hydroxyuracil (hoU), and guanine-derived formamidopyrimidine (mFapyG), whereas for hNEIL1 these base lesions and an AP site were comparable substrates. In contrast, hNEIL2 recognized an AP site exclusively, and the activity for hoU and mFapyG was marginal. hNEIL1, hNEIL2, and Endo VIII but not hNTH1 and Endo III formed cross-links to oxanine, suggesting conservation of the -fold of the active site of the Endo VIII homologues. The profiles of the excision of the Tg isomers with HeLa and E. coli cell extracts closely resembled those of hNTH1 and Endo III, confirming their major contribution to the repair of Tg isomers in cells.

However, detailed analysis of the cellular activity suggests that hNEIL1 has a significant role in the repair of 5S-Tg in human cells. DNA carrying vital genetic information of cells constantly suffers from spontaneous deamination and depurination, alkylation, and oxidation (1Lindahl T.

Nature. 2003; 421: 436-440Google Scholar). These reactions lead to modifications of the DNA backbone and bases, with the latter predominating. The resulting aberrant bases are potentially genotoxic because of the loss or alteration of base pairing information (4Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Google Scholar), and hence need to be restored by the cellular repair system (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

The major repair mechanism for such damage is the base excision repair (BER) 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; Endo, endonuclease; hNTH1, human Nth homologue; hNEIL1 and hNEIL2, human Nei-like 1 and 2; Tg, thymine glycol; hoU, 5-hydroxyuracil; hoC, 5-hydroxycytosine; fU, 5-formyluracil; hmU, 5-hydroxymethyluracil; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic site; 8-oxoG, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine; mFapyG, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine; Oxa, oxanine; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; Endo, endonuclease; hNTH1, human Nth homologue; hNEIL1 and hNEIL2, human Nei-like 1 and 2; Tg, thymine glycol; hoU, 5-hydroxyuracil; hoC, 5-hydroxycytosine; fU, 5-formyluracil; hmU, 5-hydroxymethyluracil; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic site; 8-oxoG, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine; mFapyG, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine; Oxa, oxanine; BSA, bovine serum albumin. pathway (6Scharer O.D. Jiricny J. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 270-281Google Scholar), which is conserved from bacteria to humans. In the first step of BER, DNA glycosylases with distinct damage specificities detect the aberrant base in the vast sea of normal bases and remove it from the DNA backbone, leaving an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. The resulting AP site is further processed and repaired by the subsequent action of AP endonuclease (Endo), DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase through the short patch or long patch BER pathway. The initial search for DNA glycosylases involved in the repair of oxidatively damaged bases in Escherichia coli identified Endo III, Endo VIII, and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (7Wallace S.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1-14Google Scholar, 8Gros L. Saparbaev M.K. Laval J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8905-8925Google Scholar). The principal substrates of Endo III and Endo VIII are oxidative pyrimidine lesions. They exhibit redundant damage specificity and catalyze the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond (N-glycosylase activity) and the subsequent incision of an AP site by AP lyase activity via β-elimination (Endo III) or β,δ-elimination (Endo VIII). The E. coli mutants deficient in both Endo III and Endo VIII are strong spontaneous mutators (9Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Google Scholar, 10Blaisdell J.O. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6396-6402Google Scholar) and hypersensitive to the agents that generate reactive oxygen species such as ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide (9Jiang D. Hatahet Z. Blaisdell J.O. Melamede R.J. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3773-3782Google Scholar, 11Saito Y. Uraki F. Nakajima S. Asaeda A. Ono K. Kubo K. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3783-3785Google Scholar). The principal substrates of formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase are oxidative purine lesions, and it exhibits N-glycosylase and β,δ-AP lyase activities. The E. coli mutants deficient in formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase are not sensitive to ionizing radiation but exhibit a mild spontaneous mutator phenotype (12Cabrera M. Nghiem Y. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5405-5407Google Scholar, 13Michaels M.L. Cruz C. Grollman A.P. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7022-7025Google Scholar). Interestingly, while showing distinct substrate specificity, Endo VIII and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase belong to the same structural family, the Endo VIII/formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase superfamily (14Wallace S.S.

However, their activities toward oxidized base lesions have been assessed using different substrates (oligonucleotides with different sequence contexts or calf thymus DNA) and assay methods (nicking assays of DNA and release assays of damaged bases), making the quantitative comparison of activity data rather difficult. In light of this fact, we measured and quantitatively compared the activity of human NTH1, NEIL1, and NEIL2 (hNTH1, hNEIL1, and hNEIL2) and that of their E. coli homologues (Endo III and Endo VIII) using common oligonucleotide substrates. We report here that hNTH1, hNEIL1, and hNEIL2 exhibit significantly different activities toward the stereoisomers of thymine glycol (Tg) and other oxidative base lesions, and that this is also the case for Endo III and Endo VIII. These results, together with those obtained from cell extracts, indicate that base lesions generated by reactive oxygen species are removed from DNA at distinct rates in cells, and hence that their genotoxic effects can be differentially attenuated in keeping with their repair kinetics. Oligonucleotide Substrates—The substrates used in this study are listed in Table I. 30TG5R and 30TG5S containing the diastereoisomers 5R-Tg and 5S-Tg, respectively, were synthesized using the corresponding phosphoramidite monomers as described previously (38Iwai S.

Tg has four diastereoisomers with respect to the configurations at C5 and C6: two cis isomers, (5R,6S)-Tg and (5S,6R)-Tg; and two trans isomers, (5R,6R)-Tg and (5S,6S)-Tg. The pair of 5R cis-trans isomers is in equilibrium because of epimerization in aqueous solution (abundance ratio, (5R,6S)-Tg:(5R,6R)-Tg = 87:13), and so is the pair of 5S cis-trans isomers ((5S,6R)-Tg:(5S,6S)-Tg = 80:20) (40Lustig M.J.

Accordingly, the pair of 5R cis-trans isomers are abbreviated as 5R-Tg, and the pair of 5S cis-trans isomers as 5S-Tg throughout this paper. 30UR containing a urea residue was prepared by mild alkaline treatment of 30TG5R and 30TG5S (18Asagoshi K.

The native form of hNEIL1 and hNEIL2 proteins were purified as follows. Briefly, based on published sequences (31Bandaru V. Sunkara S. Wallace S.S. Bond J.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 517-529Google Scholar, 32Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Google Scholar), hNEIL1 and hNEIL2 cDNAs were amplified from the human liver cDNA library (Nippon Gene) using the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified DNA fragments were ligated into the NdeI/XhoI site of pET-22b(+) (Novagen). The recombinant plasmids for hNEIL1 and hNEIL2 were designated phNEIL1 and phNEIL2, respectively. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) was transformed with phNEIL1 or phNEIL2. The original sequence of the inserts was confirmed by sequencing phNEIL1 and phNEIL2 isolated from the host cell. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL harboring phNEIL1 or phNEIL2 was grown in LB media containing chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C until A600 reached 0.6. After the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm), the cell culture was continued at 30 °C for 3 h. The following procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Harvested cells were disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged, and proteins in the supernatant were collected by ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation). The hNEIL1 protein was purified by SP Sepharose CL-4B, MonoS, and Superdex 75 XK16/50 columns (all from Amersham Biosciences). The hNEIL2 protein was purified by SP Sepharose CL-4B (two cycles) and Superdex 75 XK16/50 (two cycles) columns. The pooled fraction containing hNEIL1 or hNEIL2 was dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol, and stored at -80 °C (hNEIL1) or -20 °C (hNEIL2). The protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. Cell Extracts—Cell extracts were prepared on ice or at 4 °C. The HeLa cell extract was prepared from confluent cells. The cell pellet was suspended in three volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm EDTA, 5 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 300 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The cells were disrupted with 30 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The proteins in the supernatant were collected by ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% saturation). The proteins were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, dialyzed against the same buffer, and used for activity assays. The E. coli cell extract was prepared from exponentially growing E. coli AB1157. The cell pellet was suspended in 10 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, and allowed to stand for 30 min. The cells were disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for activity assays. The protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit. Activity Assays—The substrates (all 50 fmol, Table I) were incubated with DNA glycosylases in appropriate buffer (10 μl) at 37 °C for 30 min. The amount of proteins was varied depending on the activity of enzymes, and is indicated in the figures. The buffer used for assays with Endo III, Endo VIII, and hNEIL1 was 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The buffer for hNTH1 was 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 8.0), 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and that for hNEIL2 was 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The reaction was terminated by the addition of gel loading buffer (0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA, and 98% formamide). After heating at 70 °C for 5 min, products were separated by 16% denaturing PAGE and the radioactivity in the gel was analyzed on a phosphorimaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji). For assays with the cell extracts, the substrates (30TG5R and 30TG5S, both 50 fmol) were incubated with the E. coli or HeLa cell extracts (0.5-4 μg) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA (10 μl) at 37 °C for 30 (HeLa extracts) or 10 min (E. coli extracts). Products were analyzed as described for purified DNA glycosylases. NaBH4 Trapping Reactions—NaBH4 trapping reactions were performed under conditions similar to those for the activity assay using 19AP/A as a substrate and Endo VIII, hNEIL1, and hNEIL2 (all 200 ng) as enzymes. In the reaction buffer for Endo VIII and hNEIL1, 100 mm NaCl was replaced by 50 mm NaCl plus 50 mm NaBH4, and for hNEIL2, 50 mm NaCl was replaced by 50 mm NaBH4. The sample was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the sample was mixed with SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris, 8% SDS, 24% (v/v) glycerol, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% SERVA Blue G), heated, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Autoradiography and quantitation of the radioactivity were performed as described above. Cross-link Reactions with 25OXA—The duplex of 25OXA/C (10 fmol) was incubated with hNEIL1 or hNEIL2 (200 ng) in the activity assay buffer described above (10 μl) at 37 °C for up to 1 h. The sample was mixed with SDS-loading buffer, heated, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Purification of hNEIL1 and hNEIL2—The hNEIL1 and hNEIL2 proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified by several chromatographic steps. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified hNEIL1 protein showed a single band with the expected molecular mass 43.6 kDa (Fig. 1A) (31Bandaru V. Sunkara S. Wallace S.S. Bond J.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 517-529Google Scholar, 32Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Google Scholar). The purified hNEIL2 protein (36.7 kDa) also showed a single band (Fig. 1A), but its mobility was comparable with that of a 42.4-kDa marker (aldolase). The unusual mobility of the hNEIL2 protein in SDS-PAGE agrees with the previous report (33Hazra T.K. Kow Y.W. Hatahet Z. Imhoff B. Boldogh I. Mokkapati S.K. Mitra S. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30417-30420Google Scholar). No bands were evident that indicated the contamination of Endo III or Endo VIII from the E. coli host. hNEIL1 and hNEIL2 were incubated with 19AP/A containing an AP site in the presence of NaBH4, and the trapped reaction intermediate (a Schiff base formed between DNA and enzyme) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). hNEIL1 and hNEIL2 gave rise to a single trapped species, which migrated slower than that formed with Endo VIII (29.6 kDa). This result further confirmed that the hNEIL1 and hNEIL2 preparations were free from Endo VIII and Endo III (23.4 kDa). Activity of Purified Enzymes for Tg Isomers—hNTH1, hNEIL1, hNEIL2, and their E. coli homologues (Endo III and Endo VIII) were incubated with 30TG5R/A and 30TG5S/A containing 5R-Tg and 5S-Tg, respectively, and the products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows plots of the amount of nicked products (average of two experiments) against that of enzyme used for the assay, which was varied depending on the activity. hNTH1 and hNEIL1 recognized both 5R-Tg and 5S-Tg isomers, but their specificity for the isomers differed significantly. hNTH1 excised 5R-Tg much more preferentially compared with 5S-Tg (Fig. 3A), whereas hNEIL1 excised 5R-Tg only slightly better than 5S-Tg (Fig. 3B). When 5R-Tg and 5S-Tg in 30TG5R and 30TG5S, respectively, were converted to urea residues by mild alkaline treatment, hNTH1 and hNEIL1 exhibited the same activity toward urea residues derived from the two Tg isomers (data not shown). These results confirmed that the differential specificities of hNTH1 and hNEIL1 toward the Tg isomers originate from the distinct configurations at C-5 and C-6 of the pyrimidine ring. The activity of hNEIL2 for the Tg isomers was below the detection limit (Fig. 3C). From the slope of the essentially linear part of the plot in Fig. 3, the activity for the two Tg isomers was calculated as [nicked substrate]/[enzyme]/min, where square brackets denote the molar concentration, and is summarized in Table II. According to the data in Table II, the specificity ratio toward 5R-Tg versus 5S-Tg is 13:1 for hNTH1 (i.e. 1.4 × 10-2 min-1 versus 1.1 × 10-3 min-1) and 1.5:1 for hNEIL1 (i.e. 5.1 × 10-3 min-1 versus 3.3 × 10-3 min-1), demonstrating marked differences in the isomer specificity between hNTH1 and hNEIL1. It can also be deduced from the activity data (Table II) that for 5R-Tg, hNTH1 exhibits a higher turnover rate than hNEIL1 (hNTH1:hNEIL1 = 2.7:1), whereas for 5S-Tg, hNEIL1 exhibits a higher turnover rate than hNTH1 (hNTH1:hNEIL1 = 1:3). These results are in contrast to those reported recently for mouse NTH1 (mNTH1) and NEIL1 (mNEIL1) (36Rosenquist T.A. Zaika E. Fernandes A.S. Zharkov D.O. Miller H. Grollman A.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 581-591Google Scholar), although the isomer specificities of mNTH1 and mNEIL1 for the two Tg isomers are similar to those observed for hNTH1 and hNEIL1 in this study. The ratio of the turnover rates for 5R-Tg (estimated from the reported data) is mNTH1:mNEIL1 = 1:29, and that for 5S-Tg is 1:570, indicating that mNEIL1 is an extremely efficient enzyme as compared with mNTH1 for both Tg isomers, which was not the case for hNEIL1 (see above).Fig. 3Differential activities of Endo III and Endo VIII homologues for the 5R-Tg and 5S-Tg isomers. The percentage of nicked products was determined by the PAGE analysis as shown in Fig. 2, and is plotted against the amount of enzyme used for the assay (average of two experiments).

Open table in a new tab The activity of E. coli Endo III and Endo VIII for the two Tg isomers was determined in a similar manner (Figs. 2 and 3). Like hNTH1 and hNEIL1, Endo III and Endo VIII exhibited significantly different specificity for the two isomers. However, Endo III excised 5S-Tg better than 5R-Tg (Fig. 3D), and the specificity ratio toward 5R-Tg versus 5S-Tg was 1:2.5 (i.e. 1.9 × 10-1 min-1 versus 4.7 × 10-1 min-1, Table II). Thus, despite being homologues, hNTH1 and Endo III have an opposite preference for the Tg isomers. Endo VIII preferentially excised 5R-Tg as compared with 5S-Tg (Fig. 3E), and the specificity ratio toward 5R-Tg versus 5S-Tg was 3.2:1 (i.e. 3.0 × 10-2 min-1 versus 9.3 × 10-3 min-1, Table II). Although hNEIL1 has a slight preference of 5R-Tg over 5S-Tg, the difference in the isomer specificity of Endo VIII (3.2-fold) is greater than that of hNEIL1 (1.5-fold). It is likely from the activity data (Table II) that Endo III exhibits higher turnover rates than Endo VIII for both 5R-Tg (6.3-fold) and 5S-Tg (51-fold). Activity of Purified Enzymes for Other Oxidative Base Lesions—hNTH1, hNEIL1, hNEIL2, Endo III, and Endo VIII were incubated with the substrates containing hoU (25HOU/G), hoC (25HOC/G), mFapyG (34FP/C), an AP site (19AP/A), a urea residue (19UR/A), fU (25FU/A), hmU (25HMU/A), and 8-oxoG (25OG/C), and products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2093236901,"Plexins encode receptors for semaphorins, molecular signals guiding cell migration, and axon pathfinding. The mechanisms mediating plexin function are poorly understood. Plexin activation in adhering cells rapidly leads to retraction of cellular processes and cell rounding ""cell collapse""). Here we show that, unexpectedly, this response does not require the activity of Rho-dependent kinase (ROCK) nor the contraction of F-actin cables. Interestingly, integrin-based focal adhesive structures are disassembled within minutes upon plexin activation; this is followed by actin depolymerization and, eventually, by cellular collapse. We also show that plexin activation hinders cell attachment to adhesive substrates, blocks the extension of lamellipodia, and thereby inhibits cell migration. We conclude that plexin signaling uncouples cell substrate-adhesion from cytoskeletal dynamics required for cell migration and axon extension."

The amplified full-length cDNA was subcloned into pCR4 containing the V5 and polyhistidine tags (Invitrogen) and sequenced.For expression in SF9 insect cells, mTLR9 was sub-cloned in the pIZT expression vector containing the V5 and poly-histidine tags (Invitrogen). This vector expressed the green fluorescent protein constitutively as a positive control of transfection.Cell Culture, NF-κB Reporter Assay, and Immunolocalization—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The HEK293 cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells in six-well plates and transfected by Exgen (Euromedex, France) with 475 ng of mTLR9 expression vector plus 1 μg of NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (Stratagene, France). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with indicated agonists for 6 h. The cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using reagents from Promega Corp. Results were normalized according to the protein content measured by the BCA reagent (Pierce-Perbio, France). Results are expressed as fold induction compared with unstimulated controls, and the data presented are the mean ± S.E. (n = 3). To demonstrate that the mTLR9 was expressed on the cell surface, 4 × 105 HEK293 cells or SF9 cells were plated on six-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of mTLR9 DNA per well. Forty-eight hours later, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. HEK293 cells were stained with anti-V5 antibody-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (Invitrogen) 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for a few minutes with phosphate-buffered saline plus 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for DNA staining. SF9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were stained with anti-V5 as primary antibody and then with anti-mouse IgG phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody (Sigma).The insect cell line SF9 was used to produce large amounts of mTLR9 and was cultured in Grace insect cell medium (Invitrogen, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% glutamine. SF9 cells were transfected with Cellfectin (Invitrogen) at 50% of confluence with 25 μg of DNA per 75 cm2 flask. Forty-hours later, cells were centrifuged, and pellets were frozen for use in surface plasmon resonance experiments.Surface Plasmon Resonance—The Biacore 3000 instrument (Uppsala, Sweden) was used with an NTA sensor chip (nitriloacetic acid bound to a solid support). SPR buffers and solutions were as follows: eluent buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4); nickel solution (500 μm NiCl2 in eluent buffer); and regeneration buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 350 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 8.3). Two flow cells were run in parallel: on the first one, irrelevant His-tagged chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) protein was immobilized to provide background corrections for nonspecific binding of plasmid on the chip surface; on the second one, His-tagged solubilized mTLR9 was immobilized for binding purposes. Runs were performed at 20 μl/min. After a 1-min injection of regeneration buffer followed by a 1-min injection of eluent buffer, the control His-tagged protein, and subsequently the His-tagged mTLR9, were immobilized on the two channels, respectively, by 2-min injections. The analytes (buffer or plasmid solutions) were then injected over the two channels for 5 min followed by a dissociation phase of 5 min. The sensorgrams were recorded and analyzed by BiaEvaluation 3 software (Biacore). For each set of experiments, sensorgrams obtained with the control channel (coated with CAT His-tagged protein) were subtracted from those obtained with the channel with the Toll-like receptor 9. If nonspecific binding to the tag histidine occurred, it was subtracted for the kinetic analysis. The resulting curve represents specific binding of the analytes on the TLR9. Signal from buffer was then subtracted from the signals obtained with the different plasmids.Reagents—pAIT2, the methylated CpG-containing plasmid, was kindly donated by New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA). The unmethylated plasmid was derived from pAIT2 by introducing a frameshift in the methylase gene. 2Cornelie, S., Poulain-Godefroy, D., Lund, C., Vendeville, C., Ban, E., Capron, M., and Riveau, G. (2004) Scan. J. Immunol. 59, 143–151. Both plasmids were produced with Endofree Gigaprep (Qiagen, France). The sequences of the bioactive CpG-ODN (TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT) and the control inverted GpC-ODN (TCCATGAGCTTCCTGATGCT) (Invitrogen) were selected from the previously published work of Sparwasser et al. (26Sparwasser T. Koch E.-S. Vabulas R.M. Heeg K. Lipford G.B. Ellwart J.W. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Detection of endotoxins was achieved by using the limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Bio-Whittaker). The level of endotoxin detected was always <0.1 endotoxin unit/ml in all DNA preparation.RESULTSTLR9 Mediates CpG-ODN-induced NF-κB Activation— cDNA-encoding TLR9 (mTLR9) was isolated from a single-stranded cDNA library from mouse lung. This mTLR9 is identical to the GenBank™ accession number AF314224 and encodes a protein of 1032 amino acid residues, which share 77% identity to human TLR9 (as described by Chuang et al., Ref. 28Chuang T.-H. Lee J. Kline L. Mathison J.C. Ulvetich R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 538-544PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the sequence obtained contains all the structural features characteristic of other TLR family members and shares poor identity to TLR2 and TLR4 (28Chuang T.-H. Lee J. Kline L. Mathison J.C. Ulvetich R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 538-544PubMed Google Scholar). We first verified that recombinant TLR9 localized to the plasma membrane of transfected cells. SF9 and HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pIZT or pCR4 expression vector containing mTLR9 respectively. Cells were fixed and stained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression of mTLR9 was detected in SF9 cells (Fig. 1a). pIZT plasmid encoding the green fluorescent protein was used as a positive control for the transfection (Fig 1b). Merging these two images indicates that mTLR9 was expressed on the plasma membrane of these cells. Membrane expression of mTLR9 was also verified in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, lower panel). The consequence of membrane expression of mTLR9 on cell activation by CpG-ODN or a CpG-containing plasmid was investigated in HEK293 cells. We transiently cotransfected 4 × 105 cells with the mammalian expression vector for mTLR9 together with a luciferase-reporter gene driven by an NF-κB promoter. As a first step, cells were activated 24 h later with 3 μm of bioactive CpG-ODN or 3 μm of control inverted GpC-ODN for 6 h. In HEK293, bioactive CpG-ODN markedly induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 2a), which was 13-fold higher than that observed with unstimulated cells. Activation of the cells by control inverted GpC-ODN induced only marginal relative NF-κB activity, comparable with that detected when mTLR9 was not expressed by the cells. Furthermore, this activity was not observed when the cells were incubated in the presence of other bacterial stimuli such as LPS. These results indicate that the NF-κB activation of the HEK293 transfected cells by the bioactive CpG-ODN is strongly dependent upon mTLR9 expression and is sequence-specific. These results are consistent with those obtained with human TLR9 by other authors (28Chuang T.-H. Lee J. Kline L. Mathison J.C. Ulvetich R.J. J.

To address this question, we used two plasmids similar in their sequences which do not code for any eukaryotic protein. These two plasmids were either fully methylated or unmethylated on the CG sequences and were derived from the pACY184 replicon. Both methylated and unmethylated CpG-containing plasmids contained about 60 CpG motifs. The pAIT2 plasmid expresses the methylase SssI gene, allowing the de novo methylation specifically on the CG sequences in bacteria; we called this the methylated CpG-containing plasmid. By introducing a frameshift in the methylase gene, we generated the unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid which contains the same number of CpG motifs, but which is not methylated. The methylation status of plasmids was verified by using a functional test with restriction enzymes. Plasmids were treated with HpaII, which cut the unmethylated restriction site (C ↓ CGG), or by MspI, which recognizes the same restriction site independently of its methylation state. 2Cornelie, S., Poulain-Godefroy, D., Lund, C., Vendeville, C., Ban, E., Capron, M., and Riveau, G. (2004) Scan. J. Immunol. 59, 143–151. This treatment proved that no one CpG was found unmethylated in the plasmid coding the SssI methylase gene. We made use of these two plasmids to test whether they could induce NF-κB activity in vitro. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with both mTLR9 and NF-κB-expressing plasmids as described above. Cells were then activated with 10 μg of plasmid DNA, corresponding to 80 nm of equivalent integrated CpG motifs. As shown in Fig. 2b, the unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid induced a 5-fold increase in NF-κB activity, whereas the same amount of methylated CpG plasmid provoked only a weak induction of 1.5-fold. Furthermore, only a 1-fold background activity was observed when the mTLR9 was not expressed by the cells. This result reinforced the hypothesis that unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid requires TLR9 for the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor. These results suggest that activation of the NF-κB transduction pathway is strongly dependent upon the methylation status of the CpG-containing plasmid.NF-κB Activation by Plasmid DNA Requires Endosomal Internalization—To confirm these findings, a dose-response experiment with both plasmids was performed. The activation of the NF-κB transcription factor by unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid increased with the concentration of the plasmid (up to 20-fold for the 100 μg dose; 833 nm of equivalent integrated CpG motifs) (Fig. 3a). It seems, therefore, that the effect of unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid is dose-dependent. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of methylated plasmid had no influence on the relative NF-κB activity. This indicates that the weak activation observed with the methylated plasmid is nonspecific. These results strongly suggest that the stimulation by unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid is mediated by a receptor, probably the mTLR9. Bauer et al. (31Bauer S. Kirschning C.J. Häcker H. Redecke V. Hausmann S. Akira S. Wagner H. Lipford G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9237-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar) have already suggested that endosomal maturation is required for the NF-κB activity induced by CpG-ODN. Therefore, we tested whether unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid required endosomal maturation to mediate its effects. Pre-treatment of HEK293-transfected cells with chloroquine prevented the induction of NF-κB activity by either unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid or bioactive CpG-ODN (Fig. 3b). This result is consistent with the previously described inhibitory effect of chloroquine on CpG-ODN-induced activation in macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells (33Macfarlane D.E. Manzel L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1122-1131PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 3Dose-response experiments and effect of chloroquine for the unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid. 4 × 105 cells were transiently transfected with 475 ng of mTLR9 and/or 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid. a, 24 h later, cells were activated with indicated doses of unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid (gray), methylated CpG-containing plasmid (black), or bioactive CpG-ODN (white). b, HEK293 cells were pre-treated with 1 μg/ml of chloroquine and then stimulated with 3 μm of bioactive CpG-ODN or 75 μg of unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid. Data represent triplicate means ± SD and are shown as fold activation compared with stimulation with media alone for each transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Plasmid DNA Binds mTLR9 —BIAcore technology was used to study the physical interaction of CpG-containing plasmid with mTLR9 produced in SF9 cells. Expression of mTLR9 was tested by Western blotting for each batch of transfected cells (data not shown). After cell transfection and lysis, the supernatant containing His-tagged TLR9 was used to cover an Ni-NTA sensor chip. Several concentrations of the CpG-containing plasmid were tested in this experiment. To ensure that the observed interactions occurred with the TLR9, a correction for nonspecific binding was applied by subtraction of the control channel data where the chip was coated with an irrelevant His-tagged protein, the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase protein for each binding experiment, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 4a, when 250 nm (calculated as CpG motifs) of unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid was injected onto the sensorchip, a significant increase in the absorption of signal (37.1 resonance units (RU); corresponds to 1 pg/mm2) was observed. This difference was enhanced with increased doses of unmethylated plasmid, demonstrating that the unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid binds to mTLR9. The kinetics of association are slow and saturable. On the other hand, injection of methylated CpG-containing plasmid showed flattened association curves and a much lesser increase in RU at the dissociation phase, suggesting nonspecific interactions. Therefore, we subtracted this nonspecific interaction from the sensorgrams of unmethylated CpG-containing plasmid to determine the kinetic constants of specific binding (Fig. 4b). Although the sensorgrams had no smooth shape, probably because of the high mass and the low amount of the adsorbed plasmids, they could be correctly analyzed using a single Langmuir binding model with drifting baseline. This model takes into account the differential dissociation of the His-tagged TLR-9 molecules compared with the His-tagged control protein from the nickel chip. The affinity constant found was 186 nm ± 35 nm, taking into account the molarity of the CpG motifs in the plasmid. The relatively slow association rate constant (1 × 104m-1 s-1) suggests some conformational changes to obtain a stable complex with a half-life of ∼6 min, as calculated from the dissociation rate constant. The maximal response calculated from the dose-response curve was 80 RU, suggesting that only a low amount of TLR9 was able to bind to the plasmid after the solubilization and immobilization procedures. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that plasmid specifically binds to the mTLR9 when the plasmid contains unmethylated CpG motifs.Fig. 4Overlay plots showing the binding of CpG-containing plasmid to His-tagged mTLR9 immobilized on the Ni+-NTA surface. The flow rate was 20 μl/min. a, increasing concentrations of CpG-containing plasmid (250, 500, 1000 nm) were used.

While the bioactive CpG was injected with the plasmid, the signal obtained deeply differs from that obtained with the plasmid alone. Only a weak signal was observed, suggesting that the ODN interacts with the TLR9 (Fig. 4c, 15 RU). Indeed, because the RU response is proportional to the mass adsorbed, binding of a small molecular weight molecule (CpG-ODN) gives a signal which is much lower than that obtained with the high molecular weight ligand, i.e. plasmid DNA, resulting in a decrease in the RU response. This element strongly suggests that bioactive CpG-ODN inhibited the binding of the plasmid on the TLR9. Furthermore when the inverted GpC-ODN was injected with the plasmid, the dissociation curve obtained superposed on that obtained with the plasmid alone. These results show that inverted GpC-ODN did not inhibit the binding of the plasmid on the TLR9. All of these data support the hypothesis that mTLR9 is the receptor for plasmid DNA and that its recognition requires the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs in the sequence.DISCUSSIONRecent research on pathogen-associated molecular patterns linked to immunity has highlighted the importance of the innate response (34Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6060) Google Scholar). The patterns in question involve peptidoglycan, LPS, bacterial flagellin, lipoteichoic acid, double-stranded RNA, and bacterial DNA. These components are specific for bacteria and viruses and can signal the presence of potential infectious agents. The case of DNA is particular because its chemical composition and structure in plants, bacteria, viruses, and vertebrates is conserved. The discrimination between self and foreign DNA would depend upon certain sequence motifs and modifications such as methylation (35Krieg A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 709-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar). Indeed, mammalian DNA is highly suppressed in CpG motifs, and most of them are methylated. In contrast, these CpG motifs are more frequent in bacteria and are not methylated in the cytosine residue (36Cardon L.R. Buge C. Clayton D.A. Karlin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3799-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These features would allow the immune system to recognize specifically bacterial DNA and lead to the initiation of signal transduction within the cells (37Häcker H. Vabulas R.M. Takeuchi O. Hoshimo K. Akira S. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This would mark the starting point for the immune system to secrete cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules needed for the adaptive response (35Krieg A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 709-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar).Functional analyses in gene-deficient mice have identified TLR9 as a major component necessary for the responses mediated by synthetic CpG motifs, i.e. CpG-ODNs (27Hemmi H.

We show here that macropinosome rocketing can be induced by hyperosmotic shock, either alone or synergistically when combined with phorbol ester or pervanadate. Rocketing was blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase(s), p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and calcium, suggesting the involvement of phosphoinositide signaling. Since various phosphoinositides are enriched on inwardly mobile vesicles, we examined whether or not annexin 2 binds to any of this class of phospholipid. In liposome sedimentation assays, we show that recombinant annexin 2 binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5P2) but not to other poly- and mono-phosphoinositides. The affinity of annexin 2 for PtdIns-4,5P2 (KD ∼5 μm) is comparable with those reported for a variety of PtdIns-4,5P2-binding proteins and is enhanced in the presence of Ca2+. Although annexin 1 also bound to PtdIns-4,5P2, annexin 5 did not, indicating that this is not a generic annexin property. To test whether annexin 2 binds to PtdIns-4,5P2 in vivo, we microinjected rat basophilic leukemia cells stably expressing annexin 2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) with fluorescently tagged antibodies to PtdIns-4,5P2. Annexin 2-GFP and anti-PtdIns-4,5P2 IgG co-localize at sites of pinosome formation, and annexin 2-GFP relocalizes to intracellular membranes in Ptk cells microinjected with Arf6Q67L, which has been shown to stimulate PtdIns-4,5P2 synthesis on pinosomes through activation of phosphatidylinositol 5 kinase.

These results establish a novel phospholipid-binding specificity for annexin 2 consistent with a role in mediating the interaction between the macropinosome surface and the polymerized actin tail. The vertebrate annexin family comprises a group of 12 unique genes that encode proteins which are biochemically characterized by their ability to bind to negatively charged phospholipids in the presence of calcium ions (for a review, see Ref. 1Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Google Scholar). Although differences exist for individual annexins with regard to preference for specific lipids, such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and also the Ca2+ requirement for half-maximal binding, this fundamental property has led to a paradigm for annexin function in which soluble cytosolic annexins translocate to intracellular membrane surfaces upon elevation of intracellular [Ca2+]. Such Ca2+-dependent membrane association has been demonstrated for several annexins in various cell types (2Sjolin C. Stendahl O. Dahlgren C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 325-330Google Scholar, 3Chasserot-Golaz S. Vitale N. Sagot I. Delouche B. Dirrig S. Pradel L.A. Henry J.P. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20210-20216Google Scholar), although the functional consequences of reversible membrane binding by annexins are not well understood. Annexin 2 is typical in this regard and has been shown to associate with early endosomes, macropinosomes, and phagosomes (5Emans N. Gorvel J.P. Walter C. Gerke V. Kellner R. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1357-1369Google Scholar, 6Merrifield C.J. Rescher U. Almers W. Proust J. Gerke V. Sechi A.S. Moss S.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1136-1141Google Scholar, 7Sakai E. Miyamoto H. Okamoto K. Kato Y. Yamamoto K. Sakai H. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 823-831Google Scholar). However, the interaction between annexin 2 and endosomes is unusual in being Ca2+-independent, instead relying at least in part on the presence of cholesterol in the endosomal membrane (8Zeuschner D. Stoorvogel W. Gerke V. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 499-507Google Scholar, 9Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Google Scholar), although the possible involvement of other protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions cannot be excluded. Annexin 2 is also an F-actin-binding protein, and since endosomes move from their sites of formation to the cell interior in an actin-dependent manner (10Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhoff B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Google Scholar, 11Schafer D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 76-81Google Scholar), one possible role for annexin 2 in this process is at the interface between the endocytic vesicle and the associated actin filaments. Such a role would fit with the observations that although annexin 2 is a constituent of the actin tails that propel macropinosomes in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) 1The abbreviations used are: RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PtdIns4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns-4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns-3,4P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; HOS, hyperosmolar saline; Perv, pervanadate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PMA, phorbol myristic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; BB, Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. 1The abbreviations used are: RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; PtdIns4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; PtdIns-4,5P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns-3,4P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TMR, tetramethylrhodamine; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; HOS, hyperosmolar saline; Perv, pervanadate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PMA, phorbol myristic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DOPC, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; BB, Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. cells, it is enriched at the point of contact between the actin tail and the vesicle (6Merrifield C.J. Rescher U. Almers W. Proust J. Gerke V. Sechi A.S. Moss S.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1136-1141Google Scholar). Disruption of annexin 2 function by expression of a dominant negative mutant has been shown to disturb the trafficking of endosomes in HeLa cells (12Harder T. Gerke V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1119-1132Google Scholar) and to completely inhibit actin-based pinosome motility in RBL cells (6Merrifield C.J. Rescher U. Almers W. Proust J. Gerke V. Sechi A.S. Moss S.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1136-1141Google Scholar). In the latter study, it was noted that the same annexin 2 mutant had no effect on the actin-dependent motility of the intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes, demonstrating that the role of annexin 2 lies upstream of the actin polymerization machinery. These findings indicate that the binding of annexin 2 to endocytic vesicles is key to the function of this protein. Analysis of the lipid composition of endosome, pinosome, and phagosome membranes has revealed that these are enriched in mono- and polyphosphoinositides that are involved in the recruitment of proteins that mediate dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton (13Lemmon M.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 201-213Google Scholar, 14Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Google Scholar, 15Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Nalla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar). We show here that actin-dependent macropinosome rocketing is regulated by the stress response pathway, activation of which is known to lead to the synthesis of various phosphoinositides. We therefore examined whether or not annexin 2 could bind to any of this class of lipids, since such interactions may play an important role in the regulation of annexin 2 function. We show that annexin 2 binds with high selectivity to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5P2) in both the presence and the absence of calcium but not to other polyphosphoinositides tested. We also provide evidence, using a number of different experimental approaches, that annexin 2 binds to PtdIns-4,5P2 in living cells. These findings, when placed in the context of existing knowledge of phospholipid-binding by annexins, demonstrate the versatility of lipid-binding by annexin 2 and support the idea that annexin 2 is a regulator of membrane-cytoskeleton dynamics in vesicle trafficking. Labeling Macropinosomes with Fluorescently Labeled IgE—Alexa-568 (Molecular Probes) was conjugated to anti-2,4-dinitrophenol IgE (Sigma) according to the manufacturers' instructions and stored at -80 °C. Adherent RBL cells cultured as described previously (10Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhoff B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Google Scholar) were chilled to 4 °C in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS). HBS (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm glucose, pH 7.4) + 100 ng/ml IgE-A568 was added to the cells. After 30 min, cells were washed in ice-cold HBS to remove unbound IgE-A568 and then stimulated to produce actin rockets with hyperosmolar HBS (HBS + 150 mm sucrose), phorbol myristic acid (PMA) (10 nm in HBS), pervanadate (Perv, 200 μm in HBS), or combinations of these agonists for 40 min in 6-well plates at 37 °C. Buffer was replaced with preheated 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The plate was immediately transferred to room temperature for a further 10 min to complete fixation. Coverslips were then washed three times in PBS, permeabilized for 5 min using PBS supplemented with 10-100 μg/ml saponin, and washed a further three times in PBS. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of primary probe and then washed in PBS before incubation with secondary probes for 1 h at 37 °C in a moist chamber. Coverslips were then washed again in PBS before incubation with tertiary probes for 1 h at 37 °C in a moist chamber. Coverslips were washed a further three times and mounted in 90% glycerol, 10% PBS, 0.01% n-propylgallate. To visualize actin rockets, cells were fixed and stained using FITC-phalloidin (Sigma) prior to mounting. To quantify the incidence of rocketing, 100 cells were examined, and the number of cells with one or more clearly defined F-actin rocket was scored. In experiments to examine the pharmacology of rocketing, potential inhibitors and activators were added to cells 20 min prior to stimulation and then maintained at the same concentration throughout stimulation. DNA Constructs—The annexin 2-GFP and GFP-actin fusion constructs have been described previously (6Merrifield C.J. Rescher U. Almers W. Proust J. Gerke V. Sechi A.S. Moss S.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1136-1141Google Scholar, 10Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhoff B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Google Scholar), as have constructs expressing the constitutively active (Q67L) and dominant negative (T27N) mutants of Arf6 (16D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Google Scholar). Liposome Centrifugation Assays—Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC,Sigma) alone or mixed with PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, PtdIns-3,4P2, or PtdIns-4,5P2 (Avanti Polar Lipids) in a molar ratio of 39:1 was made up in 95% chloroform/5% methanol and dried under nitrogen. Lipid films were rehydrated by vortexing in 250 mm raffinose, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, and extruded 15 times through a polycarbonate membrane, pore size 0.2 μm (Whatman), to produce optically clear suspensions of small, unilamellar liposomes (17Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Google Scholar). These were diluted with three volumes of binding buffer (BB) (100 mm sorbitol, 40 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 130 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.1) and pelleted at 35,000 rpm for 10 min (S120AT2, Sorvall). Liposomes were then gently resuspended in BB supplemented with 1 mm EGTA, or various concentrations of Ca2+, to give a final total lipid concentration of 3.96 mm. 25-μl dilutions of liposomes in BB were gently mixed with 5 μg of annexin 2 purified to >95% homogeneity and diluted into 25 μl of BB to give a final concentration of annexin 2 of 2.78 μm. In most experiments, liposomes were diluted such that the phosphatidylinositide was present at 18-fold molar excess with respect to the annexin. Mixtures of annexin 2 and liposomes were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 10 min (S100AT3, Sorvall). The uppermost 40 μl of supernatant was removed, and the pellet was gently washed with 100 μl of BB and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for a further 10 min. The top 90 μl was again gently removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the annexin was visualized by staining with Coomassie blue. Gels were destained, and the bands were quantitated by densitometry using a Fujifilm LAS-1000 imager and AIDA-230 software. Loading of Cells with PtdIns-4,5P2-TMR, Rocket Induction, and Subsequent Fixation—PtdIns-4,5P2-TMR (Molecular Probes) was loaded into RBL cells using a Shuttle PIP™ carrier-1 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 40% confluent RBL cells grown on glass coverlips (Matek) were incubated with 50 μl of growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum) containing 3 μl of Shuttle-PIP/TMR-PtdIns-4,5P2 complexes. Complexes were allowed to form by incubating 2 μl of 1 μg/μl TMR-PtdIns-4,5P2 with 3 μl of 0.5 mm Shuttle PIP stock for 5 min at 20 °C. To induce rocketing vesicles, cells were exposed to 150 mm sucrose, 10 nm PMA in Hanks'-buffered saline solution for 15 min as described previously (10Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhoff B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with prewarmed Hanks'-buffered saline solution and fixed for 30 min with prewarmed 4% paraformaldehyde in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mm EGTA, and for a subsequent 3 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C. Indirect Immunofluorescence—RBL cells, loaded with PtdIns-4,5P2-TMR and fixed as described above, were incubated with the monoclonal mouse anti-annexin 2 antibody HH7 in 0.2% saponin, 1% fetal calf serum, 50 mm glycine, 0.1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed four times with PBS, and the secondary antibody was added in PBS + 0.2% saponin. Actin was stained using AlexaFluor 545-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in PBS + 0.2% saponin. Images were obtained using a Radiance 2000 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) and processed using MetaMorph. PIP Strips—PIP Strips were obtained from Echelon Biosciences Inc. These are nitrocellulose membranes onto which phospholipids have been immobilized (100 pmol/spot). Strips were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) in TTBS (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, ±EGTA/Ca2+) and incubated with annexin 2 in TTBS overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed four times with TTBS, and bound annexin 2 was visualized with conventional indirect immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody HH7 and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Annexins 1 and 2 were purified from porcine intestine and yeast, respectively, as described previously (18Regnouf F. Rendon A. Pradel L.A. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1985-1996Google Scholar, 19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Gouache P. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15190-15198Google Scholar). Annexin 5 was affinity-extracted from bacterial cell lysates as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase and purified following thrombin cleavage by ion exchange chromatography. Microinjections—The anti-PtdIns-4,5P2 antibody (a kind gift of Dr. G. Schiavo, Cancer Research, UK) was labeled using an AlexaFluor 555 protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and microinjected (1 mg/ml in phosphate buffer, pH 7.1) into RBL cells at room temperature with an Eppendorf semiautomated microinjector and micromanipulator (Eppendorf, Madison, WI) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope. Vectors expressing chimeric GFP fusion proteins were microinjected at 1 μg/ml in phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, containing TRITC dextran (0.4 mg/ml). We first established a protocol that preserved both actin tails and vesicles in fixed cells. The fluid phase markers used in live cell studies (10Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhoff B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Google Scholar) were unstable during chemical fixation (not shown), so we used fluorescently labeled IgE to tag the vesicles at the heads of actin comet tails. RBL cells express the FcϵR1 receptor, and IgE can be prebound to this receptor at the membrane surface and used to follow endocytosis stimulated by PMA (20Ra C. Furuichi K. Rivera J. Mullins J.M. Isersky C. White K.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1771-1777Google Scholar). Unstimulated cells did not produce rockets, but following stimulation with PMA in hyperosmolar saline (HOS), macropinosomes and actin rockets were visualized using IgE conjugated to Alexa 568 and co-staining with FITC-phalloidin (Fig. 1A). To confirm that all rocket tails were nucleated at the surface of endosomes, a number of IgE-A568-labeled, -stimulated, -fixed, and FITC-phalloidin-stained cells were imaged using confocal microscopy. Of 80 rockets seen in 50 cells, 98% were associated with clearly labeled endosomes, consistent with our previous findings in living cells (10Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhoff B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Google Scholar). We previously showed that when used alone, mild HOS and PMA weakly stimulate macropinocytic rocketing but that the frequency of rocketing is enhanced when the agonists are used in combination (10Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhoff B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Google Scholar), implying the activation of either two distinct signaling pathways or the synergistic activation of a single pathway. To test the possible involvement of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, we quantified the induction of actin rockets in response to Perv, alone and in combination with HOS and PMA (Fig. 1B). Specifically, induction of rocketing pinosomes with either PMA or Perv was strictly dependent on co-stimulation with HOS, yet a combination of PMA and Perv bypassed this requirement. Although both PMA and Perv stimulated the production of macropinocytic rockets, they are unlikely to act in the same way, the former probably acting through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway and the latter via protein tyrosine phosphorylation. This notion is supported by studies showing protein kinase C localized to rocketing endosomes in activated Xenopus eggs (21Taunton J. Rowning B.A. Coughlin M.L. Wu M. Moon R.T. Mitchison T.J. Larabell C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 519-530Google Scholar). These two signaling routes may be convergent, but both are clearly required to induce actin-based rocketing. The low level induction of actin-based rocketing in the presence of HOS alone suggests simultaneous but weak activation of both pathways. The fact that Perv stimulates vesicle rocketing implicates tyrosine phosphorylation in this phenomenon. Indeed, it has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for actin-based propulsion of Vaccinia, although not for Listeria or Shigella (22Frischknecht F. Cudmore S. Moreau V. Reckman I. Rottger S. Way M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 89-92Google Scholar). Despite the potent stimulatory effects of Perv on macropinocytic rocketing in vivo, we did not observe phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity associated with pinosomes or actin tails in fixed cells (results not shown), suggesting that different types of actin-based rocketing have different requirements for tyrosine phosphorylation. Despite the generation of new pinosomes under these conditions, cellular pinocytosis in the presence of HOS/PMA was significantly lower than with PMA alone (Fig. 1C). Thus, macropinocytic rocketing does not reflect stimulation of pinocytosis per se and is most likely due to the exaggeration of a step in pinocytosis not normally visible (10Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhoff B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Google Scholar). Perv alone did not stimulate rocketing but instead induced a dramatic redistribution and polarization of F-actin (Fig. 1D). Other changes in cellular morphology elicited by these agonists are shown in Fig. 1, E-H. These results are consistent with in vitro studies showing that vesicle rocketing is also strongly stimulated by Perv (23Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Google Scholar, 24Moreau V. Way M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 353-356Google Scholar). These studies, describing actin-based rocketing of both unidentified vesicles and synthetic vesicles in Xenopus egg extracts, revealed that rocketing in vitro was strongly stimulated by Perv and GTPγS and had an absolute requirement for the small GTP-binding protein Cdc42. The same studies also showed that the membrane composition of synthetic vesicles modulated their recruitment of actin and organization of actin tails. Specifically, it was found that incorporation of PtdIns-4,5P2 or PtdIns-3,4,5P3 into synthetic vesicle membranes relieved the requirement for GTPγS to promote rocketing (23Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Google Scholar). This is consistent with other studies reporting that co-stimulation of HEK-293 cells with Perv and HOS leads to a marked accumulation of PtdIns-3,4,5P3 through the activation of PtdIns3-kinase(s) (25Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Google Scholar) and that PtdIns3-kinase has a role in cup closure during phagocytosis and macropinocytosis (26Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Google Scholar). Despite the observation that vesicle rocketing in vitro was insensitive to wortmannin, the demonstration in those studies of a requirement for phosphoinositides is consistent with a role for PtdIns3-kinase. This prompted us to ask whether or not rocketing in vivo required PtdIns3-kinase(s). Incubation of RBL cells with wortmannin or LY294002 during stimulation with HOS/Perv resulted in inhibition of actin tail formation (Fig. 2, A and B), confirming the requirement for PtdIns3-kinase(s) and supporting the idea that phosphoinositides are involved in macropinocytic rocketing. To gain further insight into the signaling pathway that regulates macropinocytic rocketing, we tested a variety of other compounds for their ability to block the appearance of F-actin rockets (Table I). Because HOS is known to activate p38 MAP kinase in various cells (27Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Google Scholar, 28Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar, 29Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Google Scholar) and components of this pathway are involved in actin remodeling, we evaluated inhibitors of this pathway. Inhibitors were considered not to have had a specific effect on rocketing unless they met two criteria. First, cells showed complete abolition of macropinosome rocketing, and second, there was no obvious cell death or gross effects on cell morphology that might have indirectly affected macropinocytosis. In addition to LY294002 and wortmannin, SB202190 (Fig. 2C), latrunculin B, and BAPTA-AM all abolished macropinocytic rocketing. Inhibition of rocketing by SB202190 indicates the involvement of p38 MAP kinase, perhaps acting through the downstream effector Hsp27 (30Guay J. Lambert H. Gingras-Breton G. Lavoie J.N. Huot J. Landry J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Google Scholar), and is consistent with the appearance of phospho-p38 in RBL cells induced to rocket (Fig. 2C). Cortical actin and membrane ruffling in resting RBL cells treated with wortmannin appeared little different from controls (Fig. 2D), indicating that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not block recruitment of F-actin to the plasma membrane. However, RBL cells stimulated to produce rockets in the presence of wortmannin failed to do so, although the cells contained vesicles encircled by F-actin (Fig. 2E). These appear to be macropinosomes that budded from the plasma membrane but which then failed to rocket. Treatment of RBL cells with BAPTA-AM also abolished macropinocytic rocketing (Fig. 2, F and G), revealing the Ca2+ dependence of this activity. Indeed, there are similarities in cells treated with wortmannin and BAPTA-AM. Rather than the characteristic F-actin rockets, cells contained numerous F-actin-decorated vesicles, which tended to be clustered close to the plasma membrane. These experiments establish the following. First, macropinocytic rocketing is dependent on actin polymerization. Second, macropinocytic rocketing requires the production of phosphoinositides. Third, conditions that lead to rocketing also activate and require p38 MAP kinase, and fourth, rocketing is Ca2+-dependent.Table IThe pharmacology of macropinocytic rocketingTarget (IC50)Concentration usedRocketingInhibitorChelerythrin chloridePKCaPKC, protein kinase C.

Open table in a new tab Since vesicle rocketing in vitro can be stimulated by both PtdIns-3,4,5P3 and PtdIns-4,5P2 (23Ma L. Cantley L.C. Janmey P.A. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1125-1136Google Scholar), and given that there may be interconversion between these lipids by kinases and phosphatases, we hypothesized that annexin 2 may bind to these or other phosphoinositides on endocytic vesicles. To obtain a broad view of phosphoinositide binding by annexin 2, we performed overlay blots using lipids immobilized on strips of nitrocellulose (Fig. 3A). Under these conditions, annexin 2 bound to most of the phosphoinositides tested, but binding was only observed in the presence of 50 μm Ca2+. In contrast, annexin 5 failed to bind to any of the immobilized lipids. Unexpectedly, neither annexin 2 nor annexin 5 bound to phosphatidylserine under these conditions. This may be due to the low Ca2+ concentration used in these experiments or to poor accessibility of the phospholipid headgroups in the planar array of the immobilized lipids. To examine phosphoinositide binding by annexin 2 in a more authentic model membrane, we performed liposome sedimentation studies in which annexin 2 was added to phospholipid vesicles composed of DOPC containing a 2.5% molar fraction of PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, PtdIns-3,4P2, or PtdIns-4,5P2, in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3, B and C). The results show that annexin 2 bound only to liposomes containing PtdIns-4,5P2, and binding occurred in both the presence and the absence of 50 μm Ca2+. In contrast, annexin 5 failed to bind to any of the lipid mixes (Fig. 3, D and E). Next we prepared DOPC liposomes containing a range of concentrations of PtdIns-4,5P2 to assess the affinity of annexin 2 for this phospholipid (Fig. 3F). The results show that at low micromolar concentrations of PtdIns-4,5P2, annexin 2 has an absolute requirement for Ca2+ for binding, but that at concentrations of PtdIns-4,5P2 greater than 10 μm, annexin 2 binds independently of Ca2+. Quantitative densitometric scanning of Coomassie-stained gels revealed that in the presence of 50 μm Ca2+, binding of annexin 2 to PtdIns-4,5P2-containing liposomes is half-maximal at ∼5 μm PtdIns-4,5P2. To put these findings in a broader context, half-maximal binding to PtdIns-4,5P2 has been reported in the range 1-300 μm for various pleckstrin homology domains (17Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Google Scholar, 31Sciorra V.A. Rudge S.A. Wang J. McLaughlin S. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1039-1049Google Scholar), whereas other PtdIns-4,5P2-binding motifs, such as the ANTH (AP180 N-terminal homology) domain (13Lemmon M.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 201-213Google Scholar), bind with a similar affinity to annexin 2 but lack the high specificity of annexin 2 for PtdIns-4,5P2. Thus, the affinity of annexin 2 for PtdIns-4,5P2 is comparable with those reported for diverse PtdIns-4,5P2-binding domains, but the selectivity of annexin 2 for PtdIns-4,5P2 versus other phosphoinositides is high as compared with many PtdIns-4,5P2-binding proteins. Significantly, the affinity of annexin 2 for PtdIns-4,5P2 was increased in liposomes containing approximately physiological concentrations of phosphatidylserine (Fig. 3G), suggesting that in biological membranes, there may be cooperativity of binding. In this experiment we also compared annexin 2 with annexin 1, its closest relative in molecular phylogenetic terms and therefore the most likely among other annexins to exhibit binding to PtdIns-4,5P2. The results show that annexin 1 indeed displays similar characteristics to annexin 2, binding with high affinity to liposomes containing a mixture of PtdIns-4,5P2 and phosphatidylserine and with lower affinity to either lipid alone. Taken together, the results in Fig. 1 demonstrate that annexin 2 specifically binds PtdIns-4,5P2 and not to other polyphosphoinositides and show that the ability to bind this lipid is not a generic annexin property but is restricted to a subgroup within that family that also includes annexin 1. There is increasing evidence that phosphoinositide lipids function at least in the initial recruitment and assembly of actin at sites of vesicle formation (15Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Nalla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar, 32Sechi A.S. Wehland J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3685-3695Google Scholar) and that actin-dependent transport is responsible for the subsequent inward movement of endocytic, pinocytic, and phagocytic vesicles (11Schafer D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 76-81Google Scholar, 16D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Google Scholar, 33Castellano F. Chavrier P. Caron E. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 347-355Google Scholar, 34May R.C. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1061-1077Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether or not PtdIns-4,5P2 is enriched in motile macropinosomes or at sites of pinosome formation in the RBL experimental model. In RBL cells induced to generate rocketing macropinosomes, then fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence, we observed modest co-localization of F-actin and PtdIns-4,5P2 (Fig. 4A). More striking association of PtdIns-4,5P2 with pinosomes was observed in fixed cells preloaded with TMR-PtdIns-4,5P2. In performing z-sections of fixed RBL cells, we consistently observed concentration of PtdIns-4,5P2 immunoreactivity or TMR-PtdIns-4,5P2 at the apical cell surface (Fig. 4B). This is significant because the apical cell surface is the site at which pinosome formation is most concentrated. Thus, a z-section image of a live RBL cell expressing actin-GFP shows the pinosome at the basal cell surface, with the trailing actin tail extending upwards to the apical surface (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these findings, we also observed co-localization of annexin 2-GFP- and Cy3-labeled anti-PtdIns-4,5P2 antibody at the apical surface of activated RBL cells (Fig. 4C). These results, obtained by a number of different approaches to visualize PtdIns-4,5P2, demonstrate that the sites of pinosome formation in activated RBL cells are enriched in PtdIns-4,5P2, annexin 2, and actin. To test the possible association between annexin 2 and PtdIns-4,5P2 in a different model, we microinjected Ptk cells with GFP fusions of annexins 2 and 5, together with the constitutively active and inactive mutants of Arf6. Arf6 is a GTPase that regulates endosomal trafficking (15Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Nalla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar, 16D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Google Scholar) and activates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5 kinase, resulting in elevated levels of PtdIns-4,5P2 at the plasma membrane and on intracellular vesicles (35Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Google Scholar). Insight into the phosphoinositide lipid signaling pathway has come from studies using the Q67L constitutively active and T27N inactive mutants of Arf6 (15Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Nalla T.

In Ptk cells, annexin 2-GFP appeared localized throughout the cytoplasm but excluded from the nucleus, whereas annexin 5-GFP and GFP were present in both the cytosol and the nucleus (Fig. 5A). Co-injection of expression plasmids encoding the active Q67L mutant of Arf6 together with either GFP or annexin 5-GFP had no effect on the localization of either fusion protein (Fig. 5B). However, co-injection of Q67LArf6 with annexin 2-GFP led to a marked redistribution of annexin 2-GFP to the plasma membrane and to intracellular structures that, given the known activities of Arf6 and annexin 2, are most likely to be components of the endocytic pathway (Fig. 5C). In contrast, when co-injected with T27NArf6, annexin 2-GFP remained mostly cytosolic, but with a focal enrichment in the perinuclear region. Accumulation of perinuclear Arf6-positive vesicles has been reported previously in cells expressing the T27N mutant (16D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Google Scholar), and annexin 2 becomes concentrated in a perinuclear compartment in PC12 cells in which endocytic vesicle traffic is blocked. 2C. J. Merrifield and S. E. Moss, unpublished observations. Thus, accumulation of annexin 2 in perinuclear vesicles may be a feature of cells in which normal endocytic processing is perturbed. Taken together, these results are consistent with those presented for annexins 2 and 5 in Fig. 3. Thus, annexin 5 does not bind to liposomes containing PtdIns-4,5P2 in vitro, nor does it respond to the activating Q67L mutant of Arf6 in vivo, whereas annexin 2 binds to PtdIns-4,5P2 in vitro and exhibits a response to Q67LArf6 that would be expected for a PtdIns-4,5P2-binding protein in vivo. In conclusion, we have shown that actin-based macropinosome motility is regulated by the stress-response pathway and that rocketing macropinosomes contain PtdIns-4,5P2. We have identified a new phospholipid binding specificity for annexin 2, which unlike binding to phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, does not appear to be a generic annexin property. The affinity of annexin 2 for PtdIns-4,5P2 is comparable with that of many other PtdIns-4,5P2-binding proteins, and the results of studies in RBL and Ptk cells are consistent with a direct interaction between annexin 2 and PtdIns-4,5P2 in vivo. These findings provide further evidence that annexin 2 is involved in the dynamic remodeling of the membrane and actin cytoskeleton that depends on PtdIns-4,5P2 and occurs during the formation of endocytic vesicles. We are grateful to Volker Gerke for the regular supplies of HH7 antibody and to Mark Shipman, William Hinkes, and Keith Morris for help with the confocal microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2087551258,"Elevated levels of circulating chromogranin A (CgA), a protein stored in the secretory granules of many neuroendocrine cells and neurons, have been detected in the blood of patients with neuroendocrine tumors or heart failure. The pathophysiological role of increased secretion of CgA is unknown. Using mice bearing subcutaneous tumors genetically engineered to secrete CgA in circulation, we have found that increased blood levels of this protein prevent vascular leakage induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in the liver venous system. Structure-activity studies, carried out with CgA fragments administered to normal mice, showed that an active site is located within residues 7-57 of CgA. Accordingly, an anti-CgA antibody directed to residues 53-57 inhibited the effect of circulating CgA, either endogenously produced or exogenously administered, on liver vessels. Studies of the mechanism of action showed that CgA inhibits TNF-induced VE-cadherin down-regulation and barrier alteration of cultured endothelial cells, in an indirect manner. Other effectors, such as thrombin and vascular endothelial growth factor were partially inhibited by CgA N-terminal fragments in in vitro permeability assays. These findings suggest that circulating CgA could help regulate the endothelial barrier function and to protect vessels against TNF-induced plasma leakage in pathological conditions characterized by increased production of TNF and CgA, such as cancer or heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2000930446,"Lipid analogs with dialkylindocarbocyanine (DiI) head groups and short or unsaturated hydrocarbon chains (e.g. DiIC12 and FAST DiI) enter the endocytic recycling compartment efficiently, whereas lipid analogs with long, saturated tails (e.g. DiIC16 and DiIC18) are sorted out of this pathway and targeted to the late endosomes/lysosomes (Mukherjee, S., Soe, T. T., and Maxfield, F. R. (1999) J. Cell Biol. 144, 1271-1284). This differential trafficking of lipid analogs with the same polar head group was interpreted to result from differential partitioning to different types of domains with varying membrane order and/or curvature. Here we investigate the system further by monitoring the trafficking behavior of these lipid analogs under conditions that alter domain properties. There was a marked effect of cholesterol depletion on the cell-surface distribution and degree of internalization of the lipid probes. Furthermore, instead of going to the late endosomes/lysosomes as in control cells, long chain DiI analogs, such as DiIC16, were sorted to the recycling pathway in cholesterol-depleted cells. We confirmed that this difference was due to a change in overall membrane properties, and not cholesterol levels per se, by utilizing a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that overexpressed transfected stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, a rate-limiting enzyme in the production of monounsaturated fatty acids. These cells have a decrease in membrane order because they contain a much larger fraction of unsaturated fatty acids. These cells showed alteration of DiI trafficking very similar to cholesterol-depleted cells. By using cold Triton X-100 extractability of different lipids as a criterion to determine the membrane properties of intracellular organelles, we found that the endocytic recycling compartment has abundant detergent-resistant membranes, in contrast to the late endosomes and lysosomes. Lipid analogs with dialkylindocarbocyanine (DiI) head groups and short or unsaturated hydrocarbon chains (e.g. DiIC12 and FAST DiI) enter the endocytic recycling compartment efficiently, whereas lipid analogs with long, saturated tails (e.g. DiIC16 and DiIC18) are sorted out of this pathway and targeted to the late endosomes/lysosomes (Mukherjee, S., Soe, T.

By using cold Triton X-100 extractability of different lipids as a criterion to determine the membrane properties of intracellular organelles, we found that the endocytic recycling compartment has abundant detergent-resistant membranes, in contrast to the late endosomes and lysosomes. Lipids and proteins associated with the cell surface vary in their lateral and transbilayer distribution, as well as the rate at which they are internalized from the plasma membrane. Once inside the cell, they can potentially be delivered to a large variety of organelles by selective partitioning in a series of sorting steps associated with vesicle or tubule formation (1Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Google Scholar). Although many specific peptide motifs and protein-protein interactions that determine the distribution and trafficking of transmembrane proteins have been characterized (1Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Google Scholar, 2Dell'Angelica E.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 315-318Google Scholar), the principles underlying lipid sorting and trafficking remain relatively unclear. Although the intracellular destinations and sorting decisions for a variety of lipids and lipid analogs have been investigated in recent years (1Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Google Scholar, 3Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 605-613Google Scholar), a coherent general set of sorting rules for lipids has yet to emerge. Part of the difficulty in understanding lipid sorting and distribution in the cell arises from the fact that this is the result of a complex interplay between the specific chemistries of individual lipid molecules (e.g. their size, hydrophobicity, head group to acyl chain cross-sectional ratio, charge on the head group, acyl chain unsaturation, etc.) as well as the biophysical properties of the membrane bilayer as a whole (e.g. its composition, thickness, tension, fluidity, and curvature) (reviewed in Refs. 4Maier O. Ait Slimane T. Hoekstra D. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 149-161Google Scholar and 5Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 203-211Google Scholar). Adding to the complexity is the fact that a typical biological membrane is composed of hundreds of different lipid classes, with varying permutations of head groups and acyl chains, in addition to varying amounts of rigid, relatively planar structures like cholesterol. In addition, membranes contain a variety of proteins, both transmembrane and peripheral, that vary in shapes, sizes, charge distribution, and propensity for aggregation among themselves or with other proteins and/or lipids. As a final measure of the complexity, many of these components are distributed non-randomly in the bilayer, varying both in the lateral and the transbilayer dimensions. Biophysical studies in model membrane systems of precise composition have clarified to a great extent the ways in which classes of lipid molecules interact among themselves and with other classes of lipids or cholesterol (6Gennis R.B. Biomembranes: Molecular Structure and Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Google Scholar). However, these studies were carried out in relatively simple, well defined, two- or three-component systems. Thus, although there is no doubt that similar principles are at play in various biological membranes, these membranes are too complex to allow a simple extrapolation of the insights obtained from model systems. In contrast to the plasma membrane, very little is known about the biophysical properties of most intracellular membranes. Although lateral membrane domains or “rafts” have been shown in several studies to exist on the plasma membranes of mammalian cells, whether such domains exist in endocytic organelles as well and, if they do, how their properties compare with the domains on the cell surface remain open questions. Glycolipid and cholesterol-enriched rafts have been proposed to play a role in biosynthetic protein and lipid sorting (7Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Google Scholar). Also, experiments have utilized the ability of BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-S-indacene)-labeled lipid analogs to form excimers in a concentration-dependent manner to suggest a redistribution of lipids within seconds after the initiation of endocytosis (8Chen C.S. Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. Biophys, J. 1997; 72: 37-50Google Scholar). Lipid rafts have been shown to exist as early in the biosynthetic pathway as the endoplasmic reticulum (7Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Google Scholar, 9Watanabe R. Funato K. Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49538-49544Google Scholar). In the current study, we have utilized several of the fluorescent lipid analogs of the dialkylindocarbocyanine (DiI) 1The abbreviations used are: DiI, dialkylindocarbocyanine; DAF, decay-accelerating factor; DHE, dehydroergosterol; ERC, endocytic recycling compartment; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LE/LY, late endosomes/lysosomes; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase1; Tf, transferrin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TfR, Tf receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: DiI, dialkylindocarbocyanine; DAF, decay-accelerating factor; DHE, dehydroergosterol; ERC, endocytic recycling compartment; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; LDL, low density lipoprotein; LE/LY, late endosomes/lysosomes; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase1; Tf, transferrin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TfR, Tf receptor. series, whose trafficking behavior in normal fibroblasts was investigated previously (1Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Google Scholar). In the previous study, we found that, in general, lipids that have a propensity to partition into the more disordered lipid domains, or ones with a propensity to enter membranes of concave curvature, trafficked preferentially to the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), whereas those with opposite propensities trafficked predominantly to the late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/LY). In order to explain the results of the above studies, we had proposed a working hypothesis based on differential partitioning of endocytosed membrane-associated molecules into coexisting membrane domains, as defined by varying fluidities and/or curvatures. It is well known that both membrane fluidity (or “membrane order”) as well as curvature are strongly modulated by the amount of cholesterol present in the bilayer (10Yeagle P.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1303-1310Google Scholar, 11Feigenson G.W. Buboltz J.T. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2775-2788Google Scholar, 12Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Google Scholar, 13Julicher F. Lipowsky R. Physical Rev. E. 1996; 53: 2670-2683Google Scholar). Thus, in this paper, we test our working hypothesis by following the trafficking of the DiI analogs in cells whose membrane properties have been altered by depleting the amount of cholesterol in the bilayer. In order to ensure that the effect of cholesterol depletion was an overall alteration of membrane structure and dynamics, rather than a specific cholesterol interaction effect, we utilized an alternate method to alter membrane fluidity, without changing its cholesterol content. This was achieved by utilizing a cell line (CHO-SCD1 cells) overexpressing an enzyme, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), that alters the amount of monounsaturated fatty acid chains in the membrane lipids (35Ntambi J.M. Miyazaki M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 255-261Google Scholar). In addition to following the trafficking itineraries of the lipid analogs in this study, we also investigate the membrane properties of intracellular endocytic organelles, namely the ERC and the LE/LY, by monitoring their insolubility in cold Triton X-100. Resistance to cold Triton extraction is a criterion often used in cell biology research as phenomenological evidence for molecules residing in membrane domains, termed rafts, that are believed to exist in the so-called liquid ordered or Lo phase (14Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar, 15London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Google Scholar). Our interest in this study is to look for any general sorting rules for lipids that may emerge from these comparative studies and also to investigate the types of lateral lipid distributions (domains) that may occur in various endocytic organelles. In these studies, we are able to follow the fate of cholesterol directly, by using the fluorescent cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol (DHE) (16Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Google Scholar, 17Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Google Scholar). All fluorescent probes and anti-Alexa 488 were obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Human Tf was obtained from Sigma. It was iron-loaded and passed through a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration system as described previously (18Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Google Scholar). Alexa 488 was then conjugated to the iron-loaded Tf following manufacturers' instructions. Labeled transferrin was dialyzed thoroughly to remove the unbound dye. Monoclonal antibody against DAF was provided by Dr. S. Tomlinson (Medical University of South Carolina) (19Song H. He C. Knaak C. Guthridge J.M. Holers V.M. Tomlinson S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1875-1885Google Scholar). DHE-loaded MβCD was prepared as described previously (17Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Google Scholar). DiI-LDL was a gift from Dr. Ira Tabas (Columbia University, New York). Lipid analogs and free fatty acids were transferred as monomers from fatty acid-free BSA carriers (1Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Google Scholar). All tissue culture supplies were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were from Sigma. TRVb-1 is a modified CHO cell line that lacks endogenous Tf receptor and expresses the human Tf receptor (20McGraw T.E. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Google Scholar). DAFTb-1 cells are a derivative of TRVb-1 cells. In addition to the human Tf receptors, they also express the GPI-linked DAF (21Mayor S. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 929-944Google Scholar). They were grown in bicarbonate buffered Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml geneticin as a selection for the transfected Tf receptors. The CHO-SCD cell line was established by transfecting CHO cells with pcDNA3.1/Hygro-mSCD1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instruction. Hygromycin-resistant clones were pooled for experiments. CHO and CHO-SCD cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 200 units/ml hygromycin was used as a selection for the transfected SCD1. All cells were kept in a 5% CO2 environment in humidified incubators at 37 °C. Cells for microscopy were grown for 2 days on 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes whose bottoms were replaced with poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (22Salzman N.H. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2097-2104Google Scholar). All experimental manipulations as well as microscopy were carried out in these dishes. Metabolic Depletion—TRVb-1 cells were grown for 2 days in metabolic depletion medium (Ham's F-12 medium similar to the growth medium but with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum in place of fetal bovine serum, supplemented with 200 μm mevalonate, and 10 μm mevastatin (23Mayor S. Sabharanjak S. Maxfield F.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4626-4638Google Scholar) to block cholesterol synthesis and deplete cholesterol stores (24Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Google Scholar). Depletion by MβCD—Cells were incubated with 10 mm MβCD in Medium 1 (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 g/liter glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for 1 h prior to labeling. Control TRVb-1 cells were labeled with 10 nm DiI labeling solution for 2 min at 37 °C, rinsed several times with Medium 1, and then incubated with 5 μg/ml Alexa 488-Tf for 30 min at 37 °C. For cholesterol depletion experiments, cells were prelabeled with 5 μg/ml Alexa 488-Tf for 1 h at 37 °C, extracted with 10 mm MβCD for 1 h at 37 °C, labeled with 50 nm DiI for 2 min, and chased for 30 min at 37 °C. Alexa 488-Tf was present in all the steps except for the 2 min labeling with DiI. Cells that were cholesterol-depleted metabolically were singly labeled with DiI. At the end of the chase period, the cells were rinsed with Medium 1 and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. The effects of free saturated long chain fatty acids (heptadecanoic (C17:0) and nonadecanoic acid (C19:0) on DiIC16 trafficking were monitored in both TRVb-1 and CHO-SCD cells, under conditions of growth in normal media as well as after acute cholesterol depletion using MβCD. For these experiments, free fatty acids were first loaded onto 1% w/v fatty acid-free BSA, at a final stock concentration of 0.3 mm fatty acid, by using established protocols (25Johnson R.A. Hamilton J.A. Worgall T.S. Deckelbaum R.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1637-1645Google Scholar). The cells were then cholesterol-depleted (or not for control) with MβCD for 30 min, rinsed, labeled for 1 min with DiIC16, rinsed, and incubated with or without the fatty acid for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by imaging of the live cells. Fluorescence microscopy and digital image acquisition were carried out using a Leica DMIRB microscope (Leica Mikroscopie und Systeme GmbH, Germany) equipped with a Princeton Instruments (Princeton, NJ) cooled CCD camera driven by Image 1/MetaMorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging Corp.). All images were acquired using a high magnification oil immersion objective (63×, 1.4 NA). Alexa 488-conjugated proteins were imaged using a standard fluorescein filter cube [470-nm (20-nm bandpass) excitation filter, 510-nm longpass dichromatic filter, and 537-nm (23-nm bandpass) emission filter], DiI probes using a standard rhodamine filter cube [535-nm (50-nm bandpass) excitation filter, 565-nm longpass dichromatic filter, and 610-nm (75-nm bandpass) emission filter], and DHE using a filter cube obtained from Chroma Technology Corp. (Brattleboro, VT) [335-nm (20-nm bandpass) excitation filter, 365-nm longpass dichromatic filter, and 405-nm (40-nm bandpass) emission filter] (17Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Google Scholar). Fluorescence crossover was measured using single-labeled samples of each probe. Images were corrected for background (26Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Google Scholar) and crossover (1Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed using an Axiovert 100M inverted microscope equipped with an LSM 510 laser scanning unit and a 63× 1.4 NA plan Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Cells labeled with DiI were excited with a 1.0-milliwatt helium/neon laser emitting at 543 nm, and a 560-nm long pass filter was used for collecting emissions. Alexa 488-conjugated proteins were excited with a 25-milliwatt argon laser emitting at 488 nm and a 505-530 bandpass filter was used for emissions. The two channels were scanned alternately in a line-by-line fashion, having only one laser line and one detector channel on at each time. Summation projection of all background corrected confocal slices was produced using the MetaMorph software. Correlation Measurements—Six images were selected in which each of the cells was double-labeled with Alexa 488-Tf and FAST DiI, DiIC12, DiIC16, or DiIC18 in normal media, and DiIC16 or DiIC18 in cholesterol depletion media. They were first background corrected by subtracting the average fluorescence in regions within the image that contained no cells from the overall fluorescence (26Hao M. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15279-15286Google Scholar). A threshold was then applied to each image such that only cell-associated pixels were used in calculating the correlation coefficient. A correlation plot and a correlation coefficient for all selected pixels above the threshold for each image were generated by MetaMorph. Cholesterol Depletion Interferes with the Normal Trafficking of the DiI Analogs—Endocytic fates of the DiI derivatives were determined after their initial incorporation in the plasma membrane. Fluorescent Tf, bound to its receptor (TfR), was used as a marker for the ERC (27Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Google Scholar, 28Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Google Scholar). Exit from the ERC is the slowest step in the endocytic recycling itinerary of the TfR, resulting in the ERC being the most brightly labeled structure at steady state (18Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Google Scholar). It has been shown previously (29Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6775-6780Google Scholar) that cholesterol depletion severely inhibits the internalization of TfR from the cell surface. Thus, under these conditions, most of the Tf remains at the cell surface, and the bright cell surface fluorescence impedes the detection of the central ERC fluorescence. In order to obtain a clear definition of the ERC in cholesterol-depleted cells, we labeled the cells first with Alexa 488-Tf, allowing enough time to load the ERC, followed by cholesterol extraction and labeling with the DiI analog. Fig. 1 shows control (normal growth medium) and cholesterol-depleted cells that were labeled for 2 min with DiIC16 (Fig. 1, panels A-D) and chased for 30 min. Our previous work showed that DiIC16, which has some preference for ordered membrane domains due to its long and saturated tails, was sorted away from the endocytic recycling pathway and delivered to the LE/LY after 30 min of internalization (1Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, panels A and B). Several changes in lipid traffic were seen upon cholesterol depletion. First, a very large fraction of DiIC16 in cholesterol-depleted cells was found in the plasma membrane (the ring stain in Fig. 1, panel D). Second, most of the internalized DiIC16 localized to the ERC, indicated by extensive colocalization with internalized Tf (Fig. 1, panels C and D). This was clearly different from the route taken by DiIC16 in control cells that resulted in its accumulation in the LE/LY (Fig. 1, panels A and B). Even after 30 min of chase, very few punctate structures representing the LE/LY were seen labeled with DiIC16 in cholesterol-depleted cells. To be sure that the change in intracellular trafficking upon cholesterol depletion was related to the order preferences of the hydrocarbon tails, we confirmed these results with DiIC18, which has a higher affinity for the ordered domains than DiIC16 (30Spink C.H. Yeager M.D. Feigenson G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 25-33Google Scholar). Cells labeled with DiIC16 and DiIC18 behaved identically, both under normal growth conditions and upon cholesterol depletion (data not shown). In order to avoid possible artifacts, cholesterol depletion was carried out in two different ways. The approach used for the cells shown in Fig. 1 was to treat cells grown in normal medium with MβCD, an efficient cholesterol chelator known to form soluble inclusion complexes with cholesterol (31Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Google Scholar). In CHO cells, incubation with 10 mm MβCD for 30 min or longer reduced total cellular cholesterol by 40-50% (29Subtil A. Gaidarov I. Kobylarz K. Lampson M.A. Keen J.H. McGraw T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The other method to reduce cholesterol was metabolic depletion, in which the cells were grown for 2 days in medium containing lipid-depleted serum, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis (mevastatin), and supplemented with low levels of mevalonate in order to maintain basic metabolism of other essential isoprenoids (23Mayor S. Sabharanjak S. Maxfield F.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4626-4638Google Scholar, 24Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Google Scholar). Both methods produced similar degrees of cholesterol depletion and resulted in similar trafficking alterations (not shown). Cholesterol depletion of the cells shown in all figures here was performed using MβCD. In CHO cells, the ERC is a collection of narrow tubular elements that appears as an unresolved central spot by epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). We used confocal scanning microscopy to examine in more detail the extent of colocalization between DiIC16 and Tf in cholesterol-depleted cells. Shown in Fig. 2 are single plane images (panels A-C) and summation projections of all focal planes (panels D-F). In cholesterol-depleted cells, DiIC16 was seen to colocalize extensively with Tf in ERC tubules in the juxtanuclear region of the cell. To make sure that the morphology of LE/LY was not disrupted by cholesterol depletion, we double-labeled the cholesterol-depleted cells to steady state with DiI-LDL and Tf. The LE/LY, appearing as small punctate dots labeled by LDL (Fig. 2, panel G), distributed throughout the cell and separated from Tf (Fig. 2, panel H) in a fashion identical to that in control cells. Unlike the control cells, however, these LDL-containing endosomes did not contain significant amounts of DiIC16. Fig. 3 shows control and cholesterol-depleted cells that were labeled for 2 min with either FAST DiI (Fig. 3, panels A-D) or DiIC12 (Fig. 3, panels E-H) and chased for 30 min. As reported previously, both FAST DiI and DiIC12 are delivered to the ERC in control cells, and they show significant codistribution with Tf (Fig. 3, panels A and B, E and F) (1Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Google Scholar). However, when cholesterol was depleted, labeling of the ERC by FAST DiI and DiIC12 was reduced, and most of the label was retained at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, panels C and D, G and H). Many patches of fluorescence were seen, especially in the FAST DiI (Fig. 3, panel D), and these patches on the plasma membrane were relatively stable over time (at least up to 20 min). We have reported previously (32Hao M. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13072-13077Google Scholar) patching of DiIC12 and C6-NBD-SM into the more disordered regions of the plasma membrane upon cholesterol depletion. To verify that the patches of FAST DiI were indeed on the plasma membrane, we utilized a confocal microscope to optically section through a cholesterol-depleted cell labeled with FAST DiI (Fig. 4, panels A-D). At each section, the fluorescent patches were seen at or near the cell border, consistent with patching on the cell surface. Very little FAST DiI was seen inside the cells.Fig. 4FAST DiI distribution in cholesterol-depleted and -repleted cells. Cells were incubated with 10 mm MβCD for 1 h, labeled with FAST DiI for 2 min, and chased for 30 min. Optical sections were then taken through the cells by scanning confocal microscopy. Panel A shows a summation projection of all the focal planes. Planes B-D show three representative planes through the cell (panel B, bottom focal plane; panel D, top). Panels E and F shows the reversibility of cholesterol depletion (Chol-depl) on the trafficking of FAST DiI. Cells were incubated with 10 mm MβCD for 1 h, labeled with FAST DiI for 2 min, and chased for 30 min in Medium 1 (panel E) or Medium 1 supplemented with cholesterol-loaded MβCD (panel F). They were then imaged using a wide-field microscope. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of cholesterol depletion on the DiI trafficking is reversible (Fig. 4, panels E and F). Cells were first incubated with MβCD for 1 h. They were then labeled with FAST DiI for 2 min, chased for 30 min in either Medium 1 (Fig. 4, panel E) or Medium 1 supplemented with cholesterol-loaded MβCD (Fig. 4, panel F). Repletion of cholesterol with an exogenous source resulted in a uniform plasma membrane distribution and intracellular accumulation for FAST DiI, demonstrating that the change in FAST DiI distribution upon cholesterol depletion treatment was truly an effect of reduction in cholesterol levels. Quantification of the Overlap of the Distribution of Different DiI Analogs Relative to Tf—Although Fig. 1 shows the redirection of DiIC16 trafficking from the LE/LY to the ERC visually, we quantified this redirection to give statistical validity to our results. Fig. 5, panel A, shows the correlation plots of the distribution of different DiI derivatives relative to Tf, for control and cholesterol-depleted cells. Fig. 5, panel B, shows a plot of the correlation coefficients obtained from an average of several such correlation measurements, for each experimental condition. Correlation data in cholesterol-depleted cells (relative to Tf) for the disordered domain preferring DiI analogs (DiIC12 and FAST DiI) were not calculated because these analogs were primarily retained on the plasma membrane upon cholesterol depletion. The correlation coefficients for the DiIC16 and DiIC18 compared with Tf increase significantly upon cholesterol depletion.

https://openalex.org/W2025642590,"Although previous studies have already shown that both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial activities of glycyl-tRNA synthetase are provided by a single gene, GRS1,in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. Evidence presented here indicates that this bifunctional property is actually a result of two distinct translational products alternatively generated from a single transcript of this gene. Except for an amino-terminal 23-amino acid extension, these two isoforms have the same polypeptide sequence and function exclusively in their respective compartments under normal conditions. Reporter gene assays further suggest that this leader peptide can function independently as a mitochondrial targeting signal and plays the major role in the subcellular localization of the isoforms. Additionally, whereas the short protein is translationally initiated from a traditional AUG triplet, the longer isoform is generated from an upstream inframe UUG codon. To our knowledge, GRS1 appears to be the first example in the yeast wherein a functional protein isoform is initiated from a naturally occurring non-AUG codon. The results suggest that non-AUG initiation might be a mechanism existing throughout all kingdoms.

To our knowledge, GRS1 appears to be the first example in the yeast wherein a functional protein isoform is initiated from a naturally occurring non-AUG codon. The results suggest that non-AUG initiation might be a mechanism existing throughout all kingdoms. In lower eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, AUG is the only codon recognized as the translational initiator, and the AUG codon closest to the 5′-end of mRNA preferentially serves as the start site for translation (1Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Schweingruber A.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 215-222Google Scholar, 2Donahue T.F. Cigan A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2955-2963Google Scholar). If the first AUG triplet is mutated, initiation can begin at the next available AUG on the message. The same rules apply to virtually all eukaryotes. However, there are many examples of cellular and viral mRNAs that can use “non-AUG” codons differing from AUG by a single nucleotide as the translation start site (3Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Google Scholar). The relatively weak base pairing between a non-AUG codon and the anticodon of initiator tRNA appears to be compensated for by interactions with nearby nucleotides, in particular a purine in position -3 and a G in position +4 (4Peabody D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11847-11851Google Scholar, 5Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar). Stated differently, mutations in the sequence surrounding the first AUG can lead to its inefficient utilization as initiator and subsequent use of the next available AUG in a better context. Additionally, a stable hairpin structure with a predicted stability of around -19 kcal/mol located 12–15 nucleotides downstream from the initiator can also facilitate recognition of a weak start site (e.g. a non-AUG codon or an AUG in a suboptimal context) by the 40 S ribosomal subunit (6Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Google Scholar). In contrast, there seems to be little sequence context effect in yeast (7Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2964-2975Google Scholar), and the positive benefits of downstream secondary structures have not yet been clearly addressed. Perhaps for these reasons, yeast cannot efficiently use non-AUG codons as translation start sites (8Clements J.M. Laz T.M. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4533-4536Google Scholar). So far, examples of native non-AUG initiation have not been reported in the model yeast S. cerevisiae. In prokaryotes, there are typically 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, one for each amino acid (9Carter Jr., C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Google Scholar, 10Martinis S.A. Schimmel P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 887-901Google Scholar, 11Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Google Scholar, 12Pelchat M. Lapointe J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 343-347Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, protein synthesis occurs not only in the cytoplasm, but also in organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts (13Maréchal-Drouard L. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 115-131Google Scholar). Compartmentalization of the protein synthesis machinery within the cytoplasm and organelles of eukaryotes leads to isoaccepting tRNA species that are distinguished by nucleotide sequence, subcellular location, and enzyme specificity. Thus, most eukaryotes, such as yeast, commonly have two genes that encode distinct sets of proteins for each aminoacylation activity; one functions in the cytoplasm and the other in the mitochondria. Each set aminoacylates the isoaccepting tRNAs within its respective cell compartment, and is sequestered from the isoacceptors in other compartments. As exceptions to this rule, two S. cerevisiae genes, HTS1 (coding for histidyl-tRNA synthetase) (14Natsoulis G. Hilger F. Fink G.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 235-243Google Scholar) and VAS1 (coding for valyl-tRNA synthetase) (15Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Google Scholar), specify both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms of their respective enzymes. mRNAs with distinct 5′-ends are alternatively transcribed from each of these genes. The mitochondrial form of the enzyme is translated from the first initiation AUG on the “long” message, whereas the cytosolic form is translated from the second in-frame AUG on the “short” message. These two isoforms cannot substitute for each other because of different localization (15Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made for the Arabdopsis thaliana genes that encode alanyl-tRNA synthetase, threonyl-tRNA synthetase, and valyl-tRNA synthetase (16Souciet G. Menand B. Ovesna J. Cosset A. Dietrich A. Wintz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 848-854Google Scholar). It should be addressed that except for some algae, all aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are encoded by nuclear genes and imported post-translationally into their respective compartments. As with most yeast tRNA synthetases, two homologous nuclear genes encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), 1The abbreviations used are: GlyRS, glycyl-tRNA synthetase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; YPG, yeast extract peptone glycerol; RT, reverse transcriptase. 1The abbreviations used are: GlyRS, glycyl-tRNA synthetase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; YPG, yeast extract peptone glycerol; RT, reverse transcriptase. GRS1 and GRS2, have been identified in S. cerevisiae. Paradoxically, GRS1 provides both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions, whereas GRS2 appears to be nonfunctional (17Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Google Scholar). However, unlike HTS1 and VAS1, only one appropriate AUG triplet was identified in the 5′ region of its open reading frame, leading to the assumption that the translational product initiated from this start site was a bifunctional enzyme (17Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Google Scholar). A similar example in which a single translation product is responsible for both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic functions is the yeast fumarase gene FUM1 (18Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Google Scholar, 19Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Google Scholar). In this instance, all fumarase molecules are targeted and processed in mitochondria before part of the products are sent by retrograde movement back to the cytosol (20Sass E. Blachinsky E. Karniely S. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46111-46117Google Scholar). We wondered if GRS1 followed a similar pathway, or if a different mechanism was involved. In the work described here, we cloned the GRS1 gene and investigated its bifunctional phenotype in relation to the mechanism of its translational control. To our surprise, two protein isoforms of different size are alternatively translated from this gene. Even more remarkable is the fact that one of the two protein isoforms is actually initiated from a UUG triplet, a codon that was believed inappropriate for initiation in yeast. The implications of this novel mechanism of translation initiation, particularly in yeast, are further discussed. Construction of Plasmids—Cloning of GRS1 from S. cerevisiae followed standard protocols. The wild-type GRS1 (designated as wt GRS1) sequence was amplified by PCR as a 2.4-kb EagI-SalI fragment (a 2.0-kb open reading frame plus 0.4 kb of upstream DNA) with appropriate oligonucleotides. The PCR products were digested with EagI and SalI prior to ligation into EagI/SalI-digested pRS315, a low-copy number yeast shuttle vector (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar). Various point mutations, such as M1T (ATG1 to ACT), OF (Out-of-frame mutation of AAA-7 to TAAA), I(-18)L (ATC-18 to CTC), L(-23)L (TTG-23 to TTA), and E(-25)stop (GAA-25 to TAA), were subsequently introduced into the wild-type clone following standard protocols. The numbers “-7,” “-18,” “-23,” and “-25” in these constructs refer to the -7, -18, -23, and -25 codon triplets that precede ATG1, respectively. ADH/GRS1Δ2–12 was constructed as previously described (17Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Google Scholar). For construction of ADH/GRS1, the open reading frame (extending from base pair -3 to the stop codon) of GRS1 was amplified by PCR as an EagI-SalI fragment and cloned in a high-copy number plasmid pADH1 (22Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Google Scholar). Cloning of ADH/GRS1-88Δ2–12 (extending from base pair -88 to the stop codon but lacking codons 2–12) in pADH1 followed a similar protocol. To construct H-GRS1, a short DNA duplex coding for a putative RNA hairpin structure was inserted into position -88 of a wt GRS1 construct. Briefly, a GRS1 coding sequence extending from base pair -88 to the stop codon was amplified by PCR as an EagI-SalI fragment and cloned into pRS315, yielding GRS1-88. Two partially complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-GGCCAGCGTGCGGGCATCTAGCCCGCACGCATATGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGCATATGCGTGCGGGCTAGATGCCCGCACGCT-3′, were annealed at equal molar concentration and then inserted into the EagI site in GRS1-88. Only fusions that carry an EagI site at the 5′ junction of the duplex were selected as templates for the subsequent construction. A DNA sequence containing base pairs -300 to -88 of GRS1 was PCR amplified and inserted into the EagI site located at the 5′-end of the duplex to give H-GRS1. The putative stem-loop structure deduced from the duplex, where 5′-GCGUGCGGGC-3′ pairs with 5′-GCCCGCACGC-3, has a predicted stability of about -24 kcal/mol. For construction of various preVAS1-GRS1 fusions, a GRS1 sequence extending from base pair -12 to the stop codon was amplified by PCR, digested, and then ligated into pRS315. Subsequently, a DNA sequence containing base pairs -300 to +138 relative to ATG1 of VAS1 was amplified by PCR as a SacI-EagI fragment with appropriate oligonucleotides, and then cloned into the SacI-EagI site preceding the GRS1 sequence, yielding preVAS1-GRS1. A similar approach was used to construct preVAS1M1A-GRS1 and preVAS1-GRS1M1T, which contain a mutation (ATG1 to GCG) in the preVAS1 portion and a mutation (ATG1 to ACT) in the GRS1 portion, respectively. Construction of wild-type VAS1 (designated as wt VAS1) and VAS1c has been described previously (22Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Google Scholar). For construction of preGRS1-VAS1c, a DNA sequence containing base pairs -300 to -1 relative to ATG1 of GRS1 was amplified by PCR and used to substitute for the corresponding EagI-NdeI fragment in VAS1c, yielding preGRS1-VAS1c. preGRS1L(-23)L-VAS1c, which contains a silent mutation (TTG-23 to TTA) in the preGRS1 portion, was constructed following a similar protocol. Mapping the 5′ Ends of GRS1 Transcripts—Identification of the 5′-ends of GRS1 transcripts was carried out with 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE, Invitrogen). Briefly, the 5′-terminal sequences of GRS1 mRNAs were transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase into first strand cDNAs using an “antisense” GRS1-specific primer that was annealed to a region 400 bp downstream of ATG1. The first strand cDNA products were purified and then tailed at their 3′-ends with dCTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The tailed cDNAs were then amplified via PCR using Taq DNA polymerase with a deoxyinosine-containing anchor primer (provided by the manufacturer) annealed to the 5′-end of the cDNA, and a nested GRS1-specific primer annealed 360 bp downstream of ATG1. Following PCR-driven amplification, the double-stranded cDNA products were cloned and sequenced. Complementation Assays for the Cytoplasmic Function of GRS1— Complementation assays were performed using a yeast GRS1 knockout strain, RJT3/II-1 (17Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Google Scholar), which carries a maintenance plasmid that provides both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial GlyRS functions. Assays for the cytoplasmic function of plasmid-borne GRS1 and derivatives were carried out by introducing the test plasmid into RJT3/II-1 and determining the ability of transformants to grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). The cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days or until colonies appeared. (Photos for the complementation assays were taken at day 3 following incubation.) The transformants evicted the maintenance plasmid with a URA3 marker in the presence of 5-FOA. Thus, only an enzyme with the cytoplasmic GlyRS activity encoded by the test plasmid (carrying a LEU2 marker) could rescue the growth defect of RJT3/II-1 on 5-FOA. Complementation Assays for the Mitochondrial Function of GRS1—To test the mitochondrial function of plasmid-borne GRS1 derivatives, RJT3/II-1 was cotransformed with a test plasmid (carrying a LEU2 marker) and a second maintenance plasmid (carrying a TRP1 marker) that expresses a functional cytoplasmic GlyRS, but is defective in mitochondrial GlyRS activity. (The second maintenance plasmid used contained GRS1OF cloned in pRS314.) In the presence of 5-FOA, the first maintenance plasmid (containing a URA3 marker) was evicted from the cotransformants, whereas the second maintenance plasmid was retained. Thus, all cotransformants survived 5-FOA selections because of the presence of cytoplasmic GlyRS derived from the second maintenance plasmid. The cotransformants were further tested on YPG plates for their mitochondrial phenotypes at 30 °C, with results documented at day 3 following plating. Because a yeast cell cannot survive on glycerol without functional mitochondria, the cotransformants do not grow on YPG plates unless a functional mitochondrial GlyRS is present. Complementation assays for various VAS1 constructs were conducted essentially the same way as those for GRS1 constructs, except that a VAS1 knockout strain (designated as CW1) (22Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Google Scholar) was used as the test strain. Mapping the 5′ -Ends of GRS1 Transcripts—It was previously shown that a single GRS1 gene encodes both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial glycyl-tRNA synthetase activities in S. cerevisiae (17Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Google Scholar). However, unlike HTS1 and VAS1, no alternative in-frame AUG codon was found in the sequence upstream of the putative open reading frame (as diagramed in Fig. 1A). Interestingly, a long stretch of uninterrupted coding sequence was found between the nearest upstream stop codon, UAA-57, and the putative translation initiation codon, AUG1. (The number “-57” in UAA-57 refers to the -57 codon that precedes AUG1.) To gain insight into the mechanism of GRS1 expression, the in vivo transcription profiles of this gene were examined. The transcription start sites and 5′-terminal nucleotide sequences of GRS1 transcripts were determined using a technique known as 5′-RACE. Following reverse transcription and PCR-driven amplification, the double-stranded cDNA products were cloned and sequenced. Remarkably, only one cDNA product was identified on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1B), with its 5′-end mapped at position -88 relative to the A of AUG1 (Fig. 1A). In addition, sequence of the cDNA (∼400 bp determined) was identical to that of the corresponding segment in genomic DNA. Thus, the possibility of splicing occurring at the 5′-end of GRS1 mRNA could be ruled out. A Second Isoform of GlyRS Generated from GRS1—A previous study suggested that an amino-terminal segment of GlyRS might direct its mitochondrial localization, because deletion of codons 2–12 from this gene selectively impaired its mitochondrial activity (17Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Google Scholar) (ADH/GRS1Δ2–12 in Fig. 2). However, these phenotypes were observed with protein expression under the control of a constitutive ADH promoter in a high-copy number vector, and might not faithfully reflect normal conditions in vivo. To mimic physiological conditions, various GRS1 sequences with the native promoter were cloned into a low-copy number yeast shuttle vector, pRS315, for further studies. (Normal conditions are referred to here as protein expression from a low-copy number vector under the control of its native promoter.) We supposed if AUG1 is the only initiator for GRS1, a missense mutation at this codon would impair the synthesis (and thus function) of both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes, whereas a nonsense or an out-of-frame mutation placed upstream of AUG1 would have little effect on either function. As shown in Fig. 2, wt GRS1 allowed colony formation on both FOA (Fig. 2B) and YPG (Fig. 2C) plates, indicating the production of functional cytoplasmic and mitochondrial GlyRSs. When AUG1 was mutated to ACU, the resultant construct, GRS1M1T, lost the cytoplasmic function (Fig. 2B) but retained the mitochondrial function (Fig. 2C), suggesting that AUG1 serves as the translation initiator for the cytoplasmic form, but not the mitochondrial form. In contrast, when an out-of-frame mutation (AAA-7 to UAAA) was introduced 5′ to AUG1, the resultant construct, GRS1OF, lost the mitochondrial activity (Fig. 2C) but retained the cytoplasmic function (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the mitochondrial precursor is translationally initiated at a site upstream of AAA-7. (Note that this out-of-frame mutation not only caused an out-of-frame reading, but also led to a stop codon at this site.) Thus, the mitochondrial function of GlyRS is provided by a distinct isoform initiated at a site 5′ to AUG1. To further prove our assumption, we inserted the presequence back into construct ADH/GRS1Δ2–12 and tested for its effect. Consistent to the data mentioned above, the resultant construct, ADH/GRS1-88Δ2–12, restored the mitochondrial function of ADH/GRS1Δ2–12. However, when an intact open reading frame of GRS1 without the presequence was expressed from the ADH promoter, the overexpressed GlyRS rescued both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial defects of the grs1- strain (Fig. 2), suggesting that codons 2–12 are important for the mitochondrial phenotype of the “overexpressed” GlyRS molecules (compare ADH/GRS1 and ADH/GRS1Δ2–12 in Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, residues 2–12 appear to constitute a weak, cryptic, transit signal that normally does not play a role in mitochondria import, but can be recruited to do so when overexpressed. Initiation of the Mitochondrial Isoform from a Native Non-AUG Codon of GRS1—Because there is no other in-frame AUG triplet in the sequence 5′ to AUG1 (Fig. 1), the possibility that a non-AUG codon differing from AUG by one nucleotide serves as the translation start site for the mitochondrial form was investigated. There are 9 such triplets between UAA-57 and AUG1, including UUG-54, AUC-48, AUU-45, AUU-31, UUG-23, AUC-18, AUU-10, AAG-4, and AUU-3 (Fig. 1). To determine whether any of these serves as the initiator, a nonsense mutation was introduced into this region to map its approximate location. As shown in Fig. 3, a nonsense mutation at GAA-25 (resulting in GRS1E(-25)stop) did not compromise the mitochondrial function of this gene (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the alternative initiator was located downstream of GAA-25. Together with the results shown in Fig. 2, the alternative initiation site must be between GAA-25 and AAA-7. There are three candidates, UUG-23, AUC-18, and AUU-10, located within this region. Among these three codons, AUU-10 is the least likely candidate, because translation initiated at this site would lead to a protein with a very short leader peptide. For this reason, we focused on AUC-18 and UUG-23. Mutation at AUC-18 (resulting in GRS1I(-18)L) had little effect on the mitochondrial activity (Fig. 3C), whereas mutation at UUG-23 (GRS1L(-23)L) abolished the mitochondrial activity. To provide further evidence that UUG-23 is the initiator, a stop codon, UAA, was inserted between codons -23 and -22, and the resultant construct (GRS1-23(stop)-22) was tested for its mitochondrial activity. Consistent to our hypothesis, insertion of a stop codon immediately downstream of UUG-23 specifically knocked out its mitochondrial activity. In contrast, insertion of a stop codon, UAA, between codons -24 and -23 (resulting in GRS1-24(stop)-23) had no obvious effect on the mitochondrial function. Together, our results suggest that UUG-23 is the translation initiator for the mitochondrial isoform of GlyRS. Note that none of these mutations in the presequence compromised the cytoplasmic function of GRS1 (Fig. 3B). To rule out the possibility that mutation at UUG-23 (such as UUG-23 to UUA) caused an unpredicted change in the secondary structure of GRS1 mRNAs, UUG-23 was mutated to a classical AUG translation initiation codon and then assayed for its effect on complementation activity. As expected, the mutation did not compromise the mitochondrial activity of GRS1 (GRS1L(-23)M in Fig. 3C), suggesting that it is the initiator activity, but not the RNA secondary structure, that was damaged by the mutation of UUG-23 to UUA. In addition, the relative mRNA levels produced from each mutant were assessed by RT-PCR and found to be similar, suggesting that the mutations did not alter mRNA stability. Partitioning of GlyRS Isoforms Determined by the Signal Peptide—To provide further insight into the mechanism that governs the subcellular localization of the GlyRS isoforms, we asked whether the leader peptide of the precursor form functions independently as a mitochondrial targeting signal, and if the short form of GlyRS could be converted to a mitochondrial enzyme by fusion of a heterologous signal peptide without overexpression. As previously shown, VAS1c, which has its mitochondrial targeting peptide (residues 1–46) deleted, encodes only the cytoplasmic form of valyl-tRNA synthetase and thus, cannot rescue the mitochondrial defect of the VAS1 knockout strain CW1 (22Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Google Scholar). Substitution of the native VAS1 promoter in VAS1c with the GRS1 presequence enabled the fusion to provide both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial activities (preGRS1-VAS1c in Fig. 4), whereas mutation of the non-AUG initiator in the fusion construct (preGRS1L(-23)L- VAS1c in Fig. 4) selectively impaired its mitochondrial activity. Thus, the leader peptide is in itself a fully functional mitochondrial targeting signal. We next tested whether the short form of GlyRS can be converted into a mitochondrial enzyme by a well characterized mitochondrial targeting signal (22Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Google Scholar). Fig. 5 showed that the leader peptide of valyl-tRNA synthetase could direct the otherwise cytoplasmic glycine enzyme into mitochondria. Further mutagenesis assays confirmed that the mitochondrial and the cytoplasmic functions are provided by proteins initiated from the AUG initiators in the VAS1 and GRS1 portions, respectively (compare preVAS1M1A-GRS1 and preVAS1-GRS1M1T in Fig. 5). Thus, the subcellular locations of the GlyRS isoforms depend solely on the presence or absence of an appropriate signal peptide under normal conditions. Translation of the Isoforms from a Single mRNA—To provide additional evidence that there are no alternative transcripts available solely for translation of the cytoplasmic isoform, and that the two isoforms are indeed generated from the same transcript identified by 5′-RACE, a sequence coding for a stable RNA secondary structure was inserted at the start of the transcription initiation site and tested for its effect on protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 6, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions were simultaneously affected by the putative hairpin structure, suggesting that no alternative mRNAs are available solely for the translation of the cytoplasmic isoform. (A negligible number of small colonies were observed in H-GRS1 on 5-FOA and YPG, probably because of incomplete inhibition of translation.) These data suggested that the GlyRS isoforms are indeed translated from the same transcript. Western Blot Analyses of Non-AUG-initiated Protein Translation—To confirm our results obtained by functional tests, we investigated the initiating capacity of UUG-23 with a different approach, Western blot. Various GRS1 presequences were fused in-frame to lexA and the expression profiles of the fusion constructs were tested. (These fusions were expressed under the control of a constitutive ADH promoter.) As shown in Fig. 7, the LexA protein produced from the lexA construct was specifically recognized by anti-LexA antibody (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 7B). Unexpectedly, when the wild-type GRS1 presequence was fused to lexA (resulting in preGRS1-lexA), we observed only one protein band with a molecular mass similar to that of the LexA protein but could not detect the larger fusion protein (lane 3 in Fig. 7B). A similar profile was seen with the initiator mutant preGRS1L(-23)L-lexA (lane 4 in Fig. 7B). We wondered whether the non-AUG-initiated protein was actually produced under these conditions or if the LexA fusion generated has been processed by matrix processing peptidase in the mitochondria. To distinguish between the two possibilities, the non-AUG initiator in the GRS1 portion (UUG-23) was substituted with a traditional AUG initiator (resulting in preGRS1L(-23)M-lexA) and tested to see if the fusion protein could be detected. Because this newly introduced AUG was located 5′ to the native AUG initiator of lexA, we expected that this triplet would become the primary translation start site for the fusion gene. Contrary to our anticipation, we did not observe a larger protein band for preGRS1L(-23)M-lexA (lane 5 in Fig. 7B). Thus, the processed LexA fusions appear to have a molecular mass similar to that of LexA. To get rid of the interference caused by AUG1 in the lexA portion, we mutated the AUG in some of the constructs used in the following experiment. To compare the efficiency of initiation from various codons more accurately, we used a chemiluminescence-based method. As expected, a protein band with a molecular mass identical to that of LexA was produced from preGRS1-lexAM1T in which the AUG1 in the lexA portion was mutated (AUG to AGU) (lane 3 in Fig. 7C), suggesting that the GRS1-LexA fusion protein has been efficiently processed. The protein band became much stronger when the UUG was changed to AUG (preGRS1L(-23)M-lexAM1T, lane 5 in Fig. 7C). In contrast, when UUG-23 was mutated to a codon unsuitable for initiation (preGRS1L(-23)L-lexAM1T, lane 4 in Fig. 7C), the protein band reduced dramatically. We surmised that the insignificant protein band that appeared in lane 4 probably came from one of the non-AUG codons (that differ from AUG by one nucleotide) between UUG-23 and AUG1. However, these non-AUG initiators are probably too inefficient to serve as functional initiators in complementation assays. To obtain a more accurate estimation of the relative initiation efficiencies, various amounts of total proteins were loaded and compared. As shown in Fig. 7D, the frequency of initiation at UUG-23 is around 5% relative"

In this study we report a novel missense mutation, G609R, causing dominant dRTA in affected members of a large Caucasian pedigree who all exhibited metabolic acidosis with alkaline urine, prominent nephrocalcinosis, and progressive renal impairment. To investigate the potential disease mechanism, the consequent effects of this mutation were determined. We first assessed anion transport function of G609R by expression in Xenopus oocytes. Western blotting and immunofluorescence demonstrated that the mutant protein was expressed at the oocyte cell surface. Measuring chloride and bicarbonate fluxes revealed normal 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid-inhibitable anion exchange, suggesting that loss-of-function of kAE1 cannot explain the severe disease phenotype in this kindred. We next expressed epitope-tagged wild-type or mutant kAE1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In monolayers grown to polarity, mutant kAE1 was detected subapically and at the apical membrane, as well as at the basolateral membrane, in contrast to the normal basolateral appearance of wild-type kAE1. These findings suggest that the seventh transmembrane domain that contains Gly-609 plays an important role in targeting kAE1 to the correct cell surface compartment. They confirm that dominant dRTA is associated with non-polarized trafficking of the protein, with no significant effect on anion transport function in vitro, which remains an unusual mechanism of human disease.

Although several different SLC4A1 mutations have been found to be involved in this disease, the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis for these mutations are not completely defined. In humans, the two main sites of AE1 expression are in erythrocyte cell membranes and, in the kidney, at the basolateral surface of α-intercalated cells in the collecting duct segment of the nephron. The encoded proteins are both products of SLC4A1, but because different promoters initiate transcription, they differ at their N termini, the renal isoform (kAE1) missing the first 65 amino acids found in the erythrocyte protein. Reported SLC4A1 mutations associated with ddRTA include missense alterations of Arg-589 (R589H, R589S, and R589C) (4Bruce L.J. Cope D.L. Jones G.K. Schofield A.E. Burley M. Povey S. Unwin R.J.

These mutations have been studied for their anion transport function and protein trafficking by expression in Xenopus oocytes and cultured mammalian cells, for example human embryonic kidney (HEK) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. When mutant R589H, R589C, or S613F AE1 proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, they reached the cell surface and exhibited at worst only mildly reduced anion exchange activity (4Bruce L.J. Cope D.L. Jones G.K. Schofield A.E. Burley M. Povey S. Unwin R.J. Wrong O. Tanner M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1693-1707Google Scholar, 6Jarolim P. Shayakul C. Prabakaran D. Jiang L.

Impaired trafficking of mutant R589H, R589C, and R589S kAE1 proteins was demonstrated when expressed in HEK 293 cells, and co-expression of wild-type kAE1 with these mutant proteins also revealed a dominant negative effect (15Quilty J.A. Li J. Reithmeier R.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F810-F820Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the R901X mutant retained normal anion exchange activity in Xenopus oocytes but failed to express at the cell surface of unpolarized MDCK cells (16Toye A.M. Bruce L.J. Unwin R.J. Wrong O. Tanner M.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 342-347Google Scholar) and HEK 293 cells (17Quilty J.A. Cordat E. Reithmeier R.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 895-903Google Scholar). From all of these data, it has been concluded that mutant AE1 proteins maintain sufficient anion transport function but are defective in targeting to the cell surface. These results suggest that the explanation for AE1 mutations and ddRTA is not simple loss-of-function. As kAE1 is specifically located in the basolateral membrane of α-intercalated cells in the distal nephron, an alternative reasonable hypothesis is that kAE1 mutations do not cause complete intracellular retention but instead result in mistargeting to the apical rather than basolateral membrane of these cells (13Bruce L.J. Wrong O. Toye A.M. Young M.T. Ogle G. Ismail Z. Sinha A.K. McMaster P. Hwaihwanje I. Nash G.B. Hart S. Lavu E. Palmer R. Othman A. Unwin R.J. Tanner M.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 41-51Google Scholar, 18Tanner M.J. Nature. 1996; 382: 209-210Google Scholar). However, almost all the protein-targeting studies that demonstrated impaired trafficking of mutant kAE1 were conducted in non-polarized cells, so it is possible that these proteins may behave differently in α-intercalated cells. In support of this, we have recently demonstrated that kAE1-R901X is aberrantly targeted to the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells, which emphasizes the importance of polarized cell models for targeting studies of the membrane proteins (19Devonald M.A. Smith A.N. Poon J.P. Ihrke G. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 125-127Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a novel missense mutation of the AE1 gene in a Caucasian family with dRTA. This mutation was further examined for its transport function in Xenopus oocytes and its trafficking in polarized MDCK cells. Subjects—Several members of a Caucasian kindred with autosomal dominant dRTA were studied (Fig. 1A). All affected individuals were determined to have metabolic acidosis with alkaline urine, nephrocalcinosis, and progressive renal impairment. Control subjects consisted of 30 unrelated, unaffected individuals from the same ethnic background. Mutation Screening of SLC4A1—Each coding exon of the kidney isoform of SLC4A1 (kAE1), including its flanking exon-intron boundaries, was individually amplified from genomic DNA of study patients. These PCR products were sequenced using ABI Prism® BigDye™ terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI377 instrument. Identified sequence alterations were confirmed in family members and assessed in 30 controls by allele-specific PCR (20Newton C.R. Graham A. Heptinstall L.E. Powell S.J. Summers C. Kalsheker N.

Plasmid Construction for Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—A cDNA clone containing full-length kAE1 constructed in pHM6 was used as template for PCR amplification using the Expand™ long template PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and specific primers to introduce a HindIII site, a Kozak consensus sequence, start codon, and hemagglutinin (HA) tag upstream of the second codon of kAE1, and a HindIII site downstream of the stop codon of the gene. This 2.6-kb PCR product was digested with HindIII and cloned into a vector containing the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin (gift of Cecilia Canessa, Yale University) for expression in Xenopus oocytes. This wild-type kAE1 clone, pXG-kAE1, was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) to make a mutant clone, pXG-kAE1G609R. The sequences of these two cDNA constructs were verified by direct sequencing. pXG-kAE1 and pXG-kAE1G609R were linearized with NheI before transcription of cRNA using T7 RNA polymerase with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ kit (Ambion, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Chloride and Bicarbonate Transport in Xenopus Oocytes Expressing kAE1 Constructs—Freshly harvested and manually defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes were microinjected with 5 ng of cRNA or an equivalent volume of water and were maintained in ND96 medium (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) at 19 °C for 3–4 days. Chloride ion uptake was measured according to the method of Garcia and Lodish (22Garcia A.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19607-19613Google Scholar). Briefly, groups of 8–12 injected oocytes were incubated in ND96 containing 5 μCi ml-1 36Cl- (Amersham Biosciences) at 19 °C for 1 h. Parallel groups of oocytes were pretreated with 100 μm DIDS in ND96 at 19 °C for 1 h, before addition of the 36Cl-. At the end of the incubation period with 36Cl-, oocytes were washed in a chloride-free medium (96 mm sodium gluconate, 2 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Each oocyte was transferred to an individual scintillation vial containing 100 μl of 1% SDS. After addition of scintillant, radioactivity was measured in a TRI-CARB 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples of the radioactive medium to which the oocytes were exposed were also taken for scintillation analysis so that the chloride influx could be calculated from a knowledge of the specific activity. Although bicarbonate efflux from individual oocytes could not be measured directly, the efflux from batches of 30–40 injected oocytes was assessed to confirm the function of kAE1. Initially oocytes were incubated in a chloride-free gluconate/HCO3- solution (96 mm sodium gluconate, 2 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm NaHCO3) for 1 h at 19 °C. This medium was removed and replaced with 250 μl of ND96/HCO3- solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm CaCl2,10mm NaHCO3). 100-μl samples were taken at time 0 and again after 1 h. Samples were equilibriated with 95% O2, 5% CO2, and the pH of the medium was read using a micro pH electrode (Hanna HI 1083, Jencons-PLS). The HCO3- flux/oocyte is given by the equation J(nmol·oocyte-1·h-1)=βCO2·ΔpH·vol·n-1·h-1(Eq. 1) where βCO2 is the buffer capacity (23Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Lambert L.C. DeLuca A. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 743-760Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—Total oocyte membranes were prepared according to previous methods (24Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Hauptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-C858Google Scholar, 25Tucker S.J. Bond C.T. Herson P. Pessia M. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5866-5870Google Scholar, 26Koomoa D.L. Musch M.W. Goldstein L. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 185: 57-63Google Scholar). Groups of 20 water- or cRNA-injected oocytes were homogenized using plastic pestles in 15 μl/oocyte cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 66 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.4% (w/v) deoxycholic acid) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Homogenates were centrifuged 3–4 times, each at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove all yolk granules and melanosomes. Supernatants were then pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min to give a total membrane fraction. Pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of homogenization buffer, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min, subjected to electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (loading 40 μg/lane), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were blocked for1hin5% skim milk in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with a rat monoclonal α-HA antibody at 1:200 dilution in PBST containing 0.5% skim milk for 1 h. After three 10-min washes in PBST, membranes were incubated for 1 h with 1:5,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit α-rat Ig. After three 10-min washes in PBST, specific proteins were detected using the LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate kit (Insight Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oocyte Immunofluorescence—Three days after injection with water, wild-type, or mutant kAE1 cRNA, Xenopus oocytes were fixed for 4 h in methanol at -20 °C. The fixative was replaced with 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight for cryoprotection. Oocytes were embedded in OCT compound (BDH) and frozen on solid CO2. 25-μm sections were cut on a cryostat and mounted on electrostatically charged microscope slides (Superfrost Plus, BDH). These cryosections were preincubated with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 15 min and incubated with primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody) at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibody was omitted in control experiments. After three 10-min washes in PBS, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse Ig antibody (1:200 dilution) at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. Following three further washes in PBS, sections were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence was visualized on a Nikon ECLIPSE E600 microscope. Plasmid Construction for Expression in MDCK Cells—pXG-kAE1 and pXG-kAE1G609R were used as template for amplification using long range PCR and oligonucleotide primers, which added HindIII and XhoI sites to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the kAE1 insert, respectively. These PCR products were digested and ligated into HindIII/XhoI cut pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3.1-kAE1 and pcDNA3.1-kAE1G609R. The integrity of these complete constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNA for transfections was purified with the EndoFree™ plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen). Cell Culture and Transfection—MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum; 1% penicillin, streptomycin; and 1% glutamine (Sigma) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2.50–80% confluent cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1-kAE1 or pcDNA3.1-kAE1G609R using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). To generate mixed stable clones, transfected cells were selected with 500 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) commencing 2 days after transfection and were continuously cultured in this selection medium for 2 weeks. Colonies of transfected cells were collected after trypsinization and seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well on 0.4-μm Transwell filters (Costar). Day 4 filter-grown transfected MDCK cells were treated with 5 mm sodium N-butyrate (Sigma) for 16 h prior to examination for localization of kAE1 protein by immunofluorescence staining as below. Mammalian Cell Immunofluorescence—Stably transfected cells on filter membranes were washed twice with PBS and fixed in sodium cacodylate buffer containing 6 mm CdCl2, KCl, MgCl2, and 4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. After washing again with PBS, filters were incubated in quenching solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm glycine, and 75 mm NH4Cl in PBS) at room temperature for 10 min, followed by further washes in PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 15–30 min, and filters were then incubated with primary antibody (1:100 dilution of rat monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Applied Science)) for 1 h. Washing twice with PBS was followed by incubation with half-strength blocking solution for 5 min. These steps were repeated three times. Filters were then incubated with secondary antibody (1:150 dilution of goat anti-rat Ig conjugated to Texas Red) and counter-stained with 1:200 dilution of peanut lectin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate for 30 min in the dark. Washing with PBS and incubation with half-strength blocking solution steps were performed as before. After mounting with Antifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), the expression of protein was examined by visualization under a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Kindred RTA-1—The index case (Fig. 1A, III:8) presented at the age of 6 with ureteric colic and was found to have a metabolic acidosis with concomitant alkaline urine and prominent nephrocalcinosis with calculi. In common with his mother and four of her siblings, her father, and two of her aunts, a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis was made. Compliance with alkali therapy was poor, and he suffered recurrent problems with stones and progressive renal impairment, requiring dialysis from 1995. In 1996, he received an allograft from his unaffected sister. His native kidneys were removed prior to transplantation. Histological examination revealed bilateral end-stage tubulointerstitial disease with heavily calcified renal parenchyma and multiple renal calculi. He has remained well since transplantation, excepting a reversible episode of acute cellular rejection 6 months post-engraftment. Extending this kindred shows that several first cousins have also been diagnosed with RTA (Fig. 1A). Renal tract calcification is a prominent feature in this kindred, as is premature renal impairment. Cousin III:1 is awaiting a renal transplant at present. Identification of kAE1 G609R Mutation—DNA sequence studies of SLC4A1 in the index case revealed a heterozygous G to A transversion in exon 15, changing GGG to AGG to encode a novel missense G609R mutation (Fig. 1, B and D). No other codon-altering mutations were found in any exon. An allele-specific amplification method was employed to seek this sequence alteration in other available members of the family. Genomic DNA from each individual was amplified in two separate reactions, with either a pair of wild type-specific or mutant-specific primers, which generated the same PCR product size of 216 bp of G or A allele. The results showed that the mutation segregates with disease phenotype in available family members III:8, II:6, and III:3 (Fig. 1C). The mutation was present heterozygously in all three affected individuals but absent both from an unaffected family member (III:9) and from 30 control subjects. Expression Studies of kAE1 in Xenopus Oocytes—To determine heterologous expression of the G609R kAE1 mutant, wild-type or mutant cRNAs encoding full-length human kAE1 incorporating an N-terminal HA tag were first expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Western blotting of total membrane fractions prepared from microinjected oocytes using an anti-HA antibody demonstrated a single major protein of molecular mass 95 kDa, corresponding to kAE1, in both wild-type and mutant cRNA-injected oocytes, which was absent in control (water-injected) oocytes (Fig. 2). Immunofluorescence was also performed to confirm the expression of wild-type and mutant kAE1 at the plasma membrane of the Xenopus oocyte. The immunolocalization of kAE1 in cryosectioned oocytes injected with wild-type or mutant kAE1 cRNA showed expression of the protein at the cell surface in both cases (Fig. 3), whereas this immunofluorescence was absent in oocytes injected with water or in negative controls where primary antibody was omitted. These results indicate that the mutant G609R protein maintained normal stability and was expressed at the cell surface of Xenopus oocytes in comparable amounts to wild-type kAE1.Fig. 3Immunolocalization of kAE1 in the plasma membrane of oocytes expressing wild-type (WT) kAE1 and kAE1-G609R. Cryosectioned oocytes injected with cRNA or water were fixed, incubated, and detected under identical conditions, but primary antibody incubation was omitted in control oocyte.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Functional Studies of Mutant kAE1 in Xenopus Oocytes—To investigate whether the mutation affects kAE1 transport activity, chloride influx and bicarbonate efflux assays were performed. Comparison of 36Cl- uptake mediated by wild type-, mutant-, or water-injected (control) oocytes assayed with or without addition of DIDS, a specific covalent inhibitor of AE1 (27Lux S.E. Palek J. Handin R.I. Lux S.E. Stossel T.P. Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1995: 1701-1818Google Scholar), is shown in Fig. 4. These results demonstrate significant 36Cl- uptake following wild-type or mutant cRNA injection compared with water injection but no significant difference between wild-type and mutant cRNA. Mean uptake of 36Cl- by wild-type and mutant kAE1 proteins was 13.36 ± 0.48 and 13.81 ± 0.51 nmol of Cl-/oocyte/h, respectively (p = 0.54). We also determined 36Cl- uptake by groups of oocytes injected with wild-type or mutant cRNA, which were pretreated with 100 μm DIDS for 1 h before the assay. The 36Cl- uptakes by both wild-type and mutant kAE1 proteins were significantly decreased by DIDS but were not significantly different from each other (4.42 ± 0.74 versus 4.20 ± 0.78 nmol of Cl-/oocyte/h; p = 0.85). Endogenous 36Cl- influx was 0.92 ± 0.25 (no DIDS) nmol of Cl-/oocyte/h and 0.81 ± 0.19 (preincubation with DIDS) nmol of Cl-/oocyte/h in a group of oocytes injected with water. Since kAE1 functions as a one-to-one Cl--HCO3- exchanger (28Jay D. Cantley L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 511-538Google Scholar) across the basolateral membrane of α-intercalated cells, we wanted to confirm this function of the mutant protein by assaying HCO3- efflux. Although HCO3- efflux could not be measured from single oocytes, we developed a method to determine its efflux from batches of 30–40 injected oocytes. As expected, this revealed similar results to the 36Cl- influx study. The calculated HCO3- efflux induced by oocytes injected with wild-type or mutant kAE1 cRNA was 15.5 and 16.4 nmol of HCO3-/oocyte/h, respectively. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that this kAE1 mutant protein retains normal anion (Cl-/HCO3-) transport activity. Localization of kAE1 in Transfected MDCK Cells—MDCK I cells transfected with kAE1-G609R or kAE1 demonstrated markedly different expression patterns of these proteins (Fig. 5). As reported previously (19Devonald M.A. Smith A.N. Poon J.P. Ihrke G. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 125-127Google Scholar), wild-type kAE1 was observed exclusively at the basolateral surface of cells grown to polarity on Transwell filters (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the G609R mutant protein was visualized in a widespread distribution that included the basolateral surface and considerable subapical localization, together with some apical co-localization with the surface marker peanut lectin (Fig. 5B). Initial efforts in this study were directed toward identifying the genetic cause of ddRTA in a large family who exhibited nephrocalcinosis and renal impairment and resulted in the isolation of a novel SLC4A1 mutation. This glycine at position 609 is conserved among all known vertebrate AE1 gene family sequences, providing an idea of functional importance of this residue. Gly-609 is predicted to lie within the seventh transmembrane domain of the polytopic AE1 protein, toward its cytoplasmic end (29Zhu Q. Lee D.W. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3112-3120Google Scholar). Gly-609 is also located close to two residues where missense mutations have been reported, in codons Arg-589 and Ser-613, reinforcing the importance of this region of the multiple transmembrane-spanning half of the molecule. The mutation reported here results in substitution of a small polar uncharged amino acid by a positively charged side-chain residue. It is not clear what effect this might have on the local structure of this particular α-helix, but our studies demonstrate that it does not affect overall synthesis of the protein. It seems likely that if this glycine is normally situated within the lipid bilayer, then its replacement by arginine might disrupt nearby conformation and thus binding of another carrier or targeting molecule, but this must remain a matter for speculation at present. In investigating the potential disease mechanism, functional consequences of this G609R kAE1 mutation on anion transport were assessed by a combination of Xenopus oocyte and polarized epithelial cell studies. The expression systems used for functional and trafficking studies of membrane proteins are important. Xenopus oocytes provide an ideal expression model for transport function of ion transporters both because their large size makes handling and manipulation relatively straightforward and because they do not express endogenous kAE1, permitting measurement of the functional activity of the pure mutant proteins (22Garcia A.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19607-19613Google Scholar, 30Groves J.D. Tanner M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22163-22170Google Scholar). However, oocytes cannot be used for examination of potential polarized sorting defects (31Alper S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 899-923Google Scholar). In the absence of a definitive α-intercalated cell model, cultured mammalian cells such as MDCK cells, a canine collecting duct cell line that forms tight polarized monolayers, have proven suitable for protein-trafficking studies. In common with other plasma membrane-resident proteins, it remains difficult to transfect these cells with heterologous kAE1 cDNA, and they are not quite an ideal cell model for α-intercalated cells as they are derived originally from principal cells, the other major cell type in the collecting duct. Further studies to quantify the level of apical expression of mutant kAE1 would be advantageous if a stable line with sufficient expression could be generated, but we have to date been unable to achieve significant expression levels in stable lines to render this feasible. In terms of overall mutation detection in this disease, R589H, R589C, and R589S were reported in five families, three families, and one family, respectively (4Bruce L.J. Cope D.L. Jones G.K.

Susaengrat W. Waiyawuth W. Nimmannit S. Malasit P. Yenchitsomanus P.T. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2003; 18: 644-648Google Scholar), whereas S613F was present in one kindred (4Bruce L.J. Cope D.L. Jones G.K. Schofield A.E. Burley M. Povey S. Unwin R.J. Wrong O. Tanner M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1693-1707Google Scholar). The pathogenetic mechanisms of these previously reported mutations remain unclear, functional studies having concluded that anion exchange is at worst only mildly diminished (4Bruce L.J. Cope D.L. Jones G.K. Schofield A.E. Burley M. Povey S. Unwin R.J. Wrong O. Tanner M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1693-1707Google Scholar, 6Jarolim P. Shayakul C. Prabakaran D. Jiang L. Stuart-Tilley A.

It has been suggested that intracellular retardation of R589H and R901X mutants expressed in non-polarized cells is the dominant negative effect explaining the lack of urine acidification and dominant nature of dRTA (15Quilty J.A. Li J. Reithmeier R.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 282: F810-F820Google Scholar, 17Quilty J.A. Cordat E. Reithmeier R.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 895-903Google Scholar). However, kAE1-R901X expression in MDCK cells grown to polarity clearly results in aberrant surface expression with some mutant protein appearing at the apical surface (19Devonald M.A. Smith A.N. Poon J.P. Ihrke G. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 125-127Google Scholar) in common with the findings reported here; on the other hand, Arg-589 mutants have yet to be assessed in polarized cells, and observed results for the different mutations may be different because of this. In addition, variants of hereditary spherocytosis where AE1 haploinsufficiency occurs are not associated with a renal abnormality, suggesting that loss of 50% of the encoded protein is not sufficient to explain dRTA (32Jarolim P. Murray J.L. Rubin H.L. Taylor W.M. Prchal J.T. Ballas S.K. Snyder L.M. Chrobak L. Melrose W.D. Brabec V. Palek J. Blood. 1996; 88: 4366-4374Google Scholar). It is entirely possible that the mechanisms associated with different mutations may not be the same, but alternative explanations for these other cases have yet to emerge. The spectrum of phenotypic severity in distal RTA is wide, ranging from the asymptomatic occurrence of stones in adulthood to childhood growth impairment and rickets. Affected members of this particular kindred exhibited a striking degree of nephrocalcinosis and premature renal failure. Although the number of reported cases is too small to permit definite geno-type-phenotype correlations, it is notable that they share this severity with the kindred carrying the R901X mutation where mistargeting of the mutant protein is also a feature. It is tempting to speculate that this is because these mutations result in net bicarbonate secretion into the urine rather than overall functional cellular failure, but this has not been assessed. One way to address this would be to measure urine pCO2, predicting that in affected members of this kindred and the R901X kindred, it would not be reduced to the extent usually observed in dRTA. It is unfortunate that severe nephrocalcinosis and consequent anatomical disruption renders the interpretation of pCO2 levels unreliable. Taken together, our finding of improper trafficking of this novel G609R mutation associated with ddRTA suggests that this conserved residue in the seventh transmembrane span plays an important role in correct protein targeting, without a deleterious effect on anion transport function. As AE1 is a functional dimer (33Zhang D. Kiyatkin A. Bolin J.T. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2925-2933Google Scholar), we would expect that both homo- and heterodimers of wild-type and mutant protein could appear in the apical compartment. This effect of protein behavior of kAE1, observed previously with the C-terminal truncating mutation, leads to impaired urine acidification by disrupting the delicate electrochemical balance across α-intercalated cells resulting in severe disease. Mistargeting of mutant low density lipoprotein receptors in one form of inherited hyperlipidemia (34Koivisto U.M. Hubbard A.L. Mellman I. Cell. 2001; 105: 575-585Google Scholar) is the best known other example of a mechanism of disease that remains very unusual, with few precedents.

https://openalex.org/W2116456971,"Glomerular podocyte differentiation state is critical for filtration barrier function and is regulated by WT1, a zinc finger transcription factor. A yeast two-hybrid assay identified a novel, WT1-interacting protein (WTIP) that maps to human chromosome 19q13.1, a region with genes linked to familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The domain structure of WTIP is similar to the zyxin subfamily of cytosolic LIM domain-containing proteins, which contain three carboxyl-terminal LIM protein-protein interaction domains and a proline-rich, pre-LIM region with a nuclear export signal. Other LIM domain-containing proteins (zyxin and mouse muscle LIM protein) did not interact with WT1 in two-hybrid assays, and WTIP did not interact with an unrelated transcription factor, LMX1B. WTIP mRNA was detected in cultured podocytes and was developmentally regulated, with expression peaking in mouse kidney at embryonic day 15-16 (E15-E16) in kidney but persisting into adulthood. In situ hybridization demonstrated WTIP expression in developing E15 glomeruli and in cultured podocytes. The partial WTIP clone, which interacted with WTIP in the two-hybrid assay, co-localized with WT1 in nuclei, co-precipitated with WT1, and inhibited WT1-dependent transcriptional activation of the amphiregulin promoter. In contrast, full-length WTIP was excluded from cell nuclei, but after the addition of leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1-mediated nuclear export, it accumulated in the nucleus and co-precipitated with WT1 in whole cell lysates. Epitope-tagged WTIP co-localized with the adaptor protein CD2AP (CMS) in podocyte actin spots and with Mena at cell-cell junctions. We propose that WTIP monitors slit diaphragm protein assembly as part of a multiple protein complex, linking this specialized adhesion junction to the actin cytoskeleton, and shuttles into the nucleus after podocyte injury, providing a mechanism whereby changes in slit diaphragm structure modulate gene expression.

We propose that WTIP monitors slit diaphragm protein assembly as part of a multiple protein complex, linking this specialized adhesion junction to the actin cytoskeleton, and shuttles into the nucleus after podocyte injury, providing a mechanism whereby changes in slit diaphragm structure modulate gene expression. Podocytes are highly specialized epithelial cells, which synthesize components of glomerular basement membrane, elaborate interdigitating foot processes from adjacent cells that encircle capillaries and are bridged by extracellular proteins of the slit diaphragm. In proteinuric renal diseases, podocytes undergo stereotypic phenotypic simplification into a cuboidal shape, characterized by foot process fusion and retraction and loss of filtration barrier function. Although persistent podocyte dysregulation is associated with glomerular scarring, this phenotype switch is reversible. Appropriate therapy can restore normal podocyte structure and function, suggesting a dynamic, regulated process. Positional cloning and gene targeting have identified the proteins critical for normal podocyte function. However, in the absence of mutations, molecular mechanisms that regulate podocyte phenotype remain unclear. Given its unique microenvironment with exposure to hemodynamic forces and high flow of ultrafiltrate, we speculated that podocytes express intracellular molecules that relay changes in extracellular physical forces or soluble signals to modify cellular structure and function. A number of podocyte proteins are candidate targets as putative regulatory molecules. Normal podocyte differentiation requires the correct temporal expression of specific transcription factor genes (1Quaggin S.E. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2002; 57: 208-211Google Scholar). Of this gene set, we focused on the zinc finger transcription factor WT1 for several reasons. Although originally discovered as a tumor suppressor gene inactivated in a subset of Wilm's tumors, WT1 is essential for normal nephrogenesis. Wt1 null mice lack kidneys (2Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Google Scholar), and, when engineered to express a human WT1 transgene, the animals survive but develop mesangial sclerosis or crescentic nephritis (3Guo J.K. Menke A.L. Gubler M.C. Clarke A.R. Harrison D. Hammes A. Hastie N.D. Schedl A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 651-659Google Scholar), depending on the WT1 expression level. In normal adult animals, WT1 expression is restricted to podocytes, suggesting a role for WT1 in maintenance of podocyte differentiation. In fact, WT1 zinc finger mutations are associated with the re-expression of an immature podocyte phenotype (4Patek C.E. Fleming S. Miles C.G. Bellamy C.O. Ladomery M. Spraggon L. Mullins J. Hastie N.D. Hooper M.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2379-2394Google Scholar) and Denys-Drash and Frasier syndromes (5Hastie N.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 391-394Google Scholar), rare causes of familial glomerulosclerosis. Mice engineered to express these WT1 mutations develop phenotypes that parallel the human syndromes (5Hastie N.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 391-394Google Scholar, 6Hammes A. Guo J. Lutsch G. Leheste J. Landrock D. Ziegler U. Gubler M. Schedl A. Cell. 2001; 106: 319-329Google Scholar, 7Patek C.E. Little M.H. Fleming S.

A. 1999; 96: 2931-2936Google Scholar), further documenting that WT1 function is required for a normal podocyte phenotype. Finally, WT1 expression levels decrease in acquired causes of glomerulosclerosis (8Barisoni L. Kriz W. Mundel P. D'Agati V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 51-61Google Scholar, 9Ohtaka A. Ootaka T. Sato H. Soma J. Sato T. Saito T. Ito S. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2002; 39: 475-485Google Scholar). The WT1 gene encodes at least 24 different isoforms, with the four major isoforms represented by two alternative splice sites (5Hastie N.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 391-394Google Scholar, 10Haber D.A. Sohn R.L. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Call K.M. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9618-9622Google Scholar, 11Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp.

The first alternative splice site either includes or excludes 17 amino acids encoded by exon 5 and is only expressed in mammals. The function of this domain is not clear, since mice engineered to express WT1 isoforms without exon 5 develop normally and are fertile (13Natoli T.A. McDonald A. Alberta J.A. Taglienti M.E. Housman D.E. Kreidberg J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4433-4438Google Scholar). The second alternative splice site occurs in intron 9 and includes or excludes three amino acids, KTS. In vitro, WT1 isoforms without KTS (WT1(-KTS)) bind DNA and regulate transcription, whereas those with the KTS (WT1(+KTS)) insertion primarily regulate RNA processing but not gene activity (5Hastie N.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 391-394Google Scholar). WT1 is both a transcriptional repressor and activator (11Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Google Scholar) and regulates genes important in nephron formation including podocalyxin (14Palmer R.E. Kotsianti A. Cadman B. Boyd T. Gerald W. Haber D.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1805-1809Google Scholar), amphiregulin (15Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Google Scholar) and perhaps nephrin (3Guo J.K. Menke A.L. Gubler M.C. Clarke A.R. Harrison D. Hammes A. Hastie N.D. Schedl A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 651-659Google Scholar). To understand mechanisms of podocyte differentiation more completely, we identified proteins that interacted with WT1, using a yeast two-hybrid assay with a full-length WT1 isoform containing exon 5 and lacking the KTS insertion as bait (WT1+/-). We anticipated finding a nuclear cofactor that regulated WT1 activity. Instead, we cloned a novel, cytosolic molecule, WT1-interacting protein (WTIP), with a domain structure similar to the zyxin family of LIM domain-containing scaffolding proteins. In vitro functional studies demonstrated that when sequestered within the nucleus, WTIP repressed WT1 transcriptional activity and co-localized with WT1. Our data suggest that WTIP may shuttle between the podocyte slit diaphragm and the nucleus in vivo, similar to a growing family of cellular signaling molecules that translate information from cell junctions into altered gene expression. Cell Lines—COS7, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-1658; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Temperature-sensitive, conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes were maintained in the undifferentiated, proliferating state at 33 °C and induced to differentiate as described previously (16Mundel P. Reiser J. Zuniga Mejia B.A. Pavenstadt H. Davidson G.R. Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Mouse WT1(-KTS) cDNA (gift of J. Pelletier, McGill University) was subcloned into bait plasmid pAS2.1 (MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 2; K1604-1; Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) in frame with the GAL4 binding domain to generate pASW. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that pASW alone did not transcriptionally activate reporter genes, lacZ and His3. Yeast host strain Y190 was transformed sequentially with pASW and plasmid pACT, which contained the GAL4 activation domain and a kidney cDNA library from adult mice subcloned into the multiple cloning site (ML4014AH; Clontech). Transformants were selected on Leu/Trp/His-deficient media and scored for β-galactosidase synthesis by a lift assay. After secondary screening assays eliminated false positives, plasmids containing potential WT1 binding partners were isolated and sequenced. In addition to library screening, we performed yeast two-hybrid binding assays to determine interactions between WT1(-KTS) and other LIM domain-containing proteins, including zyxin (IMAGE clone 2599012) and mouse muscle LIM protein (IMAGE clone 2649970). We also assessed the interaction of mouse WTIP and the transcription factor LMX1B (IMAGE clone 3157928) or a WT1 isoform carrying a mutation (WT1ts396) that truncates zinc finger 3, deletes the KTS insert and zinc finger 4, and is found in some Denys-Drash syndrome patients. WT1ts396 was generated by PCR from pASW using an upstream primer in the pAS 2.1 sequence (5′-CGACGTGCGGGACCTGA-3′) and a downstream primer that contains a premature stop codon (underlined) after Ser395 (5′-GTCGACAGACAGATGCTAGGAGCC-3′). Yeast were co-transformed with purified pASW and the indicated pACT and pAS expression vectors. Colonies that grew on Leu/Trp/His-deficient media and scored positive for β-galactosidase in the lift assays indicated a positive interaction. RNA Analysis—Total or poly(A) RNA was either prepared from cultured podocytes according to the manufacturer's protocol (RNeasy and Oligotex, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or purchased (human kidney RNA; Clontech). To analyze time-dependent, WTIP expression during nephrogenesis, kidneys were isolated from FVB/N embryos harvested on embryonic day 14-18 and postnatal mice ranging in age from day 0 to 9 months as previously reported (17Ross M.D. Bruggeman L.A. Hanss B. Sunamoto M. Marras D. Klotman M.E. Klotman P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33248-33255Google Scholar). 5-15 μg of total or 250-500 ng of poly(A)+ RNA were loaded into formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Prehybridization and hybridization were done with Hybrisol I (Intergen, Purchase, NY) at 46-66 °C. Blots were hybridized using PCR-generated 32P-labeled DNA probes. WTIP probe was generated by PCR using primers, which flanked the pACT kidney cDNA clone isolated from the two-hybrid screen. Other probes were generated with the following primers: for mouse WT1, 5′-CCACACCCCTACTGACAGTTG-3′ and 5′-GTGTGGGTCTTCAGATGGTCG-3′; for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′GGAGCCAAACGGGTCATC-3′ and 5′-TGTTGCTGAGCCGTATTCAT-3′. After overnight hybridization, blots were washed in 2× SSC, 2% SDS at either 50 °C (for blots containing mouse RNA) or 46 °C (for blots containing human RNA) and exposed by autoradiography. To detect mouse WTIP by reverse transcription-PCR, 1 μg of DNase-treated RNA from undifferentiated mouse podocytes was incubated with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Resulting cDNA was amplified with Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using mouse WTIP primers 5′-AAACAGCTGACAAGTGTAGCG-3′ and 5′-CCTCTCCTCTCTGTGTACCG-3′ and sequenced. In Situ Hybridization—Nonradioactive in situ hybridization was performed on 5-μm paraffin sections from microdissected E15-E16 kidneys, which were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned as described (18Bruggeman L.A. Ross M.D. Tanji N. Cara A. Dikman S. Gordon R.E. Burns G.C. D'Agati V.D. Winston J.A. Klotman M.E. Klotman P.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2079-2087Google Scholar). To generate riboprobe templates, a mouse 800-bp WTIP cDNA fragment was subcloned bidirectionally into pCRII. Digoxigenin-labeled, nonhybridizing and hybridizing RNA probes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and were quantified spectrophotometrically and by dot blot. In situ hybridizations were performed using equivalent concentrations of sense and antisense probe. Hybridized probe was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated, anti-digoxigenin antibody. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washes were performed at 50 °C. Generation of Expression Vectors and Transient Transfections—Expression vectors for full-length WTIP, WTIP with deletion of the pre-LIM domain (NΔWTIP), and WT1(-KTS) were generated by cloning the coding regions into pCMV-Tag (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with fusion to an N-terminal FLAG or Myc tag to generate pCMV-Tag-FLAGWT1(-KTS), pCMV-Tag-mycNΔWTIP, and pCMV-Tag-myc- WTIP. pCDNA3-HA-CD2AP was a gift from Dr. Larry Holzman (University of Michigan). COS7 cells, 3T3 fibroblasts, or podocytes were transiently transfected with the indicated expression vector using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were incubated for 2.5 h with Superfect-DNA complex at a ratio of 1:5 in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, after which medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were either harvested 48 h after transfection for biochemical analyses or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for immunocytochemical studies. Immunofluorescence—Transfected cells cultured on sterile glass coverslips (collagen type I-coated for podocytes) were washed in Dulbecco's PBS, fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%, 20 min, 4 °C), and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in Dulbecco's PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 10% goat serum, cells were incubated with primary antibodies in 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's PBS for 1.5 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) include rabbit polyclonal (C19, sc192) and mouse monoclonal (F6, sc7385) anti-WT1, rabbit polyclonal (sc789) and mouse monoclonal (sc40) anti-c-Myc, and rabbit polyclonal anti-CD2AP (sch290). Anti-Mena antibody was a gift from B. Wang (Case School of Medicine). Subsequently, coverslips were washed and incubated with secondary antibody at dilutions ranging from 1:200 to 1:300 for 1.5 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated horse anti-mouse or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Coverslips were mounted in anti-fade, aqueous medium containing 4′,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vectashield with DAPI; Vector Laboratories) on standard glass slides. Antibody staining was visualized using a Nikon epifluorescence E600 microscope, and photographs were taken with a SPOT Digital System camera model 2.3.0. Confocal images were obtained with a Leica TCS SP2 Confocal system. Digital images were processed and grouped using Adobe Photoshop v6.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Coimmunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Proteins were extracted from transfected cells and analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as we have previously described (19Singh R. Huang S. Guth T. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 419-428Google Scholar, 20Singh R. Wang B. Shirvaikar A. Khan S. Kamat S. Schelling J.R. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1561-1570Google Scholar). After washing, cells were placed on ice and 750 μl of chilled lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% deoxycholate containing 1.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.2 μg/ml pepstatin, 120 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. Following centrifugation to remove debris, supernatants were matched for protein, precleared with protein A-Sepharose, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 40 μl of agarose beads conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma). In some experiments, lysates of transfected cells were precleared with nonimmune rabbit IgG and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-WT1 antibody (1:1000 dilution) and protein A-Sepharose. Beads were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 10 s and washed three times with NET buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Bound proteins were released by boiling in 2% SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Eluted proteins were separated by 4-20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) membranes, and analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (1:1000 dilution) and protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). Bound antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (Western Lightning; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Generation of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Proteins and GST Pull-down Experiments—WTIP sequences were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGST-Tag (gift of Larry Holzman, University of Michigan). GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (19Singh R. Huang S. Guth T. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 419-428Google Scholar, 20Singh R. Wang B. Shirvaikar A. Khan S. Kamat S. Schelling J.R. Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1561-1570Google Scholar). Briefly, Eschericia coli cells were transformed with the recombinant pGST-Tag expression vectors. GST fusion proteins were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Cells transfected with pCMV-Tag-FLAGWT1(-KTS) were lysed as described above. Lysates were cleared with GST and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with equal amounts of GST or the indicated GST fusion proteins. Proteins bound to GST or GST fusion proteins were precipitated from the lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing, WT1 was detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-WT1 (C19) antibody (1:1000 dilution). Transactivation Assays—Transcription experiments were carried out as previously described (15Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Google Scholar) using WT1-responsive amphiregulin promoter (genomic fragment -328 to -187 nucleotide (nt), pGL2B, which contains a WT1 response element (-292 to -283 nt, WT1-responsive element (WRE): CCCGGCCGTGGGTGGA) and pGL2BΔ-WRE, a construct that contains a WRE with 4 bp deleted. Dishes (3.8 cm2) of HeLa or 3T3 cells were transfected with a total of 1.5 μg CMVTag, pCMVTag-mycNΔWTIP, and pCMV-Tag-FLAGWT1(-KTS) and the reporter construct as indicated. Luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer (EG&G Berthold) using a kit (E1500; Promega). Results of the Two-hybrid Assay and Cloning of a WTIP—WT1 is required for appropriate podocyte differentiation, but mechanisms regulating its activity and expression are incompletely understood. To identify proteins that interact with WT1, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen a cDNA kidney library from adult mice with a full-length WT1 isoform containing exon 5 and lacking the KTS insertion after exon 9 (WT1(-KTS)) as bait. A total of 1.2 × 106 transformants were screened, yielding 18 positive yeast colonies. Two plasmids encoded identical 1.2-kb nt expressed sequence tag sequences (AA050259 and AI322654), and a partial amino acid sequence was deduced by translating the expressed sequence tag nucleotide sequence in frame with the GAL4 activation domain. Two-hybrid assays demonstrated that WTIP and WT1 specifically interact. This partial WTIP sequence did not self-activate or interact with a negative control yeast GAL4 binding domain fusion protein or irrelevant transcription factor LMX1B (Table I).Table IWTIP specifically interacts with WT1 in yeastGAL4 ADaActivation domain. fusion proteinGAL4 BDbBinding domain. fusion proteinReporter geneHIS3lacZWTIP (LIM only)cFusion proteins contain only the LIM domain regions of WTIP and zyxin, which localize to the nucleus.WT1(−KTS)++BlueGAL4 BD−WhiteLamin−WhiteLMX1B−WhiteWT1tm396++BlueMMLPdMouse muscle LIM protein (orthologous with human cysteine-rich protein).WT1(−KTS)−WhiteZyxin (LIM only)cFusion proteins contain only the LIM domain regions of WTIP and zyxin, which localize to the nucleus.WT1(−KTS)−WhiteLaminWT1(−KTS)−WhiteGAL4 ADWT1(−KTS)−Whitea Activation domain.b Binding domain.c Fusion proteins contain only the LIM domain regions of WTIP and zyxin, which localize to the nucleus.d Mouse muscle LIM protein (orthologous with human cysteine-rich protein). Open table in a new tab Full-length mouse and human WTIP cDNA sequences were generated using information in the NCBI and Celera databases. The mouse, partial WTIP cDNA identified in the two-hybrid assay mapped to chromosome 7 and was orthologous to a human gene on chromosome 19q13.12, which contained additional in-frame sequence with an initiation codon. BLASTn searches identified new human and mouse expressed sequence tags, which were obtained from the IMAGE consortium and sequenced. The resulting cDNA sequence overlapped with the expressed sequence tag sequence identified in the yeast two-hybrid assay and allowed construction of clones containing full-length 430-amino acid human and 398-amino acid mouse coding sequences for a novel WTIP. Alignment of the full-length mouse and human WTIP protein sequences is shown using ClustalW in Fig. 1. Overall, the proteins are 89% identical and 94% conserved. The primary sequence divergence between mouse and human WTIP proteins is restricted to the amino terminus. Human WTIP contains two short amino acid stretches and a polyglycine repeat that are not present in mouse WTIP, suggesting these residues are not critical for WTIP function. The Domain Organization of WTIP Is Similar to Other Zyxin Family Paralogues—Analysis of both mouse and human WTIP using SMART (available on the World Wide Web at smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) identified three carboxyl-terminal LIM protein-protein interaction domains, which demonstrated significant alignment with the zyxin family of LIM domain-containing proteins. Yeast co-transfected with the GAL4 binding domain-WT1 fusion protein expression plasmid and plasmids encoding fusion proteins containing GAL4 activation domain and other LIM domain-containing proteins (mouse muscle LIM protein (also known as cysteine rich protein) or the LIM domains of zyxin) did not grow on media lacking histidine or express β-galactosidase activity (Table I). Two-hybrid assays, using the LIM sequences of WTIP and the Denys-Drash WT1 mutant (WT1ts396) showed that the WT1-WTIP interaction was mediated by the LIM-only region of WTIP and did not require the KTS insert or the fourth zinc finger of WT1 (Table I). LIM domain sequences from known zyxin family members, including a Drosophila protein (CG11063) similar to WTIP, and human and mouse WTIP are aligned in Fig. 2A. The positions of the metal-coordinating residues are conserved between all of the family members, and other amino acid residues are either identical or strongly conserved, suggesting that the LIM domains of these molecules may interact with a similar repertoire of binding partners. The LIM domain region of WTIP is most closely related to ajuba, LIMD1 (LIM domains containing protein 1), and the Drosophila protein CG11063 with ∼60% identity. In addition, WTIP contains a conserved insertion of five amino acids ((F/Y)SGFQ) in the linker region between the first and second LIM domains, which has also been reported in ajuba, LIMD1, and CG11063 (21Renfranz P.J. Siegrist S.E. Stronach B.E. Macalma T. Beckerle M.C. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 305: 13-26Google Scholar). Comparison of WTIP LIM domains with the LIM domains of zyxin, lipoma partner protein, and thyroid receptor-interacting protein 6 showed that on average, 45% of the amino acid residues were either identical or strongly conserved. WTIP domain structure contains some notable differences from other zyxin family members (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the LIM domain-containing regions, the amino-terminal, pre-LIM regions of WTIP and other zyxin family members significantly diverge from each other, suggesting that this region confers functional specificity in this family of proteins through unique protein-protein interactions. The pre-LIM region of WTIP has 30% identity with CG11063. Only 20% of amino acid residues are identical on average with the other zyxin family members, and no stretches of amino acids encoding motifs are conserved. Human and mouse WTIP contain two conserved, proline-rich regions that appear to be SH3 binding domains (Pro151 (AQFPFPLPSLPLPP) and Pro157 (LPSLPLPPGREGGPS) in mouse WTIP and Pro183 (GPAPFPLPALPLPPG) and Pro189 (LPALPLPPGREGGPS) in human WTIP). Both mouse and human WTIP contain a PDZ binding domain (VTEL) at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2), a motif that distinguishes these gene products from other zyxin family members and potentially mediates functions specific for WTIP. WTIP Expression—WTIP tissue expression was analyzed on an RNA master blot (not shown). WTIP is expressed in a pattern similar to that reported for WT1 during embryonic development (2Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Google Scholar, 11Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Google Scholar, 22Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Haber D.A. Glaser T. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1707-1712Google Scholar). WTIP transcripts are identified in kidney, lung, eye, and ovary. Consistent with overlapping tissue expression patterns between WT1 and WTIP, WT1 is required for normal retinal (23Wagner K.D. Wagner N. Vidal V.P. Schley G. Wilhelm D. Schedl A. Englert C. Scholz H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1398-1405Google Scholar) as well as genitourinary (11Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Google Scholar) development. WT1 mutations in humans are associated with pulmonary dysplasia and mesangial sclerosis (24Dharnidharka V.R. Ruteshouser E.C. Rosen S. Kozakewich H. Harris Jr., H.W. Herrin J.T. Huff V. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2001; 16: 227-231Google Scholar). In addition, WTIP is expressed in thyroid and salivary gland, tissues that, like kidney, undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition during ontogeny. By Northern analysis (Fig. 3A), WTIP is a 2.2- and 2.0-kb transcript in human and mouse kidney, respectively. Northern blots (Fig. 3A), reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 3B) and in situ hybridization (not shown) also show that undifferentiated and differentiated murine podocytes contain WTIP mRNA. We next evaluated WTIP expression during kidney development. WTIP mRNA is robustly expressed during mouse nephrogenesis in a temporal pattern similar to WT1 (Fig. 3C). Peak WTIP mRNA expression is at E16"
https://openalex.org/W2032571964,"Adenosylcobalamin-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the interconversion of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. In humans, deficiencies in the mutase lead to methylmalonic aciduria, a rare disease that is fatal in the first year of life. Such inherited deficiencies can result from mutations in the mutase structural gene or from mutations that impair the acquisition of cobalamins. Recently, a human gene of unknown function, MMAA, has been implicated in methylmalonic aciduria (Dobson, C. M., Wai, T., Leclerc, D., Wilson, A., Wu, X., Dore, C., Hudson, T., Rosenblatt, D. S., and Gravel, R. A. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 15554–15559). MMAA orthologs are widespread in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. In Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, a mutant defective in the MMAA homolog meaB was unable to grow on C1 and C2 compounds because of the inability to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (Korotkova N., Chistoserdova, L., Kuksa, V., and Lidstrom, M. E. (2002) J. Bacteriol. 184, 1750–1758). Here we demonstrate that this defect is not due to the absence of adenosylcobalamin but due to an inactive form of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. The presence of active mutase in double mutants defective in MeaB and in the synthesis of either R-methylmalonyl-CoA or adenosylcobalamin indicates that MeaB is necessary for protection of mutase from inactivation during catalysis. MeaB and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from M. extorquens were cloned and purified in their active forms. We demonstrated that MeaB forms a complex with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and stimulates in vitro mutase activity. These results support the hypothesis that MeaB functions to protect methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from irreversible inactivation. Adenosylcobalamin-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the interconversion of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA.

Coenzyme B12 (5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin) (AdoCbl) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; MCM, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; Cbl, cobalamin; CNCbl, cyanocobalamin; Tc, tetracycline; Km, kanamycin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. serves as a cofactor for radical-based isomerization reactions (1Halpern J. Science. 1985; 227: 869-975Google Scholar). Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM), isobutyryl-CoA mutase, B12-dependent amino mutases, α-methyleneglutarate mutase, and diol dehydratase are members of this family of enzymes (2Zagalak B. Retey J. Eur.

Harding S.E. Leadlay F. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 353-358Google Scholar), Streptomyces cinnamonensis (8Birch A. Leiser A. Robinson J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3511-3519Google Scholar), Escherichia coli (9Haller T. Buckel T. Retey J. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4622-4629Google Scholar), humans (10Jansen R. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. Ledley F. Genomics. 1989; 4: 198-205Google Scholar), and mice (11Wilkemeyer M.F. Crane A.M. Ledley F.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 449-455Google Scholar) have been cloned and sequenced. The P. shermanii and S. cinnamonensis MCM contain two homologous but non-identical subunits: α-subunit (∼79 kDa) and β-subunit (∼65 kDa) (7Marsh E.N. Harding S.E. Leadlay F. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 353-358Google Scholar, 8Birch A. Leiser A. Robinson J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3511-3519Google Scholar). The human (10Jansen R. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. Ledley F.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4622-4629Google Scholar) enzymes are homodimers. Crystal structures of P. shermanii MCM were determined (12Manica F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bosecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Google Scholar, 13Manica F. Evans P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 711-720Google Scholar) that revealed that both α and β subunits consist of two principal domains: an eight-stranded α/β triose phosphate isomerase barrel (α/β)8 and a flavodoxin-like AdoCbl-binding fold. The cofactor is sandwiched between the (α/β)8 barrel and the flavodoxin-like AdoCbl-binding fold (12Manica F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bosecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Google Scholar). The enzyme has a broad distribution among living organisms and has been found in both bacterial and animal cells (14Banerjee R. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 175-186Google Scholar). MCM plays an essential role in the conversion of propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In higher animals, MCM is involved in the breakdown of the amino acids valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine as well as thymine, cholesterol, and odd-chain fatty acids (15Banerjee R. Chowdhury S. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., NY1999: 707-730Google Scholar, 16Kamoun P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 175Google Scholar). In Streptomyces, the enzyme is involved in polyketide biosynthesis (17Donadio S. Staver M.J. McAlpine J.B. Swanson S.J. Katz L.J. Science. 1991; 252: 675-679Google Scholar). In the methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens, MCM is part of the glyoxylate regeneration pathway, an essential element of methylotrophic metabolism (18Korotkova N. Chistoserdova L. Kuksa V. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1750-1758Google Scholar). In humans, inherited defects that impair the activity of MCM lead to methylmalonic aciduria. Such a disorder can result from mutations in the gene encoding MCM or from mutations that impair the assimilation of cobalamins (Cbl) into the MCM cofactor, AdoCbl (19Fenton W.A. Gravel R.A. Rosenblatt D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease.

A newly described gene, MMAA, involved in conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA has recently been identified in humans (21Dobson C.M. Wai T. Leclerc D. Wilson A. Wu X. Dore C. Hudson T. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15554-15559Google Scholar). A mutation in MMAA causes a disorder classically associated with vitamin B12-responsive methylmalonic aciduria (22Matsui S.M. Mahoney M.J. Rosenberg L.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 308: 857-861Google Scholar). Fibroblast cultures from patients with this kind of disorder show decreased propionate incorporation into cellular protein and reduced synthesis of AdoCbl, but they show a normal concentration of methylcobalamin (23Watkins D. Matiaszuk N. Rosenblatt D.S. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 510-513Google Scholar). A role of MMAA in the transport of vitamin B12 into mitochondrion has been proposed (21Dobson C.M. Wai T. Leclerc D. Wilson A. Wu X. Dore C. Hudson T. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15554-15559Google Scholar). M. extorquens AM1 contains a homolog of MMAA, called meaB (18Korotkova N. Chistoserdova L. Kuksa V. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1750-1758Google Scholar). This bacterium synthesizes AdoCbl de novo and utilizes AdoCbl as the cofactor for two enzymes, MCM and MeaA, a mutase involved in the conversion of butyryl-CoA to propionyl-CoA (18Korotkova N. Chistoserdova L. Kuksa V. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1750-1758Google Scholar, 24Smith L.M. Meijer W.G. Dijkhuizen L. Goodwin P.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 675-684Google Scholar). Mutation in meaB has no effect on the function of MeaA, suggesting that meaB is not involved in AdoCbl biosynthesis in this organism (18Korotkova N. Chistoserdova L. Kuksa V. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1750-1758Google Scholar). MeaB contains a consensus-binding sequence for GTP/ATP, based on analysis with the COG program (18Korotkova N. Chistoserdova L. Kuksa V. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1750-1758Google Scholar). Orthologs of meaB are present in many archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic genomes for which sequences are available. In most cases, meaB orthologs are located in close proximity to genes encoding orthologs of propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, and MCM (9Haller T. Buckel T. Retey J. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4622-4629Google Scholar, 25Bobik T.A. Rasche M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37194-37198Google Scholar). Other B12-dependent enzymes (glycerol and diol dehydratase) undergo suicide inactivation by the substrate during catalysis (6Kajiura H. Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36514-36519Google Scholar, 26Seifert C. Bowien S. Gottschalk G. Daniel R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2369-2378Google Scholar, 27Toraya T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 106-127Google Scholar). The inactivation involves irreversible cleavage of the Co-C bond of AdoCbl, forming 5′-deoxyadenosine and an alkylcobalamin-like species (27Toraya T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 106-127Google Scholar). The modified coenzyme remains tightly bound to the enzyme and is not exchangeable with free intact cofactor. The inactivated enzyme is reactivated by exchange of the modified coenzyme for intact AdoCbl in the presence of a chaperone-like protein (reactivase) and ATP (6Kajiura H. Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36514-36519Google Scholar). The reactivation takes place in two steps: ADP-dependent cobalamin release and ATP-dependent dissociation of the apoenzyme-reactivating factor complex (6Kajiura H. Mori K. Tobimatsu T. Toraya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36514-36519Google Scholar). Although reactivases have not been reported for any MCMs, the MCM of P. shermanii has been shown to be subject to inactivation during turnover under aerobic conditions. The inactivation occurred at a much slower rate than glycerol and diol dehydratases, with a half-life for inactivation of ∼170 min (28Thoma N.H. Evans P.P. Leadlay P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9213-9221Google Scholar). However, in the absence of substrate the enzyme was stable (28Thoma N.H. Evans P.P. Leadlay P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9213-9221Google Scholar). These precedents suggested that MeaB might play a role in protection or reactivation of MCM. In this report, we provide evidence that MeaB does not function as a reactivase but is involved in protection of the MCM from suicide inactivation, possibly by a stabilization function. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—E. coli JM109 (Promega), Top 10 (Invitrogen), S17–1 (29Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Puhler A. Molecular Genetics of Bacteria-Plant Interactions. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1983: 98-106Google Scholar), and BL21 DE3 (Novagen) used in this study were grown in Luria Bertani medium in the presence of appropriate antibiotics as described by Maniatis et al. (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y1982Google Scholar). M. extorquens AM1 and Burkholderia fungorum LB400 were grown in the minimal medium described previously (31Harder W. Attwood M. Quayle J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1973; 78: 155-163Google Scholar, 32Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1062-1067Google Scholar). Succinate (20 mm), methanol (100 mm), ethylamine (20 mm), propionate (10 mm), or citrate (20 mm) was used as the substrate. The following antibiotic concentrations were used for M. extorquens and B. fungorum: tetracycline (Tc), 10 μg ml-1, and kanamycin (Km), 100 μg ml-1. 50 μg ml-1 of rifamycin was used for M. extorquens and 10 μgml-1 of chloramphenicol was used for B. fungorum. The growth responses of mutants were tested on plates containing the substrates listed above in the presence or absence of supplements of glyoxylate (5 mm). The following cloning vectors were used: pCM184 (32Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1062-1067Google Scholar) as an allelic exchange vector with a loxP-flanked antibiotic resistance cassette, pCM157 (32Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1062-1067Google Scholar) for cre expression, pRK2013 (33Ditta G. Schmidhauser T. Yakobson F. Liang P. Lu X. Finlay D. Guiney D. Helinski D. Plasmid. 1985; 13: 149-153Google Scholar) as a helper plasmid, pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) for cloning PCR-generated fragments, and pET21d, pET22b (Novagen) for high-level protein expression in E. coli. DNA Manipulations—Plasmid isolation, E. coli transformation, and restriction enzyme digestion or ligation was carried out as described by Maniatis et al. (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y1982Google Scholar). The chromosomal DNA of M. extorquens AM1 was isolated with the procedure of Saito and Miura (34Saito H. Miura K.-I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 619-629Google Scholar). DNA Sequencing—DNA sequencing from both strands was carried out with an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer by the Department of Biochemistry Sequencing Facility at the University of Washington. Computer Analysis—Translations and analyses of DNA and DNA-derived polypeptide sequences were carried out using Genetic Computer Group (Wisconsin) and ORF Finder (NCBI) programs (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Mutant Generation—Insertion mutations in meaD (AY388648), meaB (AAL86727.1), epm (AY183758), and mcmC (ZP00031472.1) were generated in vitro using pCM184 with a Kmr gene cartridge as described earlier (32Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1062-1067Google Scholar). Tcs colonies were chosen as potential double-crossover recombinants, whereas Tcr colonies were assumed to be single-crossover recombinants. The identity of the double-crossover mutants was confirmed by diagnostic PCR. The plasmid pCM157 was introduced by conjugation into ΔmeaD::kan and Δepm::kan mutants using the helper plasmid pRK2073. Tcr strains were streaked for purity until the resulting strain produced only Kms colonies. pCM157 was removed from the strains by several transfers on medium lacking Tc. The deletion of the Km cassette from ΔmeaD and Δepm mutants was confirmed by diagnostic PCR. Unmarked ΔmeaD and Δepm strains were used to generate ΔmeaDΔmeaB::kan and ΔepmΔmeaB::kan mutants in vitro using pCM184 with a Kmr gene cartridge as described (32Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1062-1067Google Scholar). Matings—Triparental or biparental matings between E. coli and M. extorquens AM1 or B. fungorum LB400 were performed overnight on nutrient agar at 30 °C. Cells were then washed with sterile minimal medium and plated on selective minimal medium at appropriate dilutions. In triparental matings, pRK2013 (33Ditta G. Schmidhauser T. Yakobson F. Liang P. Lu X. Finlay D. Guiney D. Helinski D. Plasmid. 1985; 13: 149-153Google Scholar) was used as a helper plasmid. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Proteins—The genes encoding meaB, mcmA, and mcmB were PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA isolated from M. extorquens AM1. Oligonucleotides containing the first and last 24 bases of each gene and restriction endonuclease sites at their 5′-ends were used as primers. After restriction with NcoI and XhoI, the meaB product was cloned into the pET21d vector (Novagen) in the 5′-NcoI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites. The PCR product containing mcmB was restricted with NdeI and SalI and cloned into pET22b (5′-NdeI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites), generating pNK11. To express the native form of MCM, the following strategy was used. The mcmB gene with the T7 promoter was PCR-amplified from pNK11 with the following primer pair: 5′-gcatgctcgatcccgcgaaattaatacgac-3′ and 5′-ggatcctcatcagcccttcgcgcgctcggc-3′. The PCR product was restricted with SphI and BamHI and then ligated to the pET21d vector that had been restricted with SphI and BglII to produce pNK12. The mcmA gene was PCR-amplified from chromosomal M. extorquens AM1 DNA and cloned into pNK12 that had been restricted with NheI and NotI to produce pNK13. pNK13 contains mcmA and mcmB, each transcribed by a separate T7 promoter. All plasmids were transformed into the expression strain E. coli BL21 DE3. One isolate obtained from each transformation was used for expression. The expression strains were grown on Luria Bertani supplemented with appropriate antibiotic at 37 °C with shaking. Cells were grown to 0.4–0.7 A at 600 nm. Then expression of the target protein was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cultures were incubated for an additional 4–6 h at 30 °C for MeaB and 22 °C for MCM. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.2, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), broken using a French pressure cell at 1.2 × 108 Pa, and centrifuged for 30 min at ∼15,000 × g. Supernatant was applied to a 3-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), washed with wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.2, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and eluted with elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.2, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The purified proteins were concentrated, exchanged into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, and 15% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at -70 °C. Enzyme Assays—Enzyme activities were determined in M. extorquens AM1 and B. fungorum LB400 crude extracts obtained by passing cells through a French pressure cell at 1.2 × 108 Pa, followed by centrifugation for 20 min at ∼15,000 × g. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity was determined by two methods: a radiolabel-based assay (35Kolhouse J.F. Allen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 921-925Google Scholar) was used to monitor the MCM activity in the mutants, and an HPLC method (36Bobik T.A. Rasche M.E. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 375: 344-349Google Scholar) was used to characterize the MCM activity of purified proteins. To test for the presence of AdoCbl in cell extracts of the mutants and the wild type, 0.1 μm apoMCM was added to the reaction mixture, and MCM activity was monitored by the radiolabeling assay. Addition of half this amount of apoMCM to the wild type extract resulted in the same activity as the full amount, suggesting that the apoMCM was saturating under these conditions. Therefore, the MCM activity in this assay was a measure of relative AdoCbl levels in the cell extracts tested, able to assess decreased AdoCbl. ApoMCM (0.2 unit specific activity) was a gift from M. Rasche, University of Florida (36Bobik T.A. Rasche M.E. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 375: 344-349Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric methods (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) were used for protein determination. GTPase Activity—The reaction was performed at 25 °C for the indicated time periods in a reaction mixture containing (in a final volume of 25 μl): MeaB, 40 μg; GTP, 5 mm; [α-32P]GTP, 1 μCi; MgCl2, 5 mm; KCl, 38.5 mm; and potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 50 mm. The reaction was terminated by addition of ethanol (25 μl), and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. The products formed via the hydrolysis of GTP by MeaB were analyzed by TLC on a poly(ethyleneimine)cellulose F plate (Merck) with 1 m KH2PO4, pH 4.5, as a solvent system. The plates were dried and exposed to x-ray film, and then radioactive spots were cut out. Radioactive counting was done in a liquid-scintillation counter (Beckman LS 3801, Irvine, CA). The chromatographic positions of GTP and GDP were verified with standards by localization of UV absorbing areas. PAGE—To analyze complex formation between MeaB and MCM, the MCM·AdoCbl and the MCM·CNCbl complexes were prepared by incubation of 12 μg of apoenzyme with 50 μm AdoCbl or CNCbl, respectively, at 4 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.05 mm methylmalonyl-CoA. After 30 min of incubation, 12 μg of MeaB was added to a subset of samples and the mixture incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. As appropriate, these were further incubated with either GTP, GDP, or ATP (all at 5 mm) for 5 min. The mixtures were subjected to PAGE under non-denaturing condition in a 4–20% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) over 12 h as described by Davis (38Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Google Scholar). PAGE was performed under denaturing conditions as described by Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-695Google Scholar). Binding of GTP by MeaB—Purified MeaB (12 μg) was incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) and 5 mm MgCl2, in the presence of 30 μCi [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 25 °C. An aliquot was subjected to electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions. After the gel was dried on 3 MM paper, radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. UV-visible Spectroscopic Experiments—Spectral changes were monitored using a spectrophotometer (model UV-2401PC; Shimadzu). The experiments were performed using 10 μm of MCM in the presence and the absence of MeaB (10 μm) and methylmalonyl-CoA (400 μm). All experiments were carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, and 10% v/v glycerol at 25 °C. Size-exclusion Chromatography—To conduct sizing experiments, 0.2 mg of MeaB was loaded on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was calibrated using β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa) as standards. A MeaB Homolog Is Involved in the MCM Reaction in B. fungorum as a Domain of MCM—The available bacterial genomes were tested for correlation in gene arrangement via BLAST with MCM from P. shermanii (GenBank™ accession no. X14965.1) and MeaB from M. extorquens (GenBank™ accession no. X14965.1) and in some bacteria (Ralstonia solanacearum, (CAD13765.1); R. metallidurans, (ZP_00025985.1); B. fungorum, (ZP_00031472.1); Thermobifida fusca, (ZP_ 00058199.1); Geobacter metallireducens, (ZP_00079397.1); Leptospira interrogans serovar lai str., (AAN50154.1); and Bacillus halodurans, (BAB075151)). MCM and MeaB queries both identified the same gene. This gene was designated mcmC, and its translated polypeptide has 1080–1272 amino acid residues. The N-terminal region of McmC, from approximately residue 1–130, showed high identity with the C-terminal domain of the MCM large subunit. A putative AdoCbl-binding sequence is present in this domain (40Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of McmC, from approximately residue 540-end, shows identity to the N-terminal domain of the MCM large subunit. The McmC central region between ∼140–500 amino acid residues aligns with the complete MeaB (AAL86721.1). These results suggested that McmC is a fusion protein containing both MCM and MeaB domains. To clarify mcmC function in one of these strains, a mcmC::kan B. fungorum mutant was generated using a cre-lox mutation system (32Marx C.J. Lidstrom M.E. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1062-1067Google Scholar). Mutation in mcmC had no effect on the growth of B. fungorum on citrate and succinate, but growth on propionate was altered. The mcmC mutant had a significantly longer growth lag (70 h) than wild type (30 h) on this substrate, although once growth began it was similar to the wild type. These data suggest that mcmC is involved in propionate metabolism in B. fungorum. The ability to form succinyl-CoA from methylmalonyl-CoA in crude extracts of the wild type and the mcmC mutant was determined using a radiolabeling method. Cell extracts of the mcmC mutant failed to form succinate. Under the same conditions the MCM activity of the B. fungorum wild type was 10–12 milliunits, suggesting that McmC encodes active MCM in B. fungorum. Genes that become fused into a single gene in an organism are likely to encode polypeptides that interact in other organisms (41Enright A.J. Iliopoulos I. Kyrpides N.C. Ouzounis C.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 86-90Google Scholar). The finding that MeaB is fused with MCM into one polypeptide in several bacteria implies that MeaB may bind MCM in the organisms in which these proteins are separated. MCM Activity in M. extorquens Mutants Defective in MeaB and MeaD—In previous studies we demonstrated that M. extorquens AM1 mutants in meaB and meaD grew normally on succinate but lost the ability to grow on C1 and C2 compounds (18Korotkova N. Chistoserdova L. Kuksa V. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1750-1758Google Scholar, 42Marx C.J. O'Brien B.N. Breezee J. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 669-673Google Scholar). The meaB mutant failed to form succinyl-CoA from methylmalonyl-CoA, intermediates of the glyoxylate regeneration pathway of M. extorquens AM1 (18Korotkova N. Chistoserdova L. Kuksa V. Lidstrom M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1750-1758Google Scholar). A meaD mutant had a similar phenotype, in that it could only grow on C1 and C2 compounds in the presence of glyoxylate. Thus, the mutant showed a phenotype characteristic of mutants defective in glyoxylate regeneration, and the possibility was explored that it might function together with MeaB. However, MeaD was found to have homology (38% identity) to ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase from humans (20Leal N.A. Park S.D. Kima P.E. Bobik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9227-9234Google Scholar, 43Dobson C.M. Wai T. Leclerc D. Kadir H. Narang M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Hudson T. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3361-3369Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein might be involved in AdoCbl synthesis. MCM activity was studied in M. extorquens AM1 wild type and meaB and meaD mutants with different assay conditions. No MCM activity was detected in extracts of meaD and meaB mutants when AdoCbl was omitted from the reaction mixture (Table I). Under the same conditions, the activity of MCM in the wild type was 1–2 milliunits. When 50 μm AdoCbl was added to the reaction mixture, wild type MCM activity increased almost an order of magnitude, indicating that most of the MCM in M. extorquens AM1 extract was present in the apoenzyme form. This result is consistent with an observation that only 5–13% of total MCM occurred in the holoenzyme form after MCM purification from M. extorquens NR-1 (44Miyamoto E. Watanabe F. Yamaji R. Inui H. Sato K. Nakano Y. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 2002; 48: 242-246Google Scholar). Activity similar to the wild type was detected in the meaD mutant (7–12 milliunits) in the presence of AdoCbl, but activity was not detectable in the meaB mutant, suggesting it was below 0.1 milliunits, the level of detection (Table I). These results further supported the suggestion that MeaD is involved in cofactor biosynthesis for MCM in M. extorquens.Table IActivity of MCM (milliunits) and AdoCbl concentration (% of wild type) in extracts of succinate-grown M. extorquens AM1 and mutants 50 μm or no AdoCbl were added to extracts of the mutants and wild type. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) in the dark. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity was determined by radiolabel-based assay (35Kolhouse J.F. Allen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 921-925Google Scholar).

In this study we explore an alternative approach, that of inducing intracellular immunity using designed, zinc finger-based transcription factors. Three transcriptional repression proteins were engineered to bind sites in the HIV-1 promoter that were expected to be both accessible in chromatin structure and highly conserved in sequence structure among the various HIV-1 subgroups. Transient transfection assays identified one factor, KRAB-HLTR3, as being able to achieve 100-fold repression of an HIV-1 promoter. Specificity of repression was demonstrated by the lack of repression of other promoters. This factor was further shown to repress the replication of several HIV-1 viral strains 10- to 100-fold in T-cell lines and primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Repression was observed for at least 18 days with no significant cytotoxicity. Stable T-cell lines expressing the factor also do not show obvious signs of cytotoxicity. These characteristics present KRAB-HLTR3 as an attractive candidate for development in an intracellular immunization strategy for anti-HIV-1 therapy.

Clifford Lane H. Aids. 1999; 13: S25-S38PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Although the antiviral effects of HAART therapy are often immediate and profound, virus is not eliminated, and one or more reservoirs of latently infected cells persist even in patients that show no detectable viral load for sustained periods during treatment (2Pierson T. Hoffman T.L. Blankson J. Finzi D. Chadwick K. Margolick J.B. Buck C. Siliciano J.D. Doms R.W. Siliciano R.F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7824-7833Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Schrager L.K. D'Souza M.P. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1998; 280: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Typically, virus replication rebounds rapidly after drug withdrawal, making HAART therapy a life-long treatment. These results underscore the importance of developing adjunct strategies of retarding viral entry and/or inhibiting of viral replication. One potential strategy involves the genetic modification of cells to endow them with viral resistance via gene delivery. If the primary target cells of HIV-1 can be genetically engineered to express antiviral genes continuously and without toxicity, such cells might escape virus destruction, immune impairment, and preferentially expand in vivo. In particular, intracellular “immunization” of CD34 stem cells and/or CD4 T cells with antiviral genes might lead to long term reconstitution of the immune system in individuals with protease inhibitor resistant viruses or adverse drug reactions. Inhibition of viral transcription has long been recognized as an important goal in HIV-1 therapy. This was the driving force behind the development of antisense oligonucleotides for HIV-1 therapy (4Stein C.A. Cheng Y.C. Science. 1993; 261: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar).

The anti-RNA approaches are most successful when they target essential transcripts or gene products that are produced at a low level. Often their function in intracellular immunization strategies is very dependent on achieving high levels of intracellular expression. This is in contrast to control at the transcriptional level, which presents the advantage that only a single DNA site needs to be occupied as compared with targeting the many RNA messages that might be produced from a single gene. As with any approach that attempts specific inhibition in HIV-1, the mutation rate and genetic diversity found in vivo presents formidable obstacles. Despite this, there are regions within the HIV-1 genome that are conserved over all clades and provide suitable targets for the exploration of this approach. Our approach is based on the recognition of the structural features unique to the Cys2-His2 class of nucleic acid-binding, zinc finger proteins. To create a universal system for the control of gene expression, we have studied methods for the construction of novel polydactyl zinc finger proteins that recognize extended DNA sequences and have described the generation of zinc finger domains recognizing sequences of the 5′-(G/A)NN-3′ subset of a 64-member zinc finger alphabet (12Dreier B.

These domains can be used as modular building blocks for the construction of polydactyl proteins specifically recognizing 9- or 18-bp sequences. Methods for the rapid construction of polydactyl proteins have been developed that, together with this predefined set of zinc finger domains, provides ready access to over a billion novel proteins that bind the 5′-(G/ANN)6-3′ family of 18-bp DNA sites (12Dreier B.

Appending effector domains, such as the activation domain VP16 (17Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M.

Such regulation has been demonstrated in human, mouse, rat, monkey, Arabidopsis, and tobacco cells as wells as in transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco plants (23Stege J.T. Guan X. Ho T. Beachy R.N.

Furthermore, temporal control of expression can be achieved via chemical control of gene expression imparted by appending ligand-binding domains derived from human steroid-hormone receptors (25Beerli R.R.

As an alternative to designing and testing individual transcription factors, combinatorial libraries of designed transcription factors have been recently used to select effective transcriptional regulators in the absence of detailed chromatin accessibility information and to identify novel gene regulatory pathways (26Blancafort P. Magnenat L. Barbas III, C.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we used our recently developed methodologies to prepare optimized transcriptional regulators designed to present transcriptional blockades to the HIV-1 lifecycle. Our work extends a recent study by Reynolds and co-workers (27Reynolds L. Ullman C. Moore M. Isalan M. West M.J. Clapham P. Klug A. Choo Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) in which they observed repression of HIV-1 replication by an engineered zinc-finger transcription factor. These findings strongly support a transcription factor-based approach to intracellular immunization of CD34 stem cells and/or CD4 T cells (28Wu H. Yang W.-P. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Construction of Custom DNA-binding Proteins—DNA-binding proteins containing six zinc finger domains were assembled onto an Sp1C zinc finger scaffold (29Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Briefly, overlapping PCR primers were designed to encode zinc finger domains that had been previously modified to bind unique 3-bp sites. Three-finger proteins were assembled by overlap PCR then assembled into six-finger proteins by AgeI/XmaI ligation. For in vitro characterization, the constructs were cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs). Fusions with the maltose-binding protein were expressed and purified using the Protein Fusion and Purification System (New England Biolabs). Multitarget ELISA specificity assays and electrophoretic mobility shift affinity assays were performed as described previously (14Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Transient Transfection Assays—Effector plasmids containing the KRAB and SID effector domains have been described previously (15Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Effector plasmids consisted of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing the gene for a C-terminal designed six-finger protein cloned in-frame with an N-terminal effector domain. All constructs also encoded a nuclear localization signal from SV40 large T antigen (PKKKRKV) between the effector and zinc finger domains, as well as a C-terminal epitope tag from influenza hemagglutinin (HA tag, YPYDVPDYAS). GenBank™ accession numbers for KRAB-HLTR1, KRAB-HLTR3, and KRAB-HLTR6 transcription factors are AY518586, AY518587, and AY518588, respectively. Reporter plasmids were based on pGL3-control (Promega) and contained a luciferase gene under control of the SV40 promoter (pGL3-control), the erbB-2 promoter (erbB-2 (–758 to –1) (15Beerli R.R.

The HIV-1 HXB2 LTR was amplified by PCR from the plasmid pIIIenv3–1 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research & Reference Reagent Program, NARRRP (30Sodroski J. Goh W.C. Rosen C. Campbell K. Haseftine W.A.

The LTR fragment was cloned between the BglII/NcoI sites of pGL3-control. The plasmid pSV2tat72 (NARRRP (31Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar)) was included in all experiments as a source of TAT protein. For all transfections, HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were used at a confluency of 40–60%. Typically, cells were transfected with 100 ng each of effector and reporter plasmid and 50 ng of pSV2tat72 per well in a 24-well dish by using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cell extracts were prepared ∼48 h after transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured with corresponding assay reagent kits (Promega) in a MicroLumat LB96P luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). Luciferase activity was normalized to total extract protein. For determination of protein expression, ∼2 × 106 HeLa cells were plated onto 10-cm plates and transfected with 2 μg of zinc finger protein expression plasmid. Cell extract was prepared by the addition of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay, and 50 μg of cell extract was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was probed with an anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science), then stripped and reprobed with an anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) as a loading control. Relative zinc finger protein expression was determined using ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics). Inhibition of transiently transfected, plasmid-based HIV expression was examined using 293T cells (ATCC) at a confluency of 50–60%. Cells were co-transfected with 500 ng each of HIV-1 plasmid (pNL4–3 (32Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or pYK-JRCSF (33Koyanagi Y. Miles S. Mitsuyasu R.T. Merrill J.E. Vinters H.V. Chen I.S.Y.

Medium was changed at 24 h post-transfection, and p24 antigen was measured in the supernatant at 48 h post-transfection. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured with corresponding assay reagent kits (Promega) in a Labsystems luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized to total extract protein. Generation of Stable PM1 Cell Clones—pMAL-HLTR3 was digested with SfiI, and the HLTR3 zinc finger gene was cloned between the two SfiI sites of pMX-KRAB-E2C-IRES-GFP (19Beerli R.R. Dreier B. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1495-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), replacing the E2C zinc finger gene. This retroviral vector expresses a single bicistronic message for the translation of the zinc finger protein and, from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The vector additionally appends an HA-tag to the C-terminal of the zinc finger gene. pMX-KRAB-HLTR3-IRES-GFP and pMD-G, a plasmid expressing the envelope glycoprotein G of the vesicular stomatitis virus (kindly provided by Inder Verma, the Salk Institute (34Zufferey R. Nagy D. Mandel R.J. Naldini L. Trono D. Nat.

After 48 h of incubation, culture supernatants were used for infection of PM1 cells (NARRRP (35Lusso P. Cocchi F. Balotta C. Markham P.D. Louie A. Farci P. Pal R. Gallo R.C. Reitz Jr., M.S. J.

These cells are permissive for growth of macrophage and T-cell tropic viruses. Cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Expression levels of KRAB-HLTR3 was determined by Western analysis on 100 μg of total soluble cell protein using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) with a mouse anti-HA primary antibody (Roche Applied Science) and a goat anti-mouse-IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody conjugate (Sigma). HIV-1 Challenge of Stable T-cell Clones—Stocks for the murine heat-stable antigen-expressing (HSA-expressing), CCR5-tropic HIV-1 reporter virus, NFN-SX-HSAS (36Steinberger P. Andris-Widhopf J.

Viral supernatants were stored at –80 °C. The p24 value of the virus stock was 2649 ng/ml. 5 × 105 PM1 T-cells were exposed to NFN-SX-HSAS (140 μl) for 3 h at 37 °C, washed three times, and then cultured in 3 ml RPMI (10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, and 1% HEPES). HIV-1 infection was determined by flow cytometry analysis on cells isolated from culture on days 2, 4, 9, and 13 post-infection. Cells were stained with rat anti-mouse CD24 (heat-stable antigen) antibody labeled with R-phycoerythrin (BD Pharmingen). Rat IgG2k labeled with R-phycoerythrin was used as an isotype control. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde prior to flow cytometry analysis. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems) and analysis replied on the Cell Quest Software program. Supernatant obtained on days 2, 4, and 9 post-infection were also assessed for the presence of p24. Culture medium containing infected cells was pelleted at 2000 rpm for 2 min. 50 μl of cell-free supernatant was added to 450 μl of p24 sample buffer for the p24 assay. Quantification of HIV-1 p24 protein production was performed using the antigen capture ELISA test (Coulter Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Construction of pSIN-KRAB-HLTR3—To clone pSIN-KRAB-HLTR3, the DNA sequence for KRAB-HLTR3 was amplified by PCR from the pcDNA KRAB-HLTR3 plasmid, using the primers 5′-atcgcttagggatccgctagcatggatgctaagtca-3′ and 5′-atcgcttaggtcgacaagctttcaagaagcgtagtc-3′, which contain restriction sites for BamHI (5′) and SalI (3′). The PCR product was purified and digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into BamHI/SalI-digested pRRLPGK-GFP SIN-18 (36Steinberger P. Andris-Widhopf J. Buhler B. Torbett B.E. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), so that the KRAB-HLTR3 sequence replaced the GFP gene. The final plasmid was sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced during PCR. Lentiviral Vector Production and Titration—The HIV-derived packaging construct pCMVdeltaR8.91 encodes the HIV-1 gag and pol precursors as well as the regulatory proteins tat and rev (kindly provided by Inder Verma, the Salk Institute) (33Koyanagi Y. Miles S. Mitsuyasu R.T. Merrill J.E. Vinters H.V. Chen I.S.Y. Science. 1987; 236: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Pseudotyped lentiviruses were produced by transient calcium phosphate co-transfection of 293T cells with pCMVdeltaR8.91, pMD-G, and the zinc finger-expressing lentiviral transfer vector pSIN-ZF. Viral supernatants were harvested 48–60 h after transfection, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 culture medium. Viral titers were determined from the p24 antigen. Preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from the fresh blood of healthy donors by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation. Non-adherent peripheral blood leukocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2. They were stimulated for 3 days with recombinant human interleukin-2 (20 IU/ml; Roche Applied Science) and phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml) and then cultured in the presence of human interleukin-2 (20 IU/ml). Lentiviral Transduction—Transductions of PM1 cells and PBMCs were performed in 48-well plates with addition of 5 μg/ml Polybrene. The cells were exposed to lentiviral concentrates at titers of 100 ng/ml p24 antigen concentration at a density of 5 × 105 cell/ml. After 6 h of transduction, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and further incubated in fresh tissue culture medium. The transduction protocol was repeated two more times in the following 48 h. HIV-1 Infection of PM1 Cells and PBMC—M-tropic (YK-CSF), T-tropic (NL4–3), and dual tropic (89.6) HIV-1 viruses (NARRRP (37Collman R. Balliet J.W. Gregory S.A. Friedman H. Kolson D.L. Nathanson N.

The m.o.i. values were determined in a separate experiment by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using pRRLPGK-GFP SIN-18. It was estimated that 1 ng of p24 corresponds to 2000–3000 transducing units as m.o.i. is a statistical function of the number of virus able to infect a population of cells (38Zufferey R. Dull T. Mandel R. Bukovsky A. Quiroz D. Naldini L. Trono D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9873-9880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As determined by trypan blue staining technique, the viability of cells was higher than 95%. Where indicated, fresh PBMCs were added at day 7 to rescue viable HIV particles. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the infected lymphocytes were washed once and resuspended in fresh medium. Cell culture supernatants were collected from the infected cells at various time points, and the concentration of the p24 protein was determined by ELISA (Innotest). Cell viability was determined using the Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science) according the manufacturer's instructions. The activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, an indicator of cell viability, was measured in 10,000 cells by the conversion of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 to the red dye formazan. Formazan accumulation is detected by increased absorbance at 440 nm. Target Site Selection in HIV-1—The 5′-LTR of HIV-1 contains the promoter for all viral transcripts (39Taube R. Fujinaga K.

DNA Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The primary transcript can be either packaged into new virus particles or spliced to create the mRNA for the viral gene products. The LTR consists of three regions, U3, R, and U5. The cis-acting regulatory elements of the promoter are contained in the U3 region, which can be further subdivided into the negative regulatory region (nucleotides 1–350 as numbered in the genome of strain HXB2), the enhancer (nucleotides 351–376), and the core promoter (nucleotides 377–454). An array of transcription factors has been shown to interact with the U3 region (reviewed in Ref. 42Pereira L.A. Bentley K. Peeters A. Churchill M.J. Deacon N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and variations in their binding sites have been implicated in modulating promoter strength and replication kinetics (43Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 44Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 139-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription initiates at the first nucleotide of the R region, and polyadenylation occurs immediately after the R in the 3′-LTR. The R region also codes for the transacting response element (TAR), a stem-loop structure found in all viral mRNAs to which the transactivator protein Tat will bind. U5 spans the region between R and the binding site for tRNALys, which is used during reverse transcription. In a systematic characterization, we previously defined the zinc finger domains that specifically bind to 3-bp sites of the 5′-(G/A)NN-3′ type (12Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Flippin J.D.

After searching 5′-LTR sequences around the promoter region for existence of 18 contiguous nucleotides that are targetable with our defined domains using a search program of our own design, 2D. J.

https://openalex.org/W2056741212,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptor is an allosteric complex made of two subunits, GABAB1 (GB1) and GABAB2 (GB2). Both subunits are composed of an extracellular Venus flytrap domain (VFT) and a heptahelical domain (HD). GB1 binds GABA, and GB2 plays a major role in G-protein activation as well as in the high agonist affinity state of GB1. How agonist affinity in GB1 is regulated in the receptor remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that GB2 VFT is a major molecular determinant involved in this control. We show that isolated versions of GB1 and GB2 VFTs in the absence of the HD and C-terminal tail can form hetero-oligomers as shown by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (based on HTRF technology). GB2 VFT and its association with GB1 VFT controlled agonist affinity in GB1 in two ways. First, GB2 VFT exerted a direct action on GB1 VFT, as it slightly increased agonist affinity in isolated GB1 VFT. Second and most importantly, GB2 VFT prevented inhibitory interaction between the two main domains (VFT and HD) of GB1. According to this model, we propose that GB1 HD prevents the possible natural closure of GB1 VFT. In contrast, GB2 VFT facilitates this closure. Finally, such inhibitory contacts between HD and VFT in GB1 could be similar to those important to maintain the inactive state of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2117070143,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory cytokine, has been shown to play a role in wound-healing processes. In this study, we investigated whether protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 and PAR-2 mediated MIF expression in human endothelial cells. Thrombin, factor Xa (FXa), and trypsin induced MIF expression in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, but other proteases, including kallikrein and urokinase, failed to do so. Thrombin-induced MIF mRNA expression was significantly reduced by the thrombin-specific inhibitor hirudin. Thrombin receptor activation peptide-6, a synthetic PAR-1 peptide, induced MIF mRNA expression, suggesting that PAR-1 mediates MIF expression in response to thrombin. The effects of FXa were blocked by antithrombin III, but not by hirudin, indicating that FXa might enhance MIF production directly rather than via thrombin stimulation. The synthetic PAR-2 peptide SLIGRL-NH2 induced MIF mRNA expression, showing that PAR-2 mediated MIF expression in response to FXa. Concerning the signal transduction, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (PD98089) and a nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor (SN50) suppressed the up-regulation of MIF mRNA in response to thrombin, FXa, and PAR-2 agonist stimulation, whereas a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) had little effect. These facts indicate that up-regulation of MIF by thrombin or FXa is regulated by p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathways and NF-κB-dependent pathways. Moreover, we found that PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA expression in endothelial cells was enhanced by MIF. Furthermore, we examined the inflammatory response induced by PAR-1 and PAR-2 agonists injected into the mouse footpad. As shown by footpad thickness, an indicator of inflammation, MIF-deficient mice (C57BL/6) were much less sensitive to either PAR-1 or PAR-2 agonists than wild-type mice. Taken together, these results suggest that MIF contributes to the inflammatory phase of the wound healing process in concert with thrombin and FXa via PAR-1 and PAR-2.

Taken together, these results suggest that MIF contributes to the inflammatory phase of the wound healing process in concert with thrombin and FXa via PAR-1 and PAR-2. The mechanism of wound healing is complex, consisting of inflammation, granulation, and remodeling of the tissue (1Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Google Scholar). Several growth factors and cytokines alone or in combination play important roles during tissue repair and enhance normal wound healing. Activation of endothelial cells is recognized as one of the early and important events in inflammation accompanied by production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. During the inflammatory response, endothelial cells are exposed to bacterial products, proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FXa, factor Xa; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; HDMEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; ATIII, antithrombin III; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PAR, protease-activated receptor; TRAP, thrombin receptor activation peptide; WT, wild type; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FXa, factor Xa; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; HDMEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; ATIII, antithrombin III; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PAR, protease-activated receptor; TRAP, thrombin receptor activation peptide; WT, wild type; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. and extracellular proteases. These proteases, including thrombin and other serine proteases, are released from neutrophils, mononuclear cells, and mast cells (2Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Google Scholar). Thrombin is a serine protease that plays a central role in hemostasis after tissue injuries by converting soluble plasma fibrinogen into an insoluble fibrin clot and by promoting platelet aggregation (3Maraganore J.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 208-211Google Scholar). In addition to these procoagulant effects, thrombin plays a major role in inflammation and repair of injured tissues. The proinflammatory effects of thrombin include stimulation of plasma extravasations and edema, increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules that cause leukocyte adhesion and infiltration (4Kaplanski G. Fabrigoule M. Boulay V. Dinarello C.A. Bongrand P. Kaplanski S. Farnarier C. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5435-5441Google Scholar, 5Grandaliano G. Valente A.J. Abboud H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1737-1741Google Scholar), and release of proinflammatory cytokines by endothelial cells (6Colotta F. Sciacca F.L. Sironi M. Luini W. Rabiet M.J. Mantovani A. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 975-985Google Scholar, 7Marin V. Montero-Julian F.A. Gres S. Boulay V. Bongrand P. Farnarier C. Kaplanski G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3435-3442Google Scholar). Thrombin also stimulates proliferation of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells (8Grand R.J. Turnell A.S. Grabham P.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 353-368Google Scholar). Tissue factor-activated factor VIIa complex cleaves and activates factors IX and X into factors IXa and factor Xa (FXa), respectively, which lead to thrombin generation (5Grandaliano G. Valente A.J. Abboud H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1737-1741Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a procoagulant activator, FXa has been shown to elicit inflammatory responses in endothelial cells such as proinflammatory cytokine production (9Senden N.H. Jeunhomme T.M.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was the first lymphokine shown to prevent the migration of macrophages out of capillary tubes (14Bloom B.R. Bennett B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Google Scholar). Although it was long thought that MIF was expressed exclusively in activated T cells, an array of recent reports has indicated that MIF is ubiquitously expressed in various cells and that macrophages in particular are a major source of this protein (15Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1895-1902Google Scholar). It is of interest that MIF was reported as an anterior pituitary-derived hormone that could override the glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of inflammatory and immune responses (16Bernhagen J.

Donnelly T. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1995; 377: 68-71Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effects of thrombin and FXa on MIF expression using endothelial cells, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and investigated their signal transduction. Based on the results, we discuss the possibility that the coagulation proteases in concert with MIF could promote wound healing at the sites of injury. Materials—The following materials were obtained from commercial sources: HDMEC (Cryo HMVEC-Neo) and HUVEC were from Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc. (Walkersville, MD); human dermal fibroblasts were from Dainippon Seiyaku (Osaka, Japan); human thrombin, recombinant hirudin, trypsin, kallikrein, urokinase, concanavalin A and polymyxin B were from Sigma; antithrombin III (ATIII), purified human FXa, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98089, p38 inhibitor SB203580, and NF-κB inhibitor SN50 were from Calbiochem; selective PAR-1 agonist peptide, thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP)-6 (SFLLRN) (18Vassallo Jr., R.R. Kieber-Emmons T. Cichowski K. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6081-6085Google Scholar), TFLLR-NH2, and selective PAR-2 agonist peptide SLIGRL-NH2 were from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland); the scrambled control peptides FSLLR-NH2 (inactive on PAR-1) and LSIGRL-NH2 (inactive on PAR-2) were synthesized by solid-phase methods, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry and amino acid analyses. The Isogen RNA extraction kit was from Nippon Gene (Tokyo, Japan); Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Invitrogen; Taq DNA polymerase was from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Bio-Rad; the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit was from Pierce; nylon membranes were from Schleicher & Schüll; and Ficoll-Paque PLUS and protein A-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. MIF-deficient mice were established by targeted disruption of the MIF gene as described previously (19Honma N. Koseki H. Akasaka T. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Serizawa I. Akahori H. Osawa M. Mikayama T. Immunology. 2000; 100: 84-90Google Scholar), using a mouse strain bred onto a C57BL/6 background. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Japan Clea (Shizuoka, Japan) and maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions. Cell Culture—HDMEC and HUVEC were cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions in endothelial cell basal medium containing 3 mg/ml bovine brain extract, 10 μg/ml human epidermal growth factor, 1 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml Fungizone. The cells were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For stimulation experiments, cells of passages 4 through 5 were used at a density of 1 × 107 cells/10 ml. Before stimulation, the cells were washed and placed in serum-free culture medium. Human PBMCs were prepared from heparinized blood by Ficoll-Paque PLUS density gradient centrifugation. In brief, we collected a cell layer at the density of 1.077 ± 0.001 g/ml. The PBMC was washed three times with sterile PBS. PBMCs (1 × 107/10 ml) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 IU/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 30 μg/ml polymyxin B with use of 24-well plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The viability of these cells was >98%, as judged by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Effects of Various Signal Inhibitors on MIF Expression—To examine the signal transduction pathway of MIF, endothelial cells were stimulated with various inhibitors against molecules involved in the signal transduction pathway for 1 h at 37 °C before thrombin, FXa, or PAR-2 agonist peptide stimulation and incubated for 24 h. Assessment of Inflammation in Vivo—The selective PAR-1 agonist peptide TFLLR-NH2, the PAR-2 peptide SLIGRL-NH2, and control peptides (FSLLR-NH2, inactive on PAR-1, and LSIGRL-NH2, inactive on PAR-2) dissolved in physiological saline (each 100 μg/50 μl) were injected in the footpads of MIF-deficient and WT mice. Inflammation was determined by the increases in footpad thickness of MIF-deficient and WT mice measured hourly for 6 h with an engineer's micrometer. Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells using an Isogen extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (20 μg) was resuspended in Tris-EDTA (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), denatured, and electrophoresed on 1% agarose formaldehyde gel. The RNA was then transferred to nylon membranes and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Prehybridization was carried out in 0.75 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 50% formamide at 42 °C for 4 h. Then hybridization was performed in the same buffer containing 10% dextran sulfate, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and a radiolabeled probe at 42 °C for 20 h. The radiolabeled probe was prepared using human MIF cDNA as a template and labeled with a random primer labeling kit using [γ-32P]dCTP. The primers used for PAR-1 were CAGTTTGGGTCTGAATTGTGTCG (sense) and TGCACGAGCTTATGCTGCTGAC (antisense) and those for PAR2 were TGGATGAGTTTTCTGCATCTGTCC (sense) and CGTGATGTTCAGGGCAGGAATG (antisense). The membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC (16.7 mm NaCl and 16.7 mm sodium citrate) at 22 °C for 5 min, twice with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and twice with 2× SSC at 22 °C for 20 min before autoradiography. Quantitative densitometric analysis was performed using an MCID Image Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The density of the MIF band was normalized by the intensity of GAPDH. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Mouse ears from MIF-deficient and control (WT) C57BL/6 mice were surgically obtained, and total RNA was extracted with an Isogen RNA extraction kit. The reverse transcription of the RNA was carried out with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase using oligo-dT primer and subsequent amplification using TaqDNA polymerase. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 1 min using a thermal cycler (Model 480, ABI). MIF primers used were 5′-GTTTCTGTCGGAGCTCAC-3′ (55–72) (forward) and 5′-AGCGAAGGTGGAACCGTTCCA-3′ (215–236) (reverse). GAPDH was used as a positive control. Primers used were 5′-GAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3′ (6–28) (forward) and 5′-GTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGC-3′ (949–971) (reverse). After PCR, the amplified products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland). The protein concentrations of the cell homogenates were quantified using a Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit. Equal amounts of homogenates were dissolved in 20 μl of Tris-HCL, 50 mm, pH 6.8, containing 2-mercaptoethanol (1%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (2%), glycerol (20%), and bromphenol blue (0.04%), and the samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 1% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), probed with anti-MIF antibodies and reacted with goat anti-rabbit IgG Ab coupled with horseradish peroxidase. The resultant complexes were processed for the detection system according to the manufacturer's protocol. ELISA for MIF—The ELISA was performed as described previously (20Shimizu T. Abe R. Ohkawara A. Mizue Y. Nishihira J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 173-178Google Scholar). In brief, the anti-human MIF antibody was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and left for 1 h at room temperature. Before addition of the antibody, all wells had been filled with PBS containing bovine serum albumin (1%) for blocking and left for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then added in duplicate to individual wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the plate was washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (washing buffer), samples were again added in duplicate to individual wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the plate was washed three times, 50 μl of biotin-conjugated anti-human MIF antibody (IgG fraction) was added to each well. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plate was again washed three times with washing buffer. Then, avidin-conjugated HRP was added to individual wells, followed by addition of the IgG antibody and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Fifty microliters of substrate containing o-phenylenediamine and hydrogen peroxide in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, was added to each well. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 492 nm was measured using an ELISA plate reader (Model 3550; Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—Data in the figures are presented as the mean ± S.E. of one representative experiment. Differences between the various treatments were tested by Student's t test and were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Induction of MIF mRNA by Thrombin—Thrombin induced increases in MIF mRNA levels in HDMEC, HUVEC, fibroblasts and PBMCs (Fig. 1A). HDMEC, HUVEC and PBMCs had strong MIF mRNA expression compared with fibroblasts. Incubation of HDMEC with thrombin (0 to 100 nm) induced a dose-dependent increase in the MIF mRNA level (Fig. 1B). Stimulation of the cells with 100 nm thrombin resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in MIF expression relative to the control (no stimulation). After stimulation with 100 nm thrombin, MIF mRNA levels were up-regulated at 6 h and reached a maximum at 24 h (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, MIF contents in the culture supernatants of HDMEC increased in response to thrombin (100 nm) in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). We obtained similar results when we used HUVEC with regard to the dose-response curve and time-course. The specific thrombin inhibitor hirudin (5 units/ml) strongly inhibited the thrombin-induced MIF mRNA expression in HDMEC (Fig. 2A). By Western blot analysis, we confirmed that thrombin stimulated MIF production (3.5-fold increase compared with the control), and hirudin inhibited the thrombin-induced MIF production (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Effect of hirudin on thrombin-induced MIF expression. A, HDMEC were treated with hirudin or medium alone for 30 min before the addition of thrombin and cultured for 24 h. The cells were harvested and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, control (no stimulation); lane 2, hirudin (5 units/ml); lane 3, thrombin (100 nm); lane 4, thrombin (100 nm) + hirudin (5 units/ml). B, in a similar manner, HDMEC were treated with hirudin (5 units/ml), cultured for 24 h, and harvested. Western blot analysis was performed. Lane 1, control (no stimulation); lane 2, hirudin (5 units/ml); lane 3, thrombin (100 nm); lane 4, thrombin (100 nm) + hirudin (5 units/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Enhancement of MIF mRNA by TRAP-6 —Next we investigated whether the thrombin effect on MIF up-regulation was mediated via proteolytic cleavage of PAR-1 in endothelial cells. We evaluated the expression of MIF mRNA by HDMEC and HUVEC in response to various concentrations of TRAP-6, the PAR-1 agonist. TRAP-6 caused a dose-dependent increase in MIF mRNA expression in HDMEC (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the dose-dependent increase of MIF mRNA expression in response to TRAP-6 was seen in HUVEC, but was less significant (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that thrombin acts as an agonist for MIF, possibly via PAR-1, a specific thrombin receptor. We then examined other protease effects on MIF expression in endothelial cells. HDMEC or HUVEC were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of various proteases. We found that thrombin, known as PAR-1 agonist, and FXa as well as trypsin, known as a PAR-2 agonist, induced MIF expression in endothelial cells, but other proteases, kallikrein and urokinase, failed to (Fig. 4).Fig. 4MIF mRNA expression by proteases in endothelial cells. HDMEC and HUVEC were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of various proteases and subjected to Northern blot analysis. A and B show the results for HDMEC and HUVEC, respectively. Lane 1, no stimulation; lane 2, thrombin (100 nm); lane 3, FXa (20 nm); lane 4, trypsin (100 nm); lane 5, kallikrein (200 nm); lane 6, urokinase (20 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Enhancement of MIF mRNA and Production by FXa—We examined the expression of MIF mRNA of HDMEC, HUVEC, fibroblasts and PBMCs by FXa stimulation. Enhanced MIF mRNA expression was observed in these cells, particularly in HDMEC, HUVEC and PBMCs (Fig. 5A). We performed Northern blot analysis to confirm that FXa was capable of inducing the expression of MIF mRNA in HDMEC. Treatment of HDMEC with 20 nm FXa resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in MIF mRNA expression compared with the unstimulated control (Fig. 5B). This induction of MIF mRNA expression by FXa (20 nm) occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, HDMEC secreted MIF into the culture media in a time-dependent manner in response to FXa (20 nm) (Fig. 5D). We obtained similar results regarding the dose-dependence and time-course in HUVEC (data not shown). The effect of FXa on MIF mRNA expression was inhibited by preincubation with ATIII (160 nm), a physiological inhibitor of both FXa and thrombin (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, MIF mRNA induced by FXa was not inhibited by hirudin (5 units/ml), suggesting that FXa elicits these actions directly and not via thrombin. By Western blot analysis, we confirmed that ATIII strongly inhibited FXa-induced MIF production (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Effect of ATIII on MIF expression induced by FXa. A, HDMEC were treated with ATIII or hirudin for 30 min before the addition of FXa. The cells were cultured for 24 h, harvested, and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Lane 1, no stimulation; lane 2, FXa (20 nm); lane 3, FXa (20 nm) + ATIII (160 nm); lane 4, FXa (20 nm) + hirudin (5 units/ml). B, HDMEC were stimulated with FXa with and without ATIII. MIF protein levels were examined by Western blot analysis. Lane 1, no stimulation; lane 2, ATIII (160 nm); lane 3, FXa (20 nm); lane 4, FXa (20 nm) + ATIII (160 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Enhancement of MIF mRNA by PAR-2 Agonists—Next we investigated whether the FXa effect on MIF up-regulation in endothelial cells was mediated via proteolytic cleavage of PAR-2. We evaluated the expression of MIF mRNA by HDMEC and HUVEC in response to various concentrations of SLIGRL-NH2, a PAR-2 agonist. SLIGRL-NH2 caused dose-dependent increases in MIF mRNA expression in HDMEC and HUVEC (Fig. 7, A and B). Signal Transduction of Thrombin, FXa, and PAR-2 Agonist for MIF Expression—To examine the signal transduction of thrombin and FXa in endothelial cells with regard to MIF mRNA expression, we examined the effects of several inhibitors against molecules involved in the MAPK-dependent signal transduction pathway of HDMEC. We found that PD98089 (MAPK kinase inhibitor) significantly suppressed MIF mRNA induced by thrombin (Fig. 8A) or FXa (Fig. 8C). On the other hand, SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) had little effect on the MIF mRNA expression induced by thrombin (Fig. 8B) or FXa (Fig. 8D), respectively. Next, we demonstrated that SN50 (an NF-κB inhibitor) significantly reduced MIF mRNA stimulated by thrombin (Fig. 9A) or FXa (Fig. 9B). We also examined the signal transduction of PAR-2 with regard to MIF mRNA expression in endothelial cells. The results showed that PD98089 significantly suppressed MIF mRNA expression induced by SLIGRL-NH2 (Fig. 10A), whereas SB203580 had little effect (Fig. 10B). In addition, we demonstrated that SN50 significantly reduced MIF mRNA in response to SLIGRL-NH2 (Fig. 10C). By using HUVEC, we obtained similar results regarding the effects of thrombin and FXa as well as these inhibitors (data not shown).Fig. 9Effects of NF-κB inhibitor on thrombin- and FXa-induced MIF mRNA expression.

MIF mRNA levels were examined by Northern blot analysis. A, lane 1, no stimulation; lane 2, PD98089 (40 μm); lane 3, SLIGRL-NH2 (100 μm); lane 4, SLIGRL-NH2 (100 μm) + PD98089 (40 μm).

HDMEC were stimulated with various concentrations of MIF ranging from 0.1 ng/ml to 1000 ng/ml for 6 h, and then the levels of PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA were assessed. The results showed that the levels of both PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA were up-regulated, with PAR-2 mRNA being significantly elevated by 100 ng/ml MIF (3.4-fold elevation) (Fig. 11A). At the dose of 1000 ng/ml MIF, both PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA expression decreased (data not shown). Next, we performed a time-course study on PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA expression by MIF (100 ng/ml) in HDMEC. PAR-1 mRNA expression in MIF-treated HDMEC was up-regulated at 1 h, peaked at 6 h, and then was sustained for up to 24 h (Fig. 11B). On the other hand, PAR-2 mRNA expression was up-regulated at between 3 and 6 h, but was markedly decreased at 12 h and 24 h. In a similar manner, MIF up-regulated PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA in UHVEC (data shown). Involvement of PAR-1 and PAR-2 in Vivo—We first confirmed the deletion of the MIF gene in MIF-deficient mice by examining MIF mRNA of ears by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 12A). We assessed inflammation in the foot of the MIF-deficient mouse as for PAR-1 and PAR-2. The footpad swelling in WT mice caused by the selective PAR-1 agonist peptide TFLLR-NH2 was maximal at 1 h and lasted for at least 6 h. Foodpad swelling of MIF-deficient mice was significantly decreased compared with WT mice (Fig. 12B). The selective PAR-2 agonist peptide SLIGRL-NH2 also caused an increase of footpad swelling in WT mice that was maximal at 1 h, and footpad swelling of MIF-deficient mice was significantly decreased compared with WT mice, as with the PAR-1 agonist (Fig. 12C). MIF, the first reported lymphokine, was discovered in 1966 (14Bloom B.R. Bennett B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Google Scholar). It functions as an initiator of inflammation and the immune response via the positive regulation of a number of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and interleukin-1 (15Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1895-1902Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that MIF was present in human skin and characterized its tissue localization (21Shimizu T. Ohkawara A. Nishihira J. Sakamoto W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 199-202Google Scholar). Regarding cutaneous pathological features, high levels of MIF expression have been found in a variety of inflammatory conditions, such as atopic dermatitis in the epidermal layer of inflammatory skin lesions (20Shimizu T. Abe R. Ohkawara A. Mizue Y. Nishihira J. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 173-178Google Scholar). In addition to its inflammatory properties, MIF is thought to be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation during wound repair (22Abe R. Shimizu T. Ohkawara A. Nishihira J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1500: 1-9Google Scholar) and tumor growth (23Shimizu T. Abe R. Nakamura H. Ohkawara A. Suzuki M. Nishihira J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 751-758Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial cells are known to have the potential to produce MIF after inflammatory stimulation (24Nishihira J. Koyama Y. Mizue Y. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 199-205Google Scholar), and this cytokine acts as a potent mitogenic factor for human endothelial cells (25Yang Y. Degranpre P. Kharfi A. Akoum A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 4721-4727Google Scholar). In this context, MIF contributes to normal homeostasis and responses to stimuli such as wounds and infection (26Joshi P.C. Poole G.V. Sachdev V. Zhou X. Jones Q. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 2000; 107: 13-20Google Scholar, 27Beishuizen A. Thijs L.G. Haanen C. Vermes I. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 2811-2816Google Scholar). As shown in this study, endothelial cells would be the major source of MIF in the events of inflammatory responses as well as in wound-healing processes. Thus, it is conceivable that MIF produced by endothelial cells may be of particular biological relevance to cutaneous inflammatory responses. Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease that plays an important role in the coagulation cascade, wound healing, and inflammatory response. In this study, we showed that thrombin induced MIF mRNA expression in endothelial cells and that this expression was specifically blocked by the thrombin inhibitor hirudin. Consistent with this finding, we showed that treatment with the PAR-1 receptor peptide TRAP-6 stimulated MIF expression in endothelial cells. Recent studies have provided evidence that endothelial cells express several PARs, including the thrombin receptors (PAR-1 and PAR-3) and thrombin-independent PAR-2 (2Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Google Scholar). PARs are G-protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains. Thrombin cleaves the receptors and exposes their new N-terminal sequences at the extracellular domain. The newly exposed domains then act as tethered ligands through which PAR can induce signal transduction. In this context, it is believed that synthetic hexapeptides carrying consensus sequences of the new amino-terminal region could mimic the effects of the respective proteases and that agonist peptides could be employed as tools to analyze the involvement of PAR in the regulation of cell functions. We also showed that activation of endothelial cells through PAR-1 led to the production of MIF and, moreover, that endothelial cells would be a major source of MIF in the inflammatory response to tissue injuries. Thus, MIF facilitates the critical interaction between thrombin and PAR-1. Individual PARs mediate these events in response to thrombin, as exemplified by the fact that thrombin stimulates the secretion of IL-1 from activated macrophages (28Jones A. Geczy C.L. Immunology. 1990; 71: 236-241Google Scholar). In association with this event, we previously reported that MIF expression was up-regulated in human fibroblasts by thrombin stimulation (29Shimizu T. Ohkawara A. Mizue Y. Nishihira J. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1999; 25: 569-573Google Scholar). FXa induces thrombin production as a procoagulant activator and also has the potential to elicit inflammatory responses, such as cytokine production, in endothelial cells (9Senden N.H. Jeunhomme T.M. Heemskerk J.W. Wagenvoord R. van't Veer C. Hemker H.C. Buurman W.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4318-4324Google Scholar, 10Papapetropoulos A. Piccardoni P. Cirino G. Bucci M. Sorrentino R. Cicala C. Johnson K. Zachariou V. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4738-4742Google Scholar, 11Ollivier V. Chabbat J. Herbert J.M. Hakim J. de Prost D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1374-1381Google Scholar). FXa has also been shown to exert various cellular effects in a number of cell types and directly stimulates the proliferation of rat aortic smooth muscle cells and human mesangial cells (7Marin V. Montero-Julian F.A. Gres S. Boulay V. Bongrand P. Farnarier C. Kaplanski G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3435-3442Google Scholar, 11Ollivier V. Chabbat J. Herbert J.M. Hakim J. de Prost D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1374-1381Google Scholar). There is evidence that FXa possesses the potential to activate PAR-2 or a PAR-2-related receptor, but the exact mechanism by which FXa exerts these cellular effects is not fully understood (30Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Google Scholar). As shown in this study, FXa potently enhances MIF. FXa-induced MIF expression was inhibited by ATIII but not by hirudin. This fact strongly indicates that the positive regulation of MIF mRNA expression by FXa is independent thrombin. In addition, we revealed that the expression levels of both PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA were up-regulated by MIF in endothelial cells. It was not clear whether PAR-1 and PAR-2 were functionally important in the process of the MIF-induced inflammatory condition. PAR-1 mRNA expression started 1 h after the stimulation, peaked at 6 h, and then was sustained up to 48 h. Similarly, MIF up-regulated PAR-2 mRNA expression at 3 h and after 6 h, but the expression decreased drastically thereafter. It has been reported that PAR-2 mRNA and protein levels are elevated by TNF-α in human umbilical vein endothelial cells but that the thrombin receptor gene (PAR-1) is not induced by TNF-α (31Nystedt S. Ramakrishnan V. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14910-14915Google Scholar). Along with the present results, this finding indicates that MIF up-regulates both PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNA levels in a manner distinct from the MIF-induced up-regulation of TNF-α. Both thrombin and FXa are known to exert their effects through a variety of downstream signaling mechanisms that may involve p44/p42 MAPK, p38 MAPK, PKC, and NF-κB (32Maruyama I. Shigeta K. Miyahara H. Nakajima T. Shin H. Ide S. Kitajima I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 429-436Google Scholar, 33Donovan F.M. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12746-12752Google Scholar, 34Lidington E.A. Haskard D.O. Mason J.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2784-2792Google Scholar, 35Marin V. Farnarier C. Gres S. Kaplanski S. Su M.S. Dinarello C.A.

In this study, we provided biochemical details of the signal transduction of thrombin and FXa within the pathways of MAP kinases and NF-κB. In brief, PD98089, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1/2 that blocks the p44/p42 MAPK pathway and NF-κB, prevented the effects of both thrombin and FXa on MIF mRNA expression. In contrast, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, had no effect. These facts proved that thrombin and FXa induced p44/p42 MAPK and NF-κB activation, which led to MIF expression. Finally, several growth factors/cytokines alone or in combination play important roles during tissue repair and enhance normal wound healing. Although it has long been speculated that proinflammatory cytokines and coagulation factors may play an important role in wound repair, the molecular-based mechanism has not been fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrated inflammation caused by injection of PAR-1 and PAR-2 agonists into mouse footpads, and the induced footpad thickness was much less severe in MIF-deficient mice than in WT mice. These facts indicate that MIF could play a critical role in functionally linking the cytokine network with the coagulation cascade during various wound-healing processes. Because endothelial cells are a potential source of MIF, MIF may play an important role as a positive regulator within the whole process of wound repair via up-regulation of PAR-1 and PAR-2."
https://openalex.org/W1981568036,"Vascular remodeling (change in vessel diameter) rather than intimal hyperplasia is the most important predictor of luminal loss in immune-mediated arterial injury, yet little is known about its mechanisms. Here, we show that outward vascular remodeling and intimal thickening, two manifestations of arteriosclerosis with opposing effects on luminal size, result from immune effector mechanisms that are T-cell dependent and interferon (IFN)-gamma mediated. In our in vivo model of human coronary artery injury by allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells, both processes occur concurrently and are characterized by T-cell infiltrates with a predominantly IFN-gamma-producing cytokine profile. Neutralization of IFN-gamma inhibits the arterial and intimal expansion, whereas administration of IFN-gamma enhances these effects. The nonredundant role of IFN-gamma in T-cell-dependent remodeling of human coronary arteries demonstrated here presents a new therapeutic target for preservation of vessel lumen in arteriosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2026524798,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in regulating cell growth and differentiation. This protein plays a central role in lymphocyte and adipocyte differentiation and hepatic regeneration and in the control of inflammation and immunity in the liver and in cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. Our previous studies suggested that this protein could also have important functions in the brain. Therefore, we were interested in the identification of downstream targets of this transcription factor in cells of neural origin. We performed cDNA microarray analysis and found that a total of 48 genes were up-regulated in C/EBPβ-overexpressing neuronal cells. Of the genes that displayed significant changes in expression, several were involved in inflammatory processes and brain injury. Northern blot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of ornithine decarboxylase, 24p3/LCN2, GRO1/KC, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, xanthine dehydrogenase, histidine decarboxylase, decorin, and TM4SF1/L6. Using promoter-luciferase reporter transfection assays, we showed the ornithine decarboxylase and 24p3 genes to be biological downstream targets of C/EBPβ in neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, the levels of C/EBPβ protein were significantly induced after neuronal injury, which was accompanied by increased levels of cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme. This strongly supports the concept that C/EBPβ may play an important role in brain injury."

Although the physiological functions of many hemoglobins are still unknown, a number of new functions have recently been described, including the scavenging of nitric oxide and oxygen (2Wittenberg J.B.

Although functions vary, the tertiary structures of these hemoglobins conserve many of the general features of the globin fold even when truncated to very short primary structures (11Pesce A.

However, like many proteins sharing the same fold but carrying out different functions, the specific amino acid residues surrounding the heme prosthetic group exhibit a large degree of variability across hemoglobins from different species. An extreme example of this diversity is found in the family of hexacoordinate hemoglobins (hxHbs) in which an endogenous amino acid coordinates the ligand binding site of the heme iron in the absence of exogenous ligands. The fact that hxHbs are capable of reversible exogenous ligand binding distinguishes them from cytochrome b5 and denatured Hbs that are not capable of ligand binding in the hexacoordinate state (12Hargrove M.

The trHbs are 20–40 residues shorter than non-vertebrate hemoglobins and have a 2-on-2 α-helical globin fold rather than the typical 3-on-3 fold. They are further characterized by a hydrophobic tunnel connecting the protein surface to the distal heme pocket that could serve as a direct route for ligand entry and/or exit from the heme pocket (2Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition to being a hexacoordinate member of the trHb family, SynHb is distinguished by the ability to form a covalent bond between the heme 2-vinyl group and the His117 side chain (27Vu B.C. Jones A.D. Lecomte J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8544-8545Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); this is a novel example of covalent attachment in a Hb via the porphyrin ring, and the purpose of this modification is not yet understood. In the present study, the crystal structure of SynHb has been solved to 1.8-Å resolution. The crystal structure reveals the covalent linkage between the heme 2-vinyl and the Nϵ2 atom of His117 that is not present in the solution NMR structure of this protein (28Falzone C.J. Christie V.B.

Expression was performed without induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and free hemin was not added during fermentation. Following inoculation, cells were grown for 16 h and then harvested by centrifugation.

The purified protein was oxidized with a slight molar excess of potassium ferricyanide followed by desalting on a Sephadex G-25 column in 0.01 m potassium phosphate, pH 7. The resulting ferric SynHb was concentrated to ∼3 mm and stored at -80 °C until use. The ferric protein used for crystallization was produced under conditions similar to those in which the His117-heme covalent link was observed by NMR experiments in SynHb and the homologue in Synechococcus (28Falzone C.J.

Drops were produced by mixing 2 μlof3mm protein with 2 μl of well buffer containing 30–35% polyethylene glycol monomethylether 5000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.01 m cadmium chloride, and 0.1 m MES at pH 6.5. Single crystals grew in 1–3 days at 4 °C. Structure Determination and Refinement—Initially, solution of the crystal structure of SynHb was attempted using molecular replacement starting with the NMR structure of this protein (28Falzone C.J. Christie V.B. Scott N.L. Lecomte J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The fact that this method failed is not unusual because the use of NMR structures for molecular replacement starting models is often unsuccessful, even with 100% sequence identity (30Chen Y.W. Clore G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 31Chen Y.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1457-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction was employed using anomalous scattering from the heme iron atom. These data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL, Stanford, CA) at 100 °K. Diffraction data were processed using the program d*TREK (32Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The resolution was extended to 1.8 Å using a native data set collected on a Rigaku/MSC home source generator and further refinement using REFMAC5. The final model contains 123 amino acids and 77 water molecules with R = 21.8%, Rfree = 22.4%, and acceptably small variations from ideal stereochemistry (Table I). A plot of B factor versus residue number is shown in Fig. 2A. As expected, B factors are low except in loop and termini regions.

The overall structure is typical of other trHbs and the NMR structure of SynHb in that the B and E, and G and H helices form the characteristic 2-on-2 helical core of the globin fold (2Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The covalent linkage between the Nϵ2 atom of His117 and the heme-2-vinyl is observed as continuous electron density between these atoms (Fig. 1B). There is no evidence for a mixture of states for this side chain, suggesting that the protein is exclusively in the covalently cross-linked conformation. The Nϵ2 atom of His117 is 2.1 Å from the CAB atom of the heme in the crystal structure, whereas these atoms are 5.4 Å apart in the most representative model from NMR. This movement is accompanied by a 136° change in the angle of CHI2 and a >30° increase in the acute angle between the least squares planes of the heme porphyrin and the His117 imidazole ring. Another distinct feature of the SynHb crystal structure is the relatively large r.m.s.d. from the NMR structure, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. Two methods were used to align the structures for quantitative comparison. The first method aligns the structures based on the Cα atoms of 109 residues (89% of the residues in the SynHb structure) with clear backbone density in the crystal structure (residues 5–55, 60–98, 105, and 107–124). The second method aligns the structures based on the Cα atoms of 86 residues (70%) involved in clear secondary structure (residues 17–55, 64–98, and 101–112) and was chosen because it was the method used for aligning the 20 NMR models of SynHb (28Falzone C.J. Christie V.B. Scott N.L. Lecomte J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. values for the density-based and secondary structure-based alignments were relatively high at 2.18 and 1.6 Å, respectively. The difference in r.m.s.d. values between the two methods arises from the number of residues used for each alignment. Both alignments give an r.m.s.d. of 2.6 Å when all 123 Cα atoms of the identical sequence are taken into account, rather than only the subset of Cα atoms used in the alignment. As a frame of reference, the average r.m.s.d. among the 20 NMR models relative to the most representative structure is 1.37 Å for all Cα atoms. In addition, the comparison between the crystal and NMR structures of SynHb gives a higher r.m.s.d. value than the comparison of the SynHb crystal structure and that of the trHb from Chlamydomonas eugametos (CtrHb). The latter comparison aligns 94 Cα (76%) with an r.m.s.d. of 1.53 Å, even though CtrHb is in a different liganded state than SynHb and does not share the same primary sequence. The source of deviation between the crystal and NMR structures is examined on a per residue basis in Fig. 2. Fig. 2A includes a plot of the r.m.s.d. between the SynHb crystal and NMR structures. Fig. 2B is a ribbon representation of the crystal structure backbone onto which r.m.s.d. values have been color-coded for each amino acid (blue is <1.5 Å, orange 1.5–3 Å, and red >3 Å). Several regions of increased r.m.s.d. are expected because of increased mobility. These regions include the termini and extended loops, both of which correlate with increased B factors in Fig. 2A. There are also regions described by relatively low B factors that have increased r.m.s.d., including the entire F helix, the first half of the E helix, and a portion of the lower H helix containing the covalently linked His117. These differences between the crystal and NMR structures of SynHb are seen clearly in the backbone alignment shown in Fig. 3A. In the case of hemoglobins, it can be argued that structural alignment based on the heme prosthetic group is the most important functionally, because it gives a direct comparison of the orientation of the amino acid side chains influencing the steric and electrostatic environment immediately surrounding the ligand binding site. Alignment based on heme position rather than the protein backbone increases the deviation between the crystal and NMR structures of SynHb from 2.6 Å to 3.76 Å for all Cα. This indicates that the heme orientations within the crystal and NMR structures of SynHb are different (as can also be seen in Fig. 3A). Both the Cα and heme-based alignment comparisons indicate significant deviations between the crystal and NMR structures of SynHb, particularly at high resolution. Inclusion of side chain positions in the backbone comparison of these structures also generates r.m.s.d. values > 3 Å. Differences occur throughout the backbone but are most pronounced in the heme pocket overlay shown in Fig. 3B, which provides a direct comparison of the crystal structure and the most representative NMR structure. Several side chains, including Tyr22 and Phe35, are shifted upwards, away from the heme in the NMR structure. The H helix is closer to the heme in the crystal structure, which brings His117 into position to form a covalent bond to the heme 2-vinyl group. Additional high resolution structural differences include the position of the side chains of the proximal and distal histidines, His70 and His46, respectively (Table II), which have different orientations with respect to the heme porphyrins in the two structures. The proximal histidine in the crystal structure is tilted toward the propionates with an acute angle of 79° between the least squares planes of the heme porphyrin and the histidine imidazole ring, whereas in the NMR structure the proximal histidine is tilted away from the propionates with an acute angle of 77°. The effect of this tilt on the azimuthal angle of the proximal histidine is discussed below. Similarly, the tilts of the distal histidines are nearly opposite; that in the crystal structure tilts toward the 1- and 8-methyl groups with an acute angle of 73°, whereas the one in the NMR structure tilts toward the 4-vinyl and 5-methyl groups with an acute angle of 76°.Table IIHelix-position designations and residue numbers in trHbs Helical designations are determined by alignment with sperm whale myoglobin.ProteinB10CD1E7E10E11E14F8SynechocystisTyr22Phe35Gln43His46Gln47Phe50His70C. eugametosTyr20Phe33Gln41Lys44Gln45Phe48His68P. caudatumTyr20Phe33Gln41Lys44Thr45Phe48His68M. tuberculosisTyr33Phe46Leu54Lys57Gln58Phe61His81 Open table in a new tab Solvent Accessibility in SynHb—The crystal structures of three other group I trHbs have been solved to date, CtrHb, Paramecium caudatum (PtrHb), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (trHbN) (13Pesce A.

Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3902-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), all with bound ligands. Each of these structures display a continuous or nearly continuous “ligand tunnel” that connects the distal heme pocket with solvent. The tunnel contains two branches, with openings between the AB and GH inter-helical corners and between the E, G, and H helices (2Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 13Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing the same parameters for tunnel calculations in the other trHbs (see “Experimental Procedures”), SynHb does not contain this tunnel. In the SynHb crystal structure, crowding from residues such as Leu51, Phe55, and Met98 narrows the space between the AB and GH corners and the distal heme pocket, whereas Phe50 blocks access to the distal pocket via this path completely. Furthermore, Tyr53 in SynHb prevents access to the heme from the branch of the tunnel found between the G and H helices. For the NMR structure, it was reported that this tunnel path was detected (28Falzone C.J. Christie V.B. Scott N.L. Lecomte J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, when the same method was again used to check for solvent accessibility in the NMR structure, it was found that, despite the porous surface of the protein, no continuous tunnels extend through the protein matrix to the distal heme pocket. Both the crystal and NMR structures of SynHb are solvent-accessible around the heme propionates. The solvent-accessible cavity of the crystal structure (Fig. 4A) is smaller than that of the NMR structure (Fig. 4B), which is more extensive and reaches into the heme pocket to surround the distal His46. However, the rest of the heme group is block"

We have characterized four distinct autonomous repression domains in RIP140, termed RD1-4, that are highly conserved in mammals and birds. RD1 at the N terminus represses transcription in the presence of trichostatin A, suggesting that it functions by a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-independent mechanism. The repressive activity of RD2 is dependent upon carboxyl-terminal binding protein recruitment to two specific binding sites. Use of specific inhibitors indicates that RD2, RD3, and RD4 are capable of functioning by HDAC-dependent and HDAC-independent mechanisms, depending upon cell type.

Use of specific inhibitors indicates that RD2, RD3, and RD4 are capable of functioning by HDAC-dependent and HDAC-independent mechanisms, depending upon cell type. The ability of nuclear receptors to regulate transcription from target genes depends on the recruitment of cofactors that initiate chromatin remodelling and the assembly of the transcription machinery. The remodeling of chromatin by coactivators and corepressors is a dynamic process catalyzed by enzyme complexes that can be divided into two distinct classes. The first class is composed of ATP-dependent complexes that are involved in the location and association of nucleosomes with DNA (1Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), and the second class is composed of enzymes that catalyze post-translational modifications in histones (2Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7468) Google Scholar). Such modifications are proposed to constitute a “histone code” that represents an epigenetic marking mechanism for controlling gene transcription and other chromatin-regulated processes. The best characterized coactivators for nuclear receptors are the p160 coactivators, which seem to serve as platforms for the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes, including CREB-binding protein/p300 and methyltransferases that, respectively, acetylate and methylate residues in histones in the vicinity of target promoters (3McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). The p160 proteins have been found to interact by means of helical LXXLL motifs directly with an activation surface (called AF2) located on the ligand-binding domain of activated nuclear receptors (4Heery D.M.

It was initially proposed that RIP140 may inhibit transcription by competing with and displacing transcriptional coactivators such as p160 family members (9Subramaniam N. Treuter E. Okret S. J. Biol.

In this paper, we have investigated the function of RIP140 as a corepressor by mapping the boundaries of autonomous repression domains and determining the contribution of HDAC and CtBP binding to their ability to repress transcription. We identified four distinct autonomous repression domains that function by HDAC-dependent and -independent mechanisms, depending on the cell type.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

Chem. 2000; 275: 30801-30805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). RIP140 Contains Multiple Autonomous Repression Domains—We initially demonstrated that the ability of RIP140 to inhibit estrogen-stimulated transcription from an estrogen responsive element (ERE)-based reporter gene could be achieved by both the N-terminal (amino acids 1-528) and C-terminal halves (amino acids 535-1158) of the protein (Fig. 1A). In these experiments, we used RIP140 fragments fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, which alone had no effect, so that we could exploit a transrepression assay to determine whether RIP140 contains autonomous repression domain(s). A luciferase reporter gene was constructed under the control of LexA and Gal4 binding sites upstream of an E1A TATA box. Basal transcription was markedly increased by lexA-VP16 expression (Fig. 1B), but this was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by full-length, N- and C-terminal RIP140 fragments but not by the Gal4 DBD or RIP140 alone. The equal expression level of each Gal4-RIP140 fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The ability of both halves of RIP140 to inhibit transcription from the reporter gene in trans indicates that the protein contains at least two autonomous repression domains. The N-terminal repression domain had been shown to contain HDAC and CtBP binding sites (11Wei L.N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Farooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Vo N. Fjeld C. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6181-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated additional fragments of RIP140 to discriminate between these binding sites. Accordingly, we found that residues 78-333, which are capable of binding class I HDACs (11Wei L.N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Farooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and residues 410-700 that binds CtBP (13Vo N. Fjeld C. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6181-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) both inhibited transcription in the transrepression assay (Fig. 1C). In addition, we sub-divided the C terminus into residues 644-916 and 927-1158 and found that they too inhibited transcription, suggesting that there are at least four autonomous repression domains in RIP140, which we have named repression domains (RD) 1-4 (Fig. 1C). Identification of CtBP Binding Sites in RIP140—Previous work demonstrated that CtBP was recruited to RIP140 through the sequence PIDLSCK (13Vo N. Fjeld C. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6181-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Tazawa H. Osman W. Shoji Y. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. Zilliacus J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4187-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this sequence was both necessary and sufficient for CtBP binding and transcriptional repression, we examined the effect of replacing PIDLS with PIAAS in functional assays. Surprisingly, the mutant version retained its ability to bind CtBP in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 2A) and repressive activity, suggesting that RIP140 may contain additional CtBP binding sites. Inspection of its amino acid sequence for other sequences that fit the consensus for CtBP-interaction (17Deltour S. Pinte S. Guerardel C. Wasylyk B. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4890-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) revealed that, in addition to PIDLS (motif 1), there are three other potential binding sites, namely PINLS (motif 2) and SMDLT (motif 3) in RD2, and VRDLS (motif 4) in RD4 (Fig. 2B). In a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we found that the PIDLS and PINLS motifs in RD2 and the VRDLS motif in RD4 stimulated transcription in the presence of CtBP-VP16 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that they were distinct binding sites for CtBP. GST pull-down experiments confirmed the importance of these motifs in CtBP binding, and further suggested that motif 3 might also contribute to binding activity as judged by the interaction of different combinations of mutant versions. Thus, there was a progressive reduction in CtBP binding when motif 1 and motifs 1 and 2 were replaced, but the interaction was only abolished when all three motifs were replaced (Fig. 2C). There are two mammalian CtBPs, CtBP1 and CtBP2 (15Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5296-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), both of which we found could bind to RIP140 fragments encompassing the PIDLS/PINLS motifs in RD2 (RIP400-800) and the VRDLS motif in RD4 (RIP140, 753-1158), as shown in Fig. 2D. Characterization of Repression Domain 2—The contribution of CtBP binding to repression by RD2 was investigated using mutant versions with different combinations of defective motif in the transrepression assay (Fig. 3A). Transrepression was reduced when PIDLS was replaced with PIAAS and similarly, but to a lesser extent, when PINLS was replaced with PIAAS, suggesting that both were required for optimum repression. There was a further slight reduction in transrepression when these two mutant motifs were combined, but the replacement of SMDLT had no additional effect. The data are consistent with results we obtained when we examined the relative contribution of the motifs to CtBP binding using the two-hybrid interaction assay. Thus, mutations in motif 1 reduced the ability of RD2 to interact with CtBP to a greater extent than motif 2, and combinations of mutant motifs had little further effect (Fig. 3B). That CtBP is essential for repression by RD2 was established by demonstrating that this domain no longer inhibited transcription in mouse embryonic fibroblasts devoid of both CtBP1 and CtBP2 (Fig. 3C). Identification of Novel Repression Domains in RIP140—RD3, encompassed by residues 644-916, is a potent repressor of transcription that shows no significant sequence homology to other proteins, as analyzed by the Blast program at National Center for Biotechnology Information. Using a series of RIP140 fragments fused to Gal4, we identified amino acids 737-885 as the minimal region required for repression (Fig. 4A). This region does not contain any potential motifs for CtBP interaction and retained its ability to inhibit transcription in a cell line null for CtBP1 and CtBP2 using the transrepression assay (Fig. 4B). RD4, encompassed by residues 927-1158, contains a CtBP binding motif VRDLS; however, a mutant version in which this motif was replaced with VRAAS to abolish CtBP binding retained its function as a corepressor (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, RD4 was able to inhibit transcription in CtBP-null cells (Fig. 5B), indicating that RD4 functions as an autonomous repression domain by a CtBP-independent mechanism. Analysis of a series of RIP140 fragments (Fig. 5C) indicates that the minimal region responsible for repression is contained with residues 1118-1158. Finally, we investigated the possibility that the C terminus of RIP140 contains an additional CtBP-dependent repression domain by examining the repressive activity of residues 927-1118 lacking RD4 but encompassing the VRDLS motif; however, it was negligible (Fig. 5C). Repression Domain Activity Varies According to Cell Type—We characterized the repression activities of the four repression domains in different cell types derived from the kidney (COS and 293T cells) and ovary (CHO and KK1 cells), because RIP140 is highly expressed in these tissues (Ref. 19White R. Leonardsson G. Rosewell I. Ann Jacobs M. Milligan S. Parker M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1368-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and data not shown). The repression activities of RD1, RD2, and RD3 were similar to one another, with slightly more inhibition observed in the kidney cell lines (Fig. 6A). RD4 was less active and exhibited negligible repressive activity in ovarian cells. Although the magnitude of repression observed in ovarian cells was less than that in kidney cells, we found that this was not a feature of all repressors, because CtBP, CTIP2, and Hey 1 repress transcription in ovarian cells to a greater extent than that in the kidney cells (data not shown). Finally, we investigated the contribution of HDAC enzymatic activity to repression by the four domains by testing the ability of the HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) (Fig. 6B) and valproic acid (data not shown) to reverse transcriptional inhibition. We found that repression by RIP140 itself was unaffected by TSA, but that of RD2, and to a lesser extent RD3 and RD4, was reversed. However, this effect was restricted to COS cells, suggesting that repression is mediated by both HDAC-dependent and -independent mechanisms that vary according to cell type. RIP140 is a ligand-dependent corepressor of nuclear receptors that may inhibit transcription from target genes by competing with essential coactivators or by active repression following the recruitment of additional proteins. In this paper, we have characterized four distinct autonomous repression domains (Fig. 7A): RD1, which interacts with HDACs (11Wei L.N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Farooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); RD2, which binds CtBP (13Vo N. Fjeld C. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6181-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Tazawa H. Osman W. Shoji Y. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. Zilliacus J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4187-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); and RD3 and RD4, which may interact with proteins that have yet to be identified. Thus, it seems that RIP140 is a bridging protein that docks to nuclear receptors by means of LXXLL motifs (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 7Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and provides a platform for the recruitment of one or more corepressors involved in chromatin remodelling in the vicinity of target genes. Sequence comparisons indicate that RIP140 is highly conserved in mammalian, bird, and fish species, but it does not seem to be related to other known transcriptional repressors. RD1 is the most highly conserved region with greater than 50% conservation between mammalian and fish species. The key residues required for CtBP binding (17Deltour S. Pinte S. Guerardel C. Wasylyk B. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4890-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that encompass the three motifs in RD2 are also highly conserved (Fig. 7B), and this observation extends to the VRDLS motif in the C terminus of the protein (data not shown). Although this motif was dispensable for repression by RD4, it is conceivable that it is capable of recruiting CtBP in the context of full-length RIP140. RD3 and RD4 are also similar in human, mouse, and chicken (Fig. 7, C and D). RD1 has been shown to interact with HDACs (11Wei L.N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Farooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but we found that it is insensitive to the effects of the inhibitors TSA or valproic acid, indicating that it can repress transcription by an HDAC-independent mechanism. It was reported (11Wei L.N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Farooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) that the ability of RIP140 to inhibit the transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptors in COS cells was reversed by TSA treatment, but the repression domains involved were not mapped. It is possible that one of the other repression domains and not RD1 was responsible for this inhibition, because we found that their repressive activity, and particularly that of RD2, was reversed by TSA treatment. Our study confirms the original observation of Goodman and coworkers (13Vo N. Fjeld C. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6181-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that repression by RD2 is mediated by CtBP, although we demonstrate two CtBP binding sites in RIP140 that are both required for optimum binding and repression. The precise mechanism by which CtBP functions as a corepressor is unclear, and previous reports (18Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) suggest that it may repress transcription from certain target promoters by HDAC-dependent mechanisms and from other promoters by HDAC-independent mechanisms involving the polycomb complex. Similarly, we find that, whereas CtBP is essential for repression by RD2, it can function by HDAC-dependent or -independent mechanisms, depending upon cell type. We were unable to demonstrate a role for CtBP in repression by RD3 or RD4 and, given that TSA only partially reversed their ability to inhibit transcription, we conclude that they function by novel mechanisms. Multiple repression mechanisms have been reported to account for the repressive activity of ligand-dependent corepressor (8Fernandes I. Bastien Y. Wai T. Nygard K. Lin R. Cormier O. Lee H.S. Eng F. Bertos N.R. Pelletier N. Mader S. Han V.K. Yang X.J. White J.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 139-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Repression domain function may vary depending on the nuclear receptor to which RIP140 is recruited or the cell type. For example, the contribution of RD2 to the repressive activity of RIP140 in COS cells seems to be minimal because TSA reverses inhibition by the isolated RD2 but not full-length protein in these cells. Alternatively the mechanism utilized may vary according to the physiological status of the cells. For example, the interaction of CtBP with the PXDLS sequence in E1A was reported to be modulated by NAD and NADH, and so repression by CtBP (20Kumar V. Carlson J.E. Ohgi K.A. Edwards T.A. Rose D.W.

Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897PubMed Google Scholar) might be regulated by cellular redox states. Because RIP140 plays a distinct role in ovulation (19White R. Leonardsson G. Rosewell I. Ann Jacobs M. Milligan S. Parker M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1368-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Leonardsson G. Jacobs M.A. White R. Jeffery R. Poulsom R. Milligan S. Parker M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 700-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and adipose biology (data not shown), it may be necessary to control its function as a corepressor by different mechanisms in specific cell types or in different physiological circumstances.

PrP-res conformation differs among TSE agents derived from various sources, and these conformational differences are thought to influence the biological characteristics of these agents. In this study, we introduced deletions into the flexible N-terminal region of PrP (residues 34–124) and investigated the effect of this region on the conformation of PrP-res generated in an in vitro cell-free conversion assay. PrP deleted from residues 34 to 99 generated 12–16-kDa protease-resistant bands with intact C termini but variable N termini. The variable N termini were the result of exposure of new protease cleavage sites in PrP-res between residues 130 and 157, suggesting that these new cleavage sites were caused by alterations in the conformation of the PrP-res generated. Similarly truncated 12–16-kDa PrP bands were also identified in brain homogenates from mice infected with mouse-passaged hamster scrapie as well as in the cell-free conversion assay using conditions that mimicked the hamster/mouse species barrier to infection. Thus, by its effects on PrP-res conformation, the flexible N-terminal region of PrP seemed to influence TSE pathogenesis and cross-species TSE transmission.

These diseases are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormal form of the prion protein (PrP), which is associated with the pathogenic process and differs from normal PrP in its secondary structure and chemical properties. The susceptibility of PrP to digestion with proteinase K (PK) is generally used to distinguish the normal PrP from the abnormal PrP (1Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Google Scholar). Under conditions using mild detergents and high PK concentrations, the N-terminal third of abnormal PrP (PrP-res) up to residue 89 is digested by PK, leaving the remainder of the PrP molecule from residues 90–231 as a protease-resistant core (2Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Bolton D.C. Kent S.B. Hood L.E. Cell. 1984; 38: 127-134Google Scholar, 3Hope J. Hunter N. Ciba. Found Symp. 1988; 135: 146-163Google Scholar). In contrast, normal PrP (PrP-sen) is completely sensitive to PK digestion. The partial resistance of PrP-res to PK digestion is probably a result of the greater aggregation and a higher content of β-sheet structure of PrP-res compared with PrP-sen; however, the precise structure of PrP-res remains unknown. PrP-res molecules derived from different TSE strains or sources vary in their sites of PK cleavage (4Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Google Scholar, 5Telling G.C. Parchi P. DeArmond S.J. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Gabizon R. Mastrianni J. Lugaresi E. Gambetti P. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2079-2082Google Scholar). This variation seems to be caused by conformational differences in the PrP-res molecules and is associated with differences in the clinical phenotype and neuropathology of these TSE strains (6Bruce M.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1993; 49: 822-838Google Scholar). The biological properties of human TSE disease types are also associated with variation in PrP-res conformation as detected by PrP banding patterns after PK digestion. For example, in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), several types of PrP-res distinguished by different PK cleavage sites have been identified. These types are influenced by PrP codon 129 genotype and they seem to correlate with differences in neuropathology and clinical phenotype (7Hill A.F. Joiner S. Wadsworth J.D. Sidle K.C. Bell J.E.

Similar variations associated with some forms of familial CJD have also been correlated with clinical phenotype and neuropathology (10Capellari S. Parchi P. Russo C.M. Sanford J. Sy M.S. Gambetti P.

Despite our knowledge of the conformational variation of PrP-res present in both in vivo and in vitro situations, little is understood about the molecular contributions of different regions of PrP to this variation. In the present experiments we investigated the role of the unstructured N-terminal region of PrP in influencing the conformation of PrP-res generated in vitro in TSE strain- and species-specific reactions. The N-terminal flexible region of PrP is known to play an important role in TSE pathogenesis, because transgenic mice expressing PrP lacking residues 32–106 are not susceptible to scrapie infection (16Weissmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3-6Google Scholar), and those lacking residues 32–121 develop a spontaneous cerebellar degenerative disease (17Shmerling D. Hegyi I. Fischer M. Blattler T. Brandner S. Gotz J. Rulicke T. Flechsig E. Cozzio A. von Mering C. Hangartner C. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Cell. 1998; 93: 203-214Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated that PrP amino acid residues 94–113 were particularly important for the efficient formation of protease-resistant PrP in a cell-free system (18Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35265-35271Google Scholar). Notably, the PK-resistant conversion products generated using these mutants had a lower molecular mass (12–16 kDa versus 18–21 kDa using wild-type PrP), suggesting that the region from 94 to 113 might influence the conformation of PrP-res generated. However, it was unclear whether these peptides had any similarity to the lower molecular mass PrP species described in human and animal TSE diseases. In the present study, the low molecular weight PrP conversion products generated from N-terminal PrP deletion mutants were characterized by immunoprecipitation using antibodies to N- and C-terminal PrP peptides. The results indicated that the region between residues 94 and 99 had a particularly strong influence on the conformation of PrP-res generated in vitro. Mapping of the protease-resistant PrP-res bands indicated that they had intact C termini but were cleaved at several different sites between residues 130 and 157 to produce bands between 12 and 16 kDa in size, similar to those described for human sporadic CJD (19Zou W.Q. Capellari S. Parchi P. Sy M.S. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40429-40436Google Scholar). Residues of the N-terminal region of PrP were also shown to influence the conformation of PrP-res generated in species- and strain-specific cell-free conversion reactions. Antibodies—The 3F4 mouse monoclonal antibody recognizes an epitope within hamster PrP, which includes residues 109 and 112 (20Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Google Scholar). This antibody does not recognize wild-type mouse PrP (20Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies R24 (anti-N; residues 23–37); R18 (residues 142–155); R30 (residues 89–103), and R20 (anti-C; residues 218–232) were raised against the indicated PrP peptides and recognize both hamster and mouse PrP (21Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Ernst D. Race R.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Google Scholar). Western Blot—Homogenates prepared from the brain tissue of mice or hamsters infected with the 263K, RML, ME7, or 22L strains of rodent adapted scrapie were treated with PK and analyzed by Western blot as described previously (22Race R.E. Priola S.A. Bessen R.A. Ernst D. Dockter J. Rall G.F. Mucke L. Chesebro B. Oldstone M.B. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1183-1191Google Scholar). Clones—Construction of the Δ34–94, Δ34–113, Δ34–120, and Δ34–124 N-terminal deletion mutants of hamster PrP (HaPrP) has been described previously, and additional mutants deleted between residues 34 and 99 (Δ34–99), 34 and 102 (Δ34–102), 34 and 106 (Δ34–106) and 34 and 110 (Δ34–110) were generated in plasmid p23–7 using the same strategy (18Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35265-35271Google Scholar). The Δ34–94(LV) mutant was prepared by changing residues of HaPrP codon 109 from ATG to CTC to encode a methionine- to-leucine amino acid change and codon 112 from ATG to GTG to encode a methionine to valine amino acid change. PrP deletion mutants were sequenced, subcloned into the pSFF retroviral expression plasmid and transfected into retroviral vector packaging cell lines (Ψ2 and PA317) as described previously (23Robertson M.N. Spangrude G.J. Hasenkrug K. Perry L. Nishio J. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3271-3277Google Scholar, 24Chesebro B. Wehrly K. Caughey B. Nishio J. Ernst D. Race R. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1993; 80: 131-140Google Scholar). Labeling and Purification of PrP-sen—The 35S labeling of PrP-sen in the presence or absence of tunicamycin was performed as described previously (18Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35265-35271Google Scholar). After methanol precipitation at -20 °C the resulting protein precipitate was sonicated into a detergent lipid protein complex buffer (4.2 mg/ml α-phosphatidylcholine, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 2% sarkosyl in normal saline) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PrP antibodies. Wild-type hamster PrP, Δ34–94, Δ34–99, Δ34–102, and Δ34–106 were precipitated with the hamster PrP-specific monoclonal antibody 3F4. Wild-type mouse PrP, Δ34–94(LV), Δ34–110, Δ34–113, Δ34–120, and Δ34–124 deletion mutants were precipitated with the C-terminal rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal antibody R20. After incubation with 30 μl of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose prepared in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton-X100, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 2 h at 4 °C, the precipitated protein was washed once with detergent lipid protein complex buffer, twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1% sarkosyl and once with distilled water (dH2O) before being eluted in 0.1 m acetic acid and stored at 4 °C for use in the cell-free conversion assay. Cell-free Conversion Assay—The cell-free conversion assay is an in vitro assay that generates de novo PrP-res by mixing a source of [35S]PrP-sen with PrP-res isolated from the tissue of an infected animal. The conversion process involves the binding of PrP-sen to PrP-res followed by the induction of a conformational change that renders the [35S]PrP partially resistant to digestion by PK. After PK digestion, the de novo generated PrP-res is detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The cell-free conversion assay correlates well with the species- and strain-specific properties of PrP conversion that occur during TSE disease (4Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Google Scholar, 25Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3923-3927Google Scholar, 26Caughey B. Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2000; 2: 95-101Google Scholar). The method for cell-free conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res has been described previously (27Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 to 200 ng of PrP-res, purified from the brains of hamsters infected with the 263K, HY, or DY strain of hamster-adapted TSE, kindly provided by Greg Raymond (28Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Google Scholar), was partially denatured by incubation in 2.5 mm guanidine hydrochloride for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated with 25,000 cpm of [35S]PrP-sen in conversion buffer (0.75 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 5 mm cetylpyridinium chloride, and 1.2% sarkosyl) at 37 °C for 48 h. After incubation, 10% of the reaction was precipitated in ice-cold methanol and the remaining 90% was treated with 80 μl of PK (12 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. These samples represented PK- and PK+ samples, respectively. PK digestion was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of inhibition mix [2 mg/ml thyroglobulin, 20 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science)], and the product was precipitated at -20 °C with 4 volumes of ice-cold methanol. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in sample buffer (2.5% SDS, 3 mm EDTA, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 63 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) and electrophoresed on a 16% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen). The gel was fixed and dried, and the PK- and PK+ samples were quantified by phosphor autoradiographic image analysis (Storm PhosphorImager; Amersham Biosciences). To remove glycans from PrP, the PK-sample (1/10 of conversion reaction) was added to 34 μl of dH2O and treated overnight at 37 °C with 1,000 U PNGaseF (New England Biolabs) in a final volume of 60 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PK-treated sample was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min to pellet the PrP aggregates, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 200 μlof 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 6.5, to remove residual PK. The sample was again centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of 1× denaturation buffer (New England Biolabs) and treated with 1,000 U PNGaseF as described for the PK-sample. Thyroglobulin (10 μg) was added to both the PK- and PK+ samples as a carrier protein, and they were precipitated overnight at -20 °C by the addition of four volumes of ice-cold methanol. The precipitated protein was then prepared for SDS-PAGE as described for the cell-free conversion assay. In some cases after PK digestion, the protease-resistant fragments of the cell-free conversion assay were immunoprecipitated from the PK+ sample. Briefly, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min to pellet the PrP aggregates. The supernatant was removed and pellet was washed with 80 μl of wash buffer (50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, 5 mm cetylpyridinium chloride, 1.2% sarkosyl, and 0.02 m Pefabloc) to remove residual PK. The sample was then centrifuged a second time and the supernatant removed. The pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of 0.02 m Tris-Cl, 0.01 m EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% SDS and boiled for 10 min to denature the protein. The SDS was subsequently neutralized by the addition of 5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and 5 μl of 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. A primary rabbit anti-PrP (R24, R18, or R20) antibody was added to the sample and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The protein-antibody complexes were then immune-precipitated with 15 μl of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose/lysis buffer as described for immunoprecipitation of [35S]PrP-sen. After washing the complexes were eluted from the beads by the addition of sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 10 min before the entire sample was run on a 16% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel, fixed, dried, and visualized by phosphor autoradiographic image analysis. Altered Conformation of PrP-res Generated from PrP-sen with Residues Deleted in the N-terminal Region—We have previously shown that deletion of residues 34 to 113 in the N-terminal region of hamster PrP-sen altered the conversion efficiency and conformation of protease-resistant PrP produced in the cell-free conversion assay using PrP-res from the hamster 263K scrapie strain (18Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35265-35271Google Scholar). This conformational alteration was indicated by altered PK digestion, resulting in the presence of three or more protease-resistant bands between 12 and 16 kDa that were found in PrP-res generated from PrP-sen Δ34–113, but not from wild-type or Δ34–94 hamster PrP (18Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35265-35271Google Scholar). To determine more precisely the influence of PrP-sen residues from 94 to 113 in the generation of these 12- to 16-kDa fragments, four additional deletion mutants between 94 and 113 were generated and tested in the cell-free conversion assay (Fig. 1A). Several PrP bands with apparent molecular masses of 12 to 16 kDa were detected at increased levels in the protease-resistant products generated from PrP with deletions at residues 34–99 to 34–124. Thus, it would seem that residues 94–99 were particularly important to the conformation of the PrP-res produced in the cell-free conversion assay. Role of Glycosylation in the Alteration of PrP-res Structure— The previous observations were made using PrP-sen that had been treated with tunicamycin to prevent glycosylation. Thus, it was possible that the differences in PK digestion pattern observed in Fig. 1A were caused by the absence of glycosylation rather than by the effect of deleted PrP residues. To investigate this matter, the cell-free conversion assay was repeated using glycosylated PrP-sen; however, after PK digestion, the protease-resistant material was treated with PNGaseF to remove glycans before SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1B). Similar to the results in Fig. 1A, an increased level of 12–16-kDa bands was seen after PK digestion of PrP-res generated from PrP deletion mutants Δ34–99 to Δ34–124 (Fig. 1B). Because of the similarity between the 12–16-kDa bands generated in Fig. 1, A and B, we concluded that the banding pattern seen was not because of differential protection of PK cleavage sites by glycans but reflected the availability of PK cleavage sites as influenced by the folding of the polypeptide chain to form PrP-res. C-terminal Protease-resistant Fragments of PrP-res Are Generated from PrP-sen with Deletions in the N-terminal Region—To map the location of the PK cleavage sites that resulted in the 12–16-kDa bands, the PK-treated products of the cell-free conversion assay were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed to epitopes at PrP residues 23–37 (anti-N) or residues 218–232 (anti-C) (Fig. 2). The anti-C antibody precipitated all of the protease-resistant bands generated by cell-free conversion of both wild-type hamster PrP-sen and the hamster PrP-sen deletion mutants. This suggested that the new PK cleavage points did not expose the C-terminal portion of PrP to PK digestion. Further mapping of the bands generated from the Δ34–124 deletion mutant with an antibody directed toward residues 142–155 (R18) indicated that the epitope of this antibody was present in the 14-kDa band but not present in the 12-kDa band (Fig. 2). Based on the relative molecular mass of the protease-resistant bands, the approximate composition of the lower molecular mass PrP bands was as follows: 16-kDa band = residues 130–232, the 14-kDa band = residues 142–232, and the 12-kDa band = residues 157–232 (Fig. 2). The absence of the 16-kDa band from the protease-resistant product of Δ34–120 and Δ34–124 suggested that the PK-cleavage site around residue 130 was not exposed in the PrP-res generated from these deletion mutants. These conclusions were supported by immunoprecipitations using the anti-N antibody. No bands were precipitated by the anti-N antibody from PrP-res generated in vitro from wild-type hamster PrP-sen. This was consistent with the known PK-cleavage point at residue 89 in PrP-res (2Prusiner S.B. Groth D.F. Bolton D.C. Kent S.B. Hood L.E. Cell. 1984; 38: 127-134Google Scholar, 3Hope J. Hunter N. Ciba. Found Symp. 1988; 135: 146-163Google Scholar). In contrast, the anti-N antibody precipitated an apparently full-length band for the Δ34–94, Δ34–99, and Δ34–102 deletion mutants (Fig. 2). In the original gels, a very weak signal could also be seen in four other mutants, Δ34–106, Δ34–110, Δ34–113, and Δ34–120. Therefore, the largest protease-resistant band generated from these deletion mutants had the same molecular mass as the PrP-sen from which they were derived, indicating that no internal PK cleavage had occurred. A slightly truncated band (∼2 kDa smaller than the largest band) was present in the lane containing the total conversion product generated from the Δ34–94, Δ34–99, and Δ34–102 deletion mutants. However, the anti-N antibody did not precipitate this band, and it seemed to result from PK cleavage at or around residue 34, which removed the portion of PrP recognized by this antibody. In summary, all the bands from protease-resistant PrP generated in vitro from the PrP deletion mutants had intact C termini and variable N termini caused by cleavage at several new PK sites exposed as a result of an alteration in the conformation of the newly formed PrP-res. Effect of Species Compatibility on Conformation of PrP Generated in Vitro—TSE agents usually show preference for a particular species but can often be adapted to a new species by serial passage (29Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1978; 39: 487-496Google Scholar, 30Hill A.F. Joiner S. Linehan J. Desbruslais M. Lantos P.L. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Caughey B. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10106-10112Google Scholar). The species barrier between mice and hamsters is particularly strong, because mice inoculated with hamster scrapie usually do not become clinically ill even after 2 years, despite evidence for extensive replication of the infectious agent (30Hill A.F. Joiner S. Linehan J. Desbruslais M. Lantos P.L. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10248-10253Google Scholar, 31Race R. Meade-White K. Raines A. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. Chesebro B.

In previous experiments from this laboratory, cross-species conversion of PrP was studied in the cell-free conversion assay using hamster PrP-res and mouse PrP-sen and 12–16-kDa bands were detected in the protease-resistant PrP generated (25Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3923-3927Google Scholar, 33Chabry J. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Nishio J. Hope J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6245-6250Google Scholar, 34Priola S.A. Chabry J. Chan K. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4673-4680Google Scholar). To determine whether these bands were identical to those seen after cell-free conversion using PrP deletion mutants (Fig. 2), conversion reactions were performed using either hamster or mouse PrP-sen with hamster PrP-res, and the PK-digested conversion products were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies reactive with the PrP N or C terminus respectively. The R20 antibody to the C terminus (residues 218–232) precipitated five bands of 12, 14, 16, 18, and 19 kDa from reactions using mouse or hamster PrP-sen (Fig. 3A). These bands all contained an intact C terminus in that they were precipitated by the R20 serum. However, they lacked residues from the PrP N terminus (residues 23–37) because they were not immunoprecipitated by the anti-N serum (data not shown). These bands were similar to the bands characterized in Fig. 2, which suggested that they were generated by PK cleavage at similar sites. Interestingly, the 12–16-kDa bands were found to be much more prominent in the reactions using mouse PrP-sen compared with those using hamster PrP-sen. Because these lower molecular mass bands represent cleavage of PrP-res at newly exposed sites available in PrP-res with an altered conformation, these results indicated that the PrP-res generated by cross-species conversion had an altered structure compared with PrP-res generated in homologous conversion reactions. The similarity of the protease-resistant fragments generated in this cross-species conversion reaction to those generated by the N-terminal deletion mutants suggested that sequence differences in the N-terminal region might be important for this species-specific effect on the conformation of PrP-res generated in the cell-free conversion assay. Mouse and hamster PrP-sen differ at positions 108/109 and 111/112, and these differences have been found to cause partial interference with PrP conversion in scrapie-infected mouse tissue culture cells (35Priola S.A. Caughey B. Race R.E. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4873-4878Google Scholar) and to prevent disease in certain mice (36Supattapone S. Muramoto T. Legname G. Mehlhorn I. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1408-1413Google Scholar). To test whether differences at positions 109 and 112 of HaPrP could also alter PrP-res conformation, these residues were mutated to the mouse residues, valine and leucine, in hamster Δ34–94 PrP, and this mutant was compared with unmutated hamster Δ34–94 PrP in a conversion reaction using hamster PrP-res. The Δ34–94 deletion mutant of hamster PrP-sen was used for this experiment because it did not generate a ragged N-terminal cleavage pattern like that of wild-type hamster PrP-res (18Lawson V.A. Priola S.A. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35265-35271Google Scholar). In these experiments the protease-resistant bands at 12–16 kDa were more prominent for the Δ34–94(LV) deletion mutant than for Δ34–94 (MM) (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, similar to the cross-species conversion reaction in Fig. 3A, there was also a significant increase in the percentage of 12–16-kDa protease-resistant PrP. Therefore, differences at positions 109 and 112 of HaPrP seemed to be in part responsible for the generation of PrP-res with an altered conformation in cross-species PrP-res formation (Fig. 3A). Detection of Truncated Forms of PrP-res with Intact C Termini in Mouse Scrapie Brain—The truncated PrP-res fragments observed in our in vitro assay might be unique to the cell-free conversion system used. To test whether similar N-terminally truncated PrP-res peptides with intact C termini were produced in vivo during scrapie infection of mice and hamsters, several scrapie brain homogenates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies reactive with the C terminus (R20) of PrP. Control immunoblots with the R30 antibody (residues 89–103) detected the usual three glycoforms associated with PrP27–30 (Fig. 4A, bottom). However, immunoblots with the R20 antibody detected additional bands at or below 18 kDa in PrP-res isolated from mice infected with RML and ME7 scrapie strains but not in hamsters infected with 263K (Fig. 4A, top). Therefore, numerous different N-terminally truncated PrP fragments with intact C termini were generated by PK diges"

In previous studies, our laboratory demonstrated that ceramide regulated this 5′ splice site selection, inducing the production of Bcl-x(s) mRNA with a concomitant decrease in Bcl-x(L) correlating with sensitization to chemotherapy (Chalfant, C. E., Rathman, K., Pinkerman, R. L., Wood, R. E., Obeid, L. M., Ogretmen, B., and Hannun, Y. A. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 12587–12595). We have now identified several possible RNA cis-elements within exon 2 of Bcl-x pre-mRNA by sequence analysis. To study the possible roles of these RNA cis-elements in regulating the alternative 5′ splice site selection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA, we developed a BCL-x minigene construct which conferred the same ratio of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-x(s) mRNA as the endogenous Bcl-x and was responsive to ceramide treatment. Mutagenesis of either a purine-rich splicing enhancer or a pyrimidine tract element within exon 2 induced a change in the ratio of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-x(s) mRNA from 7 to 1 and 0.23, thereby diminishing the selection of the Bcl-x(L) 5′ splice site with a concomitant increase in Bcl-x(s) 5′ splice site selection. Furthermore, mutagenesis of these cis-elements abolished the ability of ceramide to affect the 5′ splice site selection. In vitro binding assays coupled with competitor studies demonstrated specific binding of RNA trans-activating proteins to these regions. SDS-PAGE analysis of cross-linked RNA trans-activating factors with these RNA cis-elements revealed the binding of 215-, 120-, and 30-kDa proteins to the purine-rich element and 120- and 76-kDa proteins to the pyrimidine tract element. In addition, exogenous treatment of A549 cells with ceramide increased the formation of protein complexes with these RNA cis-elements. Therefore, we have identified two ceramide-responsive RNA cis-elements within exon 2 of Bcl-x pre-mRNA, and this is the first report of an RNA cis-element responsive to a bioactive lipid.

Furthermore, endogenous ceramide has been found recently to modulate the phosphorylation status of SR proteins in a PP1-dependent manner (26Chalfant C.E. Ogretmen B. Galadari S. Kroesen B.J. Pettus B.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44848-44855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). PP1 also associates with the splice factor, PTB-associated splicing factor (PSF), and the PP1 regulatory subunit, nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1), has been demonstrated to co-localize with splicing factors (15Misteli T.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, dephosphorylation of SR proteins stimulated by PP1 induces alternative 5′ splice site selection in adeno pre-mRNA in vitro, demonstrating that pre-mRNA splicing events are regulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (29Cardinali B. Cohen P.T. Lamond A.I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, PP1 plays an important role in regulating mRNA processing.To this end, our laboratory recently described a pathway linking the generation of ceramide and activation of PP1 to the regulation of the alternative 5′ splice site selection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA. Ceramide treatment resulted in a decrease in Bcl-x(L) mRNA with concomitant increase in Bcl-x(s) mRNA in A549 cells. This effect required the generation of endogenous ceramide through the de novo pathway, and more importantly, inhibitors of protein phosphatase-1 abolished the ability of ceramide to affect Bcl-x alternative splicing (30Chalfant C.E. Rathman K. Pinkerman R.L. Wood R.E. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12587-12595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thus, both the phospho-state of SR proteins and Bcl-x 5′ splice site selection are regulated by the generation of de novo ceramide and subsequent PP1 activation.The involvement of PP1 and endogenous ceramide in the dephosphorylation of SR proteins and the effects on Bcl-x alternative splicing suggested ceramide regulated the protein-RNA complexes that mediate the 5′ splice site selection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA. In this study, we identified a purine-rich RNA cis-element that corresponds to an SRp30a-binding site, as well as a polypyrimidine tract site known to bind RNA splice factors, such as PSF, within exon 2 of Bcl-x mRNA. Furthermore, both RNA cis-elements regulated Bcl-x 5′ splice site selection and were found to be responsive to ceramide.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—A549 adenocarcinoma cells were grown in 50% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at less than 80% confluency under standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). For treatments with d-erythro-C6 ceramide (Matreya) or long chain ceramides (Brain) (Sigma), A549 cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/35-mm plate in the same media.BCL-x Minigene Construct—PCR amplification of Bcl-x genomic sequence was accomplished using Human Genomic DNA (Promega) as template and two separate amplification reactions. The first PCR amplified a 1443-bp sequence of the BCL-x gene containing exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, and the flanking region of intron 2 and utilized the following primers: sense, 5′-GCATTCCTCGAGGGCGGATTTGAATGTAGGT-3′; antisense, 5′-GCATTCGCGGCCGCGAGAGAAGCCCAGGATAGGAC-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). The amplification reaction was carried out for 30 cycles (94 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 1.5 min). The second PCR amplified a 477-bp sequence of the BCL-x gene containing the flanking region of intron 2 and partial exon 3 used the following primers: sense, 5′-GCATTCGCGGCCGCCCTGACCCTGCCCATCTCGTT-3′; antisense, 5′-GCATTCAAGCTTACCAGCGGTTGAAGCGTTCCT-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). The PCR was carried out for 30 cycles (94 °C, 30 s; 56 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 40 s). The BCL-x minigene was then constructed in the plasmid, pcDNA 3.1(–) (Invitrogen), by a two-step process. In step 1, the 477-bp fragment was cloned into the plasmid by using restriction enzymes NotI and HindIII. In step 2, the 1443-bp fragment was cloned into the plasmid by using restriction enzymes XhoI and NotI. For both fragments, inclusion and proper orientation were verified by sequence analysis. The final construct contained a minigene product of 1.92 kb (Fig. 1).Transfection—A549 cells were transfected with the BCL-x minigene construct using Superfect reagent (Qiagen Corp.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, A549 cells were plated at 40–50% confluency in 6-well tissue culture dishes 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid mixed with 10 μl of Superfect reagent for 4 h. After 24 h, the cells were treated with d-erythro-C6 ceramide for 16 h and examined for minigene expression by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR.RT-PCR Assay—Total RNA from A549 cells was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg of A549 total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) and the Superscript II preamplification kit (Invitrogen). 1 μl of the reverse transcription reaction was amplified using a specific primer for the pcDNA 3.1 cDNA sequence (5′-AAA CTT AAG CTT GGT ACC GAG-3′) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), a specific primer to Bcl-x exon 2 (5′-GGA GCT GGT GGT TGA CTT TCT-3′) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), and Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Following 25 cycles (94 °C, 30 s melt; and 68 °C, 1 min anneal/extension), the PCR was examined by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.Mutagenesis—The five potential cis-elements within exon 2 of the BCL-x minigene construct were mutated to produce replacement mutants using the Chameleon mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutants were sequenced to verify mutations and control for abnormalities in cloning at the MUSC core facility.Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from both HeLa and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells according to the method of Dignam et al. (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9140) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modification of the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad).Electromobility Shift Assay—The following sequences were used for fluorescein-tagged RNA oligonucleotides: CRCE 1, r(5′-Fl-GAGGGAGGCAGGCGACGAC), and CRCE 2, r(5′-Fl-CCUUUUUCUCCUUC) (Qiagen-Xergon). RNA binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing 400 ng of CRCE 1 or CRCE 2 fluorescein-oligonucleotide, 50 μg of nuclear protein extract, 40 units of RNAsin, and 11.3 μg of tRNAs in buffer composed of 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 120 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min followed by 5 min of UV cross-linking. Samples were loaded on a 5% TBE Criterion™ Precast Gel (Bio-Rad) for electrophoretic separation of RNA-protein(s) complexes for 1.5 h at 115 V at 4 °C. The gel was then scanned using Molecular Imager® FX (Bio-Rad) with a 488 nm EX (530 nm BP) laser.SDS-PAGE Analysis—Following the same procedures for the binding reactions described for electromobility shift assay (EMSA) (above), samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer for 10 min and then loaded on a denaturing, 15% Tris-HCl Criterion™ Precast Gel for determination of the molecular weights of the separated RNA-protein(s) complexes.Competition Studies—Competition studies were performed using 100-fold molar excess of either specific or nonspecific oligonucleotide competitor. The following competitor sequences were used: nonspecific competitor, 5′-GAA UUC GCA CGU UA-3′; CRCE 1-specific competitor, 5′-GAG GGA GGC AGG CGA CGA-3′; and CRCE 2-specific competitor, 5′-CCU UUU UCU CCU UC-3′.RESULTSIdentification of RNA cis-Elements in Exon 2 of the BCL-x Gene—Previously, our laboratory reported that the alternative 5′ splice site selection of Bcl-x was regulated by ceramide, correlating with the phosphorylation status of SR proteins (26Chalfant C.E.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation status of SR proteins has been shown to regulate 5′ splice site selection (29Cardinali B. Cohen P.T. Lamond A.I. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, exon 2 of the BCL-x gene was examined for sequences known to bind specific SR proteins as well as for other possible RNA cis-elements (32Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). One possible SRp30a-binding site (site 1, position 625–638 bp from Bcl-x intron 2), two possible SRp40-binding sites (sites 2 and 3, positions 462–475 and 348–360 bp, respectively, from Bcl-x intron 2), a purine-rich exon splicing enhancer (site 4, position 277–295 bp from Bcl-x intron 2), and one pyrimidine tract site (site 5, position 127–140 bp from Bcl-x intron 2) were found within exon 2 (Fig. 1, panel A).To determine whether these RNA cis-elements played a role in regulating the alternative 5′ splice site selection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA, a functional minigene was constructed by ligation of two DNA fragments of the BCL-x gene containing exon 1, intron 1, exon 2 (containing all five potential cis-elements), part of intron 2, and part of exon 3 (Fig. 1, panel B). These possible RNA cis-elements were modified in the minigene construct by replacement mutagenesis (Fig. 1, panel A). By using this method, the sequences were mutated without affecting the distances between splice sites within exon 2, and thus, reducing the possibility of artifactual results. Mutation of the purinerich RNA cis-element (ceramide-responsive RNA cis-element 1, CRCE 1) changed the ratio of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-x(s) mRNA from 7 to 1. Mutation of the pyrimidine tract (CRCE 2) between the Bcl-x(s) and Bcl-x(L) 5′ splice sites significantly blocked the production of minigene BCL-x(L) mRNA, changing the ratio from 7 to 0.23. Furthermore, ceramide did not affect the alternative splicing of both these Bcl-x mutants (Fig. 1, panel C). Mutation of the other three cis-elements within exon 2 had no effect on the basal and ceramide-induced RNA processing of Bcl-x pre-mRNA (data not shown). Therefore, two regulatory sites for Bcl-x 5′ splice site selection were identified within exon 2, and these sites act as either possible enhancers of the Bcl-x(L) 5′ splice site or silencers of the Bcl-x(s) 5′ splice site.RNA trans-Activating Factors Specifically Bind the Ceramide-responsive cis-Elements—Once the potential CRCEs were identified, the ability of RNA trans-activating factors to bind these RNA cis-elements was examined. Binding assays using nuclear extracts from A549 and HeLa cells and a fluorescein-tagged oligonucleotide sequence for CRCE 1 or CRCE 2 were UV cross-linked and analyzed by an EMSA. Both nuclear extracts retarded the mobility of the oligonucleotides, producing several protein-RNA complexes by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The specificity of these complex formations in A549 nuclear extracts was confirmed by the use of specific or nonspecific competitor oligonucleotides and denaturing gel analysis. The approximate molecular weights of the specific protein(s) complexed to CRCE 1 were determined to be 215, 120, and 30 kDa, and binding of these proteins to CRCE 1 was eradicated upon the addition of a 100-fold specific competitor (Fig. 2, panel A). Similar analysis of CRCE 2 revealed specific protein(s) complexes of 120 and 76 kDa that, as with CRCE 1, were eradicated upon the addition of a 100-fold specific competitor (Fig. 2, panel B). These results demonstrate that RNA trans-activating factors bind/complex specifically with the CRCEs. Similar results were obtained using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells (data not shown).Fig. 2The binding specificity of RNA trans-activating factors to the CRCEs. Nuclear extracts were prepared from A549 cells and subjected to EMSA binding conditions by reacting with labeled CRCE 1 or CRCE 2 followed by UV cross-linking. 100 × of non-labeled nonspecific competitor (NSC) or specific competitor (SC) was included in the binding assay to show specificity of RNA-protein complexes. Binding analysis was performed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (panels A and B). Closed arrows indicate specific RNA-protein(s) complexes, and open arrows indicate nonspecific RNA-protein(s) complexes. Each control was run on the same gel as the corresponding data; however, where applicable, control lanes were affixed to the left-most region of each gel for the ease of the reader. The data are representative of six separate determinations on six separate occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ceramide Regulates the Binding of RNA trans-Activating Factors to the CRCEs—Exposure of A549 cells to d-erythro-C6 ceramide solubilized in ethanol (EtOH) induces the production of endogenous ceramide after 12 h (data not shown). To determine whether the binding of RNA trans-activating factors to the CRCEs is responsive to ceramide, A549 cells were treated with exogenous ceramide at a concentration (20 μm) and time (>12 h) that induces de novo ceramide generation and alternative 5′ splice site selection of the Bcl-x exon 2 (26Chalfant C.E.

Nuclear extracts from A549 cells treated with 20 μm cell-permeable d-erythro-C6 ceramide for 12 and 30 h demonstrated an increase in protein-oligonucleotide complex formation for CRCE 1 and CRCE 2 as determined by EMSA (data not shown). An increase in complex formation was also observed for the 215-, 120-, and 30-kDa protein(s) complexes to CRCE 1 at both 12 and 30 h of ceramide treatment (Fig. 3, panel A). Similarly, an increase in complex formation at both 12 and 30 h of ceramide treatment was also observed for CRCE 2 bound to protein(s) having molecular weights of 120 and 76 kDa (Fig. 3, panel B). Thus, exogenous ceramide at treatment points that induce the activation of the Bcl-x(s) 5′ splice site and induce the production of endogenous long chain ceramides also induce the stable formation of protein complexes with the CRCEs.Fig. 3The effect of exogenous short chain ceramide on binding of RNA trans-activating factors to the CRCEs. Nuclear extracts from A549 cells treated with 20 μm d-erythro-C6 ceramide for 12 and 30 h were prepared and subjected to EMSA binding conditions and PAGE-SDS analysis by reacting with labeled CRCE 1 (panel A) or CRCE 2 (panel B) followed by UV cross-linking. Arrows indicate specific RNA-protein(s) complexes that are affected by ceramide treatment.

Acute treatment of A549 cells with brain ceramides (10 μm) induced a significant increase in the protein-CRCE 1 and protein-CRCE 2 complexes as early as 30 min (Fig. 4, panels A and B). Thus, long chain (natural) ceramides induce a rapid increase in the complex formation of proteins to the CRCEs.Fig. 4The effect of long chain (natural) ceramides on binding of RNA trans-activating factors to the CRCEs. A549 cells treated with brain ceramides (10 μm) solubilized in 2% dodecane, 98% EtOH (final concentration in treatments was 0.002% dodecane/0.098% EtOH) for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were then prepared and subjected to EMSA binding conditions by reacting with labeled CRCE 1 (panel A) or CRCE 2 (panel B) followed by UV cross-linking. The data depict SDS-PAGE analysis of protein-CRCE complexes. Arrows indicate specific RNA-protein(s) complexes that are affected by ceramide treatment.

In this study, two RNA cis-elements have been identified that regulate the alternative 5′ splice site selection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA. Furthermore, the protein-RNA interaction of these RNA cis-elements was regulated by ceramide, and we therefore designated the RNA sequences as ceramide-responsive RNA cis-elements (CRCEs). These findings are important for several reasons. First, they provide a mechanistic understanding of the regulation of Bcl-x alternative splicing. Second, a direct link between ceramide, SR proteins, and the regulation of Bcl-x RNA processing has now been substantiated. Finally, this is the first identification of RNA-protein interactions responsive to a bioactive lipid.Many reports in the literature demonstrate that the physiological fate of the cell can be determined by the ratio of anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) to pro-apoptotic Bcl-x(s), and induction of pro-apoptotic Bcl-x(s) sensitizes cells to chemotherapeutic agents (35Minn A.J.

This has been demonstrated by specifically redirecting the alternative 5′ splice site selection of Bcl-x to increase the expression of Bcl-x(s) at the expense of the levels of Bcl-x(L) (36Taylor J.K.

It has previously been shown that suramin is a potent, reversible, and competitive inhibitor of PTP1B and Yersinia PTP (YopH). We therefore screened 45 suramin analogs against a panel of seven PTPs, including PTP1B, YopH, CD45, Cdc25A, VHR, PTPα, and LAR, to identify compounds with improved potency and specificity. Of the 45 compounds, we found 11 to have inhibitory potency comparable or significantly improved relative to suramin. We also found suramin to be a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 1.5 μm) of Cdc25A, a phosphatase that mediates cell cycle progression and a potential target for cancer therapy. In addition we also found three other compounds, NF201, NF336, and NF339, to be potent (IC50 < 5 μm) and specific (at least 20–30-fold specificity with respect to the other human PTPs tested) inhibitors of Cdc25A. Significantly, we found two potent and specific inhibitors, NF250 and NF290, for YopH, the phosphatase that is an essential virulence factor for bubonic plague. Two of the compounds tested, NF504 and NF506, had significantly improved potency as PTP inhibitors for all phosphatases tested except for LAR and PTPα. Surprisingly, we found that a significant number of these compounds activated the receptor-like phosphatases, PTPα and LAR. In further characterizing this activation phenomenon, we reveal a novel role for the membrane-distal cytoplasmic PTP domain (D2) of PTPα: the direct intramolecular regulation of the activity of the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic PTP domain (D1). Binding of certain of these compounds to PTPα disrupts D1-D2 basal state contacts and allows new contacts to occur between D1 and D2, which activates D1 by as much as 12–14-fold when these contacts are optimized.

Originally it was suspected that PTPs were simply relatively nonspecific housekeeping enzymes that existed to turn off the pathways that were turned on by the tyrosine kinases. It is now known that of the ∼100 PTPs encoded in the human genome, many have very specific regulatory functions in all aspects of cellular function, such as cell growth, metabolism, and cell division. In fact, several PTPs have emerged as attractive drug targets (5Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence indicates that inhibitors of PTP1B, which dephosphorylates and inactivates the insulin receptor, could be used to treat diabetes and obesity (6Elchebly M. Payette P.

In fact, at one time it was widely held that finding potent and specific inhibitors of PTPs would be impossible because of the highly conserved nature of the PTP active site. Although some strides have been made within the last few years in overcoming this obstacle, the search for specific inhibitors remains a major challenge of the field. Currently there are only a few reported highly potent and specific PTP1B (12Shen K. Keng Y.F. Wu L. Guo X.L. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol.

No potent or specific inhibitors are described for PTPα, LAR, or CD45, and until recently, the most potent Cdc25 inhibitors were in the low micromolar range, often with low or undetermined specificity (14Loukaci A.

However, its demonstrated effects on many diverse pathways would certainly lead to unwanted side effects. We reasoned that slight variations in the suramin structure may lead to PTP inhibitors with improved potency and specificity without sacrificing its desirable absorption and distribution properties. Therefore, we obtained a library of suramin-like compounds and screened them for inhibitory activity against a panel of clinically important phosphatases, PTP1B, YopH, CD45, LAR, PTPα, VHR, and Cdc25A. We report several compounds with markedly improved potency and specificity over suramin in inhibiting PTP1B and CD45, several potent and specific inhibitors of Cdc25A and YopH, and interestingly, several compounds that activate the PTP activity of LAR and PTPα. In doing so, we provide novel lead structures for further optimization to generate tools to study the in vivo PTP function and additional evidence that it is possible to obtain potent and specific PTP inhibitors despite the fact that these enzymes all share the same active site architecture.In further characterizing the activation of PTPα by these compounds, we reveal a novel role for the membrane-distal cytoplasmic domain (D2) of PTPα: the intramolecular regulation of the activity of the membrane-proximal domain (D1). We show that these compounds do not affect the activity of PTPα-D1 expressed alone and that mutations aimed to disrupt D1-D2 interactions in the linker/spacer regions cause enhanced affinity for and activation by these compounds. This is a particularly significant finding in that most studies of receptor-like PTPs suggest that the major role for the D2 domain is in mediating dimerization-induced inhibition. Any activating functions of the D2 domain have been attributed to the blocking of this dimerization-induced inhibition (24Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. Overvoorde J. den Hertog J. J. Biol.

Our results do not contradict these findings but rather show that D2 can play an additional role in the direct intramolecular regulation of D1 activity through a conformational change.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSuramin and Its Analogs—Suramin (sodium salt) was obtained from Sigma. The suramin analogs employed in this study were synthesized by methods described previously (26Nickel P. Haack H.J. Widjaja H. Ardunay U. Gurgel C. Duwel D. Loewe H. Raether W.

Ostwald U. Nickel P. Haack H.J. Widjaja H. Ardunay U. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1985; 12: 659Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The purity of the compounds was confirmed by TLC and HPLC (30Kassack M. Nickel P. J. Chromatography B. 1996; 686: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Some of the compounds were synthesized years ago. Repeated HPLC investigations showed the stability of the compounds after a long storage at room temperature. Even in aqueous solution (pH 7.4), degradation appears to proceed very slowly (31Kassack M. Nickel P. Arch. Pharm.-Pharm. Med.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16088-16096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified according to the previously published procedures at 4 °C. Mutant PTPα enzymes (416AA, G496V, and 529AA) were constructed according to the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The mutants were purified as the wild type enzyme. The PTPα enzymes and mutants used for the limited proteolysis and activation assays were subjected to the additional step of ion exchange chromatography using a 1-ml MonoQ column on an AKTA purifier fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) in pH 8.5 Tris buffer.Enzyme Inhibition Assays—All of the assays were done at 25 °C and pH 7.0 using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (Sigma) as the substrate in 100-μl reaction volumes in 1.1-ml polypropylene tubes (Marsh Biomedical). The buffer used was 50 mm 3,3-dimethyl glutarate with the ionic strength adjusted to 150 mm with sodium chloride. The assays were initiated by adding an appropriate amount of enzyme and quenched with 100 μl of 2 m sodium hydroxide. 150 μl of each quenched reaction mixture was then added to a well of a 96-well titer plate where the absorbance was read at 405 nm using a SpectraMax 340 plate reader from Molecular Devices. For each enzyme, the kcat and Km values were determined by employing a series of pNPP concentrations and fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. For each compound, the IC50 determination was done with the pNPP concentration fixed at the experimentally determined Km value for each enzyme. The compound concentrations employed were 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10, and 20 μm. The IC50 value was determined by plotting the relative pNPP activity versus inhibitor concentration and fitting to Equation 1 using Kaleidagraph. Vi/V0=IC50/(IC50+[I])(Eq. 1) In this case, Vi is the reaction velocity when the inhibitor concentration is [I], V0 is the reaction velocity with no inhibitor, and IC50 = Ki + Ki[S]/Km. Therefore, when the substrate concentration [S] is equal to Km, IC50 = 2Ki.Protease Sensitivity Assays—The time course for trypsin sensitivity assays were done as follows at 25 °C. A 60-μl (final volume) reaction was set up containing 5 μm PTPα, 50 mm 3,3-dimethyl glutarate (pH 7.0), and 2.5 mm CaCl2. Trypsin (0.05 ng/μl, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated from Sigma) was then added. 8-μl aliquots were taken out and quenched by mixing with 2 μl of SDS sample buffer at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min. An identical reaction was also done with 100 μm NF506 in the reaction mixture. The quenched protease reactions were then all run on a 12.5% acrylamide SDS gel. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and then washed with water twice for 15 min each time to produce Fig. 8A. The pertinent bands were then cut with a scalpel, diced into ∼1-mm cubes, and placed into separate 0.6-ml low protein binding tubes. The in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry was then done according to published procedures (www.narrador.embl-heidelberg.de, and http://www.donatello.ucsf.edu/ingel.html). All mass spectrometry experiments were performed with a LCA DECA XP ion trap mass spectrometer.Activation Assays—0.39 μm PTPα was reacted with 32 mm pNPP at 25 °C with varying amounts of NF506. The reactions were quenched after 6 min, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm as under “Enzyme Inhibition Assays.” The absorbance versus inhibitor concentration data was fit to Equation 2 to determine the Kd value for the binding of NF506 to PTPα. A=A0-((A0-Amax)([PTPα]+[NF506]+Kd)-(([PTPα]+[NF506]+Kd)2-4[PTPα][NF506])1/2))/2[PTPα](Eq. 2) In this equation, A is the absorbance at 405 nm, A0 is the absorbance at 405 nm with no NF506 present, and Amax is the maximum absorbance at 405 nm as [NF506] approaches infinity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCompounds with the Suramin Core Structure—Fig. 1 shows the structure of suramin along with a table that lists the variants of suramin that were employed in this study. Also shown are the IC50 values obtained with PTP1B, Yersinia PTP (YopH), CD45, Cdc25A, and VHR. The measured IC50 value of 11 μm for suramin against PTP1B agrees well with the Ki value of 4 μm obtained previously (2Zhang Y.-L. Keng Y.-F. Zhao Y. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12281-12287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). When an inhibitor binds reversibly and competitively, as suramin does to PTP1B, the IC50 value determined when the substrate concentration is equal to the Km is twice the Ki value as shown under “Experimental Procedures”. In this study, the substrate (pNPP) concentration employed for each PTP was equal to the Km of the enzyme. We tested several of the suramin analogs against several of the PTPs used in this study. In all cases the inhibition was found to be reversible and competitive. Additionally, none of the suramin analogs have any functionality that would be expected to irreversibly inactivate PTPs. Therefore, all of the IC50 values reported in this study should directly reflect the affinity of the compound for the PTPs tested. Surprisingly none of the compounds shown in Fig. 1 nor any of the compounds employed in this study were found to inhibit LAR or PTPα, but rather many were found to moderately activate these phosphatases. Thus, for LAR and PTPα, the relative phosphatase activity at 10 μm compound concentration is shown. This series of compounds was used in an attempt to gain a structure activity relationship of the suramin analogs to determine which parts of suramin were required for inhibitory activity and which parts could tolerate major variations.Fig. 1Compounds with suramin core structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the most part, all variations of the suramin core structure tested here were well tolerated. For PTP1B, similar IC50 values were obtained with suramin and the other compounds with suramin core structures. Substitutions at the R2 position had little effect on the affinity of the compounds for the phosphatases tested. Interestingly, even changing the naphthyl trisulfonate moiety into phenyl sulfonate (NF062) did not appreciably change the IC50 value for PTP1B. In general, the same trend was observed for the other PTPs examined in this study except for CD45, which showed a 5-fold increase in the IC50 values for NF062. It was suspected previously that the high affinity of suramin for PTPs was not simply due to the presence of an aryl sulfonate moiety, which would potentially serve as a phosphotyrosine mimic and bind to the active site of PTPs (2Zhang Y.-L. Keng Y.-F. Zhao Y. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12281-12287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because the Ki value of sulfosalicylic acid for Yersinia PTP was 5,700-fold larger than that of suramin, it was concluded that other structural features of suramin, such as the additional aryl sulfonate ring of the naphthyl sulfonate moiety or the suramin core structure, were important for high affinity binding. Our results suggest that it is the suramin core structure rather than the additional aryl sulfonate ring that is important for high affinity PTP binding because NF062 retains the ability to bind with high affinity to PTPs, although it is missing this additional ring.It also appears that both halves of the symmetrical suramin core structure are required for high affinity binding to all PTPs studied. The compound NF520 (Fig. 1), which is one-half of the suramin structure minus the central urea group, did not significantly inhibit any of the PTPs used in this study. This requirement for both halves of the molecule for activity has been noted in other systems involving suramin, such as the inhibition of angiogenesis by suramin and its analogs (38Gagliardi A.R. Kassack M. Kreimeyer A. Muller G. Nickel P. Collins D.C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 41: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Interestingly, suramin was found to bind with high affinity to the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25A, but not VHR, another dual specificity phosphatase. The IC50 value of suramin (1.5 μm) for Cdc25A makes it as good or better than most of the Cdc25 inhibitors reported to date (14Loukaci A. Le Saout I. Samadi M. Leclerc S. Damiens E. Meijer L.

Cdc25A along with Cdc25B and Cdc25C are dual specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate and activate cyclin-dependent kinases, thereby driving progression through the cell cycle (39Coleman T.R.

Importantly, it has also been shown that treatment of tumor cell lines with Cdc25 inhibitors inhibits tumor growth or causes cell cycle arrest (15Peng H. Xie W. Otterness D.M. Cogswell J.P.

Cancer. 1999; 35: 1388-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which validates Cdc25 as a drug target and makes inhibitors of Cdc25 very valuable. It has been known for some time that suramin treatment increases the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Cdc2, a cyclin-dependent kinase responsible for initiation of mitosis (54Bojanowski K. Nishio K. Fukuda M. Larsen A.K. Saijo N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1574-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the function of Cdc25 is to remove the inhibitory phosphorylations in Cdc2 on tyrosine 15 (as well as threonine 14), it is tempting to speculate that suramin leads to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc2 by inhibiting Cdc25. Further, because it has been shown that inhibiting Cdc25 leads to cell cycle arrest, it is possible that the antitumor activity of suramin may be due in part to the inhibition of Cdc25.Slight Variations of the Suramin Core Structure—The compounds NF171 and NF280 (Fig. 2) are virtually identical to suramin except that the intermediate rings contain para-linkages rather than meta-linkages as in suramin. NF279 has para-linkages in the innermost rings as well as in the intermediate rings. Interestingly, as the bottom panel of Fig. 2 indicates, these slight variations can have substantial effects on the inhibitory properties of these molecules. NF171 differs from suramin only in that the terminating naphthyl trisulfonate moiety is connected to the para-position of the intermediate ring, yet it shows roughly a 3-fold enhancement and 2-fold reduction in binding affinity for PTP1B and CD45, respectively. NF280 is the same as NF171 except that it is missing the methyl groups on the intermediate rings, which leads to a 7-fold enhancement in aff"
https://openalex.org/W1980230989,"RGS6 is a member of a subfamily of mammalian RGS proteins that possess DEP (disheveled, Egl-10, pleckstrin) and GGL (G protein γ subunit-like) domains in addition to the hallmark RGS domain. RGS proteins negatively regulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling by virtue of the GTPase-activating protein activity of their RGS domains. RGS6 exists in multiple splice forms with a long (6L) or short (6S) N terminus, a complete or incomplete GGL domain, in combination with various C-terminal domains. Green fluorescent protein-tagged RGS6L and RGS6S forms exhibit predominantly cytoplasmic and nuclear patterns of distribution in COS-7 cells, respectively, and traffic from these sites to nucleoli in response to stress signaling. We undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen for nuclear RGS6-binding proteins and here identify DMAP1 as an RGS6-interacting protein. DMAP1 is a component of the Dnmt1 complex involved in repression of newly replicated genes. The domains of interaction were mapped to the N-terminal region of the GGL domain of RGS6, a region distinct from its Gβ5 binding region, and the C-terminal domain of DMAP1. Gβ5 and DMAP1 did not compete for each other's interaction with RGS6. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in COS-7 cells showed that RGS6L and RGS6S, but not RGS6LΔ258-293 deletion mutant lacking a DMAP1-binding module, co-immunoprecipitate DMAP1 as well as Dnmt1 in a DMAP1-dependent manner. A recombinant GGL domain of RGS6 precipitated endogenous DMAP1 and Dnmt1 in neuroblastoma cell lysates and endogenous DMAP1 co-immunoprecipitated with RGS6L from mouse brain. Co-expression of DMAP1 with RGS6L promoted nuclear migration of RGS6L and its co-localization with DMAP1, a response not observed with RGS6LΔ258-293. RGS6 inhibited the transcriptional repressor activity of DMAP1. RGS6 is the first member of the RGS protein family shown to interact with proteins involved in transcriptional regulation.

These proteins are defined by the presence of a semi-conserved region of ∼120 amino acids called the RGD. In mammals, 30 genes encode proteins with this domain, with alternative splicing of some RGS transcripts contributing additional diversity within this family. The RGD is responsible for the GTPase-activating activity of RGS proteins toward G protein α subunits, providing a mechanism by which RGS proteins inactivate Gα subunits, leading to their recombination with Gβγ subunits, thereby terminating signaling by Gα and Gβγ subunits (3De Vries L.

Interference with G protein signaling by some RGS proteins may involve interactions with receptors that activate G proteins (5Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W.

Biol. 2002; 22: 4334-4345Google Scholar) has shown that several RGS proteins are localized at sites other than the plasma membrane, including the nucleus, where G proteins and their activating receptors and effectors are not believed to exist. We showed that some RGS proteins localize predominantly in the nucleus (RGS2 and RGS10) or at unique subnuclear sites (RGS12TS) and that others are nucleocytoplasmic shuttle proteins (RGS4 and RGS16) (8Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the semiconserved RGS domain contains nuclear targeting signals and that some RGS proteins possess a prototypic nuclear export signal that allows them to shuttle back out of the nucleus. These findings raise questions of considerable interest and importance regarding the possible role of nuclear RGS proteins. Recently, we identified 36 splice variant forms of RGS6 (15Chatterjee T.K. Liu Z. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30261-30271Google Scholar), a member of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins that possess DEP (Drosophila/EGL10/Pleckstrin) homology and GGL (G protein γ subunit-like) domains in addition to an RGS domain. Of interest, all splice forms possessed the same RGD but had long (6L) or short (6S) N-terminal domains, existing with a complete or incomplete (-GGL) GGL domain and nine different C-terminal tails. RGS6L and RGS6S splice forms, upon expression in cells, exhibited predominant localization in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. In a related study, we showed that mild heat or proteotoxic stress, known activators of the heat shock response pathway, promoted trafficking of these proteins from their cytoplasmic or nuclear sites to nucleoli, providing new evidence linking RGS proteins to the stress signaling pathway (16Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30272-30282Google Scholar). Mapping of the stress-induced targeting domain in RGS6 proteins identified the RGS domain, the defining structural element of this protein family, as a primary determinant in stress-induced nucleolar targeting, and we demonstrated similar nucleolar accumulation of a variety of RGS proteins in response to proteotoxic stress. In an attempt to provide insight into the functional role of RGS proteins in the nucleus, we employed yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify proteins that interact with RGS6, one of the RGS proteins we found to exhibit constitutive or signaling-induced trafficking to and within the nucleus. Here we report a high affinity interaction between RGS6 and DMAP1, a protein identified and named based upon its interaction with Dnmt1 (17Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Google Scholar). DMAP1 has transcriptional repressor activity, and Dnmt1 is a multifunctional protein that is a critical DNA methyltransferase important for chromatin structure and gene silencing as well as methyltransferase-independent transcriptional repression (17Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Google Scholar, 18Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Google Scholar, 19Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L.

Our studies demonstrate interaction of RGS6 and DMAP1 in yeast and mammalian cells and define the structural determinants required for this interaction. We define a new structural motif within the GGL domain of RGS6, identified originally as a binding motif for Gβ5 (22Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Google Scholar), that mediates its high affinity interaction with DMAP1, and we show that RGS6 interacts with Dnmt1 in a DMAP1-dependent manner. Binding of DMAP1 and Gβ5 to RGS6 is not mutually exclusive. RGS6 and DMAP1 were shown to interact in the context of whole cells, and this interaction was dependent upon the identified DMAP1-binding module of RGS6. RGS6, but not the DMAP1-interacting proteins TSG101 and Dnmt1, inhibited the functional activity of DMAP1 as a transcriptional repressor, demonstrating that the interaction between RGS6 and DMAP1 is functionally relevant. RGS6 is the first member of the RGS protein family shown to interact with proteins involved in transcriptional regulation. These results provide new evidence linking RGS proteins to proteins involved in regulating gene expression. Materials—pEGFP vector, pGBKT7, pACT2, pretransformed brain MATCHMAKER library, pM vector, and anti-GFP monoclonal antibody were purchased from Clontech. pCR2.1 TOPO TA cloning vector, pTrcHis2 TOPO TA cloning vector, and anti-GFP polyclonal antibody were from Invitrogen, and pCMV vector was from Stratagene. Antibody to and cDNA encoding mouse Gβ5 was a generous gift of Dr. William Simonds (National Institutes of Health) and Dr. Vladen Slepak (University of Miami), respectively. Anti-FLAG-HRP and anti-Dnmt1 polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma, and anti-DMAP1 polyclonal antibody was from Affinity Bioreagents. Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Ni-NTA Superflow was from Qiagen. pcDNA3.1/His-Dnmt1 was a kind gift from Dr. Szyf (McGill University). Anti-RGS6L-conjugated agarose was prepared using the Immunopure rProtein A IgG Plus orientation kit from Pierce. PCR Amplification/Preparation of EGFP-RGS6, FLAG-DMAP1, and FLAG-TSG101 Constructs—All of the human RGS6 protein constructs prepared and used in this study correspond to the C-terminal splice forms that we designated α2 (15Chatterjee T.K. Liu Z. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30261-30271Google Scholar). Full-length human DMAP1 was PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers and human brain cDNA library as template. Various RGS6 cDNAs, DMAP1, and TSG101 protein cDNAs were PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers incorporating restriction sites to facilitate their cloning into EGFP vector or pCMV2B vector. Amplified RGS6 or DMAP1 cDNAs with appropriate restriction sites were first cloned in the T/A cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Then restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel purification of the cloned cDNAs were performed. RGS6 cDNAs were ligated to EGFP vector in-frame with its C- or N-terminal EGFP sequence, and DMAP1 protein cDNAs were ligated to pCMV2B vector in-frame with its N-terminal FLAG tag. A deletion mutant of RGS6L, in which part of the GGL domain was deleted (RGS6LΔ258-293), was prepared by PCR using a pair of primers that each “straddled” the flanking region of the deleted sequence (amino acids 258-293) and thus complementary to each other. The resulting PCR product was purified and used as template with outer primers to amplify the full-length sequence with the deleted region, followed by cloning as described above. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 and SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin (50 μg/ml) (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with vectors containing various RGS6 cDNAs, DMAP1, and/or Dnmt1 by electroporation as described (8Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Google Scholar). Cells were used in experiments ∼40 h following transfection. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and β-Galactosidase Assays—Full-length RGS6L and RGS6S, various truncation mutants of RGS6L, and truncation mutants of DMAP1 were PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers incorporating restriction sites to facilitate their cloning into pGBKT7 or pACT2 vector. First, amplified cDNAs were cloned in pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Then restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel purification of the cloned cDNAs was performed. RGS6 cDNAs were ligated to pGBKT7 vector, and DMAP1 cDNAs were ligated to pACT2 vector. Constructs cloned into the pGBKT7 vector were fused to an N-terminal Gal4 DBD, and constructs cloned into the pACT2 vector were fused to a N-terminal Gal4 DNA activating domain. pGBKT7-RGS6S was used to screen a human brain cDNA library cloned into pACT2 vector. The yeast strain AH109 was transformed with pGBKT7-RGS6S and mated with the yeast strain Y187 already transformed with human brain cDNA library. An estimated 107 diploid clones were screened. Yeast clones containing interacting proteins were identified by growth on selective media lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine and confirmed by β-galactosidase activity. RGS6L and its truncation mutants fused with Gal4 DBD were co-transformed with different DMAP1 truncation mutants fused with Gal4 activating domain into AH109 cells. The activity of the reporter gene β-galactosidase was then assessed by liquid culture assay using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Fluorescence and Immunofluorescence—Transfected cells were rinsed three times with DPBS before fixation for fluorescence or immunofluorescence studies. For visualization of GFP-tagged RGS proteins, cells were fixed by treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. For immunodetection of FLAG epitope, cells were fixed by treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with DPBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (∼1 μg/ml) in DPBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Cells then were rinsed three times with DPBS, incubated with Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies (∼1 μg/ml) in DPBS for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times with DPBS. Finally, cells were air-dried and mounted using Vecta Shield mounting solution. Images shown are representative of a minimum of 400 cells derived from four or more separate transfections. Co-immunoprecipitations—For co-immunoprecipitation studies, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged forms of RGS6 proteins and FLAG-tagged DMAP1, with or without Gβ5, and grown for 48 h in 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Cells were harvested by lysis with 200 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. Resulting supernatants were incubated with anti-GFP and protein A-conjugated agarose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in RIPA buffer, suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 3 min. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody and anti-FLAG-HRP. For co-immunoprecipitation studies on RGS6 and Dnmt1, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged forms of RGS6 proteins and His6-tagged Dnmt1 with or without FLAG-tagged DMAP1 and grown for 48 h in 10 cm of tissue culture. The cell lysate was processed and subjected to immunoprecipitation by using anti-GFP antibody as described above. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody and anti-polyhistidine antibody. For co-precipitation studies in mouse brain, an adult mouse brain was homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Anti-RGS6L-conjugated agarose (70 μl) was added to the resulting supernatant. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer, and then resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-GFP and anti-RGS6L antibodies. Preparation of Recombinant GGL Domain Protein and in Vitro Pull-down Assays—A cDNA encoding amino acids 258-319 of RGS6L, encompassing the GGL domain and 10 amino acids C-terminal to the GGL domain, was PCR-amplified and cloned into pTrcHis2 TOPO TA vector (i.e. fused to the C-terminal hexahistidine tag from the vector). This RGS6 GGL domain construct was transformed into DH5α bacteria and cultured overnight. The culture was inoculated in new LB medium, and protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside using standard methods. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mg of lysozyme) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After brief sonication, supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and loaded onto a column filled with 2 ml of Ni-NTA slurry. The column was washed with 10 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole), and the Ni-NTA/protein mixture was collected and an aliquot subjected to SDS-PAGE to check for protein purity. For in vitro pull-down assay, a T150 flask of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (∼107 cells) was lysed in 2 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer and subjected to pull down by mixing with either empty Ni-NTA beads or RGS6 GGL domain-bound Ni-NTA beads, both of which were pre-incubated in RIPA buffer. The beads were rocked for 4 h at 4 °C, collected, washed three times with RIPA buffer, and then resuspended in sample buffer. Samples were heated briefly and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-DMAP1 antibody and anti-Dnmt1 antibody. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase reporter gene construct containing five repeats of the Gal4-binding element and the herpesvirus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter was PCR-amplified and cloned in the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). Gal4 DBD fusion constructs of DMAP1 were cloned into the pM vector. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with various DNA constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity in transfected cells was determined with a luciferase assay kit (Promega) 40 h following transfection. Immunoblotting was performed on cell lysates derived from cells transfected in replicate wells to compare expression of proteins (RGS6, Dnmt1, and TSG101) tested for their ability to modulate the transcriptional activity of DMAP1. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfected β-galactosidase determined with a Galacto chemiluminescence assay kit. Identification of DMAP1 as an RGS6-binding Protein—We used yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify proteins that interact with RGS6S, a form of RGS6 that exhibits a nuclear pattern of localization (15Chatterjee T.K. Liu Z. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30261-30271Google Scholar). A human brain library was screened with RGS6S, and a strongly interacting clone, encoding the C-terminal 292 amino acids of DMAP1, was identified and recovered by bacterial transformation. Full-length DMAP1 then was amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA library, and its sequence was verified by comparison with that of DMAP1 identified in yeast two-hybrid screens as a Dnmt1-associated protein (17Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Google Scholar). Although the tissue-specific pattern of expression of DMAP1 has not been examined, EST database analyses show that DMAP1 mRNA is present in brain, where RGS6 mRNA is expressed predominantly (23Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Google Scholar), liver. and a few other tissues. RGS6-DMAP1 Minimal Interaction Requirements—We initiated our studies by determining the structural sequences involved in interaction between RGS6 and DMAP1 in yeast. We examined interaction of RGS6L, RGS6S, and various RGS6 truncation mutants with the C-terminal region of DMAP1 identified as an RGS6S-binding region in our two-hybrid screen and DMAP1 truncation mutants of this region. RGS6 and DMAP1 constructs were used as bait and target proteins, respectively, and the relative strength of interaction between these proteins was assessed by β-galactosidase assays. p53 interaction with T antigen served as a positive control, and interaction of vector controls for the identified RGS6- and DMAP1-interacting regions were included as negative controls. Fig. 1 illustrates the constructs examined and the results obtained. As shown, both RGS6L and an RGS6 mutant truncated before the GGL domain interacted with the C-terminal DMAP1 protein as strongly as RGS6S. These results suggest that the site of interaction between RGS6 proteins and this region of DMAP1 is not unique to RGS6S and does not require sequences N-terminal to the GGL domain. However, further truncation to remove the GGL domain caused a loss of interaction with DMAP1, suggesting its involvement in interaction between RGS6 proteins and DMAP1. This finding was confirmed by showing that constructs encoding the GGL domain and 10 additional C-terminal amino acids (258-319) or the GGL domain alone (258-309) interacted with the DMAP1 protein as strongly as that of full-length RGS6S or RGS6L. The interaction site within the GGL domain was further defined, by analysis of other truncation mutants, to the N-terminal 36 amino acids of the GGL domain (258-293). Most interesting, RGS6(-GGL) splice forms possess only the first 28 N-terminal amino acids of the GGL domain. Thus, it was interesting to compare the interaction of this domain (258-285) to that of the identified DMAP1-interacting region within the GGL domain. As shown the truncated GGL domain present in RGS6(-GGL) splice forms interacted with the DMAP1 protein, although this interaction was weaker than that observed with the complete GGL domain or construct 258-293. These findings suggest that RGS6(-GGL) splice forms may interact with DMAP1, although this interaction may not be as strong as that of splice forms with complete GGL domains. These studies identify the site of interaction of RGS6 proteins with the DMAP1 protein to a specific sequence module present in the GGL domain and that sequences N- or C-terminal to this region are not required and do not affect GGL domain interactions with this protein. The region between amino acids 212 and 422 of DMAP1 contains a putative coiled coil region that was implicated in its interaction with Dnmt1 (17Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that this region of Dnmt1 showed strong interaction with a construct of RGS6 encompassing its GGL domain. These results identify the putative coiled coil region of DMAP1 as the RGS6-interacting domain. RGS6 Interaction with DMAP1 and Dnmt1 in COS-7 Cells—It seemed essential to determine whether the interaction we observed between RGS6 and DMAP1 in yeast occurred in mammalian cells and whether this interaction was mediated by the identified region within the GGL domain of RGS6. Thus, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged DMAP1 and various GFP-tagged forms of RGS6 or an RGS6L deletion mutant (RGS6LΔ258-293) lacking the region of the GGL domain we identified as the DMAP1-interacting domain in yeast (Fig. 1). We used both RGS6L and RGS6S and their -GGL splice forms, the latter proteins possessing only the N-terminal 28 amino acids (258-285) of the GGL domain but being otherwise identical to their RGS6L and RGS6S counterparts. We examined co-immunoprecipitation of DMAP1 by RGS6 proteins, by subjecting cell lysates to immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP or anti-FLAG. Anti-GFP immunoblotting was used to show the efficacy of the precipitation reaction. The top panel of Fig. 2 shows the result of these experiments. As shown, DMAP1 efficiently co-precipitated with RGS6L and RGS6S and slightly less efficiently with the -GGL splice forms of these proteins. However, no co-precipitation was observed with the RGS6L deletion mutant (RGS6LΔ258-293). These differences were not due to differences in the level of expression of RGS6 proteins or of DMAP1 or in the efficiency of their immunoprecipitation. These results demonstrate that DMAP1 interacts with RGS6 proteins in mammalian cells and confirm our yeast two-hybrid analysis identifying the N-terminal region of the GGL domain as the domain mediating this interaction. The lack of interaction of the RGS6L deletion mutant with DMAP1 further excludes the N-terminal region of RGS6L as well as sequences outside of the deleted region, including the RGD, as being involved in this interaction. Most interesting, the slight reduction in efficiency of co-precipitation of DMAP1 by RGS6(-GGL) splice forms observed here suggests that the 8 amino acids of the DMAP1-interacting region lacking in these proteins are required for full binding of DMAP1, consistent with our yeast two-hybrid analyses of these sequences (Fig. 1). Rountree et al. (17Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Google Scholar) demonstrated that DMAP1 and Dnmt1 co-immunoprecipitate each other when expressed in COS-7 cells. Yeast two-hybrid mapping of the interaction sites identified the N terminus of Dnmt1 as the DMAP1 interaction site, whereas only one truncation mutant of DMAP1, representing its coiled coil domain, interacted with Dnmt1, although this interaction was much weaker than that of full-length DMAP1. Our finding that RGS6 proteins interact with DMAP1 raised questions of whether RGS6 interacts with the DMAP1-Dnmt1 transcriptional complex or if binding of RGS6 to the coiled coil region of DMAP1 prevents DMAP1 interactions with Dnmt1. To address these issues, we determined whether RGS6 proteins associate with Dnmt1 and the dependence of such an interaction on the presence of DMAP1. Therefore, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells transfected with His6-tagged Dnmt1, with and without FLAG-tagged DMAP1, with GFP-tagged RGS6L, or the RGS6L deletion mutant (RGS6LΔ258-293) tha"

Use of inhibitors of cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 and overexpression of PDE3B in vitro have demonstrated a regulatory role for this enzyme in insulin secretion. In this work, the physiological significance of PDE3B-mediated degradation of cAMP for the regulation of insulin secretion in vivo and glucose homeostasis was investigated in transgenic mice overexpressing PDE3B in pancreatic β-cells. A 2-fold overexpression of PDE3B protein and activity blunted the insulin response to intravenous glucose, resulting in reduced glucose disposal. The effects were “dose”-dependent because mice overexpressing PDE3B 7-fold failed to increase insulin in response to glucose and hence exhibited pronounced glucose intolerance. Also, the insulin secretory response to intravenous glucagon-like peptide 1 was reduced in vivo. Similarly, islets stimulated in vitro exhibited reduced insulin secretory capacity in response to glucose and glucagon-like peptide 1. Perifusion experiments revealed that the reduction specifically affected the first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, morphological examinations demonstrated deranged islet cytoarchitecture. In conclusion, these results are consistent with an essential role for PDE3B in cAMP-mediated regulation of insulin release and glucose homeostasis.

A vital part of the signaling network responsible for stimulus-secretion coupling in pancreatic β-cells involves cAMP as second messenger. In particular, several physiological enhancers of glucose-stimulated insulin release, such as pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide (GLP) 1The abbreviations used are: GLP, glucagon-like peptide; PDE, phosphodiesterase; GLUT2, glucose transporter 2; PKA, protein kinase A; RIP, rat insulin promoter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid. 1, act mainly through increased formation of cAMP (1Gromada J.

Kvist-Reimer M. Ahren B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1959-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and, at least in part, its subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA). However, the exact mechanisms by which cAMP mediates the potentiating effect on insulin secretion remain to be established. Also, glucose itself has been reported to stimulate cAMP formation in β-cells. The significance, however, of glucose-induced increase in cAMP has been debated (4Howell S.L. Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S30-S35Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S37-S42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and full understanding of its contribution to insulin release has not been reached. Utilization of inhibitors of PKA has been shown not to impair glucose-stimulated release of insulin (6Harris T.E. Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Howell S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that cAMP plays a minor role in nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. Recently, newly described targets for cAMP, e.g. the family of exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac), were shown to participate in PKA-independent β-cell signaling and may prove to mediate previously unknown secretion stimulatory effects of cAMP (8Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 9Kang G.

The significance of accurate regulation of cAMP levels is illustrated by the large number of gene products known to generate, target, and degrade the cyclic nucleotide (reviewed in Ref. 11Steinberg S.F. Brunton L.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 751-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Degradation of cAMP is achieved through phosphodiesterase (PDE)-catalyzed hydrolysis, which balances the activity of adenylyl cyclase, and thereby contributes to the control of appropriate levels of cAMP within the cell. Inhibitors of PDE, some of which are in clinical use, are well known cAMP elevating tools. One effect of PDE inhibition is augmented insulin secretion (12Siegel E.G. Wollheim C.B. Kikuchi M. Renold A.E. Sharp G.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13El-Metwally M. Shafiee-Nick R. Pyne N.J. Furman B.L. Eur. J.

Commun. 1997; 236: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PDEs comprise a superfamily of enzymes with 11 known members (PDE1–11), each containing multiple isoforms and splice variants (15Soderling S.H. Beavo J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 16Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isozymes are structurally related but differ both functionally, e.g. with regard to regulation and substrate specificity, and in tissue distribution. PDE3B, which is one of two enzymes forming the PDE3 family, has been shown to reside particularly in tissues of importance for energy homeostasis (17Degerman E. Rahn L ström T. Stenson Holst L. Göransson O. Ahmad F. Shakur Y. Kenan Y. Manganiello V. Le Roith D. Olefsky J.M. Taylor S. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000: 284-289Google Scholar). A critical role of PDE3B in insulin-induced inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis is well established. Also, a role in inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis has been described (17Degerman E. Rahn L ström T. Stenson Holst L. Göransson O. Ahmad F. Shakur Y. Kenan Y. Manganiello V. Le Roith D. Olefsky J.M. Taylor S. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000: 284-289Google Scholar). Besides these tissues, β-cells of the endocrine pancreas express this particular isoform. In β-cells, PDE1 and PDE4 enzymes are expressed in addition to PDE3B (18Han P. Werber J. Surana M.

A. 1997; 94: 3223-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but the differential roles of these enzymes remain to be clarified. Although all three have been implicated in insulin release, the firmest evidence of an important role has been obtained by manipulating the activity of PDE3B (20Zhao A.Z. Zhao H. Teague J. Fujimoto W. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3223-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Härndahl L. Jing X.J. Ivarsson R. Degerman E. Ahrén B. Manganiello V.C.

Jing X.J. Ivarsson R. Degerman E. Ahrén B. Manganiello V.C. Renström E. Stenson Holst L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37446-37455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To study the physiological role of PDE3B in cAMP-mediated insulin release, we have generated transgenic mice with β-cell-targeted overexpression of the enzyme. Here we show that a modest degree of PDE3B overexpression impairs the insulin response to intravenous loads of glucose and GLP-1 and that mainly the first phase of insulin secretion is impaired. Furthermore, the islet dysfunction in these mice is associated with glucose intolerance and histological examination reveals deranged islet cytoarchitecture similar as in models of type 2 diabetes. The effects appear to be “dose”-dependent, because glucose homeostasis was further impaired in a second transgenic line exhibiting a more pronounced overexpression of PDE3B. Our findings highlight the important physiological role of cAMP in the control of insulin secretion. Generation of PDE3B Transgenic (RIP-PDE3B) Mice—A transgene construct for β-cell-specific expression was achieved by placing a FLAG epitope-equipped cDNA for mouse PDE3B (described in Ref. 22Shakur Y. Takeda K. Kenan Y. Yu Z.X. Rena G. Brandt D. Houslay M.D. Degerman E. Ferrans V.J. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol.

To this end the pcDNA3/mPDE3B-Flag vector (22Shakur Y. Takeda K. Kenan Y. Yu Z.X. Rena G. Brandt D. Houslay M.D. Degerman E. Ferrans V.J. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol.

A 958-bp genomic fragment of the human growth hormone gene (nucleotides 1193–2151) was then subcloned into the XbaI/ApaI restriction sites downstream of PDE3B cDNA in the same vector. After excision of the whole construct (6.3 kb) by HindIII/AvrII cleavage, pronuclear microinjection into C57Bl/6 x CBA mice was performed (at the Transgenic Core Facility of Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden) generating the C57Bl/6xCBA-Tg(RIP-PDE3B)Lsh mice (nomenclature according to Ref 45Eppig J.T. Blake J.A. Burkart D.L. Goldsmith C.W. Lutz C.M. Smith C.L. Genesis. 2002; 32: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Transgenic founder mice were identified by PCR analysis of tail biopsies using a 5′ primer annealing to nucleotides 3076–3110 of the mouse PDE3B sequence and a 3′ primer annealing to the FLAG epitope sequence, resulting in a 250-bp PCR fragment. Heterozygous transgenic mice have been used throughout the present studies and non-transgenic littermates have been utilized as controls. Mice have been fed a standard pellet diet and tap water ad libitum in an air-conditioned room with 12 h light and dark cycle. The Animal Ethic Committee, Lund, approved all experiments. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B reagent (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Oligo-(dT)18 was used to prime one strand cDNA synthesis from 1 μg of total RNA using the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech). The mPDE3B-Flag cDNA was amplified using the same primer pair as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Tissues were homogenized in buffer consisting of 50 mm TES, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan). Homogenates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene membranes (Millipore) and membranes were blocked with 0.5% (v/w) gelatin in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/w) Tween 20 for 1 h. Membranes were probed with polyclonal PDE3B antibodies (21Härndahl L. Jing X.J. Ivarsson R. Degerman E. Ahrén B. Manganiello V.C. Renström E. Stenson Holst L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37446-37455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) for 16 h. Proteins were detected using chemiluminescence (Pierce) and a LAS 1000 Plus system (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). PDE Activity Measurements—Tissues were homogenized as above and PDE activity was measured in duplicates as described (23Murad F. Manganiello V. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 3 μm OPC3911 (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan). To increase the sensitivity for PDE3 in the assay, the isoform-specific PDE4 inhibitor Ro-20-1724 (10 μm) (Biomol Research Labs, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was included when analyzing muscle samples. Assays were performed at 30 °C for 20–50 min. In Vivo Experiments—Mice, either fed or fasted for 3 h, were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of midazolam (a 0.15-ml injection containing 0.2 mg/mouse; Dormicum® (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and a combination of 0.4 mg/mouse fluanison and 0.02 mg/mouse fentanyl (Hypnorm® Janssen, Beerse, Belgium). After induction of anesthesia, a blood sample was taken from the retrobulbar, intraorbital capillary plexus, and then 1 g of d-glucose (British Drug Houses, Poole, UK) per kg body weight was injected rapidly into the tail vein. The volume load was 10 μl/g body weight. New blood samples were taken after 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 75 min. The samples were taken in heparinized tubes and stored on ice. After centrifugation, plasma was separated and stored at -20 °C until analysis. For arginine tests 0.25 g of l-arginine (Sigma) per kg was administered intravenously as described above; in experiments assessing GLP-1 effects, glucose (1 g/kg) in combination with 1 nmol/kg GLP-1 (7–36 amide) (Peninsula Labs, Merseyside, United Kingdom) was used. In insulin tolerance tests, mice, fasted for 24 h, were injected intraperitoneally with insulin (1 unit/kg) and blood samples were collected at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 60 min after the injection. Immunohistochemistry and Morphometry—Pancreases were dissected, fixed overnight in Stefanini's solution (2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.2), rinsed thoroughly in Tyrode solution containing 10% sucrose, and frozen on dry ice. Sections (10 μm thickness) were cut and thaw-mounted on slides. Alternatively, specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections (6 μm thickness) were mounted on coated slides, deparaffinized, and hydrated before further handling. Antibodies were diluted in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Triton X-100. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: insulin, dilution 1:2560 (code 9003, Euro Diagnostika, Malmö, Sweden); glucagon, dilution 1:5120 (code 8708, Euro Diagnostica); GLUT2, dilution 1:640 (code AB 1342, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After rinsing in PBS with Triton X-100, secondary antibodies with specificity for rabbit- or guinea pig-IgG, and coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark), were applied on the sections and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were again rinsed in Triton X-100-enriched PBS and then mounted in PBS:glycerol, 1:1. Sections from paraffin-embedded specimens were immersed in 3% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidase activity and incubated with primary antibodies as above. Unlabeled secondary antibody (dilution 1:160) was then applied to the sections and incubated for 30 min, followed by incubation with peroxidase anti-peroxidase complex, dilution 1:100 (DAKO) for 30 min. Peroxidase was visualized with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. The specificity of immunostaining was tested using primary antisera preadsorbed with homologous antigen (100 μg of peptide/ml of antiserum at working dilution), or by omission of primary antibodies. Immunofluorescence was examined in epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX60). Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride was examined in bright field. Images were captured with a digital camera (Olympus). To measure islet size, images were analyzed using Image Pro Plus. The pancreatic specimens (n = 5 in each group) were analyzed at three levels with a distance of 800 μm between each level. Three sections with 100 μm distance were taken at each level. Images of all islets immunostained for insulin within each section were captured and the islet areas were measured. Image Pro Plus was used for calculation of the mean islet area. Insulin Secretion and Insulin Content—Pancreatic islets were isolated by a collagenase digestion technique (21Härndahl L. Jing X.J. Ivarsson R. Degerman E. Ahrén B. Manganiello V.C. Renström E. Stenson Holst L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37446-37455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) modified after Lacy and Kostianovsky (24Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). After preincubation (1 h) in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRBB: 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2–7.4) at low (3.3 mm) glucose, groups of 3 islets were distributed to 96-well plates and incubated in 200 μl of KRBB containing glucose at the indicated concentrations, with or without addition of 100 nm GLP-1 or 10 μm OPC3911, for 1 h at 37 °C. Buffer was then withdrawn for determination of the amount of insulin secreted. Insulin content of isolated islets was determined by acid-ethanol extraction. Groups of 3 islets were homogenized in 100 μl of acid ethanol (0.18 m HCl in 95% ethanol) and frozen on dry ice. This step was repeated once, and after centrifugation supernatants were stored at -20 °C until analysis. Perifusion Experiments—The kinetics of insulin release was studied in vitro using the perifusion technique as described by Skoglund et al. (25Skoglund G. Lundquist I. Ahren B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1988; 132: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In short, freshly isolated islets were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in UB buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 1.2 mm MgCl·6H2O, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) including 3.3 mm glucose. UB buffer was used throughout the experiment and kept at 37 °C. Groups of 30 islets were placed between two layers of preswollen Bio-Gel beads (Bio-Gel P4, Bio-Rad) and perifused at a rate of 0.5 ml/min using UB buffer containing 3.3 mm glucose. After 10 min the buffer was switched to UB buffer containing 16.7 mm glucose, and after 30 min to buffer containing 16.7 mm glucose and 35 mm KCl (the concentration of NaCl was changed from 125 to 96 mm). Samples were collected every minute and analyzed for insulin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mercordia, Uppsala, Sweden). Insulin and Glucose Measurements—Insulin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassays (if not otherwise stated) using reagents from Linco Research Inc. (St. Charles, MI). Glucose concentrations were determined by either the glucose (Trinder) kit from Sigma or glucose (oxidase) reagent from Thermo Trace (Melbourne, Australia). Statistical Analysis—Data are given as the mean values ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated using unpaired Student's t test. PDE3B Expression in RIP-PDE3B Mice—A RIP2-controlled cDNA construct was used to generate mice with a β-cell-specific overexpression of PDE3B. By PCR analysis, 11 transgene-positive founder mice were identified and subsequently analyzed for islet PDE3B expression. Western blot analysis revealed variable degrees of overexpression, ranging between ∼2 and 10-fold, in all founders (data not shown). Based on these results and analyses of islet PDE3 activity we established two transgenic lines. One line, here designated RIP-PDE3B/2, exhibits a 2–3-fold increase in islet PDE3B expression and activity compared with wild-type mice, whereas in islets of the other line (RIP-PDE3B/7), the increase is 7–10-fold (Fig. 1). None or very weak signs of transgene expression were observed in other tissues, as studied both by reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blot analysis (data not shown), and PDE3 activity determination (Table I). Mice of the two RIP-PDE3B lines appear normal with regard to behavior, as inspected from birth to adult age, and they reproduce normally with a Mendelian distribution of offspring in heterozygous mating. Body weight monitored throughout the life span of the mice did not differ significantly between transgenic and wild-type mice (Table II).Table IPDE3 activity in tissues isolated from transgenic and wild-type mice Crude homogenates from isolated islets, adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, hypothalamus, and testis were used to determine PDE3 activity.

Initial experiments revealed insulin secretory response and glucose tolerance different from wild-type in male but not female transgenic mice. Therefore, for further experiments, groups of male mice only were used. Experimental series included mice between 6 and 34 weeks of age. In 12-week-old RIP-PDE3B/2 mice, glucose concentrations in plasma collected immediately before glucose was administered did not differ from control mice values (13.8 ± 1.0 mm versus 13.3 ± 0.4 mm (n = 8)) (Table II). In contrast, fasting (3 h) plasma glucose was increased in RIP-PDE3B/7 mice (10-week-old) (15.4 ± 0.9 mm versus 10.7 ± 0.6 mm for wild-type (p < 0.001; n = 8)) (Table II). Plasma insulin concentrations before injection of glucose varied but showed no significant differences in any of the transgenic animals compared with their wild-type counterparts. After intravenous administration of glucose (1 g/kg body weight), the transient peak of plasma insulin detected after 1 min was significantly lower in both groups of transgenic mice compared with wild-type. In RIP-PDE3B/2 mice (Fig. 2A), the acute insulin response was 30% of that seen in wild-type animals (increase from 0.35 ± 0.06 to 0.75 ± 0.10 nm in RIP-PDE3B/2 versus from 0.32 ± 0.07 to 1.67 ± 0.18 nm in wild-type (n = 8)), whereas insulin levels at 5–50 min did not differ. A complete failure of insulin secretory response at 1 min after glucose administration was observed in RIP-PDE3B/7 mice (Fig. 3A) as opposed to the 2.6-fold increase in insulin in their wild-type littermates (0.88 ± 0.18 to 0.69 ± 0.08 nm in RIP-PDE3B/7 versus 0.77 ± 0.20 to 2.02 ± 0.15 nm in wild-type (n = 8)). As a consequence of the reduced insulin response, glucose disposal was impaired in both lines (Figs. 2B and 3B). Moderately increased glucose levels were observed in plasma of RIP-PDE3B/2 mice at 20 and 50 min after the glucose injection (30.0 ± 1.0 and 21.1 ± 0.6 mm in RIP-PDE3B/2 versus 25.2 ± 0.8 and 18.7 ± 0.8 mm in wild-type (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05; n = 8)). In RIP-PDE3B/7 mice, the rise in glucose concentration at 5 min post-injection was significantly higher compared with wild-type (35.7 ± 0.8 mm versus 30.9 ± 1.2 mm (p < 0.01; n = 8)) and the elimination from plasma was remarkably reduced with end point (75 min) glucose levels remaining significantly higher than in wild-type mice (20.7 ± 0.9 mm versus 13.7 ± 0.8 mm, p < 0.001; n = 8) (Fig. 3B). Repeated glucose tolerance tests during the age span of 6–25 weeks of both animal groups produced similar results and we did not observe significant age-related differences. Intravenous administration of arginine (0.25 g/kg) did not produce significant differences between wild-type and transgenic mice with regard to insulin secretory response or glucose elimination (Figs. 2C and 3C), indicating that the above described effects are specific for glucose stimulation.Fig. 3Intravenous glucose tolerance test performed in RIP-PDE3B/7 mice (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice at the age of 10 weeks. Blood samples were drawn immediately before and after an intravenous injection of glucose (1 g/kg). Plasma insulin (A) and glucose (B) levels at the indicated time points were determined. Control experiments with intravenous injections of l-arginine (0.25 g/kg) were conducted in mice at 22 weeks of age (C). Values are presented as the mean ± S.E. (n = 6–8 mice in each group). **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the physiological insulin secretory response of RIP-PDE3B/7 mice to GLP-1 stimulation, GLP-1 (1 nmol/kg) was administered intravenously together with glucose (1 g/kg). While unable to elevate plasma insulin in response to glucose only, these mice did respond to glucose in combination with GLP-1 (Fig. 4). However, the 1-min peak insulin value in RIP-PDE3B7 mice was only 48% of that of wild-type (4.1 ± 0.5 nm in RIP-PDE3B/7 mice versus 8.6 ± 0.6 nm in wild-type mice (p < 0.001; n = 4)). As evident from Fig. 4B, this amount of insulin secreted did not suffice to significantly increase glucose disposal. At 75 min post-injection plasma glucose concentration was 21.2 ± 1.3 mm in RIP-PDE3B/7 and 10.9 ± 0.9 mm in wild-type (p < 0.001; n = 4). PDE3 enzyme activity assayed in hypothalamic homogenates did not reach detectable levels (Table I). To check the possibility that, still, a low expression of the transgene specifically in hypothalamic neurons could have altered their signaling and created an insulin-resistant condition, we performed insulin tolerance experiments in the RIP-PDE3B/2 mice. Insulin doses at 1 unit/kg, given intraperitoneally, induced equal elimination rates of plasma glucose in the transgenic mice and wild-type control animals (Fig. 5), indicating that insulin sensitivity is not reduced in the RIP-PDE3B/2 mice. Islets Isolated from RIP-PDE3B Mice Exhibit Impaired Insulin Secretion—Islets were isolated after completion of the in vivo experiments and the secretory capacity was examined in static incubations with groups of 3 freshly isolated islets, matched according to size, i.e. avoiding remarkably large or small islets. As seen in Fig. 6A, the secretory response to 16.7 mm glucose was significantly reduced in islets from RIP-PDE3B/2 mice in comparison with wild-type islets (1.8 ± 0.3 nm versus 2.7 ± 0.4 nm insulin per 3 islets (p < 0.05, n = 3)). Inclusion of the selective PDE3 inhibitor OPC3911 (10 μm) together with glucose at 16.7 mm potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In the islets of transgenic mice addition of OPC3911 caused reversal of the diminished insulin secretory response to glucose. The response to 100 nm GLP-1 in the presence of high glucose (16.7 mm) showed a 47% reduction in islets of RIP-PDE3B/2 mice compared with wild-type (3.4 ± 0.6 nm versus 6.4 ± 0.8 nm insulin per 3 islets (p < 0.01, n = 3)). By addition of 10 μm OPC3911 th"

There are four variants of TIMPs, and each has its defined set of metalloproteinase (MP) targets. TIMP-1, in particular, is inactive against several of the membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs), MMP-19, and the ADAM proteinase TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, ADAM-17). The molecular basis for such inactivity is unknown. Previously, we showed that TIMP-1 could be transformed into an active inhibitor against MT1-MMP by the replacement of threonine 98 residue with leucine (T98L). Here, we reveal that the T98L mutation has in fact transformed TIMP-1 into a versatile inhibitor against an array of MPs otherwise insensitive to wild-type TIMP-1; examples include TACE, MMP-19, and MT5-MMP. Using T98L as the scaffold, we created a TIMP-1 variant that is fully active against TACE. The binding affinity of the mutant (V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L/T98L) (K appi 0.14 nm) surpassed that of TIMP-3 (K appi 0.22 nm), the only natural TIMP inhibitor of the enzyme. The requirement for leucine is absolute for the transformation in inhibitory pattern. On the other hand, the mutation has minimal impact on the MPs already well inhibited by wild-type TIMP-1, such as gelatinase-A and stromelysin-1. Not only have we unlocked the molecular basis for the inactivity of TIMP-1 against several of the MPs, but also our findings fundamentally modify the current beliefs on the molecular mechanism of TIMP-MP recognition and selectivity.

The enzymes degrade various pericellular components and regulate cell proliferation, matrix remodeling, and the release of a vast array of bioactive molecules (1Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Nat.

Under normal physiological conditions, the activities of the metalloproteinases (MPs) are tightly controlled by their natural inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). There are four variants of TIMPs (TIMP-1 to -4), and each has its own profile of MP targets (9Woessner J.F. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 33-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bode W. Maskos K.

Although the majority of the MMPs are inhibited by all TIMPs, some are notably less sensitive to TIMP-1 inhibition. To name a few, MMP-19, the membrane-type 1 (MT1)-MMP (MMP-14), MT3-MMP (MMP-16), MT5-MMP (MMP-24), and the best known ADAM proteinase, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE), have all been shown to be intractable to TIMP-1 inhibition (12Stracke J.O.

Despite the similarity in sequence identity (40–50%) and tertiary conformation, the molecular basis of TIMP selectivity remains hitherto unclear.The MPs of the MMP and ADAM families are multidomain, zinc-dependent endopeptidases. Their functional diversity notwithstanding, the catalytic domains of the proteinases are remarkably similar in tertiary configuration. The main body of the domain consists typically of five highly twisted β-pleated sheets flanked on either side by up to two regular α-helices. The result is the division of the catalytic domain into a larger upper subdomain and a smaller lower subdomain. The groove separating the upper and lower subdomains also contains the enzyme active site where substrate cleavage takes place. The catalytic zinc is coordinated by three conserved histidines of the zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH (for review, see Ref. 15Gomis-Rüth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).TIMPs are small molecules of ∼22 kDa in mass. Protein crystallography and NMR studies carried out on TIMP-1 and -2 showed that the molecules are folded into two very distinct N- and C-terminal domains (16Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G. Docherty A.J. Freedman R.B. Feeney J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11745-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Gomis-Rüth F. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain encompasses the first two-thirds of the polypeptide. Configuration-wise, the domain is made up of a compact, five-stranded Greek key β-barrel reminiscent of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding fold. The C-terminal domain is composed mostly of β-sheets and is structurally less well defined. TIMP exerts its inhibitory functions by slotting the wedge-like edge of its N-terminal domain into the active site of an MP to form a non-covalent 1:1 stoichiometric complex with the enzyme.Previously, we showed that TIMP-1 could be transformed into a fully active inhibitor against MT1-MMP by the replacement of threonine 98 residue (Thr-98) with leucine (18Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40224-40230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have broadened the study to cover a comprehensive range of MPs, including a member of the ADAM family. In line with the sensitivity of the chosen MPs toward TIMP-1, the results are arranged in three sections. The first section deals with TACE, a specific case in which information is available about the background of the enzyme and its reactivity with some of our previous TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 mutants. The second section discusses how we extended the investigations to two MMPs also known to be insensitive to TIMP-1, namely MMP-19 and MT5-MMP, and the subsequent realization of the role of Thr-98 in MP recognition. In the final section, the impact of T98L mutation on the MMPs normally well inhibited by TIMP-1 is analyzed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All kinetic assays were performed at 27 °C in fluorescence assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, 1% Me2SO, 0.02% NaN3) with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B spectrofluorometer equipped with thermostatic cuvette holders. The enzymes and substrates for the assays of gelatinase-A (MMP-2), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3), matrilysin-1 (MMP-7), collagenase-3 (MMP-13), MT5-MMP (MMP-24) (Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2); MMP-19, matrilysin-2 (endometase, MMP-26) (Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2); and TACE (ADAM-17) (Mca-Ser-Pro-Leu-Ala-Gln-Ala-Val-Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg-Lys-Dnp-NH2) have been reported in our previous papers (12Stracke J.O.

Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40224-40230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mutations were incorporated into the N-terminal domain of human TIMP-1 cDNA (residue 1–126, cloned in pRSET-c Escherichia coli expression vector, Invitrogen) by either forward or reverse primers, depending on the locations. All constructs have been sequenced to confirm that no unwanted mutation had been introduced during the mutagenesis process.Protein Refolding and Assessment of Activity by Titration—N-TIMP-1 mutants were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli and refolded essentially as described previously (18Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40224-40230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The activities of active N-TIMP-1 in each preparation were determined by titration against gelatinase-A and collagenase-3 as reported previously (18Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40224-40230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Inhibition Constant Measurement (K appi)—With the exception of MMP-19, MPs (0.15 nm) were preincubated with increasing concentrations of N-TIMP-1 mutants (up to 800 nm, depending on the potency of the inhibitors) at room temperature. Due to the low kcat/Km rate of MMP-19 with its fluorescent substrate, significantly more MMP-19 enzyme (5 nm) was used for the inhibition constant assays. Incubation was allowed for 3 h prior to steady state (Vs) measurement. Quenched fluorescent peptides were added to a final concentration of 1 μm (2 μm for MMP-19) to initiate the assays. All data were fitted into competitive tight binding equations with the computer program Grafit to obtain an estimation of K appi values with the equation (22Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 201-301Google Scholar) Vs=(V0/2Et)×{(Et-It-Kiapp)+[(Kiapp+Ii-Et)2+4EtKiapp]1/2}(Eq. 1) where Vo is the rate in the absence of inhibitor, Et is the total enzyme concentration, and It is the total inhibitor concentration.Association Rate Constant Measurement (kon)—kon measurements were performed by adding N-TIMP-1 mutants (up to 400 nm) to 0.05 nm MPs (1 nm for MMP-19). The rate of inhibition was followed using a continuous fluorometric assay at 27 °C until steady state was reached. The progress curve was analyzed using the equation (22Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 201-301Google Scholar) P=Vst+(V0-Vs)(1-e-kt)/k(Eq. 2) where P is the product concentration, V0 is the initial velocity, Vs is the steady state velocity, and k is the apparent first order rate constant of equilibrium between enzyme and TIMP complex. kon values were calculated by linear regression of k on TIMP concentrations.RESULTSN-TIMP-1 Mutants Originally Designed against MT1-MMP Are Also Active TACE Inhibitors—TACE is unique not only because of its versatility in shedding a great variety of bioactive molecules but also because of its selective inhibition by TIMP-3 (14Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). TIMP-1, -2, and -4 are not capable of inhibiting the enzyme. In our previous study with MT1-MMP, we created a series of N-terminal domain TIMP-1 mutants that displayed partial to full inhibitory functions against the enzyme (18Lee M.H. Rapti M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40224-40230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A common feature among these N-TIMP-1 mutants is that the amino acid constituency of their N termini, AB-loops, CD-loops, and EF-loops comprises derivatives of TIMP-2, -3, and -4. At the outset of the current project, we subjected TACE to affinity measurements with three of these mutants (T98L/V4A/P6V/TIMP-2-AB-loop, T98L/V4A/P6V, and V4A/P6V/TIMP-2-AB-loop), and the results are summarized in Table I. (The composition of the TIMP-2-AB-loop mutant is explained in Fig. 1.) Interestingly, we found that N-TIMP-1 mutants originally designed against an MT1-MMP backdrop were also active TACE inhibitors. With K appi values between 8 and 20 nm, the binding affinity of two of the mutants (T98L/V4A/P6V/TIMP-2-AB-loop and T98L/V4A/P6V) was markedly better than the wild-type N-TIMP-1 (K appi 356 nm). In addition, their progress curves also conspicuously resembled the inhibitory pattern of a typical slow, tight binding inhibitor (Fig. 2a) (22Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 201-301Google Scholar). It was apparent that the two mutants containing T98L mutation (i.e. T98L/V4A/P6V/TIMP-2-AB-loop and T98L/V4A/P6V, K appi 8–20 nm) had significantly better affinity than the one without (V4A/P6V/TIMP-2-AB-loop, K appi >120 nm) (Table I). However, from the panel of the compounded mutants per se, we were unable to conclude whether T98L was the contributory factor for the superior potency. To clarify the ambiguity, we subjected TACE to further analysis with N-TIMP-1 carrying single V4A, P6V, TIMP-2-AB-loop, and T98L mutations. As shown in Table I, T98L was indeed the source of the enhanced affinity. The affinity of the mutant with TACE (K appi 21 nm) was at least an order of magnitude better than that of wild-type N-TIMP-1. On the other hand, whereas the TIMP-2-AB-loop significantly enhanced the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for TACE, the individual V4A and P6V mutations had exactly the opposite effects.Table IKinetic analysis of TACE with N-TIMP-1 originally designed against MT1-MMPKiappkonnm×10-5m-1s-1Wild type N-TIMP-1356 ± 87n/aan/a, not able to determine N-TIMP-30.22 ± 0.073.65 ± 0.33Compounded mutants T98L/V4A/P6V/TIMP-2-AB-loop20.1 ± 6.10.11 ± 0.02 T98L/V4A/P6V8.5 ± 1.20.16 ± 0.05 V4A/P6V/TIMP-2-AB-loop124 ± 25n/aIndividual mutation V4A497 ± 180n/a P6V754 ± 151n/a TIMP-2-AB-loop57.9 ± 33n/a T98L21.1 ± 4.10.22 ± 0.10a n/a, not able to determine Open table in a new tab Fig. 2The evolution of N-TIMP-1 against TACE: the association profiles of (a) T98L+V4A/P6V, (b) T98L, (c) V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L, and (d) T98L+V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L mutants. The N-TIMP-1 mutant T98L+V4A/P6V was originally designed for MT1-MMP inhibition. It was subsequently shown to be also an active TACE inhibitor. On the contrary, V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L was an N-TIMP-1 mutant tailor-made against TACE. The kinetic characteristics of the mutant were similar to a fast competitive, Michaelis-Menten-type inhibitor. Incorporation of T98L into V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L transformed the mutant into a slow, tight binding inhibitor. The affinity of the final mutant, T98L+V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L (K appi 0.14 nm), surpasses that of N-TIMP-3 (K appi 0.22 nm), the only natural TIMP inhibitor of TACE. The gray lines denote the trajectory of the slow, tight binding equation used for calculating the association rate, as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” The hydrolysis curve of TACE in the absence of inhibitor is also included in each panel to show that no significant substrate depletion occurred during the assays.

The corresponding amino acid in TIMP-2, -3, and -4 is leucine. Is leucine the only amino acid capable of transforming N-TIMP-1 into a TACE inhibitor? With the exception of cysteine, we substituted Thr-98 with all the known amino acids, and the kinetic profiles of these Thr-98 site-directed mutants are summarized in Table II. Of the 17 mutants created, only T98I, T98M, and T98V displayed clear signs of activity against TACE. With K appi of just over of 75 nm, isoleucine fared best, followed by methionine (K appi 135 nm) and valine (K appi >650 nm). Judging from their progress curves, none of the mutants exhibited the inhibition characteristics of a slow, tight binding inhibitor. The rest of the amino acids were completely inactive against TACE.Fig. 3Cross section view of stromelysin-1·TIMP-1 interaction complex (PDB code 1UEA). Crystallography data shows that TIMP interacts with MMP by inserting its MMP-binding ridge into the active site of the enzyme. The second and the fourth residues of TIMP (highlighted by Corey-Pauling-Koltun format in aquamarine and lilac, respectively) interact with the S1′ and the S3′ pockets of the MMP at the “right” side of the catalytic zinc, whereas the CD-loop (pink) associates with the S2 pocket at the “left.” As Thr-98 (red) is not in intimate contact with any of the pockets, its importance has been ignored until very recently. Inset, N-TIMP-1 structure highlighting the components of the MMP-binding ridge: the N terminus, the AB-loop, the CD-loop, and the EF-loop.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIInhibition constant (K1opp) of Thr-98 site-directed mutants with TACE and MMP-19TACEMMP-19nmHydrophobic T98I76 ± 912.3 ± 1.8 T98M135 ± 2534.1 ± 10.2 T98V660 ± 5412.1 ± 3.3 T98F>800>100 T98P>800>100Small T98G>800>100 T98A>800>100Nucleophilic T98S>800>100Aromatic T98Y>800>100 T98W>800>100Acidic T98D>800>100 T98E>800>100Amide T98N>800>100 T98Q>800>100Basic T98H>800>100 T98K>800>100 T98R>800>100 Open table in a new tab The N-TIMP-1 Mutant That Surpasses N-TIMP-3 in TACE Inhibition: T98L+V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L—As part of our ongoing interests in TIMP engineering, we designed previously a triple N-TIMP-1 mutant that displayed appreciable affinity against TACE (23Lee M.H. Maskos K. Knäuper V. Dodds P. Murphy G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mutant, termed V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L, contains mutations at three loci: the N terminus (V4S), the AB-loop (TIMP-3-AB-loop transplant), and the CD-loop (V69L) (Fig. 3). Despite its reasonable K appi value of 15 nm with TACE, the mutant lacks the essential quality of a slow, tight binding inhibitor. Instead, its kinetic profile with TACE was more similar to that of a fast, reversible Michaelis-Menten-type inhibitor (Fig. 2c) (23Lee M.H. Maskos K. Knäuper V. Dodds P. Murphy G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine the combined effects of T98L with these mutations, we incorporated V4S, TIMP-3-AB-loop, and V69L individually and collectively into T98L to generate a group of T98L-based mutants. The effects were complementary. As shown in Table III, combination of T98L with V4S, TIMP-3-AB-loop, and V69L, be it individually or collectively, brought about a severalfold enhancement in binding affinity. Moreover, the inhibition profiles of all the mutants conformed to the kinetics of a slow, tight binding inhibitor. The K appi of T98L+V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L (0.14 nm) even surpassed that of TIMP-3 (0.22 nm), the only native TIMP capable of inhibiting TACE (Table III and Fig. 2d). With such low K appi and kon values, the corresponding dissociation rate of 1 × 10-5 s-1 compared with that of N-TIMP-3, 8 × 10-5 s-1, shows that the half-life of the mutant TIMP inhibition complex with TACE is considerably longer than that of N-TIMP-3. In other words, the mutant could be the ideal archetype for the development of future clinical TACE inhibitors.Table IIICombining T98L with V4S, TIMP-3-AB-loop, and V69L mutations from previous study against TACEKiappkonnm×10-5m-1s-1Previous mutant V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L15 ± 3n/aan/a, not able to determineT98L + mutations from previous study T98L + V4S7.08 ± 0.730.34 ± 0.03 T98L + TIMP-3-AB-loop2.38 ± 0.520.58 ± 0.06 T98L + V69L5.69 ± 1.380.26 ± 0.02 T98L + V4S/V69L4.37 ± 1.340.24 ± 0.02 T98L + V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L0.14 ± 0.060.76 ± 0.07a n/a, not able to determine Open table in a new tab MMP-19 and MT5-MMP: Two Metalloproteinases Also Inhibited by T98L—So far, we have shown that T98L is the key for the successful transformation of TIMP-1 into fully active inhibitors against two of the most prominent cell surface-associated sheddases, MT1-MMP and TACE. What about other MPs not customarily inhibited by TIMP-1? MMP-19 and MT5-MMP are known to be relatively TIMP-1-insensitive (12Stracke J.O. Hutton M. Stewart M. Pendás A.M. Smith B. López-Otin C.

Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). More attractively, the enzymes are reasonably stable at room temperature, and the assays for their activity have been worked out previously (12Stracke J.O. Hutton M. Stewart M. Pendás A.M. Smith B. López-Otin C. Murphy G. Knäuper V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14809-14816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 24Llano E. Pendas A.M. Freije J.P. Nakano A. Knäuper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). Table IV shows that, although none of the T98L-based mutants were originally designed for MMP-19 and MT5-MMP inhibition, they did display improved activity against the enzymes (Fig. 4, a and b). In the case of MMP-19, the K appi of the best mutant T98L+V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L (1.27 nm) approached that of N-TIMP-2 (0.66 nm). In terms of association rate, there was practically no difference between the mutant and those of N-TIMP-2, -3, or -4 (kon 2–5 × 10-5m-1s-1). Examination with Thr-98 site-directed mutants again showed that residues with the best affinity were those of aliphatic and hydrophobic character, i.e. valine, leucine, and isoleucine (Table II). Interestingly, although T98I and T98V were superior to T98L (K appi of 12 nm for T98I and for T98V versus K appi of 18 nm for T98L), they failed to display the inhibition profile of a slow, tight binding inhibitor (Fig. 4c). MT5-MMP, on the contrary, had better affinity with the T98L/V4A/P6V and T98L/TIMP-3-AB-loop mutants (K appi of 5–6 nm) (Table IV). Although the affinity of the mutants is significantly better that of wild-type N-TIMP-1 (∼65 nm), they are still not as good as those of N-TIMP-3 and -4 (0.2–0.5 nm). Intriguingly, despite the rather similar K appi reactivity of MMP-19 and MT5-MMP with regard to T98L mutation (Table IV), the association curves of the enzymes with T98L mutants differ significantly. An example is shown in Fig. 4d; although the T98L-bearing mutant T98L+V69L (K appi 7 nm) displays obvious signs of slow, tight binding association with MT5-MMP, its association curves do not strictly echo the trajectory of a slow, tight binding inhibitor (22Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 201-301Google Scholar). On the contrary, the association profiles of T98L mutants with MMP-19 are typical of that of a slow, tight binding inhibitor. Indeed, much more work is needed to delineate the fundamental kinetics of N-TIMP-1 mutants/MT5-MMP interactions in the future.Table IVKinetic profiles of T98L mutants with MMP-19 and MT5-MMPMMP-19MT5-MMPKiappkonKiappkonnm×10-4m-1 s-1nm×10-4m-1 s-1Wild type N-TIMP-152 ± 20n/aan/a, not able to determine64.5 ± 1.9n/a N-TIMP-20.66 ± 0.314.62 ± 0.643.60 ± 0.20127 ± 30 N-TIMP-30.53 ± 0.322.80 ± 0.250.25 ± 0.05525 ± 50 N-TIMP-40.20 ± 0.103.06 ± 0.200.53 ± 0.1316 ± 9.0T98L-based mutants T98L18.8 ± 3.20.82 ± 0.0916.75 ± 1.00NAbNA, not available, as the progress curves do not fit the trajectory of the equation for kon T98L + V4A/P6V6.95 ± 1.680.80 ± 0.036.06 ± 0.08NA T98L + V4S4.46 ± 0.682.66 ± 0.1014.51 ± 1.50NA T98L + TIMP-3-AB-loop5.08 ± 0.601.79 ± 0.154.90 ± 0.05NA T98L + V69L5.36 ± 0.452.44 ± 0.126.60 ± 0.31NA T98L + V4S/V69L3.84 ± 0.672.18 ± 0.3023.44 ± 2.04NA T98L + V4S/TIMP-3-AB-loop/V69L1.27 ± 0.362.15 ± 0.1215.30 ± 2.20NAa n/a, not able to determineb NA, not available, as the progress curves do not fit the trajectory of the equation for kon Open table in a new tab Fig. 4The association profiles of (a) T98L, (b) T98L+V4A/P6V, (c) T98I with MMP-19, and (d) T98L+V69L with MT5-MMP. a and b, T98L mutation transformed N-TIMP-1 into a slow, tight binding inhibitor against MMP-19. c, despite the fact that T98I (Kiapp 12 nm) had better affinity than T98L (Kiapp 19 nm), the mutant was not showing the inhibition profile of a slow, tight binding inhibitor.

https://openalex.org/W1980355143,"Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and global genomic repair (GGR) of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were investigated in the yeast GAL1-10 genes. Both Rpb9- and Rad26-mediated TCR are confined to the transcribed strands, initiating at upstream sites ∼100 nucleotides from the upstream activating sequence shared by the two genes. However, TCR initiation sites do not correlate with either transcription start sites or TATA boxes. Rad16-mediated GGR tightly correlates with nucleosome positioning when the genes are repressed and are slow in the nucleosome core and fast in linker DNA. Induction of transcription enhanced GGR in nucleosome core DNA, especially in the nucleosomes around and upstream of the transcription start sites. Furthermore, when the genes were induced, GGR was slower in the transcribed regions than in the upstream regions. Finally, simultaneous deletion of RAD16, RAD26, and RPB9 resulted in no detectable repair in all sites along the region analyzed. Our results suggest that (a) TCR may be initiated by a transcription activator, presumably through the loading of RNA polymerase II, rather than by transcription initiation or elongation per se; (b) TCR and nucleosome disruption-enhanced GGR are the major causes of rapid repair in regions around and upstream of transcription start sites; (c) transcription machinery may hinder access of NER factors to a DNA lesion in the absence of a transcription-repair coupling factor; and (d) other than GGR mediated by Rad16 and TCR mediated by Rad26 and Rpb9, no other nucleotide excision repair pathway exists in these RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; GGR, global genomic repair; nt, nucleotide(s); NTS, nontranscribed strand; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; TCR, transcription-coupled repair; TS, transcribed strand; UAS, upstream activating sequence. of UV-induced cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in DNA is heterogeneous in the genomes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. One reason for this heterogeneity is transcription-coupled repair (TCR). For many genes being actively transcribed, NER is considerably faster in the transcribed strand (TS) as compared with the nontranscribed strand (NTS) or with both strands of inactive genes (1Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Google Scholar, 2Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Google Scholar). On the other hand, damage in a transcriptionally silent gene, and in the NTS of an actively transcribed gene, is repaired by the so-called global genomic repair (GGR) pathway. It was recently shown that two TCR subpathways, mediated by Rad26 and Rpb9, respectively, exist in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribed genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). Although facilitating Rad26-mediated TCR, Rpb4, another nonessential subunit (besides Rpb9) of Pol II, represses Rpb9-mediated TCR (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). It has also been shown that deletion of SPT4, encoding a protein involved in transcription elongation, releases the requirement of Rad26 for TCR (4Jansen L.E. den Dulk H. Brouns R.M. de Ruijter M. Brandsma J.A. Brouwer J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6498-6507Google Scholar). Furthermore, TCR was also observed in the RNA polymerase I-transcribed ribosomal RNA genes in yeast (5Conconi A. Bespalov V.A. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 649-654Google Scholar, 6Meier A. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Thoma F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11845-11852Google Scholar) but has not yet been observed in ribosomal RNA genes of mammalian cells (7Stevnsner T. May A. Petersen L.N. Larminat F. Pirsel M. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1591-1596Google Scholar, 8Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1994; 323: 179-187Google Scholar, 9Fritz L.K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13117-13124Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, TCR has been observed only in the transcribed regions of analyzed genes (10Selby C.P. Sancar A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 317-329Google Scholar, 11Kunala S. Brash D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 264-272Google Scholar, 12Li S. Waters R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 31-46Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, however, TCR initiation sites can be very different from gene to gene. For example, in the yeast RPB2 and GAL1 genes, TCR is initiated ∼40 and 180 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the transcription start sites, respectively (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). In the yeast URA3 gene, TCR seems to be limited to the transcribed region (13Tijsterman M. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8027-8032Google Scholar, 14Tijsterman M. de Pril R. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 934-940Google Scholar). Chromatin structure also contributes to NER heterogeneity in the genome (15Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 227-255Google Scholar, 16Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Google Scholar). In the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into a nucleoprotein complex known as chromatin (17Wolffe A.P. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, London1999: 7-172Google Scholar). This complex provides the compaction and structural organization of DNA for processes such as replication, transcription, recombination, and repair. The fundamental subunits of chromatin are nucleosome cores, where 147 bp of DNA is wrapped in 1.65 left-handed superhelical turns around a histone octamer (18Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Google Scholar). The DNA between adjacent nucleosome cores is called linker DNA; it varies in length from about 20 to 90 bp in different organisms and tissues or even between individual nucleosome cores in the same cell (19Holde K.E.v. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag KG, Berlin1989: 289-354Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of NER in the URA3 gene of a yeast minichromosome showed that NER in the NTS is faster in linker DNA than in the core regions (20Wellinger R.E. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5046-5056Google Scholar). Similar correlations were observed in the GAL1-URA3 fusion gene of a yeast minichromosome (21Li S. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Gupta R. Meijer M. Thoma F. Smerdon M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3610-3620Google Scholar) and in the yeast genomic URA3 gene (14Tijsterman M. de Pril R. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 934-940Google Scholar). The divergent yeast GAL1 and GAL10 genes, which share a common upstream activating sequence (UAS), are regulated identically (22Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Google Scholar, 23Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 197-259Google Scholar). These genes are completely repressed in glucose media and highly induced with galactose. Extensive studies have been done on isolated nuclei or chromatin to map the nucleosome structure in the GAL1-10 region (24Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar, 25Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Google Scholar, 26Fedor M.J. Kornberg R.D. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1721-1732Google Scholar, 27Cavalli G. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4603-4613Google Scholar). Using bleomycin as a DNA cleaving agent, we recently mapped nucleosome positioning in the GAL1-10 genes in permeabilized whole yeast cells (28Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44651-44659Google Scholar). In glucose cultures, nucleosomes with fixed positions exist in regions adjacent to the UAS, and the variability of nucleosome positioning sharply increases with increasing distance from this sequence. In agreement with the past reports using isolated nuclei or chromatin (24Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar, 25Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4603-4613Google Scholar), galactose induction causes nucleosome disruption throughout the region analyzed in permeabilized whole yeast cells, with the disruption of those nucleosomes close to the UAS being the most striking (28Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44651-44659Google Scholar). Rapid NER has been observed around and upstream of the transcription start sites in a number of actively transcribed genes (13Tijsterman M. Verhage R.A. van de Putte P. Tasseron-de Jong J.G.

In some instances, this rapid repair also occurs in the NTS (29Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Google Scholar, 33Tommasi S. Oxyzoglou A.B. Pfeifer G.P.

It has been speculated that there may be other NER pathways operating in these regions in addition to TCR and GGR. These different repair mechanisms may superimpose on chromatin substrates in the cells. A long-standing question is how these different NER pathways contribute to repair in different regions of a gene. With proper deletion mutants (i.e. TCR-deficient, GGR-deficient) available, we were able to dissect the different NER pathways in the well characterized yeast GAL1-10 genes. Yeast Strains—Wild type yeast strain Y452 (MATα, ura3-52, his3-1, leu2-3, leu2-112) and its isogenic rad16, rad16 rad26, rad16 rpb9, rad16 rad26 rpb9, and rad26 rpb9 deletion mutants were created as described previously (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). UV Irradiation and Repair Incubation—Cells were grown at 28 °C in minimal medium containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose to log phase (A600 ≈ 1.0), washed with 2% glucose or galactose, and irradiated with 50 J/m2 of 254 nm UV light (36Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 170-179Google Scholar). Repair incubation, DNA isolation, and CPD mapping were done as described (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar, 12Li S. Waters R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 31-46Google Scholar, 28Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44651-44659Google Scholar, 36Li S. Waters R.

Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated following UV irradiation and different times of repair incubation, using glass beads to break the cells (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). About 1 μg of genomic DNA was digested with restriction endonuclease(s) to release the fragments of interest. The restriction fragments were incised at CPD sites with an excess amount of purified T4 endonuclease V (kindly provided by Dr. R. Stephen Lloyd, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). Excess copies of biotinylated oligonucleotides, which are complementary to the 3′ end of the fragment to be labeled, were mixed with the sample. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min to denature the DNA and then cooled to an annealing temperature. The annealed fragments were attached to streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal, Inc.) and the non-annealed fragments removed by washing the beads at the annealing temperature. The attached fragments were labeled at the 3′ ends using [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), nonradioactive dCTP, and Sequenase (version 2, United States Biochemicals) (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). The labeled fragments were eluted from the beads and resolved on DNA sequencing gels. The dried gels were then exposed to PhosphorImager screens, and the 32P-labeled DNA was visualized on an Amersham Biosciences (model 445-P90) PhosphorImager. Quantitation of CPDs at Individual Sites—Five overlapping fragments in each strand of the GAL1-10 region were analyzed. As the bands on the upper part of a sequencing gel are not well separated, only the CPD bands on the lower part of the gel are used for quantitation. The signal intensity at all pixels in a gel lane was measured by ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences) and the data transferred to Microsoft Excel. After the gel background signal (i.e. the signal in the areas that do not have samples) was subtracted, the total signal intensities in different lanes of a gel were normalized to the same amount. A relatively low UV dose for yeast (50 J/m2) was used for CPD induction. However, even under these conditions, a small portion of the fragments may still have more than one CPD induced, and a small portion of the signal at a site will not show up on a gel if another CPD exists upstream (relative to the labeled 3′ end) of the site. The effect of this “hidden signal” increases as a CPD site is more distant from the labeled 3′ end. This hidden signal was corrected as described previously (28Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44651-44659Google Scholar). The signal intensities in a lane containing the unirradiated control samples were used as a base line for other lanes that contain UV-irradiated samples. The signal intensities in a lane containing UV-irradiated sample were corrected by subtraction of the base line. The data were then imported into the PeakFit program (SPSS, Inc.) to fit and deconvolute peaks corresponding to the individual CPD sites on the gels (36Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 170-179Google Scholar). The percent of CPDs remaining at individual sites after different times of repair incubation were calculated and the times required for repairing 50% of CPDs (t½) were obtained by either linear or second order polynomial regression. We analyzed repair over a period of 4 h, because significant cell growth occurs if longer repair times are used, and this obscures the fraction of repaired DNA in the samples (because of the increased fraction of newly replicated, undamaged DNA). The t½ values > 4 h were obtained by extrapolation of either linear or second order polynomial regression of the data obtained from 0, 1, 2, and 4 h of repair. Profiles of the repair rates along the GAL1-10 region were obtained from smoothed lines of t½ values (e.g. see Figs. 3, 7, and 10). Smoothing was carried out by averaging the individual t½ values at continuous intervals of 40 nt, where the 40-nt brackets were ramped along the DNA by 1 nucleotide.Fig. 7Plot showing tight correlation between GGR and nucleosome structure in TCR-deficient rad26 rpb9 cells.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3991-3998Google Scholar). Furthermore, the initiation sites of the rapid repair vary from gene to gene, ranging from immediately downstream (13Tijsterman M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3991-3998Google Scholar) or even hundreds of nucleotides upstream of the transcription start sites (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) for this rapid repair is poorly understood. We asked how TCR may contribute to the rapid repair and which gene element(s) (e.g. UAS, TATA, and transcription start site) determines a TCR initiation site. To address these questions, we analyzed both Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated TCR in the galactose-induced GAL1-10 genes (Fig. 1) at nucleotide resolution. Deletion of RAD16 eliminates GGR (39Verhage R. Zeeman A.M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D.D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Google Scholar), and the two TCR subpathways can be examined easily in a rad16 background (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). Therefore, rad16, rad16 rpb9, rad16 rad26, and rad16 rad26 rpb9 cells were grown in galactose media to log phase (A600 ≈ 1.0), UV-irradiated, and incubated for different periods of time in repair media. The genomic DNA was isolated, cut with restriction enzyme to release the fragments of interest, and incised at CPDs with excess amounts of purified T4 endonuclease V (40Lloyd R.S. Mutat. Res. 1998; 408: 159-170Google Scholar). The fragments were 3′ end-labeled on individual strands, separated on sequencing gels, and exposed to PhosphorImager screens. Representative gels showing Rad26- and Rpb9-mediated TCR in the GAL10 and GAL1 genes are presented in Fig. 2. The intensity of a band in the 0′ lane reflects CPD yield at the respective site, and the decreasing band intensity with increasing time (1, 2, and 4 h) of incubation reflects repair of CPDs (36Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 170-179Google Scholar). The signal intensities of individual CPD bands on the gels were quantified using peak deconvolution (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the percent CPDs remaining at each site after different times of repair was determined (e.g. see Ref. 41Liu X. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23729-23735Google Scholar, Fig. 5 therein). The times required for repairing 50% of the CPDs (t½) at individual sites were then obtained by regression analysis of these curves of percent CPDs remaining (Fig. 3). In rad16, rad16 rpb9, and rad16 rad26 cells, obvious TCR can be seen in a continuous sequence of the TS. In the GAL10 gene, TCR is initiated ∼120 nt upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3, upper panel, marked with an open arrow), which is immediately upstream of the TATA box (Figs. 2A and 3, marked with an open box). In the GAL1 gene, TCR is initiated ∼180 nt upstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3, lower panel, marked with an open arrow), which is ∼100 nt upstream of its TATA box (Figs. 2B and 3, marked with an open box). Thus, the TCR initiation sites do not correlate with the locations of the transcription start sites or the TATA boxes of these genes. Interestingly, however, the TCR initiation sites of the two genes are both ∼100 nt downstream from the ends of their shared UAS (Figs. 2 and 3).Fig. 5NER in the top strand (TS for GAL10 and NTS for GAL1) of glucose (Glu)- and galactose (Gal)-cultured TCR-deficient rad26 rpb9 cells. A and B show sequencing gels for two of five overlapping restriction fragments analyzed along the top strand of the GAL1-10 genes. Gel lanes are DNA samples from unirradiated (U) and UV-irradiated cells following 0, 1, 2, and 4 h repair incubation. Ovals on the left of the panels represent nucleosome locations in glucose cultures, where the intensity of shading denotes the invariability of the nucleosome positions (darkest, least variable; lightest, most variable). Bold vertical arrows on the right of the panels indicate the major transcription start sites. Open bars marks TATA boxes of the genes. Roman numerals on the left of panel B denote the positions of the four Gal4 binding sites in the UAS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In rad16 rpb9 cells, there is a general trend of similar repair rates in the coding regions and in the regions upstream of the transcription start sites (Fig. 2; Fig. 3, black symbols). This result indicates that Rad26-mediated TCR may operate equally in the two regions. In contrast, in rad16 rad26 cells, faster repair appears to occur in the coding regions compared with the regions upstream of the transcription start sites (Fig. 2; Fig. 3, blue symbols), indicating that Rpb9-mediated TCR may be more effective in the coding regions of the two genes. Furthermore, the repair rates in the transcribed regions of the TS are only slightly slower in rad16 rad26 cells than in rad16 cells (Fig. 3, compare blue and red symbols), indicating that Rad26 may be almost dispensable for TCR in these regions. In the constitutively expressed RPB2 gene, however, TCR is more dependent on Rad26, as the repair rate in the transcribed region of this gene is much slower in rad16 rad26 cells than in rad16 cells (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). Therefore, there may only be a small proportion of Pol II associated with Rpb4 (a suppressor of Rpb9-mediated TCR) during the robust transcription of the GAL1-10 genes (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). The Rpb9-mediated TCR, if unsuppressed by Rpb4, can be very efficient in the transcribed regions. In rad16, rad16 rpb9, and rad16 rad26 cells, no repair could be seen in the TS regions more than 120 or 180 nt upstream of the transcription start site for the GAL10 or GAL1 genes, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). This indicates that neither the Rad26- nor the Rpb9-mediated TCR subpathway is operative in these regions. Furthermore, NER is not observed in any region of the NTS in rad16, rad16 rad26, and rad16 rpb9 cells cultured in galactose media (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that neither the Rad26- nor the Rpb9-mediated TCR subpathway is operative in the NTS of the two genes, even in the regions around and upstream of the transcription start sites. Finally, within the entire 4-h period of repair incubation, no apparent repair was observed in any region of the GAL1-10 genes in rad16 rad26 rpb9 cells (Fig. 2; Fig. 3, gray symbols). This indicates that no other apparent NER pathway besides Rad16-mediated GGR, Rad26-mediated TCR, and Rpb9-mediated TCR exists in these Pol II-transcribed genes. GGR Tightly Correlates with Nucleosome Structures—We analyzed repair in the GAL1-10 genes in rad26 rpb9 cells where GGR is intact and TCR is completely abolished (3Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar). Representative gels showing Rad16-mediated GGR in the GAL1-10 genes of cells grown in glucose and galactose are presented in Figs. 5 and 6, and the quantification data for these gels are shown in Fig. 7. In glucose cultures, where nucleosomes are positioned along the GAL1-10 genes, repair rates correlate with nucleosome positioning and stability, being slower in the nucleosome core region and faster in the linker DNA (Figs. 5 and 6, Glu lanes, and Fig. 7A, gray triangles). This correlation is strongest in the nucleosomes adjacent to the UAS (e.g. nucleosomes c and d) and fades off with distance from the shared sequence (Figs. 5, 6, 7). These results agree well with the variability of nucleosome positioning in the region, most fixed in the region adjacent to the UAS and more variable with distance from the UAS (28Li S. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44651-44659Google Scholar). Galactose induction caused a general enhancement of GGR in both strands of the GAL1-10 genes (Figs. 5 and 6, compare Glu and Gal lanes; Fig. 7A, compare black and gray symbols; Fig. 7B). This enhancement closely correlates with nucleosome positioning and disruption profiles in glucose and galactose cultures. Indeed, decreases in the t½ of >4-fold occurred in both DNA strands of the core regions of nucleosomes c and d (Fig. 7), which are disru"
https://openalex.org/W2046896210,"Aerobic photosynthetic bacteria possess the unusual characteristic of producing different classes of carotenoids. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of two distinct crt gene clusters involved in the synthesis of spirilloxanthin and canthaxanthin in a Bradyrhizobium strain. Each cluster contains the genes crtE, crtB, and crtI leading to the common precursor lycopene. We show that spirilloxanthin is associated with the photosynthetic complexes, while canthaxanthin protects the bacteria from oxidative stress. Only the spirilloxanthin crt genes are regulated by light via the control of a bacteriophytochrome. Despite this difference in regulation, the biosyntheses of both carotenoids are strongly interconnected at the level of the common precursors. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the canthaxanthin crt gene cluster has been acquired by a lateral gene transfer. This acquisition may constitute a major selective advantage for this class of bacteria, which photosynthesize only under conditions where harmful reactive oxygen species are generated.

This acquisition may constitute a major selective advantage for this class of bacteria, which photosynthesize only under conditions where harmful reactive oxygen species are generated. Carotenoids comprise a large class of pigments that are widely distributed in living organisms. They are synthesized by all photosynthetic organisms from bacteria to plants where they play at least three essential functions (1Paulsen H. Frank H.A. Young A.J. Britton G. Cogdell R.J. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 123-135Google Scholar). First, they act as accessory light-harvesting pigments by absorbing light in the 450–570 nm region. Second, they are important for the assembly and stability of some of these light-harvesting complexes. Finally they operate as photoprotectors by directly quenching both triplet excited (bacterio)chlorophylls and singlet oxygen. Carotenoids are also synthesized by a wide variety of nonphotosynthetic bacteria (2Armstrong G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Less is known about their precise function in these bacteria, but it is well accepted that their strong antioxidant character may protect the organisms against (photo)oxidative damage. A remarkable feature of aerobic phototrophic bacteria, besides their ability to photosynthesize only under aerobic condition, is their carotenoid composition. Indeed most strains synthesize, in addition to the carotenoids involved in photosynthesis such as spirilloxanthin, a large amount of unusual carotenoid molecules (3Shimada K. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 105-122Google Scholar). The most striking complexity is observed for Erythrobacter species such as Erythrobacter longus or Erythrobacter ramosum, which have been reported to produce about 20 different carotenoids (4Takaichi S. Shimada K. Ishidsu J.-I. Arch. Microbiol. 1990; 153: 118-122Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5Yurkov V.V. Beatty J.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 695-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another example comes from various strains of photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium, symbionts of Aeschynomene (6Fleischman D. Kramer D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which synthesize, in addition to spirilloxanthin, large amounts of canthaxanthin of unknown function (7Lorquin J. Molouba F. Dreyfus B.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Molouba F. Lorquin J. Willems A. Hoste B. Giraud E. Dreyfus B. Gillis M. de Lajudie P. Masson-Boivin C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 6: 3084-3094Crossref Google Scholar). All carotenoids are synthesized from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. This compound is formed by the enzyme geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (CrtE), which catalyzes the condensation of farnesyl pyrophosphate with an isopentyl pyrophosphate moiety. The second step catalyzed by phytoene synthase (CrtB) is the formation of phytoene from the head-to-head condensation of two molecules of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Subsequent dehydrogenations catalyzed by the phytoene desaturase (CrtI) convert the phytoene to neurosporene in three desaturation steps or to lycopene in four steps. After the action of these three enzymes (CrtE, CrtB, and CrtI), the biosynthetic pathways diverge depending on the species leading to the accumulation of various different carotenoids. The synthesis of canthaxanthin from lycopene necessitates two enzymes: CrtY, which catalyzes cyclization of lycopene leading to β-carotene, and CrtW, which oxygenates β-carotene to form canthaxanthin (see Fig. 1A) (9Misawa N. Satomi Y. Kondo K. Yokoyama A. Kajiwara S. Saito T. Ohtani T. Miki W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The sequence of the reactions from lycopene to spirilloxanthin includes the successive reactions of hydration, desaturation, and methylation catalyzed, respectively, by the three enzymes CrtC, CrtD, and CrtF (see Fig. 1A) (10Takaichi S. Frank H.A. Young A.J. Britton G. Cogdell R.J. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 40-69Google Scholar, 11Pinta V. Ouchane S. Picaud M. Takaichi S. Astier C. Reiss-Husson F. Arch. Microbiol. 2003; 179: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These reactions are performed first on one-half of the molecule and then on the other half. The genes encoding many carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes (crt genes) have been characterized in plants and in various bacteria (12Cunningham F.X. Gantt E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 557-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 13Armstrong G.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 629-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In bacteria, they are always found clustered, except in the Cyanobacteria. In purple photosynthetic bacteria, the genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis are localized within the photosynthesis gene cluster, a 45-kb DNA region that contains the essential genes involved in the synthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus (14Alberti M.

Lorquin J. Angles d'Ortoli N. Garcia N. Chaintreuil C. Masson-Boivin C. Dreyfus B. Giraud E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3850-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This cluster contains the five crt genes, crtE, crtY, crtI, crtB, and crtW, necessary for the canthaxanthin biosynthesis. Neither photosynthesis genes nor specific genes of spirilloxanthin biosynthesis from lycopene (crtC, crtD, or crtF) have been identified in this cluster. Light stimulation of carotenoid biosynthesis has been reported in numerous organisms including plants, fungi, and bacteria (19Bramley P.M. Mackenzie A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1988; 29: 291-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In higher plants, regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis occurs at the level of phytoene synthase expression (20Von Lintig J. Welsch R. Bonk M. Giuliano A. Kleinig H. Plant J. 1997; 12: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This expression is controlled by a phytochrome, a plant photoreceptor that mediates response to red and far-red light through photoconversion between two stable conformations, a red-absorbing form (Pr) and a far-red-absorbing form (Pfr). Biochemical and genetic studies have recently demonstrated the occurrence of phytochrome-like proteins in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic bacteria (21Hughes J. Lamparter T. Mittmann F. Hartmann E. Gärtner W. Wilde A. Börner T. Nature. 1997; 386: 663Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Bhoo S.-H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Such a (bacterio)phytochrome appears to control the synthesis of the carotenoid deinoxanthin in the non-photosynthetic bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans (23Davis S.J. Vener A.V. Vierstra R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2517-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the characterization of a second crt gene cluster, in the Bradyrhizobium ORS278 strain, coding the enzymes of spirilloxanthin synthesis. This second crt gene cluster contains all the genes necessary for the synthesis of spirilloxanthin from farnesyl pyrophosphate. Biochemical analysis and phenotypes of mutants deleted in specific genes of canthaxanthin and spirilloxanthin synthesis allow us to establish the involvement of spirilloxanthin in the photosynthesis activity and the protective role of canthaxanthin in response of the bacteria to oxidative stress. We also demonstrate that the spirilloxanthin crt genes are specifically regulated by light via the control of a bacteriophytochrome. These results provide the first demonstration of two independent and differently regulated crt gene clusters in a living organism. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bradyrhizobium sp. strain ORS278 (wild-type strain) and isogenic mutants were grown in a modified yeast extract mannitol agar medium with addition of the appropriate antibiotic when required (24Giraud E. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Verméglio A. Dreyfus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All the strains were cultured for 7 days in sealed Petri dishes at 35 °C in either complete darkness or different continuous illumination conditions provided by light-emitting diodes of different wavelengths between 590 and 870 nm with an irradiance of 6.6 μmol of photons/m2/s. Escherichia coli was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. Pigment Analysis—Cells grown at the surface of the Petri dishes in the dark or under different light conditions were resuspended in 6 ml of water + 9 g/liter NaCl and centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 × g. The pellets were extracted three times in the dark with 1 ml of cold acetone/methanol (7:2, v/v). The carotenoids in the pooled extracts were analysis by HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RC, reaction center; LH, light harvesting; WT, wild type; LDAO, lauryldimethylamine oxide. using a Waters Alliance 2690 system. The conditions were: 5-μm Hypersil C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, Alltech), acetonitrile/methanol/isopropanol (40:50:10, v/v/v) as eluent, 0.8 ml/min flow rate. The eluted fractions were monitored using a Waters 996 photodiode array detector scanning from 270 to 600 nm every 2 s. Carotenoids were identified by their retention times and by comparison of the spectral features with those of pure compounds or with reported data. The amount of canthaxanthin was determined from the area of the peak detected at 480 nm using a calibration curve obtained with a canthaxanthin standard kindly provided by Aventis. The amount of spirilloxanthin was estimated from the area of the peak detected at 494 nm using the canthaxanthin correlation coefficient due to the lack of spirilloxanthin standard. The data represent the mean of three independent cultures. Light Action Spectrum of crt Gene Expression—The mutants harboring the various lacZ-crt fusions were grown under continuous illumination with low irradiance of different wavelengths as described previously (25Giraud E.

After growth, the cells under the illuminated area were resuspended in 3 ml of water, and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (24Giraud E. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Verméglio A. Dreyfus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Construction of crt Mutant Strains—Constructions of mutants deleted in the bacteriophytochrome (278ΔBrbphP) and in the transcriptional factor PpsR (278ΔppsR) have been described previously (25Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For the construction of a crtCD mutant (278ΔcrtCD), a region of about 3.5 kb containing crtC and crtD genes of ORS278 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-TAGTCGACGCAATGGCGCGCCACGATCTATC-3′ and 5′-ACAGTCGACCGGTCTTGGAGCGGTGATAATG-3′ and subsequently cloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A 2-kb region containing part of the crtC and crtD genes was deleted by XhoI digestion and replaced by the 4.7-kb SalI LacZ-Kmr cassette of pKOK5 (26Kokotek W. Lotz W. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 84: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The resulting 6.2-kb SalI insert containing the mutated crtC and crtD genes was cloned into the pJQ200mp18 suicide vector (27Quandt J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). To mutate the crtE.c gene of the canthaxanthin crt gene cluster, a region of about 1.2 kb containing crtE.c gene was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GGTAGATCTGGTCTGCATGCGCGGATGAAACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAAGATCTCGAAGGCAGGTTCAGAGTATG-3′, digested by BglII, and cloned into the BamHI sites of pJQ200mp18. The 4.7-kb BamHI LacZ-Kmr cassette of pKOK5 was then inserted into the unique BamHI site of crtE.c. To mutate the crtY gene, a 1.8-kb PstI fragment of pSTM78 (18Hannibal L. Lorquin J. Angles d'Ortoli N. Garcia N. Chaintreuil C. Masson-Boivin C. Dreyfus B. Giraud E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3850-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) containing crtY gene was cloned into the PstI sites of pJQ200mp18. A 0.4-kb XhoI fragment containing part of crtY was then deleted and replaced by the 4.7 SalI LacZ-Kmr cassette of pKOK5. To mutate the crtI.s gene of the spirilloxanthin crt gene cluster, a region of 1.4 kb was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCTTGGCTGGCGAAAGCGTCAATTTC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCAGGACGACAGGCGCTGCTCGAAATC-3′, digested by BamHI, and cloned into the BamHI sites of pJQ200mp18. The 4.7-kb SalI LacZ-Kmr cassette of pKOK5 was then inserted into the unique XhoI site of crtI.s. For each construction, we verified by PCR and sequencing that the lacZ reporter gene was in the correct orientation. The pJQ200 derivatives obtained, which encoded a counterselective sacB marker, were transformed into E. coli S17-1 for mobilization into ORS278 as described previously (24Giraud E. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Verméglio A. Dreyfus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Double recombinants were selected on sucrose, and the insertion was confirmed by PCR. Preparation of Membranes and RC-LH1 Complexes—A 200-ml culture of Bradyrhizobium (wild type (WT) or mutant) was collected and resuspended in 10 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8). The cells were disrupted by three passages through a French press at 50 megapascals. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 × g to remove the unbroken cells and cells debris. The supernatant was loaded on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.6–1.2 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8) and centrifuged at 255,000 × g for 90 min. The membranes localized at the interface of the two sucrose layers constitute the chromatophore fraction, while the pellet contains the cytoplasmic membranes. Each fraction was diluted in 25 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8), centrifuged at 255,000 × g for 90 min to removed the sucrose, and then resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm, pH 8). RC-LH1 complexes were isolated by addition of 1.5% LDAO to purified chromatophores or cytoplasmic membranes whose optical density was adjusted to 5 OD/cm at 870 nm. After an incubation of 15 min at room temperature in the dark, the membrane suspension was loaded on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.02% LDAO) and centrifuged at 255,000 × g for 90 min. All canthaxanthin molecules do not enter the sucrose gradient. The RC-LH1 particles, collected at the interface between the 0.2 and 0.3 m sucrose layers, were diluted in Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 8, 0.02% LDAO) and centrifuged at 255,000 × g for 180 min. They were resuspended in Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 8, 0.02% LDAO). Further purification of the canthaxanthin-containing fraction and of the RC-LH1 particles was performed using a mono-Q column coupled to an FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) and submitted to a NaCl gradient. Absorption and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Absorption spectra and light-induced absorption changes in intact cells were measured as described previously (24Giraud E. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Verméglio A. Dreyfus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were recorded on a Spex Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon). For excitation spectra, the excitation slits were 5 nm, and the emission was measured at 870 nm (on the blue side of the emission spectrum where the instrument sensitivity was highest) with 15-nm slits. For emission spectra excitation was through 10-nm slits, and emission was measured through 7-nm slits. Emission spectra were corrected for the wavelength dependence of the instrument response, and excitation spectra were corrected for variations in excitation intensity. For all fluorescence spectra the detector was protected from scattered excitation by a Wratten 88A gelatin filter. Isolation and Characterization of the Spirilloxanthin Biosynthesis Genes—In all photosynthetic bacteria studied so far, the carotenoid biosynthesis genes have been found linked to the photosynthesis gene cluster. We have previously isolated, from a genomic DNA library of the ORS278 strain, a cosmid (pSTM1) with an insert of ∼35 kb that contains some photosynthesis genes (24Giraud E. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Verméglio A. Dreyfus B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Its partial sequencing reveals a gene arrangement close to that of purple photosynthetic bacteria with the superoperonal structure bchCXYZpufBALM conserved. This prompted us to check whether the upstream region of bchC gene contains some of the carotenoid synthesis genes as observed in other photosynthetic bacteria. The sequencing of this region reveals the presence of six open reading frames encoding proteins with similarities to known Crt enzymes assigned to crtE, crtF, crtC, crtD, crtI, and crtB genes (Fig. 1B). The orientation of these open reading frames suggests the existence of a minimum of three operons (crtEF, crtCD, and crtIB) as usually observed in purple photosynthetic bacteria (2Armstrong G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overlap observed between crtD and crtC (348 bp) was also reported in Rubrivivax gelatinosus (28Ouchane S. Picaud M. Vernotte C. Reiss-Husson F. Astier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1670-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The canthaxanthin crt gene cluster (Fig. 1C) was previously isolated from the cosmid pSTM73 (18Hannibal L. Lorquin J. Angles d'Ortoli N. Garcia N. Chaintreuil C. Masson-Boivin C. Dreyfus B. Giraud E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3850-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We showed by PCR that there is no overlap between this cosmid and the cosmid pSTM1 containing the spirilloxanthin gene cluster. Together these results demonstrate the presence of two distinct crt gene clusters in Bradyrhizobium ORS278, a spirilloxanthin gene cluster localized in the photosynthesis gene cluster region and a canthaxanthin gene cluster localized in a different part of the genome. Interestingly the genes crtE, crtI, and crtB that encode enzymes of lycopene biosynthesis, a common precursor of canthaxanthin and spirilloxanthin, are found in both clusters. However, they are obviously different and show little similarity (38% identity between the two CrtE proteins and 43 and 51.6% for the CrtB and CrtI pairs, respectively). To distinguish these genes, we call the genes from the spirilloxanthin crt cluster crtE.s, crtI.s, and crtB.s and those from the canthaxanthin crt cluster crtE.c, crtI.c, and crtB.c. To demonstrate that the canthaxanthin and the spirilloxanthin crt gene clusters we have identified are each responsible for the biosynthesis of the appropriate one of these two carotenoids, we constructed a mutant deleted in crtY gene (278ΔcrtY strain, canthaxanthin minus) and a mutant deleted in the crtCD genes (278ΔcrtCD strain, spirilloxanthin minus). The pigmentation of both mutants is clearly different from the WT strain (Fig. 2A). The 278ΔcrtCD mutant presents an orange color characteristic of canthaxanthin, while the 278ΔcrtY mutant deleted in a canthaxanthin gene is pink as is typical for spirilloxanthin. These variations in color are essentially due to the difference in absorption profiles of the carotenoids in the 400–600 nm region of the three strains (Fig. 2B). HPLC analysis of the carotenoids extracted from each mutant (Fig. 2C) confirmed the absence of spirilloxanthin in the 278ΔcrtCD mutant as well as the absence of canthaxanthin in the 278ΔcrtY mutant. Membrane Localization and Function of Canthaxanthin and Spirilloxanthin—Aerobic photosynthetic bacteria are known to possess a small amount of photosynthetic apparatus correlated with few invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane (5Yurkov V.V. Beatty J.T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 695-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a first attempt to clarify the function of the two carotenoids present in Bradyrhizobium ORS278, cytoplasmic and intracytoplasmic fractions of the membrane were separated on a sucrose gradient after breakage of the WT cells. The two types of membranes could be separated as a function of their density (see “Experimental Procedures”). The cytoplasmic membranes form a pellet, while the intracytoplasmic membrane fragments (chromatophores) sediment at the interface between 0.6 and 1.2 m sucrose layers. The absorption spectrum of the chromatophores reveals the presence of bacteriochlorophyll (873, 590, and 375 nm) and spirilloxanthin (548, 515, and 485 nm) molecules but no detectable canthaxanthin (Fig. 3A). In contrast the cytoplasmic membrane contains a large amount of canthaxanthin in addition to the photosynthetic pigments (Fig. 3B). From the relative amounts of bacteriochlorophyll molecules present in these two fractions, we deduce that about 40% of the photosynthetic units are present in the chromatophores, while the rest is localized in the cytoplasmic membrane. This experiment clearly shows that spirilloxanthin molecules are associated with the photosynthetic apparatus in agreement with previous observations on several other species (10Takaichi S. Frank H.A. Young A.J. Britton G. Cogdell R.J. The Photochemistry of Carotenoids. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 40-69Google Scholar). Another proof that only spirilloxanthin molecules are associated with the photosynthetic apparatus was obtained by the measurement of the excitation spectrum of intact cells of the bacteriochlorophyll fluorescence around 890 nm (Fig. 3C). Comparison between the absorption spectrum of intact cells (Fig. 2B) and the excitation spectrum associated with the fluorescence emission of the LH1 complexes (Fig. 3C) shows that only the spirilloxanthin (at 550, 515, and 485 nm) molecules are able to transfer energy to the photosynthetic units. There is no evidence of energy transfer from canthaxanthin. In addition, identical excitation spectra are measured for both the WT and the 278ΔcrtY mutant (canthaxanthin minus) (Fig. 3C). These results clearly demonstrate that spirilloxanthin, but not canthaxanthin, transfers light energy to the photosynthetic apparatus. An additional proof comes from the characteristics of the absorption spectrum of purified RC-LH1 complexes. These complexes can be easily purified from the cytoplasmic or the chromatophore membranes after addition of 1.5% LDAO (see “Experimental Procedures”). These particles do not contain any canthaxanthin as shown by both their absorption spectrum (Fig. 3D) and analysis of their carotenoid content (data not shown). The phenotypes of mutants deleted in one of the genes of the canthaxanthin (278ΔcrtY) or the spirilloxanthin (278ΔcrtCD) pathways also demonstrate that spirilloxanthin and not canthaxanthin is associated with the photosynthetic apparatus. Indeed a similar amount of photosynthetic apparatus is present in intact cells of the WT or of the canthaxanthin minus mutant (278ΔcrtY) (see Fig. 2B) demonstrating that the lack of canthaxanthin does not affect its formation. In contrast, the amount of photosynthetic apparatus is reduced by at least a factor of 3–5 in the spirilloxanthin minus mutant (278ΔcrtCD) compared with the WT as shown by the comparison of their absorption spectra (see Fig. 2B) or measurement of light-induced photooxidation of the cytochrome on intact cells (data not shown). In fact, the chemical analysis of the carotenoid content of this mutant reveals the presence of a significant amount of lycopene (0.05 mg/g of cells) (data not shown). This carotenoid is associated with the small fraction of photosystem present in the 278ΔcrtCD mutant as demonstrated by the absorption spectrum of the chromatophore fraction and of purified isolated RC-LH1 complexes (Fig. 3, A and D) and the fluorescence excitation spectrum (Fig. 3C), which all present the characteristic bands of lycopene around 520, 487, and 460 nm. Canthaxanthin and RC-LH1 complexes can be easily extracted from the cytoplasmic membranes. The fraction containing the canthaxanthin does not enter the sucrose gradient, while the RC-LH1 complexes sediment at the 0.6–1.2 m interface (not shown). Further purification of the canthaxanthin fraction on a Mono-Q column followed by gel electrophoresis shows that the canthaxanthin is not associated with protein. This suggests that, unless the detergent has destroyed a weak protein-canthaxanthin association, canthaxanthin is present in the lipid phase of the membrane and not associated with specific polypeptides. One putative function of canthaxanthin is to act as strong antioxidant protecting against (photo)oxidative damage. To test this hypothesis, we measured the survival of bacteria exposed to an oxidative stress caused by addition of methyl viologen for both the WT and the 278ΔcrtY and 278ΔcrtCD mutants. As seen on Fig. 4, the canthaxanthin minus mutant (278ΔcrtY) is more sensitive to the addition of increasing concentrations of methyl viologen than either the WT strain or the spirilloxanthin minus mutant (278ΔcrtCD). In addition, the canthaxanthin minus mutant is less resistant than the WT strain in patch assays with H2O2 as the oxidative stress inducer (data not shown). These results are a clear indication that canthaxanthin acts as a protective agent against oxidative stress in Bradyrhizobium ORS278 cells. Regulation of Canthaxanthin and Spirilloxanthin Synthesis by Light—We have previously shown that the photosynthetic activity in Bradyrhizobium is stimulated by far-red light through the action of the bacteriophytochrome BrbphP (25Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The BrbphP gene is localized close to the photosynthesis gene cluster and contiguous to an open reading frame homologous to the transcription factor PpsR. The PpsR protein is known to repress crt genes in Rhodobacter species at high oxygen tension or high light intensity (29Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2869-2876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ponnampalam S.N. Buggy J.J. Bauer C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The up-regulation of photosynthesis genes by far-red light illumination observed in Bradyrhizobium ORS278 strain results from the antirepressor effect of the Pr form of BrbphP on PpsR (25Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Verméglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This prompted us to clarify the role o"
https://openalex.org/W2083836564,"CCR4, a poly(A) deadenylase of the exonuclease III family, is a component of the multiprotein CCR4-NOT complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is involved in mRNA degradation. CCR4, unlike all other exonuclease III family members, contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif through which it makes contact to CAF1 and other factors. The LRR residues important in contacting CAF1 were identified by constructing 29 CCR4 mutations encompassing a majority (47 of 81) of residues interstitial to the conserved structural residues. Two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation data revealed that physical contact between CAF1 and the LRR is blocked by mutation of just two α-helix/β-helix strand loop residues linking the first and second repeats. In contrast, CAF16, a potential ligand of CCR4, was abrogated in its binding to the LRR by mutations in the N terminus of the second β-strand. The LRR domain was also found to contact the deadenylase domain of CCR4, and deletion of the LRR region completely inhibited CCR4 enzymatic activity. Mutations throughout the β-sheet surface of the LRR, including those that did not specifically interfere with contacts to CAF1 or CAF16, significantly reduced CCR4 deadenylase activity. These results indicate that the CCR4-LRR, in addition to binding to CAF1, plays an essential role in the CCR4 deadenylation of mRNA.

Although the number of tandem repeats in these LRR structures is variable, ranging from 5 to 17 repeats, the overall nonglobular topology of each LRR is strongly similar. Each repeat is a structural unit consisting of a highly conserved β-strand packed against a more variable strand, usually helical; these are assembled along a common axis into an arc-shaped structure lined with parallel β-strands along the inner surface, an adjoining asparagine or cysteine loop region, and the α-helix, 310 helix, or extended conformation flanking the outer circumference (26Marino M.

Several studies point to the nonleucine, interstitial residues of the solvent-exposed β-sheet and the β/α-turn regions of the LRR motif as involved in protein and RNA ligand recognition and binding (22Ho D.N.

However, because each of these studies has targeted only a few of the potential LRR contact points, it is not yet clear whether such limited interactions are universally employed by this diverse protein family to mediate binding. CCR4 contains a central region of five complete tandem LRRs of 23 amino acid residues in length, plus one partial repeat, which together span residues 335–467 (14Malvar T. Biron R.W. Kaback D.B. Denis C.L. Genetics. 1992; 132: 951-962Google Scholar). On the basis of the length and consensus sequence of its LRR domain, CCR4 is classified as belonging to the most highly populated or typical subfamily of LRR proteins (19Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 519-527Google Scholar). Deletion of two or more LRRs of CCR4 results in a nonfunctional protein that is unable to complement a defective ccr4 allele and fails to bind to CAF1 and its other potential ligands (5Chen J. Rappsilber J. Chiang Y.-C. Russell P. Mann M. Denis C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 683-694Google Scholar, 14Malvar T. Biron R.W. Kaback D.B. Denis C.L. Genetics. 1992; 132: 951-962Google Scholar, 17Liu H.-Y Chiang Y.-C. Pan J. Salvadore C. Chen J. Audino D.C. Badarinarayana V. Palaniswamy V. Anderson B. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7541-7548Google Scholar, 33Draper M.P. Liu H.Y. Nelsbach A.H. Mosley S.P. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4522-4531Google Scholar). The direct physical contact between CCR4 and CAF1 has been established by two-hybrid assays and by immunoprecipitations (5Chen J. Rappsilber J. Chiang Y.-C. Russell P. Mann M. Denis C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 683-694Google Scholar, 6Liu H.Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Google Scholar, 15Bai Y Salvadore C. Chiang Y.-C. Collart M. Liu H.-Y. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Google Scholar). However, the CCR4 contact to CAF16 and its other potential ligands has only been shown by two-hybrid assays (17Liu H.-Y Chiang Y.-C. Pan J. Salvadore C. Chen J. Audino D.C. Badarinarayana V. Palaniswamy V. Anderson B. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7541-7548Google Scholar), and the physiological significance of these contacts remains to be determined. We have taken advantage of the small size and relative simplicity of the LRR of CCR4 to mutate systematically the majority of LRR residues predicted to be involved in ligand binding. A total of 29 mutants (47 amino acid alterations) were characterized for altered binding and functional activity. Here we report the contacts that the CCR4-LRR makes to its protein ligands, CAF1 and CAF16. Moreover, we find that the LRR interacts with the C-terminal exonuclease domain of CCR4 and, importantly, is absolutely required for its activity. Mutations across the β-sheet surface, including those that do not interfere with CAF1 binding, significantly reduced CCR4 enzyme activity, whereas mutations in other regions generally had less or no effect on CCR4 activity. These data demonstrate that the relatively small LRR domain of CCR4 is essential both for binding CAF1 and for CCR4 deadenylase function. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The following yeast strains were used in this study: EGY188 (MATa his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 LexA-LEU2), EGY191 (MATα his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 LexA-LEU2), EGY188-1a (isogenic to EGY188 except ccr4::URA3), MD9-7c (MATa adh1–11 his3 trp1 ura3 ccr4–10), and TM4 (isogenic to MD9-7c except trp1::CCR4). Conditions for growth of cultures on minimal medium lacking uracil and histidine or YEP medium (2% Bacto Peptone, 1% yeast extract, and either 4% glucose or 2% galactose/raffinose as a carbon source) have been described previously (34Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Google Scholar). YD solid medium contained YEP supplemented to 2% glucose and 2.5% agar. Because yeast cells expressing LexA-CCR4 fusion proteins were observed to undergo loss of activity with prolonged maintenance on selective plates, all assays on new transformants were conducted within 4 weeks of transformation. Plasmid Constructions—The construction of plasmid TM5, which contains the 1.5-kb BamHI to HindIII fragment of S. cerevisiae CCR4, has been described previously (14Malvar T. Biron R.W. Kaback D.B. Denis C.L. Genetics. 1992; 132: 951-962Google Scholar). MD9 (33Draper M.P. Liu H.Y. Nelsbach A.H. Mosley S.P. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4522-4531Google Scholar) is a LexA-CCR4 fusion plasmid in which full-length CCR4 (residues 1–837) has been fused in-frame with LexA at the EcoRI-BamHI polylinker site of pLexA1–87, a 2 μm-based plasmid described previously (35Brent R. Ptashne M.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 729-736Google Scholar). Full-length CCR4-LRR mutants generated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis were cloned into pMD9 as follows. The PCR products were digested with ApaI-BamHI, and the purified 1,400-bp fragment was ligated into the ApaI-BamHI site of pMD9. The remaining 588-bp ApaI gap (CCR4 residues 13–210) was then filled in by performing a second digest with ApaI and ligating in a purified 588-bp CCR4 ApaI fragment. B42-CAF1, B42-CAF16, and B42-CAF17 fusions used in this study have been described in detail previously (10Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Google Scholar, 17Liu H.-Y Chiang Y.-C. Pan J. Salvadore C. Chen J. Audino D.C. Badarinarayana V. Palaniswamy V. Anderson B. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7541-7548Google Scholar). CCR4-LRR Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce single or double point mutations into the LRR by sequential PCR steps using either of two methods described (36Aiyar A. Leis J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 366-369Google Scholar, 37Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 15-21Google Scholar). Briefly, either one or two mutagenic oligonucleotide primers, varying in length from 27 to 33 bases, were used in the first round of PCR to amplify template plasmid TM5, which contains the 1.5-kb BamHI–HindIII fragment of CCR4. Amplified fragments containing the desired mutation were purified and served as the template for a second round of PCR amplification using nonmutagenic primers to flank the mutation site. The resulting products were gel purified and digested for cloning into MD9 as described. The sequence of each mutant was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of the mutant LexA-CCR4 protein of the predicted size at wild-type levels was verified by anti-LexA Western blot analysis. Complementation Analysis—The ability of LexA-CCR4-LRR mutants to complement the ccr4–10 allele (defective for CCR4 function) in the strain MD9-7c was determined by transformation of MD9-7c with pMD9 expressing either wild-type or mutant LexA-CCR4 followed by phenotypic analysis for glycerol temperature sensitivity and growth on YD plates containing 8 mm caffeine (16Liu H.Y. Toyn J.H. Chiang Y.-C. Draper M.P. Johnston L.H. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5289-5298Google Scholar). The ability of CCR4-LRR-FLAG mutants to complement strain EGY188-1a-1, isogenic to EGY188-1a except ccr4::ura3, was determined on YD plates containing 8 mm caffeine and on YGAL plates lacking glucose and containing 2% galactose, 2% raffinose, and 8 mm caffeine. Enzyme Assays—Trancriptional activation was determined by cotransformation of pMD9 LexA-CCR4 or LexA-CCR4-LRR mutants into yeast strain EGY188 together with p34, a 2-μm reporter plasmid with eight LexA operators controlling expression of the lacZ gene (34Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Google Scholar, 35Brent R. Ptashne M.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 729-736Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity assays were conducted on yeast extracts as described previously (34Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Google Scholar). The ability of LexA-CCR4 mutants to interact with B42 fusion proteins was measured by their ability to activate LexA-lacZ activity in two-hybrid assays. B42 fusions of CCR4-NOT complex proteins were transformed into strain EGY191, and transformants were mated with EGY188/LexA-CCR4-LRR mutants; yeast extracts from resulting diploids were then assayed for β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activities reported (in units/mg) are the average of multiple assays of at least four separate transformants. S.E. values were less than 20%. Chromosomal Integration of LRR Mutations—Plasmid TM4 contains a selectable TRP1 marker and the 3.5-kb BglII fragment of wild-type CCR4 at the BamHI site of YRp7. To construct mutant CCR4-LRR strains, pMD9 carrying the desired CCR4 mutation was digested with ApaI and SmaI. The resulting fragments were gel purified and ligated into the ApaI-SmaI site of the TM4 vector. TM4-CCR4-LRR mutant plasmids were first linearized within the TRP1 site by digestion with BglII and then used for the integrative transformation at the trp1 locus in EGY188-1a. Transformants were initially selected on trp- plates, then subsequently transferred to YD to allow for plasmid loss. Single colonies were grown overnight and lysed; the extracts were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-CCR4 Western blot to confirm chromosomal CCR4 gene expression. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—The ccr4-null yeast strain, EGY188-1a, containing either wild-type CCR4 or a CCR4-LRR mutation integrated at the chromosomal TRP1 locus, was grown overnight in YEP medium containing 4% glucose. Cells were pelleted, and the whole-cell proteins were extracted in lysis buffer (8 mm K2HPO4, 17 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, plus protease inhibitors, pH 7.6). The insoluble fraction of the resulting extract was pelleted by centrifugation. A 2-mg aliquot of cleared supernatant was then incubated with 2 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-CAF1 for 45 min at 4 °C and mixed with 20 μl of protein A-agarose for an additional 30 min. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and washed three times in 1 ml of the lysis buffer, 1 ml of lysis buffer with 1 m KCl, and finally 1 ml of Triton X-100 wash buffer. 20 μl of SDS sample buffer was added to the beads, and then the beads were boiled for 4 min before being loaded on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis was carried out as described using polyclonal anti-NOT1, anti-CAF1, and anti-CCR4 blotting antibodies and alkaline phosphatase detection (10Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Google Scholar). RNA Enzyme Assays—CCR4-FLAG protein variants were prepared from a GAL1 promoter (38Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar) in strain EGY188-1a-1 as described previously (1Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Google Scholar). The RNA substrate 25N+20A was utilized, and the enzyme activities were conducted as described previously (38Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar). Relative enzyme activity was determined over several enzyme concentrations and standardized to that of wild-type CCR4-FLAG. Depending on the enzyme variant, relative activity was quantitated by determining the number of As removed per min or, for those variants having activity similar to wild-type, by determining the rate at which the 20N+1A substrate was deadenylated (38Viswanathan P. Chen J. Chiang Y.-C. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14949-14955Google Scholar). Quantitation of CCR4 protein variant abundances was determined by Western analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. CCR4-LRR Mutagenesis—A total of 29 CCR4-LRR mutants were generated by PCR mutagenesis, verified by sequencing, and cloned into a yeast expression vector for functional analysis (Fig. 1). The majority of mutants were single or double alanine substitutions of residues lying interstitial to conserved structural residues of the LRR. The conserved residues of the LRR were left intact to minimize alterations that would affect the overall structure and integrity of the LRR. To target residues encompassing all of the repeats efficiently, residues were mutated in pairs wherever possible. Together, these mutations targeted a majority (47 of 81) of the predicted nonconserved residues distributed across the 5.5 LRRs of yeast CCR4 (Fig. 1). For existing glycine or alanine residues the bulky aromatic residue tyrosine or phenylalanine was substituted. Each of the mutated CCR4 genes was constructed as a LexA-CCR4 fusion to monitor CCR4 interactions with its known ligands rapidly using the two-hybrid assay (10Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Google Scholar, 17Liu H.-Y Chiang Y.-C. Pan J. Salvadore C. Chen J. Audino D.C. Badarinarayana V. Palaniswamy V. Anderson B. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7541-7548Google Scholar). All of the mutants except two (K406A/Y407A and C426A/N427A, see “Discussion”) expressed a LexA-CCR4 fusion protein of the predicted size in vivo at levels comparable with wild-type LexA-CCR4 as determined by anti-LexA Western blots (data not shown). Also, all LexA-CCR4-LRR mutants transformed into MD9-7c, a yeast strain bearing the nonfunctional ccr4-10 mutant allele, exhibited complementation of the glycerol temperature-sensitive (ts) and 8 mm caffeine-sensitive phenotypes of ccr4-10 (data not shown) (16Liu H.Y. Toyn J.H. Chiang Y.-C. Draper M.P. Johnston L.H. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5289-5298Google Scholar). Each of the stably expressed mutant LexA-CCR4 proteins was initially analyzed for its ability to activate low level transcription from a LexA-lacZ reporter, a property characteristic of LexA-CCR4 (33Draper M.P. Liu H.Y. Nelsbach A.H. Mosley S.P. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4522-4531Google Scholar). All LexA-CCR4-LRR mutants retained the ability to activate transcription weakly (data not shown), consistent with the localization of the CCR4 activation domains to regions N-terminal to the LRR (33Draper M.P. Liu H.Y. Nelsbach A.H. Mosley S.P. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4522-4531Google Scholar). We did observe, however, that two alterations, Q429A/F430A and Y409A, resulted in significantly increased levels of lacZ expression (from 10 units/mg of β-galactosidase activity for wild-type to 140 units/mg for Y409A and 180 units/mg for Q429A/F430A). Because these alterations are situated in close proximity to one another in the modeled tertiary structure of the CCR4-LRR (see Figs. 1 and 3), it is possible that these residues may define either a repressor binding site or, more likely, a contact that influences the N-terminal activation domains. Identification of LRR Mutants Defective in Protein Binding to CAF1 and CAF16 —To characterize the effect of the LRR mutations on CCR4 protein binding, each of the LexA-CCR4-LRR mutant proteins was analyzed in two-hybrid interaction assays. LexA-CCR4-LRR mutants were screened for their ability to interact with B42 fusions of the CAF1 and CAF16 proteins shown previously to interact with wild-type LexA-CCR4. Of these two interacting proteins, only CAF1 has been shown to bind directly to CCR4 by immunoprecipitation analysis (6Liu H.Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Google Scholar, 15Bai Y Salvadore C. Chiang Y.-C. Collart M. Liu H.-Y. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Google Scholar). CAF16 is a likely component of the 1.9-MDa CCR4-NOT complex (17Liu H.-Y Chiang Y.-C. Pan J. Salvadore C. Chen J. Audino D.C. Badarinarayana V. Palaniswamy V. Anderson B. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7541-7548Google Scholar), but its physical interaction with CCR4 has only been demonstrated by two-hybrid analysis. In vivo binding interactions were measured based upon the transcriptional activation of a LexA-lacZ reporter plasmid (6Liu H.Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Google Scholar, 10Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Google Scholar, 17Liu H.-Y Chiang Y.-C. Pan J. Salvadore C. Chen J. Audino D.C. Badarinarayana V. Palaniswamy V. Anderson B. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7541-7548Google Scholar). The large majority of stably expressed CCR4-LRR mutants did not differ significantly from wild-type CCR4 in interacting with CAF1, CAF16, or other proteins shown to interact in the two-hybrid with CCR4 such as CAF17 (data not shown). We identified only two mutants for which binding to one CCR4-NOT complex fusion partner was reduced significantly while another partner interaction remained intact (Fig. 2): D357A/F358A and T360A/R361A. Another four mutants affected binding to all interactors tested (see below). The D357A/F358A alteration reduced by 20-fold the ability of LexA-CCR4 to interact with B42-CAF1 but had no effect on LexA-CCR4 interactions with B42-CAF16 (Fig. 2) or other CCR4 interactions, such as CAF17 (Fig. 2; data not shown). These results suggest that CAF1 contacts the CCR4-LRR primarily through the α-helix/β-strand loop, which links the first and second repeats. In contrast, the T360A/R361A mutation reduced the interaction of CCR4 with CAF16 by a factor of ∼16-fold but had no effect on CCR4 interactions with CAF1 (Fig. 2). The T360A/R361A mutations also affected CAF17 interaction (Fig. 2). Because this was the only mutant for which CAF16 binding was severely abrogated leaving the CAF1 contact unimpaired, CAF16 is likely to contact the CCR4-LRR directly through one or both of these residues. Several other mutations affected CCR4 two-hybrid interactions with CAF1, CAF16, and CAF17 (Fig. 2). These mutations, Q429A/F430A, D386A, Y409A, and G432F, all of which cluster on the same location across the β-sheet surface of the LRR (Fig. 3), may be affecting a key structural feature of the LRR such as to reduce its two hybrid interactions. Two of these alterations, Y409A and Q429A/F430A, were shown above also to affect LexA-CCR4 activation ability. LRR Mutations Disrupt the Physical Binding of CAF1 to CCR4 —To examine whether the two-hybrid assays reflect physical contacts between CCR4 and CAF1, CCR4-LRR mutant strains were constructed in a ccr4 null strain by the integration of non-LexA fusions of the CCR4-LRR mutants T360A/R361A, D357A/F358A, Q429A/F430A, and G432F into the genome. Each of these CCR4 proteins was expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 4A, right panel; although the abundance of CCR4 and CAF1 in the wild-type lane appears diminished relative to that in the mutants, other analyses indicate that there is no effect of the mutations on CCR4 or CAF1 protein abundance). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to compare the binding of native CAF1 to wild-type CCR4 and CCR4-LRR mutants. Whole-cell extracts from wild-type and LRR mutant strains were treated with polyclonal rabbit anti-CAF1 antibody, and the resultant immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-CAF1, anti-CCR4, and anti-NOT1 antibodies. As anticipated from the two-hybrid assay results, CCR4 was immunoprecipitated from the T360A/R361A LRR mutant strain at levels indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 4A, left panel), but barely detectable levels of CCR4 were coimmunoprecipitated from the D357A/F358A LRR mutant strain (left panel). NOT1 was coimmunoprecipitated from each of the CCR4-LRR mutant strains and from the wild-type strain at comparable levels, indicating that CAF1 could immunoprecipitate NOT1 even though it failed to bind well with the D357A/F358A CCR4-LR"
https://openalex.org/W1977797772,"Our structural comparison of the TIM barrel metal-dependent hydrolase(-like) superfamily suggests a classification of their divergent active sites into four types: αβ-binuclear, α-mononuclear, β-mononuclear, and metal-independent subsets. The d-aminoacylase from Alcaligenes faecalis DA1 belongs to the β-mononuclear subset due to the fact that the catalytically essential Zn2+ is tightly bound at the β site with coordination by Cys96, His220, and His250, even though it possesses a binuclear active site with a weak α binding site. Additional Zn2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+, but not Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+, can inhibit enzyme activity. Crystal structures of these metal derivatives show that Zn2+ and Cd2+ bind at the α1 subsite ligated by His67, His69, and Asp366, while Cu2+ at the α2 subsite is chelated by His67, His69 and Cys96. Unexpectedly, the crystal structure of the inactive H220A mutant displays that the endogenous Zn2+ shifts to the α3 subsite coordinated by His67, His69, Cys96, and Asp366, revealing that elimination of the β site changes the coordination geometry of the α ion with an enhanced affinity. Kinetic studies of the metal ligand mutants such as C96D indicate the uniqueness of the unusual bridging cysteine and its involvement in catalysis. Therefore, the two metal-binding sites in the d-aminoacylase are interactive with partially mutual exclusion, thus resulting in widely different affinities for the activation/attenuation mechanism, in which the enzyme is activated by the metal ion at the β site, but inhibited by the subsequent binding of the second ion at the α site.

Since d-amino acids are intermediates in the preparation of antibiotics, pesticides, and bioactive peptides, d-aminoacylase has commercial importance for the optical resolution of N-acetyl-dl-amino acids (1Yang Y.B. Lin C.S. Tseng C.P. Wang Y.J. Tsai Y.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 1259-1260Google Scholar, 2Tsai Y.C. Lin C.S. Tseng T.H. Lee H. Wang Y.J. Enzyme Microbial. Technol. 1992; 14: 384-389Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the 483-residue d-aminoacylase from Alcaligenes faecalis DA1 revealed that the enzyme is comprised of a small β barrel and a catalytic TIM barrel with a unique 63-residue insertion (3Liaw S.H. Chen S.J. Ko T.P. Hsu C.S. Chen C.J. Wang A.H.J. Tsai Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4957-4962Google Scholar). The structural similarity and the conserved metal ligands of four histidines and one aspartate suggest that d-aminoacylase belongs to the TIM barrel metal-dependent hydrolase superfamily. This superfamily includes a variety of enzymes with highly diverse substrates and has been coined an “evolutionary treasure” (4Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 72-82Google Scholar). To date, crystal structures of 14 members in the superfamily have been determined. As more structures are solved, more divergences in the metal centers and in the β-strand packing of the TIM barrel are observed (Fig. 1). Based on the binding site(s) of the catalytically essential metal ion(s), we classify these members into four types: αβ-binuclear (αβ), α-mononuclear (α), β-mononuclear (β), and metal-independent subsets. Phosphotriesterase (homology protein), urease, dihydroorotase, renal dipeptidase, isoaspartyl didpeptidase, and dihydropyrimidinase comprise the αβ subset (5Benning M.M. Shim H. Raushel F.M.

Arnold E. Ding J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4038-4049Google Scholar). Murine adenosine deaminase and Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase belong to the α subset (16Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Google Scholar, 17Ireton G.C. McDermott G. Black M.E. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 687-697Google Scholar). d-Aminoacylase belongs to the β subset due to the essential Zn2+ binding tightly at the β site, even though it possesses a weak α binding site (3Liaw S.H. Chen S.J. Ko T.P. Hsu C.S. Chen C.J. Wang A.H.J. Tsai Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4957-4962Google Scholar). In contrast, the activity assay and the crystal structure of uronate isomerase show that this enzyme does not display any specific metal requirement and thus belongs to the metal-independent subset (18Ashwell G. Wahba A.J. Hickman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1559-1565Google Scholar, 19Schwarzenbacher R. Canaves J.M. Brinen L.S. Dai X. Deacon A.M. Elsliger M.A. Eshaghi S. Floyd R. Godzik A. Grittini C.

The functional requirement for the different metal centers is still unclear. Interestingly, Bacillus subtilis N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase (NAGA) 1The abbreviation used is: NAGA, N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase. contains two iron ions and thus belong to the αβ subset, whereas the Thermotoga maritima enzyme has only one iron bound at the β site and may belong to the β subset (20Vincent F. Yates D. Garman E. Davies G.J. Brannigan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2809-2816Google Scholar). Eukaryotic and some bacterial NAGAs replace the conserved HXH motif with QXN and apparently possess only the β site. The putative magnesium-dependent TatD DNase from T. maritime also displays a similar β-mononuclear metal center. Similar to NAGAs, eukaryotic and some bacterial TatDs substitute the HXH with GXN. Structural comparison demonstrates that both αβ and β subsets share similar binuclear active sites (Fig. 1). The crystal structure of the inactive Klebsiella aerogenes urease variant (H134A) suggests that the proper coordination for the two catalytically essential metal ions in the αβ subset is mutually cooperative (21Park I.S. Michel L.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18632-18637Google Scholar). Therefore, we would like to address the function of the binuclear center in d-aminoacylase, the best studied β member. The bridging ligand in this superfamily is a bidentate carboxylate group from either carbamylated lysine or glutamate, except for d-aminoacylase using a cysteine residue instead. In putative d-aminoacylases from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680, Desulfitobacterium hafniense, and Gloeobacter violaceus, the unusual bridging cysteine is replaced with an aspartate. In this study, Cys96 was also changed into aspartate. Structural similarity search and subsequent structural comparisons were carried out by DALI (22Dietmann S. Park J. Notredame C. Heger A. Lappe M. Holm L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 55-57Google Scholar), VAST (23Gibrat J.F. Madej T. Bryant S.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 377-385Google Scholar),and INSIGHT II (Molecular Simulation Inc.). The recombinant protein of DA1 d-aminoacylase was expressed, isolated, and crystallized as described previously (24Hsu C.S. Chen S.J. Tsai Y.C. Lin T.W. Liaw S.H. Wang A.H.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1482-1483Google Scholar). The enzyme activity was measured using N-acetyl-d-methionine as substrate coupled to a d-amino acid oxidase enzyme assay (25Hsu C.S. Lai W.L. Chang W.W. Liaw S.H. Tsai Y.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2545-2550Google Scholar). Crystals of H220A and D366A mutants were grown as described for the native enzyme. The different metal derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals of the wild-type and mutant enzymes in a solution containing 10 μl of divalent cation solution (100–200 mm) and 10 μl of reservoir solution containing 25–30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.6), and 0.2 m ammonium acetate. The native protein contains one zinc ion tightly bound at the β site, even though no metal ions were added either during protein purification or crystallization (3Liaw S.H. Chen S.J. Ko T.P. Hsu C.S. Chen C.J. Wang A.H.J. Tsai Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4957-4962Google Scholar). Neither extensive dialysis of the protein solution against 100 mm EDTA in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) buffer nor soaking of the crystals with 100 mm EDTA in the crystallization solution could remove this bound zinc ion. Therefore, zinc ion is believed to bind tightly at the β site in the metal derivatives as in the native enzyme. The x-ray data were collected by using either an in-house radiation or synchrotron radiation and then processed using the program HKL (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group P212121, with one molecule in an asymmetric unit. The crystal structures of the metal derivatives and the mutants were solved by molecular replacement. The initial model was constructed starting with the refined coordinates of the wild-type protein at 1.5-Å resolution (Protein Data Bank code 1M7J). The mutated residue (Asp366 or His220), the bound zinc ions, and all water molecules were omitted from the initial model. The first simulated annealing omit maps clearly indicated the presence of the bound metal ions and the position of the missing residue. All structures were refined using CNS monitored by the free R factor and the quality of the electron density maps (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Addition of extrinsic zinc ions does not enhance enzyme activity. Instead a large excess of zinc ions is able to strongly inhibit enzyme activity. Zn2+ proved to be the most potent inhibitor followed by Cd2+ and Cu2+ (Table II; Fig. 2A). Kinetic studies demonstrate that exogenous Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions attenuate activity by slowing catalysis at the level of the rate-limiting step (a decrease in kcat), characteristic of noncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 2B). However, Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Ca2+ do not inhibit the enzyme activity. An excess of Zn2+, but not Co2+, was also shown to inhibit the enzyme activity of d-aminoacylases from Alcaligenes denitrificans DA181 and Alcaligenes xylosoxydans A-6 (29Yang Y.B. Hsiao K.M. Li H.

Interestingly, addition of Zn2+ into the C96D mutant but not the C96A, C96S, H220A, and D366A mutants could restore some enzyme activity (Table II).Table IICharacterization of DA1 d-aminoacylase mutants The kinetic parameters are the average of five assays with the standard deviations below 10%.

For the Zn2+ ion derivative, two strong electron density peaks, one at the natural β site and the other at the α site, were assigned as zinc based on the zinc anomalous data. The zinc ion at the β site is coordinated by Cys96, His220, and His250 as it is in the native enzyme (3Liaw S.H. Chen S.J. Ko T.P. Hsu C.S. Chen C.J. Wang A.H.J. Tsai Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4957-4962Google Scholar), while the zinc ion at the α site is tetrahedrally ligated by His67, His69, Asp366, and ACT1, an acetate molecule from the crystallization solution (Table III). For the Cd2+ derivative, the difference Fourier maps also show a large peak at the α site, suggesting that Cd2+ ion binds at the same position as the Zn2+ ion, henceforth called the α subsite. In contrast, Cu2+ is ligated by His67, His69, Cys96, and ACT1 at the α2 subsite. However, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Ca2+ did not bind to the enzyme.Table IIIThe geometries of α sitesM2+Zn2+/Cd2+ (α1)Cu2+ (α2)Zn2+ (α3)Zn2+ (α4)Bond distances (Å) M-H67Nϵ22.002.102.142.37 M-H69Nϵ22.042.012.122.09 M-C96Sγ3.522.302.602.46 M-D366Oδ11.983.342.24 M-Act1O11.952.612.28 M-β3.833.383.293.20 M-α11.460.771.12 M-α21.460.720.47 M-α30.770.720.37 M-α41.120.470.37Bond angles (°) 67Nϵ2-M-69Nϵ2110.92119.73118.63112.96 67Nϵ2-M-96Sγ101.1894.6093.70 67Nϵ2-M-366Oδ1103.3589.99 67Nϵ2-M-Act1O1121.09102.62112.06 69Nϵ2-M-96Sγ130.44116.91126.76 69Nϵ2-M-366Oδ1102.5284.76 69Nϵ2-M-Act1O1112.46104.01106.84 96Sγ-M-366Oδ1151.49 96Sγ-M-Act1O191.98103.81 366Oδ1-M-Act1O1104.00 Open table in a new tab Metal Selectivity—Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Ca2+ do not bind to the α site, perhaps because of the type of ligands and the coordination stereochemistry. Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ prefer to bind to oxygen-containing ligands. In addition, Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ prefer an octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal coordination sphere, and a pentagonal bipyramid is preferred by Ca2+ (31Yang W. Lee H.W. Hellinga H. Yang J.J. Proteins. 2002; 47: 344-356Google Scholar, 32Auld D.S. BioMetals. 2001; 140: 271-313Google Scholar). The requirement of the bi-nickel center in urease is perhaps due to the preference of nickel for octahedral coordination having multiple available binding sites for the substrate urea and for the active site hydration (8Benini S. Rypniewski W.R. Wilson K.S. Miletti S. Ciurli S. Mangani S. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 205-216Google Scholar). On the other hand, Zn2+,Cd2+, and Cu2+ strongly prefer a tetrahedral geometry (32Auld D.S. BioMetals. 2001; 140: 271-313Google Scholar, 33Karlin S. Zhu Z.Y. Karlin K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14225-14230Google Scholar, 34Dudev T. Lim C. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 773-787Google Scholar). Cysteine residues have never been found to serve as ligands in the cocatalytic zinc-binding sites with the possible exception of the zinc-dependent β-lactamases (32Auld D.S. BioMetals. 2001; 140: 271-313Google Scholar). Instead aspartate and histidine predominate as ligands in cocatalytic zinc sites, and a bidentate carboxylate group is the predominant bridging ligand. Once a cysteine binds to metal ions, its sulhydryl side chain is considered to be deprotonated and to have a more favorable charge-charge electrostatic interaction. Because Cys96 contributes most of its charge to interact with the tightly bound β ion, Cys96 may not interact with the second metal ion strongly. As a result, the enzyme utilizes His67, His69, and Asp366 for chelation of additional Zn2+ and Cd2+. On the other hand, Cu2+ is a “soft” ion and prefers soft ligands, with sulfur and nitrogen being the most preferred coordinating atoms. Protein Data Bank surveys of copper-binding sites have shown that very seldom is a copper ion ligated by acidic residues (33Karlin S. Zhu Z.Y. Karlin K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14225-14230Google Scholar, 35Castagnetto J.M. Hennessy S.W. Roberts V.A. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Pique M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 379-382Google Scholar). Therefore, the additional Cu2+ chooses His67, His69, and Cys96 as its ligands. The Inactive H220A Mutant—Unexpectedly, the difference electron density maps showed that in the H220A mutant the endogenous zinc ion no longer binds at the β site, instead it is tetrahedrally coordinated by His67, His69, Cys96, and Asp366 at the α3 subsite (Fig. 3B). The α3 subsite is located almost midway between the α1 and α2 sites (Table III). Elimination of the enzyme activity by the substitution of His220 with alanine may be due to a lack of the β ion, suggesting that the β ion is indeed required for the catalysis. The metal coordination in the H250N mutant is expected to be similar to that in the H220A mutant because both His220 and His250 ligate the β ion, and the H220A and H250N mutants bind approximately half the normal complement of zinc ion (25Hsu C.S. Lai W.L. Chang W.W. Liaw S.H. Tsai Y.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2545-2550Google Scholar, 30Wakayama M. Yada H. Kanda S. Hayashi S. Yatsuda Y. Sakai K. Moriguchi M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1-8Google Scholar). The much stronger electron density peak and lower B-factor of the zinc ion in the H220A mutant (20.5 Å2 for the zinc ion and an average value of 15.4 Å2 for all protein atoms) than the proposed zinc ion at the α1 subsite in the native enzyme (51.5 Å2 for the zinc ion and an average value of 9.3 Å2 for all protein atoms) show that elimination of the β ion enhances the binding affinity of the α ion. This enhancement suggests that the α and β sites are interactive with partially mutual exclusion. In the native enzyme, Cys96 commits most of its charge to interact with the β ion and thus could not interact with the α ion strongly, resulting in different metal-binding affinities. Once the β site is destroyed, Cys96 could contribute its charge to interact with the α ion and thus enhance metal affinity. This unusual bridging Cys96 has been shown to contribute the most toward the interactions with the metal ions among the ligands, because the C96A mutant shows very little zinc-binding ability, 0.2 g·atom/mol of enzyme (25Hsu C.S. Lai W.L. Chang W.W. Liaw S.H. Tsai Y.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2545-2550Google Scholar). The less active C96D mutant also demonstrates the uniqueness of this cysteine residue. The Inactive D366A Mutant—The electron density maps showed that the tetrahedral arrangement of the β zinc ion in the D366A mutant is maintained as in the native enzyme (Fig. 3C). Replacement of Asp366 with alanine does not induce any significant conformational change, but it does abolish enzyme activity, perhaps due to its action via proton transfer as a general base. A similar coordination geometry of the β zinc ion is expected as well for the His67 and His69 mutants because these three residues do not chelate the β ion, and neither the H67N nor the D366A mutant shows a significant drop in zinc binding (25Hsu C.S. Lai W.L. Chang W.W. Liaw S.H. Tsai Y.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2545-2550Google Scholar, 30Wakayama M. Yada H. Kanda S. Hayashi S. Yatsuda Y. Sakai K. Moriguchi M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1-8Google Scholar). In D366A mutant, additional Cu2+ binds at the α2 subsite, the same as in the wild-type protein, while Zn2+ binds weakly at another α site (α4) surrounded by His67, His69, Cys96, and ACT1 (Table III, Fig. 3D). A comparison of the crystal structures presented here reveals that the spatial locations of all protein residues are virtually identical, suggesting that the His220 mutant, the Asp366 mutant, and the metal binding to the enzyme do not significantly alter the three-dimensional structure (Fig. 3D). The differences in metal coordination are achieved by small movements of the metal ions and small shifts in the side chains of ligands to accommodate the metal binding. These results seem to be in agreement with the entatic state theory proposed by Williams, in which the metal site in a metalloprotein is configured by the protein matrix (36Williams R.J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 363-381Google Scholar). The contrast between virtually identical β sites and conformationally variable α sites with a looser arrangement of ligands is consistent with their different affinities. A Metal Inhibition Mechanism—There are two possible mechanisms for the inhibition effect of the α metal ion (Fig. 4). First, the proton dissociation energy of histidine has been shown to drop significantly upon metal ion binding, due to stabilization of the negatively charged imidazolate anion by metal dication through charge-charge interactions and charge transfer (37El Yazal J. Pang Y.-P. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 8773-8779Google Scholar). Therefore, ligation of the α ion by the highly conserved residues His67, His69, and Asp366 would lower their pKa and thus down-regulate their ability to efficiently carry out the proton transfer and intermediate stabilization, resulting in a reduction in kcat. Second, the putative active site water molecule, which is likely to be present at the product acetate ACT1 O1 position, lies significantly closer to the zinc ion at the α1 subsite (1.95 Å) than that at the β site (2.84 Å). This is one striking difference between the active site here and those in other binuclear zinc hydrolases such as the αβ members, where the water/hydroxide ion is almost symmetrically located between the two metal ions (5Benning M.M. Shim H. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2712-2722Google Scholar, 6Buchbinder J.L. Stephenson R.C. Dresser M.J. Pitera J.W. Scanlan T.S. Fletterick R.J.

Arnold E. Ding J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4038-4049Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibitory metal ion at the α site may hold the active site water tightly and thus perturb the stereochemical arrangements required for enzyme catalysis as it does in bovine carboxypeptidase A (38Gomez-Ortiz M. Gomis-Rüth F. Huber R. Avilés F.X. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 336-340Google Scholar). The much stronger inhibition by Zn2+ and Cd2+ than Cu2+ may be due to Asp366, an important residue for the proton shuttle, and the active site water molecule being closer to the α1 subsite than the α2 subsite (2.61 Å). A Metal Activation/Attenuation Mechanism—Our studies presented here suggest that the binuclear metal center in d-amioacylases is responsible for a metal activation/attenuation mechanism. The enzyme is activated by the Zn2+ ion tightly bound at the β site but inhibited by the subsequent binding of a second metal ion at the α site. To achieve this mechanism, an unusual bridging cysteine (Cys96) is inserted to generate mutually exclusive metal-binding sites, which result in different metal-binding affinities. The binding at the high affinity β site leads to a weakened binding at the α site, whereas a lack of the β ion enhances the α ion binding. To the best of our knowledge after a structural and sequence search, d-aminoacylase is the only member of the TIM barrel metal-dependent hydrolase superfamily that uses a cysteine as a metal bridging ligand. Mutation of Cys96 into alanine, serine, and threnine, but not aspartate, causes an almost complete loss of the metal-binding ability. The purified C96D mutant contains a similar zinc content as measured by atomic absorption, as the native enzyme. However, this mutant results in 104-fold decrease in the enzyme activity. Unexpectedly, addition of some zinc ions restores the enzyme activity by 100-fold with an effect on kcat but not Km, indicating involvement of this cysteine residue in catalysis. Therefore, the particular bridging cysteine residue serves as a control switch for regulation of catalytic activity. As mentioned above, NAGAs and TatD DNases have distinct amino acid triplets for the conserved HXH, but there is similarity in the pattern of evolution. Sequence analysis of the HXH and GXN groups of TatD DNases shows that the former are solely present in the Eubacteria, while the latter are present in the Eubacteria, Archeae, and Eukaryotes. This would suggest that the latter is a more ancient form of the enzyme, which does not require the involvement of metal regulation. In some Eubacteria, the GXN enzyme is present in parallel with a HXH enzyme, suggesting a distinct functional difference that may be related to the presence of metal regulation at the active site. The GXN enzyme group of the Eubacteria is also generally Gram-negative proteobacteria having a close environmental relationship with Eukaryotes, and thus it is possible that the presence of this enzyme in these bacteria represent a horizontal transfer from Eukaryotes some time after the split of the three Kingdoms. Thus metal-based regulation of the active site in the HXH enzymes may have a particular function in Eubacteria and the need for an enzyme that is not subject to such regulation may be niche specific. For example, fluctuations in environmental metal content in Eukaryotes will generally be less than for free living bacteria. A similar pattern between bacteria and eukaryotes occurs for NAGAs, and thus it is possible that similar evolution pressures have resulted in a similar pattern of metal regulation between these two enzyme groups. Inhibition by Excess Zinc Ion in Other Metalloenzymes—The crystal structures of thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A, main representatives of two large superfamilies, endo- and exoproteases, in the presence of excess zinc also show second inhibitory zinc-binding sites at the active site (38Gomez-Ortiz M. Gomis-Rüth F. Huber R. Avilés F.X. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 336-340Google Scholar, 39Holland D.R. Hausrath A.C. Juers D. Mattews B.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1955-1965Google Scholar). Both inhibitory zinc ions are also located in close proximity to the essential zinc (3.2 and 3.3 Å). The inhibitory zinc in thermolysin sterically excludes the substrate, whereas that in carboxypeptidase A holds the active site water molecule. Despite the great differences in overall folding and active-site topologies of the proteases and d-aminoacylase, their inhibitory zinc-binding sites share some common features with the cocatalytic zinc sites (32Auld D.S. BioMetals. 2001; 140: 271-313Google Scholar), in which the metal ions are in close proximity and bridged by external ligands (water, hydroxyl, acetate) and/or protein residues. Since zinc is the second-most abundant transition metal in living organisms after iron, it is quite possible that inhibitory zinc ions may be involved in important physiological functions and this should not be neglected. Conclusions—The divergences of the metal centers and the β-strand packing in the TIM barrel metal-dependent hydrolases illustrate the structural plasticity for the functional diversity in the superfamily. The present kinetic and structural studies of the A. faecalis DA1 d-aminoacylase suggest that the binuclear metal center in this β-mononuclear member is responsible for an “activation/attenuation” mechanism, whereby the enzyme is activated by the Zn2+ ion at the β site but inhibited by the subsequent binding of a second metal ion at the α site. The synchrotron radiation experiments were performed at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan, at the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan, and at the SPring-8, Sayo, Japan."

This has been dominated by the two-electron gates of bacterial reaction centers (reviewed in Refs. 1Okamura M.Y. Paddock M.L. Graige M.S. Feher G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 148-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar and 2Wraight C.A. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 309-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which until recently have provided the only high resolution structures. Discussion has centered on the features of structure that allow the sites to mediate between the one-electron chemistry of photochemical reactions (or of cytochrome or iron-sulfur center redox reactions) and the two-electron chemistry of quinones. Since reduction or oxidation of the quinone systems involves uptake or release of protons, the sites also have to include the features needed to deal with these processes. Over the last few years, structures at high resolution have become available for several other proteins with quinone processing sites. Among these, the bc1 complex has provoked the most interest because of the dynamic features associated with the Qo-site, through which ubihydroquinone (quinol, QH2) is oxidized (reviewed in Refs. 3Berry E. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.-S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1007-1077Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 4Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev.

However, recent structures at high resolution have suggested that the second quinone processing site of the bc1 complex, the Qi-site, through which ubiquinone (quinone, Q) is reduced through a two-electron gate, might also have interesting dynamic features, albeit on a smaller scale (9Kolling D.R.J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9067-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Of the three high resolution structures available in which a quinone is modeled at the site, all show marked differences in the pattern of ligation by protein side chains, in the orientation of the quinone, and in the involvement of bridging waters. Earlier studies of functional aspects show the same general two-electron gate behavior at the Qi-site as that at the QB-site of bacterial reaction centers but with heme bH of the cytochrome (cyt) b subunit acting as an electron donor (12Crofts A.R. Wraight C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 149-186Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In both systems, a relatively stable semiquinone (SQ) intermediate stores one electron from the donor chain and is reduced to quinol by a second electron. The involvement of the SQ necessitates that the sites accommodate binding of all three components of the quinone redox system. The three species (Q, SQ, and QH2) require different properties of the H-bond partners, which therefore have to respond during different phases of the catalytic cycle. The structures have shown that the thermodynamic properties and pattern of liganding involved in the Qi-site are different from those in the bacterial reaction centers and that the proton processing pathways are likely also different, and simpler. To understand the mechanism, more detailed information is needed on the H-bonding to the intermediate semiquinone. This information is important both in terms of the binding of the semiquinone and because the proton exchange reactions are likely mediated by transfer through H-bonds. The paramagnetic properties of the semiquinone provide the possibility of studying the protein environment through ENDOR and ESEEM applications, in which the interactions of nuclear spins from neighboring 1H and 14N atoms with the unpaired electron spin modify the energy levels and relaxation properties of the spin system. In contrast to reaction centers, the semiquinone at the Qi-site is EPR-detectable without the need for structural modification. In previous work (13Salerno J.C. Osgood M. Liu Y. Taylor H. Scholes C.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the ubisemiquinone at the Qi-site has been studied by X-band ENDOR. Spectra showed a loss of intensity after 1H/2H exchange. These changes were assigned to one or more protons from hydrogen bonds, with the perpendicular component having a hyperfine tensor ∼4 MHz. However, the number of hydrogen bonds, their orientation, and which protein atoms were involved in these bonds were not resolved. We have shown more recently using X-band ESEEM that the SQ at the Qi-site interacts with a nitrogen atom, characterized by an isotropic hyperfine coupling, A, of ∼0.8 MHz and quadrupole coupling constant, K, of ∼0.35 MHz. The nitrogen was identified as the Nϵ or Nδ imidazole nitrogen of a histidine, most probably His-217, equivalent to His-201 in the bovine mitochondrial complex (9Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I. Holland J.T. Berry E.A Dikanov S.A. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39747-39754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the structure from Berry's group, this histidine provides an H-bond through the Nϵ-atom to one of the quinone carbonyls. The isotropic hyperfine coupling suggests the existence of an atomic bridge for the transfer of spin density from the SQ on this protein nitrogen. The only likely mechanism for such a transfer is a hydrogen bond between one of the SQ oxygens and the protein nitrogen identified. We did not detect in the X-band ESEEM spectra any major contributions from other nitrogens in the SQ environment that had comparable unpaired spin density. Thus, ENDOR and ESEEM studies have established the presence of at least one hydrogen bond between the SQ in the Qi-site and the protein environment, with the participation of a histidine imidazole nitrogen. However, the results of these studies did not exclude the existence of additional hydrogen bonds between SQ oxygens and other protein H-bonding partners, for example R-O-H... O, R-S-H... O, or even R-N-H... O, but with smaller nitrogen isotropic coupling. As noted above, analysis of the available high resolution x-ray structures provides ambiguous information about other possible H-bonds. Three structures at ≤2.6-Å resolution all have different configurations of the quinone bound at the Qi-site. However, all show the same three suitable residues close enough to the quinone to allow formation of H-bonds, assuming some degree of structural flexibility. These are (in bovine numbering) His-201, Asp-228, and Ser-205, with the following bond lengths in the 2.1-Å structure from Berry's group (9Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I. Holland J.T. Berry E.A Dikanov S.A. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39747-39754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar): His-201 NϵH to carbonyl O-atom (2.52 Å), Asp-228 –OH to carbonyl O-atom (2.74 Å), and Ser-205 –OH to H2O (2.62 Å), and to the –O-CH3 O-atom (4.06 Å). In the other structures, H-bonds with either the histidine (10Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) or both the aspartate and the histidine (11Gao X. Wen X. Esser L. Quinn B. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Xia D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9067-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) were mediated by bridging waters. The H-bonding of the serine also varied, with the yeast structure (10Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) showing a H-bond to one –O-CH3, and the Gao et al. (11Gao X. Wen X. Esser L. Quinn B. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Xia D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9067-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) bovine structure showing an H-bond to the other –O-CH3 O-atom. We note, however, that in the coordinate data set for this latter structure available from the Protein Data Bank (1ntz), the configuration of the Qi-site has been revised, with the quinone flipped so as to show a H-bonding pattern more similar to that in yeast. In this study, we present a characterization of the exchangeable protons around SQ in the Qi-site by ESEEM and HYSCORE, visualized by substitution of H2O by 2H2O, in samples of Rhodobacter sphaeroides bc1 complex poised with a substantial population of SQ at the Qi-site. Our results indicate the existence of three exchangeable protons interacting with the electron spin of the SQ. These possess different isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine couplings that allow clear distinction between them. The hyperfine couplings all differ from values typical for in-plane hydrogen bonds observed in model experiments with semiquinones in frozen aqueous or alcohol solutions. It is suggested that the formation of two hydrogen bonds with carbonyl oxygens involves a significant out-of-plane character and occurs under the combined influence of bulky substituents and the protein environment. Generation of Semiquinone at the Qi-site—Three protocols used to generate semiquinone at the site were similar to those described previously (9Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I. Holland J.T. Berry E.A Dikanov S.A. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39747-39754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), with minor modifications to maximize the intensity of the semiquinone radical signal. The samples, with or without the addition of inhibitors (antimycin and/or myxothiazol), were incubated at room temperature for at least 20 min. In the sodium ascorbate reduced samples, the sodium ascorbate was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The samples that contained semiquinone generated by the addition of decylubihydroquinone in the presence of myxothazol were mixed within the EPR cuvette and rapidly (∼30 s) frozen in liquid nitrogen. The paramagnetic signals had similar characteristics in all of the samples. In all cases, the semiquinone species observed was completely eliminated by the addition of antimycin at 2-fold molar excess over the monomer concentration. Preparation of Deuterium-exchanged Samples—Deuterium-exchanged samples were subjected to three dilutions in 2H2O medium, each dilution by a factor of 10. Samples were reconcentrated between each dilution step using a Centriplus YM-100 centrifugal concentrator (Amicon). Following the final exchange and concentration step, samples were incubated over 24 h at 4 °C. Sodium ascorbate used was dissolved into 2H2O, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended into 2H2O. The buffer used for samples with ascorbate-generated semiquinone was 100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.01% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Sigma), 15 μg/ml phosphatidyl choline (Avanti Polar-Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) at pH 7.8 made in 99% deuterium oxide (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA). The buffer used for samples in the presence of myxothiazol and decylubiquinol was the same as previous, except 50 mm CHES, in place of MOPS, was used at a pH of 9.0. Preparation of Isolated bc1 Complex—The bc1 complex was isolated from chromatophores prepared from R. sphaeroides strain GBH6 and purified following the protocols described by Kuras et al. (14Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16280-16288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with minor modifications as described in Ref. 9Kolling D.R.J. Samoilova R.I. Holland J.T. Berry E.A Dikanov S.A. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39747-39754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. EPR Measurements—The continuous wave EPR and ESEEM experiments were carried out using X-band Bruker Elexsys E580 spectrometers equipped with Oxford CF 935 cryostats. Unless otherwise indicated, all measurements were made at 90 K. Several types of ESE experiments with different pulse sequences were employed with appropriate phase-cycling schemes to eliminate unwanted features from experimental echo envelopes. Among them are two-pulse, and one-dimensional and two-dimensional four-pulse sequences. In the two-pulse experiment (π/2-τ-π-τ-echo), the intensity of the echo signal is measured as a function of the time interval τ between two microwave pulses with turning angles π/2 and π to generate an echo envelope that maps the time course of relaxation of the spin system (in ESEEM) or as a function of magnetic field at fixed τ (in field-sweep ESE). In the two-dimensional four-pulse experiment (π/2-τ-π/2-t1-π-t2-π/2-τ-echo), also called HYSCORE, the intensity of the stimulated echo after the fourth pulse is measured with t2 and t1 varied at constant τ. Such a two-dimensional set of echo envelopes gives, after complex Fourier transformation, a two-dimensional spectrum with equal resolution in each direction. This procedure differs from the one-dimensional version of the four-pulse experiment where the time τ between first and second pulses is kept constant and the times t1 = t2 = T/2 are increased stepwise. The set of four-pulse envelopes recorded at different τ values forms a two-dimensional four-pulse data set. Spectral processing of ESEEM patterns was performed using Bruker WIN-EPR software. Characteristics of HYSCORE Spectra from I = ½ Nuclei—The most informative experimental data regarding the ligand environment of SQ were obtained from the two-dimensional ESEEM (HYSCORE) experiment (15Höfer P. Grupp A. Nebenfηhr H. Mehring M.M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1986; 132: 279-284Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The basic advantage of the HYSCORE technique is the creation in two-dimensional spectra of off-diagonal cross-peaks whose coordinates are nuclear frequencies from opposite electron spin manifolds. The cross-peaks simplify significantly the analysis of congested spectra by correlating and spreading out the nuclear frequencies. In addition, the HYSCORE experiment separates overlapping peaks along a second dimension and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through a second Fourier transform. HYSCORE is also valuable for the detection of extended anisotropic peaks of low intensity, which are not seen in one-dimensional ESEEM spectra. HYSCORE spectra are sensitive to the relative signs of the correlated frequencies and are usually presented as two quadrants (+,+) and (+,–). A nucleus with I = ½, such as 1H, has two hyperfine frequencies, να and νβ, corresponding to two states of the electron spin in the applied magnetic field. These may produce a pair of cross-features, (να, νβ) and (νβ, να), in the (+,+) quadrant as well as another pair (να, –νβ) and (νβ, –να) in the (+,–) quadrant. Peaks in the (+,–) quadrant appear primarily from strong hyperfine interactions, i.e. |T+2a| ≫ 4νI, whereas the peaks in the (+,+) quadrant appear predominantly for |T+2a|≪ 4νI (where a is the isotropic hyperfine coupling, T is the perpendicular component of the axial anisotropic hyperfine tensor, and νI is the nuclear Zeeman frequency). Peaks may appear in both quadrants simultaneously if the hyperfine and Zeeman couplings are comparable (16Dikanov S.A. Tyryshkin A.M. Bowman M.K. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 144: 228-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present work, the cross-peaks from protons were located in (+,+) quadrant only. Orientationally disordered (i.e. powder) spectra of I = ½ nuclei also reveal, in the form of cross-peak contour projections, the interdependence between να and νβ values in the same orientation. Analysis of the contours allows for direct, simultaneous determination of the nuclear isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants (17Dikanov S.A. Bowman M.K. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 116: 125-128Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The line of the SQ in frozen solutions of the bc1 complex in H2O at 90 K has a width ∼0.80–0.85 mT in X-band continuous wave EPR and in field-sweep ESE spectra. The replacement of H2O by 2H2O decreases the line width by less then 0.1 mT. The effects of solvent replacement on line shape and line width of the SQ are relatively small, and in line with those reported previously (13Salerno J.C. Osgood M. Liu Y. Taylor H. Scholes C.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), despite the significant difference in magnetic moments of the 1H and 2H. Typical principal values of the g-tensor of the quinone anion-radicals in reaction centers and frozen solutions measured by Q- and W-band EPR vary within the following ranges: gx = 2.0064 ± 0.0006, gy = 2.0051 ± 0.0002, gz = 2.0021 ± 0.0001 (18Lubitz W. Feher G. Appl. Magn. Reson. 1999; 17: 1-49Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Such tensor anisotropy produces the difference of ∼0.7–0.8 mT between the fields corresponding to the gx and gz canonical orientations in powder X-band EPR spectrum measured at microwave frequency ∼9.7 GHz. This estimated difference corresponds well to the line width of the SQ (Fig. 1) and indicates that the primary contribution to line shape is given by g-tensor anisotropy, which largely masks the influence of 1H/2H substitution on the EPR spectrum. Fig. 2 shows the two-pulse spin echo decay of the SQ measured at the maximum of EPR intensity in the two samples at 90 K. The sample in H2O shows the modulation associated with spin coupling to protons and 14N-atoms in the immediate environment, with Zeeman frequencies ∼15 and ∼1.5–5 MHz, respectively. The additional deep periodical variations of the echo intensity that appear in the sample prepared in 2H2O are characteristic, and Fourier transformation of this echo envelope shows that the major contribution to the deep variations occurs at the frequency of ∼2.3 MHz, corresponding to the Zeeman frequency of deuterium. There is also a contribution of smaller intensity at the double frequency ∼4.6 MHz. This result gives a first indication of solvent accessibility and 1H/2H exchange around the SQ. On the other hand, the resolution achieved in two-pulse spectra is not sufficient to show details of the interaction with protons and deuterons. More complete information about the proton environment of the SQ was obtained from the application of more sophisticated one-dimensional and two-dimensional ESEEM approaches. HYSCORE—The proton region of the HYSCORE spectra of the SQ obtained at τ = 136 and 200 ns in the samples with two different solvents is shown in Fig. 3. In addition to a diagonal peak with extended shoulders at the proton Zeeman frequency (∼14.7 MHz), the spectrum in Fig. 3, a and b, contains three types of resolved cross-peaks, designated H1, H2, and H3. The cross-peaks labeled H1 extend between (17.4; 12.2) and (16.2; 13.4) MHz. A set of lower intensity lines (H2) is located in a similar area of the plot and even overlaps with the H1 lines at the high frequency edge of the ν2 dimension. Nevertheless, the contours of both cross-features are well pronounced and could be used for the quantitative analysis. Lines associated with H3 are well separated from the H1 and H2 lines and consist of several separate features in the area further up the diagonal. The opposite cross-feature is enhanced at larger times τ. The HYSCORE spectra recorded under the same conditions using the sample with 2H2O show a complete disappearance of the cross-peaks H1, H2, and H3. Simultaneously, the peak lying on the diagonal at the proton Zeeman frequency is almost completely suppressed in the spectrum measured at τ = 200 ns (not shown). However, the diagonal peak, with a shoulder extending up to (15.3, 14.3) MHz, corresponding to the proton splitting of ∼1 MHz, still appears in the spectrum measured at τ = 136 ns (Fig. 3C). In addition to the weak proton lines, a very intense line lying on the diagonal at the point corresponding to the deuterium Zeeman frequency at 2.3 MHz appears in the HYSCORE spectra of the 2H2O sample (not shown). The ratio of 1H and 2H magnetic moments is 6.51. The proton splitting leading to differences between the coordinates of each cross-peak point would be decreased by 6.51 in the deuterium spectra; the largest splitting in the proton spectra (which reaches up to ∼6 MHz) would correspond to a maximal splitting of <1 MHz in the deuterium spectrum. As a consequence, the deuterium spectrum shows only an intense broad peak around the deuterium Zeeman frequency, which is not resolved into separate spectral contributions from different types of exchangeable nuclei. The results indicate that the exchangeable protons interacting with the unpaired electron spin of the SQ produce three different resolved cross-peaks, H1, H2, and H3 in HYSCORE spectra. More specific conclusions about the nature of these protons could be formulated after evaluation of their hyperfine couplings from their contour line shapes. Analysis of HYSCORE Spectra—The contour line shape in the powder two-dimensional spectrum from the 1H nuclei (nuclear spin I = ½) for axial hyperfine interactions is described by Equations 1, 2, 3 (17Dikanov S.A.

For each cross-peak contour, the frequency values along the ridge can be plotted as ν 2αversus ν 2β, transforming the contour line shape into a straight line segment whose slope and intercept are proportional to Qα and Gα, respectively. These values can then be used to obtain two possible solutions of isotropic (a) and anisotropic (T) couplings with the same value of |2a + T| and interchanged A⊥ = |a – T| and A∥ = |a + 2T|. The coordinates (να, νβ) of arbitrary points along the ridge formed by the uppermost contour for each proton cross-peak were measured from HYSCORE spectra recorded with different τ values at a constant magnetic field value and plotted as sets of values for ν 2αversus ν 2β as shown in Fig. 4. The larger frequency of each point was arbitrarily selected as να, and the smaller was selected as νβ. The points have been fitted by linear regression to give the slopes and intercepts shown in Table I.Table IParameters derived from contour line shape analysis of HYSCORE spectraProtonQαGα|T|(a, T)aThe analysis described in the text provides only relative signs of a and T values.

Open table in a new tab In addition to the experimental points, the curve |να + νβ| = 2νI (using νI = 14.715 MHz corresponding to proton Zeeman frequency) is also plotted in Fig. 4. The points at which the curve crosses each extrapolated straight line correspond to the nuclear frequencies να and νβ at canonical orientations. They define the range of possible frequencies in powder spectra for each nucleus at this particular value of νI. These canonical frequencies can also be used to determine the hyperfine parameters. For an axial hyperfine tensor, there are two possible assignments of the parallel or perpendicular orientations, and consequently, two sets of hyperfine tensors, one for each assignment. This approach gives hyperfine couplings identical to those determined from the slope and intercept. The placement of this theoretical curve on the figures provides additional evidence for the correct assignment of these peaks to protons. The measured points fit to the linear regression with a high degree of accuracy and are found in the proper region relative to this curve, as the extrapolated regression line crosses the curve at two points. These intercepts would not be observed if the signals originated from other elements. Additionally, the crossing of the regression lines with the curve |να + νβ| = 2νI also provides evidence that peaks H1–H3 belong to different nuclei. It has been shown that for strongly non-axial hyperfine tensors, up to three separate ridges (even observed in both quadrants) may appear in the HYS"

In order to monitor in detail the numerous movements of the GroEL apical domain, we have constructed a mutant chaperonin (GroEL R231W) with wild type-like function and a fluorescent probe introduced into the apical domain. By monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence changes of GroEL R231W upon ATP addition in the presence and absence of the co-chaperonin GroES, we detected a total of four distinct kinetic phases that corresponded to conformational changes of the apical domain and GroES binding. By introducing this mutation into a single ring variant of GroEL (GroEL SR-1), we determined the extent of inter-ring cooperation that was involved in apical domain movements. Surprisingly, we found that the apical domain movements of GroEL were affected only slightly by the change in quaternary structure.

Our experiments provide a number of novel insights regarding the dynamic movements of this protein. Research regarding the specific mechanism by which the Escherichia coli GroE chaperonins bind and assist the folding of various proteins has resulted in the collection of a vast amount of knowledge regarding the specific effects of these proteins on protein folding, the specific factors necessary to achieve these effects, and a partial understanding of the specific processes by which these proteins act (1Sigler P.B.

The general consensus regarding the effects of the chaperonins on protein folding is that these proteins act to minimize nonspecific aggregation of protein folding intermediates by encapsulation of the protein molecule in a dome-like chamber formed by the chaperonins themselves. Our present understanding of the cyclic mechanism of the GroE system is represented by the elegant study performed by Rye et al. (5Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), which involves the encapsulation of refolding protein in a central cavity formed by the two chaperonin subunits, GroEL and GroES (the cis complex), and a subsequent ejection of the refolding protein into the bulk medium which is initiated by the binding of ATP to the ring situated in trans to the refolding protein. This mechanism presented by Rye et al. provides a very comprehensive view of the process by which GroEL binds, segregates, and releases refolding protein molecules to minimize nonproductive aggregation and promote efficient protein refolding. The GroEL subunit is composed of three structural domains (equatorial, intermediate, and apical), each possessing a distinct role in the overall mechanism. The apical domain, located at the entrance to the central cavity, is responsible for the recognition, binding, and possibly the release of refolding protein molecules and the co-chaperonin GroES to the GroEL tetradecamer. The x-ray crystal structure of GroEL14-ADP7-GroES7 (6Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) shows that this domain undergoes radical movements that are controlled by the binding of the nucleotide ATP to the equatorial domain and subsequent hydrolysis to ADP and Pi. This radical movement of the GroEL apical domain allows a modulation of the binding affinity of GroEL toward various protein molecules, by alternatively presenting and hiding various structural motifs located at the domain surface. The x-ray crystal structures reported to date presumably reveal only two specific conformations that are accessible to the GroEL subunit, and the actual number of conformations utilized, as well as the specific sequence of events which describe the cyclic mechanism, are the subjects of immediate and extensive study (7Weissman J.S.

Saibil H.R. Cell. 2001; 107: 869-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) has recently elucidated a number of structural characteristics regarding the functional intermediate states of GroEL that suggest that GroEL may undergo a more intricate series of events than a simple closed-open transition in its functional mechanism. Using cryo-electron microscopy, they have shown that in the ATP-bound state of GroEL D398A, the apical domain of GroEL initially rotates ∼25° in a counterclockwise rotation, whereas the final open conformation seen in the x-ray crystal structure places the apical domain at a position that is rotated clockwise 90° relative to the initial closed conformation. This result, together with numerous other facts revealed in this study, hint at the extreme complexity that underlies the chaperonin mechanism. Various biophysical studies regarding the kinetic aspects of GroEL subunit movements have also been performed. Yifrach and Horovitz (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7083-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the various movements of GroEL using a mutant form of GroEL (F44W). In their studies they found an interesting kinetic phase whose rate displayed a bisigmoidal dependence on the concentration of the nucleotide ATP. Also, in a recent study, Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have performed experiments regarding the molecular movements of GroEL that expand on the results of Yifrach and Horovitz. They demonstrated, using a mutant GroEL subunit with a tryptophan residue located in the equatorial domain, that the GroEL subunit undertook no less than four distinct conformational changes upon ATP binding. These conformational changes were respectively attributed to various important stages of the chaperonin functional mechanism, based on their kinetic characteristics and behavior under various experimental conditions. As part of our studies on the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of GroEL-facilitated protein folding, we were very interested in describing in detail the specific movements of the GroEL apical domain that are initiated as a result of ATP binding. However, the wild-type GroEL subunit does not possess a suitable structural probe, which may be utilized in such studies. To address this, we attempted to construct a mutant GroEL molecule with functional characteristics that were virtually identical to wild-type GroEL, but with a fluorescent tryptophan residue introduced into the apical domain. Our experiments have resulted in the construction and characterization of GroEL R231W. GroEL R231W possesses a single tryptophan residue in the apical domain of GroEL (Fig. 1a), situated in between the two α-helices (helix H and helix I), which are implicated in interactions between GroEL and refolding protein, as well as GroEL and the co-chaperonin GroES. In addition, Arg231 may be seen in the x-ray crystal structure of GroEL to move from a relatively hydrophilic position at the top of the GroEL ring to a relatively hydrophobic position at the interface of two adjacent GroEL subunits (Fig. 1b). A fluorescent probe introduced into this site should report on a number of important events during the cyclic mechanism of GroEL, including binding of GroES, as well as various intricate movements of the apical domain. In this report we summarize our results regarding stopped-flow fluorescence experiments on GroEL R231W, with special emphasis on the sequence of events immediately following the binding of ATP to the equatorial domain of GroEL. We initially observed three major kinetic phases from tryptophan fluorescence, with apparent rate constants that shared a number of common characteristics with the conformational changes observed by Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An additional phase that was observed only in the presence of GroES and whose apparent rate was dependent on the GroEL:GroES ratio was also detected, and from this we deduced that GroES binding to the apical domain was being observed. In order to determine the relationship of these numerous conformational changes to the unique tetradecameric structure of GroEL, we next introduced this mutation into the single ring mutant GroEL SR-1 1The abbreviation used is: SR-1, single ring mutant. 1The abbreviation used is: SR-1, single ring mutant. and analyzed the changes in kinetic profiles, which were brought about by the splitting of the tetradecameric double ring structure. We report here a number of previously unsuspected anomalies regarding the kinetic domain movements of GroEL SR-1/R231W, which may prompt a reassessment of the dynamic characteristics of this intriguing protein. Materials—Wild-type GroEL protein was purified from E. coli cells harboring plasmid pUCESL, as described elsewhere (14Mizobata T. Kawata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GroEL mutants R231W and SR-1/R231W were constructed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using either pUCESL (wild-type GroEL) or pEL-SR1 (15Inobe T. Makio T. Takasu-Ishikawa E. Terada T.P. Kuwajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1545: 160-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (GroEL SR-1) as the template. The constructed plasmids were used to transform E. coli JM109. pEL-SR1, the template used in the construction of GroEL SR-1/R231W, was a generous gift from Professor Kunihiro Kuwajima, Tokyo University. Purification of GroEL R231W and SR-1/R231W was accomplished according to previously published protocols (14Mizobata T. Kawata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the case of GroEL SR-1/R231W, an additional purification step consisting of a 30-min incubation with 1 mm ATP followed by fractionation on a Q-Sepharose column as described by Inobe et al. (15Inobe T. Makio T. Takasu-Ishikawa E. Terada T.P. Kuwajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1545: 160-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was required to attain the necessary purity. Details regarding the purification of GroEL R231W are given under “Results.” Bovine rhodanese and nucleotides were obtained from Sigma. Pig heart malate dehydrogenase was obtained from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were obtained commercially from Wako Fine Chemicals (Osaka) and Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto). Refolding Assays—Refolding assays of rhodanese were performed according to the “permissive” (16Mendoza J.A. Demeler B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and “non-permissive” (17Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) conditions published previously. Refolding of pig heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase was performed according to Hayer-Hartl (18Hayer-Hartl M. Schneider C. Chaperonin Protocols Methods in Molecular Biology. 140. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 127-132Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Spectroscopy—Stopped-flow spectroscopy of various GroEL proteins was performed on an Applied Biophysics SX-17MV stopped-flow fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation wave-length was 295 nm, and a filter was used to quantitate all emission fluorescence above 320 nm. Experiments were performed in 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl. Protein samples were dialyzed overnight against this buffer containing 0.5 g/liter of powdered acid-washed charcoal to remove any fluorescent contaminants. The final concentration of GroEL during measurements was set at 0.5 mg/ml (corresponding to an oligomeric molar concentration of 0.62 μm for GroEL R231W and 1.2 μm for GroEL SR-1/R231W). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. Ten fluorescence traces per sample point were averaged to obtain data suitable for kinetic analyses. For the analysis of individual kinetic phases, regions of each trace where the phase of interest was the major component were selected and then analyzed using the software provided with the stopped-flow system according to a single- or sequential double exponential equation using non-linear least squares fitting. All of the experimental traces described below were obtained at an identical photomultiplier voltage (700 volts) to allow comparisons of the relative amplitudes of each kinetic phase. Initial Characterization of GroEL R231W—GroEL R231W was constructed using conventional mutagenic procedures and overexpressed in E. coli. In preliminary experiments, we confirmed that this mutant was capable of replacing wild-type GroEL in E. coli strain KY1156 cells (19Miyazaki T. Yoshimi T. Furutsu Y. Hongo K. Mizobata T. Kanemori M. Kawata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50621-50628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and was therefore active in vivo. Expression of this mutant protein was very high, and purification from crude extracts was relatively straightforward (14Mizobata T. Kawata Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with a single exception. In Q-Sepharose anion exchange column purifications, a fraction of GroEL R231W was seen to elute in inactive form at ionic concentrations lower than the active mutant protein. Although various attempts were made to reconstitute this soluble, inactive form of GroEL R231W, our attempts have so far been unsatisfactory. Care was taken, therefore, to purify only the fractions with ATPase activity, which were eluted at NaCl concentrations of 0.4∼0.5 m from a Q-Sepharose gel. Initial characterization of the GroEL R231W mutant indicated that its behavior toward rhodanese (16Mendoza J.A. Demeler B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (20Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was indistinguishable from the wild-type protein (data not shown). However, we observed in refolding assays using other, larger proteins that GroEL R231W showed a decreased tendency to bind to larger polypeptides (not shown). This is in agreement with a very recent study (21Wang J. Chen L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which implicated this residue in the binding of substrate proteins and GroES. An ATPase activity that was slightly higher than the wild-type chaperonin was also detected. In the present study, we regarded the effects of these deviations from wild-type-like behavior on the overall mechanism to be negligible. When GroEL R231W was mixed with various concentrations of ATP and immediately monitored using stopped-flow fluorescence, we observed an intricate series of fluorescence intensity changes, suggesting various movements of the apical domain (Fig. 2). The changes in fluorescence intensity involved an initial sharp increase (Phase A, apparent rate constant kapp > 300 s-1 at 300 μm ATP, 25 °C, Fig. 2a), followed by a large decrease in fluorescence (Phase B, kapp = 68 s-1 at 300 μm ATP, 25 °C, Fig. 2a), which was in turn followed by a slow increase in fluorescence (Phase C, kapp = 4.3 s-1 at 1 mm ATP, 25 °C, Fig. 2b). The rate constants of Phase A and Phase B at these two ATP concentrations were clearly different; the fastest phase A was lost in the dead time of the instrument at 1 mm ATP. The residuals derived from a typical analysis of Phases B and C are shown in the lower panels of Fig. 2, a and b. In each case, the residuals consisted of small, random deviations, which suggested that the fitting procedure had been completed properly. A more detailed examination of the apparent rate constants of each phase with respect to the ATP concentration revealed a number of common characteristics with the kinetic phases observed by Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in their studies. With regard to Phase A, the apparent rate constants observed under our experimental conditions was too rapid to allow a detailed analysis of its characteristics. However, the value of the apparent rate constant of Phase A in the presence of 300 μm suggested that this kinetic phase was similar to phase a of GroEL Y485W. This extremely rapid kinetic phase most likely reflects movements of the apical domain, which immediately follow ATP binding. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of the apparent rate constants and relative amplitudes of Phase B with respect to the ATP concentration. As shown in Fig. 3a, the dependence of the rate constants of Phase B on the ATP concentration were characterized by an initial increase in apparent rate that leveled off transiently at ATP concentrations from 200 to 300 μm. The rate constants were again increased at ATP concentrations higher than 300 μm, to saturate at ATP concentrations greater than 1000 μm. The overall saturation profile was bisigmoidal, a distinct characteristic of a kinetic phase that was previously observed by Yifrach and Horovitz (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7083-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in their experiments using GroEL F44W, and also by Cliff et al. for phase b in GroEL Y485W (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In order to compare the present values with the values for GroEL Y485W, we analyzed the curves in accordance with the phenomenological model utilized by these research groups, more specifically according to Reaction Scheme 1 put forth by Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), EL+(n+m)ATP⇄K1ELATPn+mATP⇄K2ELATP(n+m)ELflATPn+k1↓↑k-1mATP⇄ELflk2↓↑k-2ATP(n+m)(Eq. 1) where GroEL binds to n molecules of ATP with an equilibrium constant of K1, followed by m molecules of ATP binding with an equilibrium constant of K2. These two forms of GroEL each undergo conformational transitions with a forward rate constant of k1 and k2, respectively to a common state, ELfl, with decreased fluorescence intensity. k-1 is the backward rate constant for the GroEL molecule with n ATP molecules bound, and k-2 is the backward rate constant for the GroEL molecule with (n + m) molecules of ATP bound. Using the above mechanism, the apparent rate constant kobs may be described by Equation 1. kobs=k1([ATP]/K1)n+k2([ATP]/K1)n([ATP]/K2)m1+([ATP]/K1)n+([ATP]/K1)n([ATP]/K2)m+k−1(Eq. 2) We have adopted the results of the simulation performed by Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and omitted k-2 from Equation 1. Analysis of the kapp shown in Fig. 3a using Equation 1 resulted in the following constants: K1 = 154 ± 42 μm, k1 = 83.8 ± 20 s-1, n = 1.6 ± 0.4 for the first sigmoidal transition, and K2 = 660 ± 21 μm, k2 = 195 ± 3 s-1, m = 3.9 ± 0.3 for the second sigmoidal transition. A very poorly defined value of 0.3 ± 2.7 s-1 was obtained for k-1, the backwards rate attributed to the first sigmoidal transition. The values of K1, K2, and k2 were very similar to the values obtained by Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and analogous values in Yifrach and Horovitz (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7083-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The estimates of the two Hill constants provided slightly lower values, and the relatively poorly defined k1 was slightly higher than the values reported in Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but very similar to that reported by Yifrach and Horovitz (12Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7083-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Contrary to the behavior of the apparent rates with regard to the ATP concentration, the dependence of the amplitude of Phase B on the ATP concentration was characterized by a single weakly sigmoidal curve, and no additional increases in amplitude were observed at ATP concentrations greater than 300 μm ATP (Fig. 3b). Analysis of the data according to a simple Hill equation revealed a weak cooperativity (n = 2.0 ± 0.2), which was similar to the value of n obtained using Equation 1 in Fig. 3. From the amplitude data in Fig. 3b it is possible that the structural state attained after the completion of Phase B may be the same in both moderate (∼250 μm) and high (∼1mm) concentrations of ATP. Alternatively, the states may be different, but indistinguishable by changes in fluorescence of Trp231. Interestingly, this characteristic was also a feature, which was observed for phase b in GroEL Y485W (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), reinforcing the notion that the two phenomena reflect a common molecular event. Since we are unable to distinguish between the states attained after Phase B at different ATP concentrations by fluorescent probes located at two diverse locations within the GroEL subunit, these states may indeed be structurally equivalent. With regard to Phase C, the maximum apparent rate was similar to that of phase c as reported by Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). In the present study, the fact that Phase C was detected as a fluorescent increase allowed us to analyze the characteristics of this phase in more detail. The rate of this phase varied with the ATP concentration and saturated at 4.5 s-1 with a K½ of 105 ± 47 μm. Interestingly, the amplitude of this phase saturated at a much lower concentration of ATP (∼50 μm). It seems that in the presence of ATP at concentrations from 50 to ∼300 μm, the rate of the apical domain movements attributed to Phase C was dependent on the ATP concentration while the amplitude remained constant. A prominent difference between the results of the present study and that of Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) involved the characteristics of a kinetic phase corresponding to phase d in GroEL Y485W. We found that in GroEL R231W, a slow decrease in fluorescence intensity may indeed be observed after the completion of Phase C, with an apparent rate constant of 0.39 s-1 at 1 mm ATP, 25 °C (data not shown). However, the appearance of this kinetic phase was rather erratic. At present, we would like to refrain from characterizing this kinetic phase in more detail until we are more confident of the specific conditions under which this phase is detected. The number of similarities between the numerous kinetic phases determined in the present study and the results of Cliff et al. (13Cliff M.J. Kad N.M. Hay N. Lund P.A. Webb M.R. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 667-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), in particular with regard to Phase B, suggested attractively that we were observing functionally significant movements of the GroEL apical domain, and that a number of these movements were part of a global alteration of the GroEL subunit. Phase B Is Unaffected by the Binding of GroES—When GroEL R231W was mixed simultaneously with 1 mm ATP and an equimolar concentration of GroES, an additional kinetic phase was observed (Fig. 5, dotted traces). Analyses of the kinetic curves indicated that the new phase consisted of a fluorescence increase with an apparent rate constant of 29 s-1. A rough estimate of the rate of association of GroEL and GroES under the experimental conditions used yielded a bimolecular rate constant of 4.6 × 107m-1 s-1, which was in good agreement with the binding constants obtained in other studies (5Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The apparent rate of this newly detected phase was dependent on the molar ratio of GroEL and GroES (Fig. 5b). Therefore, we concluded that GroEL R231W was capable of reflecting the binding of GroES to the GroEL ring, in addition to the numerous movements of the apical domain. Since we were able to observe GroES binding and apical domain movements simultaneously using Trp231, and also, since we observed that the apparent rates of the GroES binding phase and Phase B were very similar to each other, we were curious to determine whether there were any dependences between these two phenomena. Specifically, we probed the relationship between GroES binding and Phase B by lowering the concentration of ATP so that the apparent rate of Phase B would be retarded, and monitoring the effects of this retardation on the phase reflecting GroES binding. Fig. 6 shows the kinetic traces obtained at ATP concentrations ranging from 300 to 1000 μm ATP.Fig. 6A comparison of the changes in fluorescence of GroEL R231W in the presence and absence of GroES at varying ATP concentrations. A comparison similar to that shown in Fig. 5 was performed in the presence of the following ATP concentrations: 300 μm (a), 400 μm (b), 1 mm (c). The experimental temperature was 25 °C. Solid lines indicate fluorescence changes in the absence of GroES, dotted lines indicate fluorescence changes in the presence of an equimolar oligomeric concentration (0.6 μm GroES7) of GroES.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 6, we found that the kinetic phase reflecting GroES binding remained relatively unaffected by the changes in apparent rate of Phase B. In order to confirm this, we subtracted from the data shown in dotted traces (taken in the presence of GroES) in each panel of Fig. 6 the corresponding traces shown in solid traces (taken in the absence of co-chaperonin), to isolate the GroES binding phase. All three of the derivative traces closely overlapped (data not shown), suggesting that the binding of GroES proceeded with little regard to the completion of the apical domain movements corresponding to Phase B. Apical Domain Movements in a Single Ring GroEL Mutant—In order to obtain more data to clarify the relationship between apical domain movements and GroES binding, as well as to determine the relationship between the three conformational movements and the quaternary structure of GroEL, we const"
https://openalex.org/W2044320388,"Post-translational modifications of the extracellular portions of receptors located in the cell membrane can contribute to modulating their biological activity. Using a mutagenesis approach in which single or multiple Tyr-to-Phe, Thr-to-Ala, Ser-to-Ala, and Asn-to-Gln substitutions were made at the appropriate positions, we analyzed the sulfation and glycosylation state of the murine CCR8 chemokine receptor, and the way in which these post-translational modifications affect CCR8 activity. A Y14Y15-to-F14F15 CCR8 mutant was less sulfated than the wild-type receptor. An N8-to-Q8 mutant was less glycosylated than wild-type, and a double T10T12-to-A10A12 mutant showed even less glycosylation. We established a flow cytometric analysis with an Fc-fused form of mouse CCL1 to determine precisely the ligand-binding activity of these mutants. Single mutants at amino acid positions 8, 10 or 12 bound CCL1-Fc similarly to wild-type CCR8, whereas the F14F15 double mutant was essentially inactive and the A10A12 double mutant showed about 65% of wild-type ligand-binding activity. Calcium flux activity assays were performed with these mutants, yielding results consistent with those from the ligand binding assays. These data indicate that sulfation at specific positions of the N-terminal domain of mouse CCR8 is critical for its biological activity, whereas glycosylation has a minor influence."

Bacillus licheniformis 749/I and Staphyloccocus aureus PC1 secrete BlaP and BlaZ β-lactamases, respectively, the synthesis of which is induced by the presence of an exogenous β-lactam antibiotic, the inducer (1Joris B. Hardt K. Ghuysen J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. 27. Elsevier Science publishers B. V., Amsterdam1994: 505-515Google Scholar, 2Philippon A. Dusart J. Joris B. Frère J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 341-346Google Scholar). In both strains, at least three regulatory genes, blaI, blaR1, and blaR2, are involved in the derepression of the blaP or blaZ genes. The blaI gene encodes a cytoplasmic repressor that, in the absence of antibiotic, maintains a low level of β-lactamase expression (3Salerno A.J. Lampen J.O. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 61-65Google Scholar, 4Clarke S.R. Dyke K.G. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 803-810Google Scholar). The blaR1 gene encodes a penicillin sensory transducer (5Kobayashi T. Zhu Y.F. Nicholls N.J. Lampen J.O. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3873-3878Google Scholar, 6Hackbarth C.J. Chambers H.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1144-1149Google Scholar). The additional regulatory gene, blaR2, is not yet identified, but it is believed to play an essential role in the signal transfer process (7Filée P. Benlafya K. Delmarcelle M. Moutzourelis G. Frère J.M. Brans A. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 685-694Google Scholar, 8Sherratt D.J. Collins J.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1973; 76: 217-230Google Scholar). Some S. aureus strains have become resistant to β-lactam antibiotics by recruiting an alternative penicillin-binding protein 2′ (PBP2′ or MecA protein), 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; NTD, amino-terminal domain; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; TM, transmembrane; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; 6-APA, 6-aminopenicillanic acid; FT, Fourier transform. which is much less sensitive than the endogenous PBP targets (4Clarke S.R. Dyke K.G. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 803-810Google Scholar). This low-affinity PBP2′ is under the control of the MecI and MecR1 proteins, which exhibit a high degree of primary structure similarity with the corresponding S. aureus and B. licheniformis BlaI and BlaR1 β-lactamase regulators. Recently, the tridimensional structures of the S. aureus MecI and the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of the B. licheniformis BlaI repressors have been solved; as expected, they share the same fold (9VanMelckebeke H. Vreuls C. Gans P. Filée P. Llabres G. Joris B. Simorre J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 711-720Google Scholar, 10Garcia-Castellanos R. Marrero A. Mallorqui-Fernandez G. Potempa J. Coll M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39897-39905Google Scholar). It has been also shown that S. aureus MecI and BlaI can be exchanged in vivo (11McKinney T.K. Sharma V.K. Craig W.A. Archer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6862-6868Google Scholar) and that B. licheniformis BlaI can recognize the S. aureus BlaI DNA operator in a band-shift assay (9VanMelckebeke H. Vreuls C. Gans P. Filée P. Llabres G. Joris B. Simorre J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 711-720Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is believed that the three induction mechanisms are very similar in the two strains. During the induction of the BlaP/BlaZ β-lactamase or the PBP2′ by β-lactam antibiotics, because these antibiotics do not cross the cytoplasmic membrane, the presence of the antibiotic outside the cell must generate an extracellular event that is transmitted inside the cell to allow the expression of the resistance gene. In the cases of B. licheniformis and S. aureus, the membrane-bound BlaR1/MecR1 protein plays this role. The membrane topology of B. licheniformis BlaR1 (601 amino acid residues) has been determined. It is organized as a two-domain protein, including an N-terminal domain (BlaR-NTD, from residues 1 to 350) anchored into the membrane and an extracellular C-terminal domain (BlaR-CTD, from residues 351 to 601) (12Hardt K. Joris B. Lepage S. Brasseur R. Lampen J.O. Frère J.M. Fink A.L. Ghuysen J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 935-944Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This module belongs to the serine penicillin-recognizing protein family and can be overproduced in Escherichia coli as a water-soluble moiety that is efficiently acylated by penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics (Fig. 1B) (13Duval V. Swinnen M. Lepage S. Brans A. Granier B. Franssen C. Frère J.M. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1553-1564Google Scholar, 14Joris B. Ledent P. Kobayashi T. Lampen J.O. Ghuysen J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 58: 107-113Google Scholar). The second-order acylation rate constants k2/K′ ranged from 0.0017 to more than 1 μm-1 s-1, and the deacylation rate constants (k3) were lower than 4 × 10-5 s-1. These values imply a rapid to very rapid formation of stable acylated adduct. The same result has been obtained for the S. aureus BlaR1 protein (15Gregory P.D. Lewis R.A. Curnock S.P. Dyke K.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1025-1037Google Scholar, 16Golemi-Kotra D. Cha J.Y. Meroueh S.O. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18419-18425Google Scholar). BlaR-NTD is embedded in the plasma membrane via four transmembrane segments (TM1, TM2, TM3, TM4). This topology defines three loops named L1, L2, and L3 connecting these hydrophobic segments. L1 and L3 are exposed in the cytoplasm, whereas L2 is outside the cell. The cytoplasmic L3 loop contains an HEXXH motif that is the signature of the thermolysin family of the Zinc metalloproteases (12Hardt K. Joris B. Lepage S. Brasseur R. Lampen J.O. Frère J.M. Fink A.L. Ghuysen J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 935-944Google Scholar, 17Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F. Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Google Scholar). This motif is directly involved in the cytoplasmic signal transmitted by BlaR1. According to the proposed mechanism of signal transduction by BlaR1, acylation of the BlaR-CTD domain by β-lactam inducers generates a proteolytic activation of the intracellular metalloprotease. Two mechanisms for the inactivation of the BlaI repressor have been described. Zhang et al. (17Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F. Science. 2001; 291: 1962-1965Google Scholar) proposed a direct proteolysis of BlaI by the acylated BlaR1 receptor in S. aureus, whereas Filée et al. (7Filée P. Benlafya K. Delmarcelle M. Moutzourelis G. Frère J.M. Brans A. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 685-694Google Scholar) concluded that the generation of a coactivator by the activated BlaR1 receptor in B. licheniformis combined with a cellular penicillin stress were necessary for BlaI inactivation. Binding of the antibiotics to the S. aureus BlaR-CTD generates a significant conformational change, and this process was proposed to play a role in the signal transduction process (16Golemi-Kotra D. Cha J.Y. Meroueh S.O. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18419-18425Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, BlaR-CTD is responsible for the sensing of the β-lactam antibiotic outside the cell and BlaR-NTD for the first signaling step in the cytoplasm. The transmission of the presence of the antibiotic detected by BlaR-CTD to BlaR-NTD requires a close interaction between these two domains. In BlaR-NTD, the 63-residue L2 extracellular loop connecting TM2 and TM3 is the best candidate to interact with BlaR-CTD (Fig. 1A). In this study, we investigated the interaction between L2 loop and BlaR-CTD by phage display. The conformational change of BlaR-CTD concomitant to its acylation by β-lactam antibiotics is probed by fluorescence spectroscopy, CD, and FTIR spectroscopy. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—E. coli DH5α and TG1 F′ strains (BD Biosciences Clontech) were used as hosts for cloning and phage amplification, respectively. Luria-Bertani broth and agar plates were used for growth of E. coli strains. When required, appropriate antibiotics were added to the media (100 μg/ml ampicillin or 7 μg/ml tetracycline). Production of BlaR-CTD—BlaR-CTD was cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (13Duval V. Swinnen M. Lepage S. Brans A. Granier B. Franssen C. Frère J.M. Joris B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1553-1564Google Scholar). Construction of the Phage fd-tet-DOG-L2—The DNA sequence encoding the L2 loop (Pro53 to Ser115 residues, l2-loop) of B. licheniformis BlaR1 was amplified by PCR using pRTW8 (14Joris B. Ledent P. Kobayashi T. Lampen J.O. Ghuysen J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 58: 107-113Google Scholar) as template and fd-tet-DOG1-L2up (5′-AGTGCACAGTGTGGTGGTCCTTTTATCCCCTTTCATTTTC-3′) and fd-tet-DOG1-L2rp (5′-TGCGGCCGCACACCCCCCTGAATCTATCATTTTGGAAGACG-3′) as amplimers. The oligonucleotides contained ApaLI or NotI site (underlined in the oligonucleotide sequences) to facilitate the cloning and introduced four and three additional codons, encoding Gln-Cys-Gly-Gly and Gly-Gly-Cys, at the 5′-and the 3′-ends of the l2-loop, respectively. The PCR fragment was ligated into the pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen), generating pCIP351. This plasmid was digested with ApaLI and NotI, and the fragment carrying l2-loop was cloned into the corresponding sites of the replicative form of the fd-tet-DOG1 phage (18Clackson T. Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Nature. 1991; 352: 624-628Google Scholar, 19Soumillion P. Jespers L. Bouchet M. Marchand-Brynaert J. Winter G. Fastrez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 415-422Google Scholar). In the resulting phage, fd-tet-DOG1-L2, the l2-loop was fused with the 5′ end of the fd-tet-DOG1 gene encoding the G3p protein to generate the l2-loop-g3p gene under the control of the PG3p promoter. The fidelity of PCR and the final l2-loop-g3p fusion were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Phage Particles—E. coli TG1 F′ cells harboring fd-tet-DOG1 and fd-tet-DOG1-L2 were grown for 78 h at 23 °C on Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 7 μg/ml tetracycline. Concentrated phage solutions were prepared by polyethylene glycol precipitations as previously reported by Legendre et al. (20Legendre D. Laraki N. Graslund T. Bjornvad M.E. Bouchet M. Nygren P.A. Borchert T.V. Fastrez J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 87-102Google Scholar). The number of phage particles per unit volume was determined from absorbance at 265 nm. One unit of absorbance corresponds to a solution of 7 × 1012 phage particles/ml. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Phage particles (1011 particles/20 μl) diluted in protein-denaturing buffer containing dithiothreitol as reductant (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 100 mm dithiothreitol) were denatured by incubation at 100 °C for 15 min and submitted to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). Incubation of membrane with primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-G3p; Eurogentec) was followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse as secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). The primary and the secondary antibodies were diluted 400- and 3000-fold, respectively, in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20. The immunocomplexes were detected by using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate chemistry (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Phage ELISA—Microtiterplate wells (Kartell) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of BlaR-CTD in 0.2 ml of PBS (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl). After PBS washing (3 times with 300 μl), the wells were blocked with 300 μl of PBS buffer containing 2% (w/v) skim milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. 100 μl of the phage suspension (7 × 1011 phages/ml) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the plates were washed (five times with 300 μl of PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and one time with 300 μl of PBS buffer containing 2% (w/v) skim milk powder) and incubated with anti-G8p major coat protein antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) at a 1:5000 dilution in PBS buffer containing 2% (w/v) skim milk powder. After extensive washing (five times with PBST and 1 time with PBS) bound phages were quantified using 2′2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)sulfonic acid in the presence of H2O2 according to the manufacturer (Pharmacia). Absorbance readings were taken at 405 nm after 30 min. Some assays were also performed in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics. In this case, immediately after BlaR-CTD coating, plates were incubated with penicillin G (36 μg/ml final) or 6-APA (final concentration, 20 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. Finally, some assays were performed in the absence of antibiotic as described above, except that the washing steps after the phage binding incubation were realized with PBS and Tween 20 containing 6-APA (20 μg/ml). Fluorescence Experiments and Acrylamide Quenching Studies—Fluorescence measurements of free or acylated BlaR-CTD, were performed on an LS50 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences), using a cell with a 1-cm light path. Fluorescence emission spectra in the 300-440 nm range were recorded using excitation wavelengths at 280 or 295 nm. The bandwidths for excitation and emission were 4 and 5 nm, respectively. At least 10 scans were averaged, and the appropriate blanks (buffer or buffer + antibiotic) were subtracted to obtain the corrected spectra. Acrylamide quenching experiments were carried out at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Quenching measurements were made on five solutions of free or acylated BlaR-CTD containing increasing amounts of acrylamide (final concentration, 50-250 mm). Fluorescence intensities were measured at 340 nm after each addition of the quencher. The data were analyzed according to the modified Stern-Volmer equation: FO/F = (1 + KSV[Q])eV[Q], where KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant for the dynamic quenching process, V is the static quenching constant, and [Q] is the molar concentration of quencher. FO and F represent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and the presence, respectively, of quencher. The values of KSV and V were obtained by nonlinear regression using the Grafit software (Erithacus Software). Before recording the spectra of the acylated protein, BlaR-CTD (1 μm) was incubated with penicillin G (10 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. CD Experiments—CD spectra were acquired with the help of a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter using 0.2- and 1-cm path-length cells in the far (190-250 nm) and near (250-320 nm) UV, respectively. The CD spectra of free and acylated BlaR-CTD (4 or 80 μM in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) were recorded at 25 °C and with a 2-nm bandwidth. The average from five scans was taken, and spectra were corrected for the blank by subtraction of the solvent spectrum obtained under identical conditions. Before recording the spectra of penicillin-acylated BlaR-CTD, the protein was incubated with penicillin G for 15 min at 37 °C and an antibiotic/protein molar ratio of 10. Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform IR Spectroscopy—Attenuated total reflection-FTIR spectroscopy spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker IFS-55 IR spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-tellurium detector at a resolution of 4 cm-1. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with dry air. The internal reflection element (attenuated total reflection) was a germanium plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm; Harrick EJ2121) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections (21Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Google Scholar). Thin protein films were obtained by slowly evaporating a sample containing 70 μg of BlaR-CTD (in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) on one side of the attenuated total reflection plate under a stream of nitrogen (22Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Google Scholar, 23Fringeli U.P. Gunthard H.H. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 31: 270-332Google Scholar). Before evaporating the acylated BlaR-CTD, the protein was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of ampicillin for 15 min at 37 °C. The determination of the secondary structure was based on the vibrational bands of the protein, particularly the amide I band (1600-1700 cm-1), which is sensitive to the secondary structure. The analysis was performed on the amide I region of BlaR-CTD in the absence and presence of ampicillin. For each spectrum, 512 scans were averaged. Fourier self-deconvolution was applied to increase the resolution of the spectra in the amide I region. The self-deconvolution was carried out using a Lorentzian line shape for the deconvolution and a Gaussian line shape for the apodization. The area of the different components of amide I revealed by self-deconvolution was calculated as described by Goormaghtigh et al. (22Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Google Scholar). Kinetics of Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange—Films containing 70 μg of free or acylated BlaR-CTD were prepared on a germanium plate as described above. Samples were deuterated under a stream of D2O-saturated nitrogen gas inside the sealed sample holder. The kinetics of hydrogen-deuterium exchange of amide protons was followed by monitoring the decreasing area of amide II and the increasing area of amide II′ as described by Goormaghtigh et al. (24Goormaghtigh E. Vigneron L. Scarborough G.A. Ruysschaert J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27409-27413Google Scholar). Twelve spectra were recorded and averaged for each kinetic time point. The areas of amide II and II′ bands were finally normalized between 0 and 100% for each time point. BlaR-CTD Conformational Changes—The putative BlaR-CTD conformational changes after acylation by a β-lactam antibiotic were probed using a combination of spectroscopy techniques, including intrinsic fluorescence, fluorescence quenching by acrylamide, far-UV and near-UV CD, and FTIR spectroscopy. Fluorescence Measurements—The BlaR-CTD polypeptide chain contains five tryptophan, 14 tyrosine, and 18 phenylalanine residues in its polypeptide chain. Excitation wavelengths of 280 and 295 nm yield different emission spectra (Fig. 2A), indicating that the tyrosine residues contribute significantly to the fluorescence spectra. Fig. 2B shows the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of free and acylated BlaR-CTD. In the presence of penicillin G, the fluorescence intensity decreases by about 37% without change in the position of the maximum emission wavelength at 340 nm. Similar results were obtained using ampicillin, another antibiotic inducer (data not shown). These results show that significant changes occur in the environment of least some of the aromatic residues upon β-lactam binding. Quenching of Fluorescence by Acrylamide—Quenching of protein fluorescence by acrylamide offers a very useful method for monitoring protein conformation changes. The sensitivity of the quenching technique allows the detection of very subtle conformational rearrangements that accompany the binding of a ligand to a protein in terms of an increase or decrease in the exposure of tryptophan residues (25Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Google Scholar). This solvent accessibility is quantified by the Stern-Volmer plots presented in Fig. 3. The plots for free and acylated BlaR-CTD display upward curvatures, indicating significant contributions from both dynamic and static quenching. This is expressed by the modified Stern-Volmer equation (26Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Google Scholar): FO/F = (1 + KSV[Q])eV[Q], where KSV is the Stern-Volmer constant for the dynamic quenching process and V is the static quenching constant. The values of KSV and V are obtained by nonlinear regression of the data in Fig. 3. When penicillin G is added to BlaR-CTD, the KSV drops from 4.4 ± 0.75 to 2.4 ± 0.23 m-1. These values indicate that some tryptophan residues of BlaR-CTD are less exposed to acrylamide after antibiotic binding. The V values in the absence or presence of penicillin G are identical within experimental error (1.5 ± 0.39 and 1.6 ± 0.15 m-1, respectively). Furthermore, the nonzero V values in all experimental conditions suggest that acrylamide binds near the aromatic residues and induces static quenching. To confirm that this fluorescence quenching is not caused by three-dimensional rearrangement, CD experiments in the far and near UV were performed. CD Studies—Far-UV spectra (190-250 nm) of free and acylated BlaR-CTD were recorded. After correction by substraction of the solvent spectra with or without penicillin G, both protein spectra are similar (Fig. 4A), indicating the absence of secondary structural change. The percentage of α-helix estimated from far-UV CD is 60% (27Greenfield N. Fasman G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Google Scholar). CD bands in the near-UV region (250-320 nm) originate from the aromatic amino acids. Therefore, the resultant near-UV CD spectrum is extremely sensitive to small changes in secondary and tertiary structures. The near-UV spectra of free and acylated BlaR-CTD are shown in Fig. 4B. In the absence of penicillin G, the spectrum shows a broad negative band with a minimum at 292 nm. Formation of the BlaR-CTD/penicillin G adduct results in a decrease in the ellipticity between 255 and 290 nm that is clearly apparent after subtraction of the contribution of the antibiotic. This indicates that the aromatic residues of the acylated BlaR-CTD are in a more asymmetric environment after antibiotic binding. IR Spectroscopy: Secondary Structure Analysis—IR-attenuated total reflection spectra of free and acylated BlaR-CTD were recorded (data not shown). The amide I band, assigned to γ (C = O) of the peptide bond presents two absorption maxima around 1654 and 1632 cm-1. The amide II band located around 1545 cm-1 is characteristic of the γ (N-H) of the peptide bond. The position of amide I at 1654 cm-1 indicates a relatively high amount of α-helix in the protein, and the low frequency shoulder near 1632 cm-1 indicates the presence of a significant proportion of β-sheet (22Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Google Scholar, 28Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Google Scholar). The shape of the amide I band for free and acylated BlaR-CTD is similar. The secondary structure of BlaR-CTD was analyzed from the shape of amide I after Fourier self-deconvolution and curve fitting as detailed in Goormaghtigh et al. (21Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Google Scholar) and consists of 58% α-helix, 29% β-sheet, and 13% turns. This α-helix value is in agreement with that obtained from CD measurements. Clearly, the secondary structure of BlaR-CTD does not change upon binding of antibiotic. Deuterium/Hydrogen Exchange Kinetics—For a constant secondary structure and under identical experimental conditions, the rate of H/D exchange can be used as an indicator of tertiary structure changes. Kinetics of deuteration of free and acylated BlaR-CTD were monitored. The rate of amide H/D exchange is related to the solvent accessibility of the NH amide groups. Amide hydrogen exchange was followed by monitoring the amide II absorption peak as a function of the time of exposure to D2O-saturated nitrogen. The percentage of exchange was computed between 0 and 100%. The decrease of the amide II region is proportional to the number of hydrogens that have been exchanged by deuterium and provides a probe of conformational changes. H/D exchange is shown in Fig. 5 as a function of deuteration time. The percentage of deuterium-hydrogen exchange is not significantly affected by antibiotic binding. H/D exchange is extremely rapid in the two tested situations; a large decrease of the amide II band intensity is observed during the first 3 min of exposure to D2O, indicating a rapid replacement of a large number of amide hydrogens by deuterium. H/D exchange is much slower over the subsequent 60 min. Finally, more than 50% of the hydrogens do not exchange, according to the compact globular 3D structure of BlaR-CTD (29Kerff F. Charlier P. Colombo M.L. Sauvage E. Brans A. Frère J.M. Joris B. Fonze E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12835-12843Google Scholar). Display of the L2 Loop—Phage display of the B. licheniformis BlaR1 receptor L2 loop was performed by fusion to the minor coat protein (G3p) to determine whether the L2 loop interacts with the BlaR-CTD. The L2 loop displayed at the N terminus of G3p and exhibiting two additional cysteines at its extremities can potentially form a disulfide loop (30McLafferty M.A. Kent R.B. Ladner R.C. Markland W. Gene. 1993; 128: 29-36Google Scholar, 31Hoess R.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 572-579Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The disulfide bond constrains the two extremities of the L2 loop in neighboring position as expected from the four-α-helix bundle model of BlaR-NTD (12Hardt K. Joris B. Lepage S. Brasseur R. Lampen J.O. Frère J.M. Fink A.L. Ghuysen J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 935-944Google Scholar). The sequence encoding the L2 loop in fd-tet-DOG1-L2 phage were sequenced and shown to encode L2 loop fused in frame with G3p. The proteins of the coat of the phage fd-tet-DOG1 and fd-tet-DOG1-L2 were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against G3p (Fig. 7). A band of 70 kDa was seen for the fd-tet-DOG1 phage (an abnormal position was already observed by McCafferty et al. (32McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Chiswell D.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 552-554Google Scholar)) and a band at 77 kDa for the fd-tet-DOG1-L2. This showed that the L2 loop was fused to G3p on the phage coat and indicated that no significant proteolytic cleavage of the L2 loop occurred during the virus morphogenesis. Expression of L2 loop on the phage surface results in a reduction in phage infectivity from 3.0 to 1.6%. This makes titration of infectious particles inappropriate for comparing the quantities of fd-tet-DOG1 and fd-tet-DOG1-L2 (33McCafferty J. Jackson R.H. Chiswell D.J. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 955-961Google Scholar). For this reason, the amount of phage particles was expressed with respect to the total number of phage particles, rather than to the number of infectious phage and was determined by measuring absorbance at 265 nm. Retention of the Phage—To analyze the interaction between L2 loop and BlaR-CTD, a phage ELISA was designed. This ELISA yields an absorbance value proportional to the amount of bound phages. Phages displaying the L2 loop were significantly retained on the ELISA plates coated with BlaR-CTD (Fig. 8A). Indeed fd-tet-DOG1-L2 phages are 15-fold more adsorbed than fd-tet-DOG1 control phages. When BlaR-CTD is acylated by penicillin G, the retention of fd-tet-DOG1-L2 phages becomes similar to that observed with the control phages, but adsorption of the control phages is increased. The experiment was repeated using 6-APA as an acylation agent (Fig. 8B) with similar results. Adsorption of the fd-tet-DOG1-L2 phages was significantly higher than that of the control phages (Fig. 8B1) and after acylation of BlaR-CTD, the difference became not significant but the background level was increased (Fig. 8B2). With the free BlaR-CTD, addition of 6-APA in the washing buffer resulted in a complete disappearance of the difference between phages displaying L2 loop and control phages (Fig. 8B3). These results demonstrate an interaction between the L2 loop and the BlaR-CTD soluble domain. If BlaR-CTD is penicilloylated this interaction does not occur. Transmembrane receptors are proteins through which cells commonly receive information from the outside and transmit it for processing into the cytoplasm. Typical receptor contains an extracellular ligand binding domain, a cytoplasmic signaling domain, and transmembrane hydrophobic sequences. The mechanism by which external ligand binding generates an intracellular signal is poorly understood. For the aspartate receptor of chemotaxis, it was suggested that conformational changes caused by the ligand binding at the dimer interface induce a relative realignment of the helices at the interface, thus transmitting conformational information from the periplasm to the cytoplasm (34Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Google Scholar). In a first approach, we have explored a putative conformational change in the penicillin-binding domain of the B. licheniformis BlaR1 receptor after binding of a β-lactam antibiotic. Far-UV CD and IR spectra are extremely sensitive to small changes in secondary structures. They were used as probes for small conformational changes in the BlaR-CTD structure after binding β-lactam antibiotics. Clearly, antibiotic binding does not significantly modify the secondary structure of BlaR-CTD. In S. aureus, by contrast, a significant conformational change of BlaR-CTD upon acylation by β-lactam antibiotics was reported in terms of enhancement of secondary structure (α-helicity and β-sheets) (16Golemi-Kotra D. Cha J.Y. Meroueh S.O. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18419-18425Google Scholar). Near-UV CD, fluorescence, and, for a constant secondary structure, FTIR spectroscopies can be used as indicators of tertiary structure changes. Near-UV CD spectra of free and acylated BlaR-CTD show a significant difference in the environment of the aromatic residues. BlaR-CTD contains many aromatic residues, and they all contribute to the spectrum to various extents. It is thus difficult to interpret a small change in the spectrum in structural terms, because any of many chromophores might be responsible for the spectral modifications. Similar conclusions are deduced from fluorescence emission spectra of free and acylated BlaR-CTD. When BlaR-CTD is acylated, fluorescence intensity decreases by 37% without change in the position of the maximum. Studies of fluorescence quenching demonstrate that some tryptophan residues of BlaR-CTD are becoming less exposed to acrylamide upon antibiotic binding. There are two possible explanations for this decrease in tryptophan indole exposure upon antibiotic binding. First, the antibiotic itself might act sterically to shield Trp488 residue from collision with acrylamide. Indeed, the crystal structure of BlaR-CTD shows that the Trp488 residue points into the active site of BlaR-CTD (Fig. 9A; Protein Data Bank code 1NRF) (29Kerff F. Charlier P. Colombo M.L. Sauvage E. Brans A. Frère J.M. Joris B. Fonze E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12835-12843Google Scholar). In the class D β-lactamase OXA-13, the equivalent Trp154 also points into the active site and, clearly, its environment is modified by imipenem binding (Fig. 9B; Protein Data Bank code 1H5X). The other explanation is that antibiotic binding induces a widespread conformation change in BlaR-CTD, resulting in a slight decrease in the exposure of several fluorescent residues. Amide H/D exchange, followed during the time of exposure of the sample to D2O-saturated nitrogen, allows us to determine the accessibility of the amide hydrogens to the solvent and provides a measure of tertiary conformational change. The kinetics of deuteration of free and acylated BlaR-CTD were similar. These data indicate that free and acylated BlaR-CTD have the same general conformation. In addition, the structures of the other PBPs (Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP2a (35Gordon E. Mouz N. Duée E. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 477-485Google Scholar); S. aureus PBP2a (36Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 870-876Google Scholar)) did not reveal important conformation changes after antibiotic binding. According to these observations, then, it is reasonable to conclude that the β-lactam antibiotic does not induce a drastic conformation change in B. licheniformis BlaR-CTD. Consequently, signal transduction by BlaR1 from the outer side of the membrane to the cytoplasmic compartment should require interactions between the penicillin-binding CTD and NTD. To analyze the interaction between the two domains of the B. licheniformis penicillin receptor BlaR1, a phage ELISA was designed. We have shown that phages displaying L2 loop can significantly interact with BlaR-CTD. The low signal suggests a weak interaction between the two domains of BlaR1. Phage ELISAs allow us to investigate both strong and weak interactions. It was reported that a Kd value as low as 0.1 mm can be detectable (37Rossenu S. Dewitte D. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. J. Prot. Chem. 1997; 16: 499-503Google Scholar). When BlaR-CTD is acylated by either penicillin G or 6-APA, phages expressing the L2 loop did not appear to bind to BlaR-CTD because there was no increase in signal intensity compared with control phage. The binding of the phages in the presence of penicillin G seems to lead to some nonspecific binding of the phages to the wells, as suggested by the increased background level. We attempted to minimize this nonspecific interaction by using 6-APA that has no hydrophobic lateral chain in contrast penicillin G. In this case, we also observed nonspecific binding of the control phage. Nonetheless, BlaR-CTD acylated by 6-APA has lost its capacity to interact with the L2 loop because there is no significant retention of phages displaying L2 loop. Moreover, addition of 6-APA in the washing solution leads to displacement of the bound phages by loss of the L2 loop/BlaR-CTD interaction. According to these results, we propose the following hypothesis. In the absence of β-lactam antibiotic (inducer), the BlaR-CTD domain interacts with the L2 loop. This interaction constrains the four transmembrane segment TM1-TM4 to adopt relative positions so that the intracellular L3 loop remains inactive. When a β-lactam antibiotic is present in the outer medium, BlaR-CTD is acylated. This triggers a release of the L2 loop/BlaR-CTD interaction, causing a motion of the transmembrane helices and transduction of the information into the cytoplasm, involving activation of L3 loop metallopeptidase (Fig. 10). In S. aureus, deletion of the BlaR-CTD 35 C-terminal amino acids results on constitutive β-lactamase synthesis (38Lewis R.A. Curnock S.P. Dyke K.G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 271-275Google Scholar). In this truncated BlaR-CTD, the L2 loop/BlaR-CTD interaction is lost as in the native BlaR-CTD after acylation by a β-lactam antibiotic. Meanwhile, when only BlaR-NTD domain is present, there is no β-lactamase induction (29Kerff F. Charlier P. Colombo M.L. Sauvage E. Brans A. Frère J.M. Joris B. Fonze E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12835-12843Google Scholar). Thus, BlaR-CTD naturally imposes constraints onto the transmembrane regions outside the L2 loop/BlaR-CTD interaction that permits the correct folding of the intracellular L3 loop. We thank Dr. E. Sauvage for Fig. 9."
https://openalex.org/W2061353072,"Cardiac muscle contraction is regulated by Ca2+ through the troponin complex consisting of three subunits: troponin C (TnC), troponin T (TnT), and troponin I (TnI). We reported previously that the abnormal splicing of cardiac TnT in turkeys with dilated cardiomyopathy resulted in a greater binding affinity to TnI. In the present study, we characterized a polymorphism of cardiac TnI in the heart of wild turkeys. cDNA cloning and sequencing of the novel turkey cardiac TnI revealed a single amino acid substitution, R111C. Arg111 in avian cardiac TnI corresponds to a Lys in mammals. This residue is conserved in cardiac and skeletal muscle TnIs across the vertebrate phylum, implying a functional importance. In the partial crystal structure of cardiac troponin, this amino acid resides in an α-helix that directly contacts with TnT. Structural modeling indicates that the substitution of Cys for Arg or Lys at this position would not disrupt the global structure of troponin. To evaluate the functional significance of the different size and charge between the Arg and Cys side chains, protein-binding assays using purified turkey cardiac TnI expressed in Escherichia coli were performed. The results show that the R111C substitution lowered binding affinity to TnT, which is potentially compensatory to the increased TnI-binding affinity of the cardiomyopathy-related cardiac TnT splicing variant. Therefore, the fixation of the cardiac TnI Cys111 allele in the wild turkey population and the corresponding functional effect reflect an increased fitness value, suggesting a novel target for the treatment of TnT myopathies. Cardiac muscle contraction is regulated by Ca2+ through the troponin complex consisting of three subunits: troponin C (TnC), troponin T (TnT), and troponin I (TnI).

Contraction of vertebrate striated muscle is powered by actomyosin ATPase and is regulated by intracellular Ca2+ through the thin filament-based troponin-tropomyosin system. The troponin complex consists of three protein subunits: the Ca2+-binding subunit troponin C (TnC) 1The abbreviations used are: TnC, troponin C; TnT, troponin T; TnI, troponin I; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CT3, anti-cardiac and slow TnT mAb; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; WT, wild-type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ΔE8, exclusion of exon 8; pI, isoelectric point; TcTnI-ND, N-terminal truncated turkey cardiac TnI; TcTnT, turkey cardiac TnT; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: TnC, troponin C; TnT, troponin T; TnI, troponin I; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CT3, anti-cardiac and slow TnT mAb; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; WT, wild-type; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ΔE8, exclusion of exon 8; pI, isoelectric point; TcTnI-ND, N-terminal truncated turkey cardiac TnI; TcTnT, turkey cardiac TnT; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid., the tropomyosin-binding subunit troponin T (TnT), and the inhibitory subunit troponin I (TnI). During muscle contraction, cytoplasmic Ca2+ increases, binds to TnC, and evokes a series of conformational changes in the thin filament (1Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 235-305Google Scholar, 2Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Google Scholar, 3Solaro R.J. Rarick H.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 471-480Google Scholar). These thin filament protein interactions translate the cytosolic [Ca2+] signal into an activation of actomyosin ATPase, resulting in the development of force. Among the three troponin subunits, TnC belongs to a family of Ca2+-signaling proteins that includes calmodulin and myosin light chains (4Collins J.H. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1991; 12: 3-25Google Scholar), whereas TnI and TnT are striated muscle-specific proteins encoded by closely linked genes (5Huang Q.-Q. Jin J.-P. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 780-788Google Scholar). The interaction between TnT and TnI is an essential component of the Ca2+-regulated allosteric regulation of muscle contraction (6Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Google Scholar, 7Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Google Scholar, 8Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Google Scholar). The co-evolutionary relationship between TnT and TnI (5Huang Q.-Q. Jin J.-P. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 780-788Google Scholar) indicates their interrelated structure and function.We reported previously that turkeys with inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure express an unusually low Mr cardiac TnT resulting from the splice-out of a normally conserved 11 amino acid N-terminal segment encoded by exon 8 (9Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Google Scholar). The deletion of the exon 8-encoded segment from cardiac TnT alters binding affinities to TnI and tropomyosin and increases the calcium sensitivity of actomyosin ATPase. Expression of the exon 8-deleted cardiac TnT occurs prior to the development of DCM in turkeys, indicating a role in pathogenesis. We also demonstrated similar aberrant splicing of cardiac TnT in mammals that exhibit a high incidence of DCM (10Biesiadecki B.J. Elder B.D. Yu Z.-B. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50275-50285Google Scholar). Exclusion of the same exon as the turkey exon 8 was found in canine cardiac TnT. Transgenic expression of the aberrantly spliced cardiac TnT variant in the mouse heart resulted in altered cardiomyocyte contraction (10Biesiadecki B.J. Elder B.D. Yu Z.-B. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50275-50285Google Scholar). These findings lead to the hypothesis that changes in thin filament Ca2+-sensitivity resulting from the expression of abnormally spliced cardiac TnT variants may affect myocardial function and contribute to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy and heart failure.Alternative splicing of the N-terminal region of TnT modulates the overall molecular conformation. One of the primary consequences of physiological or pathological alterations in TnT structure is the effect on its interaction with TnI (11Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Google Scholar, 12Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Google Scholar, 13Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1162-C1170Google Scholar). The structure-function relationship of TnT and TnI has been studied extensively. Protein binding studies (6Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Google Scholar, 7Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Google Scholar), functional assays using various TnT (6Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Google Scholar) and TnI (7Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Google Scholar) fragments, and the newly published crystallography structure of the partial human cardiac troponin complex (8Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Google Scholar) have identified the TnT-TnI contact sites. Of specific interest is the TnT-TnI double α-helical structure corresponding to amino acid residues E226-K276 of cardiac TnT and F90-R136 in cardiac TnI. Determination of the TnT-TnI interface structure provides valuable guidance in understanding the structure-function relationship of the troponin subunits.In the present study, we characterize a unique polymorphism of cardiac TnI observed in wild turkey hearts. cDNA cloning and sequencing revealed a single amino acid substitution of Cys for Arg111 in the novel turkey cardiac TnI. Arg111 in avian cardiac TnI corresponds to Lys117 in human cardiac TnI and is conserved in cardiac and skeletal muscle TnIs across the vertebrate phylum. This amino acid resides in the TnT-TnI contacting α-helix (8Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Google Scholar). Structural modeling indicates that the substitution of Cys for Arg or Lys at this position would not disrupt the overall structure of TnI. Protein-binding assays using purified turkey cardiac TnI expressed in Escherichia coli were carried out to investigate the potential effect of the size and charge differences between Arg111 and Cys111 side chains on the interaction between TnI and TnT. The results demonstrate that the R111C substitution decreased the binding affinity of TnI for TnT, which is potentially compensatory to the increased TnI-binding affinity of the DCM-related cardiac TnT splicing variant. These results suggest that the fixation of the cardiac TnI Cys111 allele in the wild turkey population reflects a selection value and indicate a novel target for the treatment of TnT myopathies.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTurkey Cardiac Muscle Samples—Domestic turkey samples were obtained from commercial sources and included both Giant White and Broad Breasted Bronze strains. The heart samples were frozen immediately after the birds were sacrificed and stored at -80 °C until use. Skeletal muscle samples were collected in the same manner for use as controls. Wild turkey hearts were collected in Northeast Ohio during the spring hunting season. The hearts were harvested within 1 h postmortem, kept in ice during transportation, and then stored at -80 °C until use. We have demonstrated previously that no detectable cardiac TnI degradation occurred when mouse corpses were stored at room temperature for 8 h (14Yu Z.-B. Zhang L.-F. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15753-15760Google Scholar). The anticipated integrity of cardiac TnI in the wild turkey heart samples was confirmed by later sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis. Triton X-100-washed cardiac myofibrils were prepared from the wild turkey ventricular muscle, as described previously (9Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Ventricular muscle tissues or myofibrils were homogenized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% SDS, heated to 80 °C for 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation. Total protein extracts were resolved by 14% Laemmli gel with an acrylamide: bisacrylamide ratio of 180:1 or by 12% Laemmli gel with an acrylamide: bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1. Resulting gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R250 to reveal the resolved protein bands, and duplicate gels were electrically blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, as described previously (11Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Google Scholar). After blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with an anti-TnI monoclonal antibody (mAb) (TnI-1) (15Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W. Yu Z.-B. Ruse C. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Google Scholar) or an anti-cardiac and slow TnT mAb (CT3) (16Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: 1067-1077Google Scholar). The membranes were then washed with high stringency using Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.05% SDS, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-mouse IgG second antibody (Sigma), washed again, and developed in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate solution, as described previously (11Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Google Scholar).cDNA Cloning—Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) cloning of cDNAs encoding the turkey cardiac TnI variants was used to determine the protein primary structure. The turkey belongs to the avian order of Galliformes that also includes the domestic chicken (17Jin J.-P. Samanez R.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 103-116Google Scholar). To obtain primer sequences appropriate for the cloning of turkey cardiac TnI cDNA, we first extended the published partial chicken cardiac TnI cDNA sequence (18Hastings K.E. Koppe R.I. Marmor E. Bader D. Shimada Y. Toyota N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19659-19665Google Scholar) to full-length. A cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ mRNA extracted from 5-week-old White Leghorn chicken hearts, as described previously (19Jin J.-P. Wang J. Zhang J. Gene. 1996; 168: 217-221Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was prepared from the ventricular muscle with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by using a biotinylated-oligo(dT) selection method (the poly(A) tract system II from Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Using reagents from Stratagene, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA with EcoRI-XhoI unidirectional primer-linkers in which the first strand DNA synthesis was carried out using equal molars of oligo dT and random hexamer primers. The cDNA synthesized was unidirectionally ligated to the EcoRI/XhoI-digested λZAPII phage arms, packaged in vitro using the Gigapack-Gold phage extracts and propagated with XL1-Blue MRF′ E. coli host cells.From the chicken cardiac cDNA library, the exon 5–8 region of chicken cardiac TnI cDNA was amplified by PCR using a pair of forward and reverse primers designed according to the published partial chicken cardiac TnI cDNA sequence (18Hastings K.E. Koppe R.I. Marmor E. Bader D. Shimada Y. Toyota N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19659-19665Google Scholar). The 5′-region of chicken cardiac TnI cDNA was amplified from the library in a separate PCR using a reverse primer in the exon 7 region paired with T3 primer (in this λ phage library, a forward binding site for the T3 primer is present flanking the 5′ end of the cDNA insert). The PCR-amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced using the dideoxy chain-termination method. Full-length chicken cardiac TnI cDNA was constructed by pasting restriction fragments of the 5′ and 3′ cDNAs.cDNA encoding the turkey cardiac TnI was then cloned from domestic and wild turkey hearts by RT-PCR using primers synthesized according to the chicken cardiac TnI cDNA sequence. As described previously (9Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Google Scholar), turkey ventricular muscle RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent. 2 μg of the total cardiac RNA was used to synthesize cDNA from all poly(A)+ RNA by reverse transcription using an anchored oligo dT primer (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTV-3′, where V = A, C, or G). Double-stranded cDNA encoding turkey cardiac TnI was then amplified by PCR with a forward primer corresponding to the region of the translation initiation codon (5′-GGTGCATATGGCTGAGGAGGAGGAGCC-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-ATGCCACAACGCTGCCCTTAAAGGTGA-3′) synthesized corresponding to a 3′ untranslated sequence 97–124 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon. Resultant PCR products were cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector as above. Recombinant plasmid DNA was purified, and the cDNA insert was sequenced.Construction of N-terminal Truncated Turkey Cardiac TnI—Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a truncated cDNA encoding turkey cardiac TnI without the cardiac specific N-terminal region. A forward primer (5′-GGGCATATGGCTGTGGAGCCCCA-3′) was synthesized containing an NdeI restriction enzyme site (underlined) and incorporating a Met codon prior to the turkey cardiac TnI codon for amino acid 23. This mutagenesis primer was used together with the T7 primer flanking the 3′ end of the cloned turkey cardiac TnI cDNA in the pCR4-TOPO vector sequence to generate the truncated cDNA template by PCR. The PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and EcoRI and ligated into the compatibly cut pAED4 vector. Recombinant plasmid DNA was purified, and the cDNA insert was sequenced as above to verify the construction.Expression and Purification of N-terminal Truncated Turkey Cardiac TnI—The N-terminal truncated turkey cardiac TnI (TcTnI-ND) was expressed in E. coli from the cDNA construct for functional characterization. As described previously (9Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Google Scholar), BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells were transformed with the recombinant pAED4 plasmid and cultured in liquid media containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The culture was induced at mid-log phase with isopropyl-1-thiol-β-d-galactoside. After 3 additional h of culture, the bacterial cells were harvested and lysed by three passes through a French cell press in 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein extracts were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 0 °C. The fraction between 20–40% saturation was dialyzed against 0.5 mm EDTA containing 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After dialysis, the fraction was brought to 6 m urea, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.6, clarified by centrifugation, and chromatographed on a CM52 cellulose cation-exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear KCl gradient (0–500 mm), and the protein peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing TcTnI-ND were verified by Western blotting using the anti-TnI mAb TnI-1, dialyzed against de-ionized water containing 0.1% formic acid and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and concentrated by lyophilization. The N-terminal truncated cardiac TnI CM52 fractions were further purified to homogeneity by Sephadex G-75 gel filtration chromatography in 0.5 m KCl, 6 m urea, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, as described previously (9Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Google Scholar). The pure TcTnI-ND peak was identified by SDS-PAGE, dialyzed against 0.5% formic acid, and lyophilized. All of the dialysis and chromatography steps were carried out at 4 °C.Preparation of Other Proteins—Intact chicken cardiac TnI was purified from adult ventricular muscle as described previously (9Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Google Scholar). The wild-type (WT) turkey cardiac TnT and exon 8-excluded (ΔE8) turkey cardiac TnT were expressed from cloned cDNA and purified as described previously (9Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Google Scholar).Protein Conformation Assays—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) epitope analysis (11Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Google Scholar) was carried out to examine whether the deletion of the N-terminal 22 amino acids from the turkey cardiac TnI (TcTnI-ND) affects the global conformation in comparison to that of the intact chicken cardiac TnI. The mAb TnI-1 against an epitope in the C-terminal domain of TnI (15Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W. Yu Z.-B. Ruse C. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Google Scholar) was used to monitor overall conformational changes that alter the antibody binding affinity. Similar to that described previously (9Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Google Scholar), purified TcTnI-ND and intact chicken cardiac TnI were dissolved in buffer A (0.1 m KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0) and coated on microtiter plates by incubation at 4 °C overnight. Unbound cardiac TnI was washed away with buffer A containing 0.05% Tween 20 (buffer T), and the remaining plastic surface was blocked with 1% BSA in buffer T. The immobilized cardiac TnI was incubated with serial dilutions of the TnI-1 mAb at room temperature for 2 h. After washes with buffer T to remove unbound first antibody, the plates were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin second antibody (Sigma) at room temperature for 45 min. The unbound second antibody was washed away with buffer T and H2O2/2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) was added for substrate reaction. A405 of each assay well was recorded at a series of time points by an automated microplate reader (Bio-Rad Benchmark). The A405 values in the linear course of the color development were used to plot the TnI-1 mAb titration curves, allowing the quantification of binding affinity to the epitope on cardiac TnI. All experiments were done in triplicate.Protein Binding Assays—The ELISA-based solid-phase protein binding assay (11Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Google Scholar) was used to investigate the interactions of cardiac TnI with wild-type and exon 8-excluded turkey cardiac TnT.Standard ELISA (11Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Google Scholar) was first carried out on purified wild-type and exon 8-excluded turkey cardiac TnT to validate the equal coating of the two TnT variants onto the microtiter plate. Turkey cardiac TnTs were dissolved in buffer A and incubated at varied concentrations in the microtiter plates. Cardiac TnT bound to the plate was assessed by incubation with a saturating concentration of the anti-TnT mAb CT3 and quantified by standard ELISA, as described above. The A405 values for the maximally bound CT3 mAb were used as a quantitative indicator of the amount of turkey cardiac TnT immobilized in the well of the microtiter plates.To assess TnI-TnT interactions by solid-phase binding experiments, purified cardiac TnT or BSA control was dissolved at 5 μg/ml in buffer A and coated onto triplicate wells of the microtiter plates by incubation at 4 °C overnight. After washes with buffer T to remove the unbound protein, the plates were blocked with buffer T containing 1% BSA. After washes with buffer T, the plates were then incubated with serial dilutions of cardiac TnI in buffer T containing 0.1% BSA at room temperature for 2 h. After washes with buffer T, the cardiac TnI bound to immobilized cardiac TnT was quantified by means of the anti-TnI mAb TnI-1 (15Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W. Yu Z.-B. Ruse C. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Google Scholar) and standard ELISA procedure.Computer Modeling—To investigate the potential structural effect of R111C substitution in turkey cTnI, we calculated the lowest energy homology models of the troponin complex, including these variants. The 52-kDa human cardiac troponin crystal structure (8Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Google Scholar) was retrieved from the NCBI website and cTnI residues 114–117 were changed from the original human cardiac to that of the turkey. Structures containing either Arg or Cys at residue 117 (equivalent to avian residue 111 and corresponding to the two turkey cTnI variants) were compared by analysis in the low mode search of Macromodel 7.2 (Schrodinger, Inc.) using an OPLS-AA force field and GBSA solvent model.Data Analysis—The DNA and protein sequence analyses were done using computer programs from DNAStar. Statistical analysis of the ELISA antibody titration and protein binding assays was done by a Student's t test. All values are given as mean ± S.D.RESULTSA Novel Cardiac TnI in Wild Turkey Hearts with Unique Gel Mobility—Normally the adult mammalian and avian hearts express only one cardiac TnT and one cardiac TnI. Previously, we reported the domestic turkey expresses two cardiac TnT, with the low Mr variant resulting from abnormal RNA splicing to the exclusion of the exon 8 segment. On cardiac muscle homogenates, SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) and Western blot analysis using the anti-cardiac and slow TnT mAb CT3 demonstrate that the wild turkey heart expresses the additional low Mr cardiac TnT variant as previously demonstrated in the domestic turkey heart (Fig. 1B; Ref. 9Biesiadecki B.J. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18459-18468Google Scholar). The use of the anti-TnI mAb TnI-1 Western blot of domestic turkey heart identified a single cardiac TnI of identical SDS-gel mobility to that of the chicken cardiac TnI (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, an additional slow migrating cardiac TnI was detected in the heart of the wild turkeys. The heart of wild turkey #1 (shown in Fig. 1C) expressed both the normal and a slower migrating variant of cardiac TnI, whereas wild turkey #2 expressed only the slower migrating cardiac TnI (Fig. 1C). The novel, slow migrating TnI detected in the wild turkey hearts is distinct from fast or slow skeletal muscle TnI, as its SDS-gel mobility was different from that seen in a mixed-fiber skeletal muscle of a newly hatched domestic turkey and the fast skeletal muscle of a 15-day-old domestic turkey (Fig. 1C). The slow migrating cardiac TnI was proportionally incorporated into the myofilaments as shown by the Western blot of extensively washed wild turkey cardiac myofibrils (Fig. 1D).Cloning of the 5′ Region of Chicken Cardiac TnI cDNA— Based on the 3′ partial sequence of chicken cardiac TnI cDNA reported by Hastings et al. (18Hastings K.E. Koppe R.I. Marmor E. Bader D. Shimada Y. Toyota N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19659-19665Google Scholar), we cloned a full-length chicken cardiac TnI cDNA by PCR from a unidirectional chicken cardiac cDNA library. Expression of the cloned cDNA in E. coli yielded a protein recognized by the anti-TnI mAb TnI-1 with identical size to cardiac TnI in the chicken heart (Fig. 1E). Sequence of the full-length chicken cardiac TnI cDNA has been submitted to GenBank™/EBI with the accession number AY463242. The physical properties of the protein deduced from the cDNA sequence demonstrate that the chicken cardiac TnI is of similar molecular weight to that of human and mouse cardiac TnI. The fact that the chicken cardiac TnI (208 amino acids, Mr = 23,627, isoelectric point (pI) = 9.96) exhibits a significantly faster SDS-gel migration rate than that of the similar-sized human (210 amino acids, Mr = 24,037, pI = 9.87) and mouse (211 amino acids, Mr = 24,258, pI = 9.57) cardiac TnI (Fig. 1C) demonstrates that SDS-gel mobility is a sensitive indicator of differences in TnI primary structure.A Single Nucleotide Mutation Results in a Cys Substitution for Arg111 in Wild Turkey Cardiac TnI—Based upon the full-length chicken cardiac TnI cDNA sequence, we were able to use RT-PCR to clone cDNAs encoding the fast and slow migrating turkey cardiac TnIs. Sequencing analysis revealed that chicken, domestic turkey, and the faster migrating wild turkey cardiac TnIs are identical in amino acid sequence. Therefore, the domestic turkey cardiac TnI sequence is considered the wild type. Consistent with the expression patterns of the fast migrating (chicken-like, wild-type) and/or slow migrating cardiac TnI in the wild turkey hearts (Fig. 1C), wild-type cardiac TnI cDNA clones were obtained from wild turkey #1 but not from wild turkey #2. cDNA clones isolated from wild turkey #2 were different from the wild-type cardiac TnI by a single G → T transversion of nucleotide 331 located in the exon 6 sequence. This nucleotide transversion resulted in the mis-sense mutation of codon 111, which corresponds to a change of Arg111 into Cys (R111C) (Fig. 2A). The cDNA cloning data demonstrate that the two turkey cardiac TnI bands of different SDS-gel mobility (Fig. 1C) represent a polymorphism caused by two cardiac TnI alleles. The cDNA sequences of the Arg111 and Cys111 turkey cardiac TnI alleles have been submitted to GenBank™/EBI with the accession numbers AY463243 and AY463244, respectively. Whereas the domestic turkey is a homozygote of the wild-type Arg111 allele, wild turkey #1 is a heterozygote of Arg111/Cys111 alleles, and wild turkey #2 is a homozygote of the Cys111 allele. Because substitution of the Cys for the wild-type Arg111 results in a decreased protein mass and slightly acidic shift of pI (23,574 and 9.78 versus 23,627 and 9.96, respectively), the slower SDS-gel mobility of the turkey cardiac TnI Cys111 was not due to a change in molecular mass but rather indicates a change in protein conformation. The substitution of a neutral side chain for a positively charged side chain may confer structural and functional alterations in the wild turkey cardiac TnI.Fig. 2Primary structure of turkey cardiac TnI and a G → T transversion in wild turkey cardiac TnI gene, resulting in a substitution of Cys for Arg111. A, cDNA cloning and sequencing revealed the primary structures of the slow and fast migrating turkey cardiac TnIs. The deduced amino acid sequence of the wild-type turkey cardiac TnI was found to be identical to the chicken cardiac TnI, with Arg at position 111.

https://openalex.org/W1975406504,"We are using the tissue-specific splicing of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) as a model to investigate smooth muscle phenotypic diversity. We previously identified a U-rich intronic enhancer flanking the 5′ splice site (IE1), and a bipartite exonic enhancer/suppressor, that regulate splicing of the MYPT1 central alternative exon. Here we show that T-cell inhibitor of apoptosis (TIA-1) and T-cell inhibitor of apoptosis-related (TIAR) proteins bind to the IE1. Co-transfection of TIA expression vectors with a MYPT1 mini-gene construct increase splicing of the central alternative exon. TIA proteins do not enhance splicing when the palindromic exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) is mutated, indicating that TIAs are necessary but not sufficient for splicing. The ESE specifically binds SRp55 and SRp20 proteins, supporting a model in which both SR and TIA proteins binding to their cis-elements are required for the recruitment of the splicing complex to a weak 5′ splice site. Inactivation of TIA proteins in the DT40 cell line (TIA-1-/-TIAR+/-) reduced the splicing of the central alternative exon of the endogenous MYPT1 as well as stably transfected MYPT1 minigene constructs. Splicing of the MYPT1 3′ alternative exon and the MLC17 alternative exon were unaffected, suggesting that TIA proteins regulate a subset of smooth muscle/nonmuscle alternative splicing reactions. Finally, reduced RNA binding and reduced expression of the TIA and SR proteins in phasic (gizzard) smooth muscle around hatching coincided with the switch from exon inclusion to exon skipping, suggesting that loss of TIA and SR enhancer activity may play a role in the developmental switch in MYPT1 splicing.

Much phenotypic diversity in SM tissues is generated by the alternative splicing of exons (1Black D.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Google Scholar, 2Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Google Scholar, 3Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Google Scholar, 4Graveley B.R. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 100-107Google Scholar). Nearly 60% of vertebrate genes are estimated to undergo alternative splicing (5Xu Q. Modrek B. Lee C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3754-3766Google Scholar, 6Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Google Scholar). Whereas there are a few well characterized genes where alternative splicing is governed by the presence or absence of a single regulatory protein (6Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Google Scholar), in many genes regulated splicing of exons involves a combinatorial interplay of positive and negative cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting proteins (3Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Google Scholar, 7Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Google Scholar). These regulatory interactions affect the splice site selection by the splicing machinery and thus govern the inclusion or exclusion of alternative exons. Our laboratory is using the MYPT1 gene (a subunit of smooth muscle myosin phosphatase) as a model gene to understand how SM phenotypic diversity is generated through alternative splicing of exons for several reasons. In birds and mammals, isoforms of MYPT1 are generated by cassette-type alternative splicing of exons in the central and 3′-end of the transcript. The splicing of the alternative exons is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. Around the time of hatching (embryonic day 21 (ED21)), the MYPT1 isoform in the chicken gizzard (phasic fast contracting smooth muscle phenotype) completely switches from central exon-in and 3′-exon-out to central exon-out and 3′-exon-in. In contrast, the chicken slow tonic contracting aorta smooth muscle phenotype throughout development expresses the MYPT1 isoform in which the central alternative exon is included and the 3′ alternative exon is skipped (8Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Google Scholar, 9Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression of the MYPT1 splice variants is thought to be an important determinant of smooth muscle functional diversity (9Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Google Scholar, 10Payne M.C. Zhang H.-Y. Shirasawa Y. Kosa Y. Ikebe M. Benoit J.N. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 281 (in press)Google Scholar). We previously used mutation and deletion analysis of MYPT1 minigene constructs to identify cis-regulators of splicing of the chicken MYPT1 central alternative exon (from here on referred to as the MYPT1 alt exon). We identified several cis-enhancer elements (Fig. 1B) in the vicinity of the alternative exon 5′-splice site, including a proximal U-rich intronic sequence, a 67-nucleotide intronic enhancer, and an exonic splicing enhancer, that are necessary for the splicing of the MYPT1 alt exon (11Dirksen W.P. Mohamed S.A. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9722-9732Google Scholar). The proximal intronic splicing enhancer (IE1) is a 19-nucleotide U-rich sequence including two UCUU motifs immediately adjacent to the 5′ splice site of the alternative exon. This sequence is a putative binding site for TIA-1 and TIAR (12Forch P. Puig O. Kedersha N. Martinez C. Granneman S. Seraphin B. Anderson P. Valcarcel J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11881-11890Google Scholar) proteins, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in the regulation of MYPT1 alt exon splicing. TIA-1 and TIAR are RNA-binding proteins regulating a number of functions in both nucleus and cytoplasm (16Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J.

PTB, also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-I, is a well known repressor of splicing (21Charlet B. Logan P. Singh G. Cooper T.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 649-658Google Scholar). In the current study, we use gain and loss of function experiments as well as RNA-protein binding experiments to show that TIA-1 or TIAR functioning through the U-rich enhancer element is necessary but not sufficient for the splicing of the MYPT1 alt exon. We also find that expression of the TIA proteins is developmentally regulated, suggesting a model in which the silencing of TIA expression during the development of the phasic fast (gizzard) smooth muscle phenotype contributes to the loss of splicing of the MYPT1 alt exon. Tissue Culture and Transfection of Plasmid DNA—Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated from embryonic chicken gizzards and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories) as previously described (8Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Google Scholar, 11Dirksen W.P. Mohamed S.A. Fisher S.A. J. Biol.

Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE as a carrier as previously described. The cells were transfected in 24-well plates with 0.1 μg/well expression vector containing wild type or mutant MYPT1 mini-gene expression vectors under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (11Dirksen W.P. Mohamed S.A. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9722-9732Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) and 0.01–0.1 μg of full-length TIA-1 or TIAR (16Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Google Scholar) or PTB (15Perez I. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11881-11890Google Scholar) expression vectors. The pUC 19 plasmid (0.0–0.09 μg) was included to maintain a constant amount of plasmid DNA used in each transfection. RNA was isolated 24–48 h after transfection using Promega SV RNA isolation kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. Cell Culture, Electroporation, and RNA Isolation from DT-40 Cells— DT40 cells were cultured and electroporated as described by Le Guiner et al. (20Le Guiner C. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10465-10476Google Scholar). For electroporations, 30 μg of a minigene construct were mixed with 3 μg of a plasmid carrying a blasticidin resistance marker. Cells were selected in medium containing 50 μg/ml blasticidin, and RNA was prepared and reverse-transcribed as described by Le Guiner et al. (20Le Guiner C. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10465-10476Google Scholar). RT-PCR of RNA—RNA samples were analyzed by RT-PCR for the presence of exon-included and exon-skipped MYPT-1 minigene transcripts as described previously (11Dirksen W.P. Mohamed S.A. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9722-9732Google Scholar). In these reactions, a 3′ primer is used that specifically anneals with the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence present only in the exogenous MYPT1 minigene transcript. The RT-PCR products were separated on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel, and fluorescent signals of the exon-included and exon-excluded products were quantified with a Storm 860 Imager (Amersham Biosciences) and Amersham Biosciences ImageQuaNT software. Splice variants of MLC17, MYPT1 central, and MYPT1 C-terminal were examined in DT40 cells and DT40 TIA-/-TIAR+/- (referred as TIAmut cells hereon) (20Le Guiner C. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10465-10476Google Scholar) using primers as previously described (11Dirksen W.P. Mohamed S.A. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9722-9732Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, 23–27 (for transfected gizzard cells), 30–35 (for endogenous genes from DT40 cells), and 60–65 (for DT40 stably transfected cells) cycles of amplification were used. RT reactions were done with 0.5–1.5 μg of total RNA, and one-twentieth to one-one hundredth of the RT reaction used in the PCR. For every sample, negative control reactions were performed in which the avian myeloblastosis virus RT enzyme was omitted from the RT reaction. To demonstrate the linearity of the assays, PCRs were performed using 0.5 and 1.5 μl of input cDNA from each RT reaction. As previously shown (11Dirksen W.P. Mohamed S.A. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9722-9732Google Scholar), this resulted in severalfold increase in the total signal without any significant change in the ratio of the exon-included to exon-skipped products (not shown). Preparation of Nuclear and Whole Tissue Extracts—Nuclear and whole tissue extracts were prepared from embryonic and posthatched chick gizzard and aorta tissues using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Samples were assayed for protein concentrations using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Synthesis of Labeled RNA Oligonucleotides—The 5′-end amine-modified RNA oligonucleotides containing a wild type or a mutant IE1 or an ESE sequence were purchased from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). The oligonucleotides were biotin-labeled with sulfo-succin-midyl-6′-biotinamido-hexanoate by Pierce, following the procedure as described by the manufacturer. The labeled oligonucleotides were purified by ethanol precipitation followed by polyacrylamide gel purification on a 19% gel. RNA Affinity Assays—RNA affinity assay was carried out following the method described by Blyn et al. (22Blyn L.B. Chen R. Semler B.L. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4381-4389Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions were performed in 250 μl of binding buffer consisting of 100 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm KCl, 50% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm ATP, and 2.0 μl of bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), 10 μg t-RNA, 200 pmol of biotin-labeled RNA, and 250 or 400 μg of NE. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction mixture was added to 400 μl of streptavidin Magnesphere particles (Promega, Madison, WI), prewashed five times with the binding buffer without t-RNA. The reaction mixture was incubated with prewashed beads for 15 min at 30 °C to allow binding of the protein-RNA complex to the beads. The beads-RNA-protein complex was then washed five times with binding buffer. After final wash, 30 μl of 2× protein sample buffer was added to the complex and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C to allow dissociation of the protein from the complex. 10 μl of each protein sample (one-third of the total sample) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Protein Analysis—Proteins were separated on 4–12% gradient Nu-PAGE Novex bis-tris gels (Invitrogen) and either visualized by silver stain or electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in wash buffer for 1 h and probed with antibodies ML 29 against TIA-1, 6E3 against TIAR (23Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Google Scholar), and mAb 104 against SR proteins (24Roth M.B. Murphy C. Gall J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2217-2223Google Scholar) and SF2-specific antibody (25Hanamura A. Caceres J.F. Mayeda A. Franza Jr., B.R. Krainer A.R. RNA. 1998; 4: 430-444Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1600; Bio-Rad). Signals were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). TIA-1 and TIAR trans-Activate MYPT1 Central Exon Splicing—Transfection of the MYPT1 wild type minigene expression plasmid (Fig. 1A) into cultured gizzard SMCs resulted in 89 ± 2% exon-included transcripts as we previously reported (11Dirksen W.P. Mohamed S.A. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9722-9732Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Co-transfection of a TIA-1 expression plasmid increased the level of exon-included product from 89 ± 2% to 98 ± 2% (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Co-transfection of a TIAR expression plasmid had a similar but slightly less potent effect (95 ± 3% in wild type Fig. 2A, lane 3). In contrast, co-transfection with a PTB expression plasmid resulted in a small shift toward the exon-exclusion in the cultured SMCs (85 ± 4%, Fig. 2A, lane 4). In order to determine whether the ability of TIA-1 to enhance splicing of the MYPT1 alt exon was cell type-specific, transfections were repeated in the mammalian nonmuscle 293 cell line. In these cells, transfection of the MYPT1 minigene expression plasmid resulted in ∼50% exon-included transcripts (Fig. 2B, lane 1), as previously reported. Co-transfection of TIA-1 expression plasmids increased exon inclusion to 85 ± 4% of transcripts (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Thus, TIA-1 or TIAR, but not PTB, can enhance splicing of the MYPT1 central alt exon in multiple cell types. trans-Activation Effect of TIA Is U-rich IE1-dependent—To test whether the observed enhancer effect of TIA on splicing is functioning through the U-rich IE1, TIA-1 or TIAR expression plasmids were co-transfected with MYPT1 minigene constructs where the IE1 is deleted (ΔUCUU1 + 2) or mutated (Cmut2 and Cmut1 + 2) (Fig. 1B). Deletion of the 19-nt U-rich sequence results in a significant loss of exon splicing in cultured SMCs (19 ± 4% exon inclusion) (see Fig. 3A, lane 3). Co-transfection with the TIA-1 expression plasmid had no effect on exon splicing (15 ± 2% exon-in) (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, mutation of the U-rich sequence to C-rich (Cmut1 + 2) also resulted in exon skipping and failure of TIA-1 co-transfection to enhance splicing (15 ± 2% versus 18 ± 4%) (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). When the U-rich sequence was partially mutated (Cmut2), a smaller shift toward exon exclusion occurred, and this could be entirely rescued by co-expression of TIA-1 (60 ± 4 versus 92 ± 2% exon-included) (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 7 and 8). Nearly identical results were obtained with co-transfection of a TIAR expression plasmid and the MYPT1 mini-gene constructs (data not shown). Thus, TIA-1 and TIAR trans-activation of MYPT1 alt exon splicing is IE1-dependent. TIA Enhancer Activity Is ESE-dependent but Independent of the Downstream IE2—We next tested weather the trans-activating ability of TIA-1, functioning through the IE1, is dependent on the exonic and downstream intronic cis-enhancers (ESE and IE2), since mutation of these cis-elements had significant effects on splicing independent of the IE1. Replacement of the chicken MYPT1 alt exon sequence with the corresponding rat MYPT1 exon sequence results in the deletion of 18 nt (including an 11-nt palindromic ESE) and substitution mutations of 36 nt (8Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Google Scholar). It should be noted that this exon in the rat (and other mammals) is constitutively spliced and thus may lack regulatory elements (8Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Google Scholar). The transcripts processed from this minigene construct have minimal exon inclusion, and there is no effect of co-transfection of TIA expression plasmids (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). This indicates that the cis-enhancer elements within the exon are required as co-activators for the TIA-1-dependent IE1. To more specifically define the co-activator, we tested the effects of mutation of two previously identified cis-enhancers. A mutation that disrupts a palindromic ESE (Mut pal1 + 2) (Fig. 1) resulted in a reduction in exon inclusion to 49 ± 3% as previously reported. This mutation disrupts both half-sites of the palindromic ESE as well as the putative SRp55 binding sequence (UACAUC). Co-transfection of a TIA expression plasmid had no significant effect on alt exon splicing (45 ± 4%) (see Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4). A more limited mutation of the 5′-half of the palindromic ESE (Mut pal1, Fig. 1), which destroys the putative binding site for SRp55, has a more modest effect on exon splicing but also does not respond to co-transfection with TIA vector (Mut pal 1 75 ± 2% versus 76 ± 3% exon inclusion) (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, mutation of 10 nt immediately upstream of the palindromic ESE to the corresponding rat sequence that resulted in a significant loss in exon inclusion could be completely rescued by co-transfection with a TIA expression plasmid (mutA; 59 ± 3% versus 88 ± 2% exon inclusion) (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8). In contrast to the requirement of the ESE for TIA function in alt exon splicing, the effect of deletion of 661 nt in the downstream intron that contains a 67-nt enhancer (IE2) was also completely rescued by co-transfection of a TIA expression plasmid (Δ1, 65 ± 5% versus 93 ± 2% exon-in) (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 9 and 10). Thus, TIA function to enhance splicing of the alt exon is dependent upon the palindromic ESE but not an adjacent ESE nor downstream IE2. Effect of TIA-1 and TIAR Gene Disruption on MYPT1 Alt Exon Splicing—We next examined the effect that TIA loss-of-function would have on MYPT1 alt exon splicing. MYPT1 is expressed in nonmuscle and SM cells, and the central alt exon is spliced in nonmuscle cells. This allowed us to utilize the chicken lymphoid DT40 cell line in which both TIA genes were intact (WT) or with both TIA-1 alleles and one TIAR allele disrupted (TIA-1-/-TIAR+/-) cells (TIAmut) (20Le Guiner C. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10465-10476Google Scholar). Stable transfection of wild type DT40 cells with the wild type MYPT1 minigene generated 88 ± 2% exon-included product (Fig. 4, lane 1), identical to that obtained with transient transfection of cultured chicken SMCs and the chicken hepatocellular carcinoma LMH cell line (11Dirksen W.P. Mohamed S.A. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9722-9732Google Scholar). The MYPT1 minigene construct stably transfected into DT40 TIAmut cells resulted in a large shift toward exon skipping (54 ± 5% exon inclusion) (Fig. 4, lane 2). This effect is similar to the effect of partially disabling the TIA cis-element Cmut2 (see Fig. 3A, lane 7;60 ± 4% exon inclusion) and suggests that the remaining TIAR allele can partially support MYPT1 alt exon splicing, consistent with the co-transfection assays. Stable transfection of DT40 WT with the Cmut1 + 2 MYPT1 minigene plasmid resulted in a large shift toward exon skipping with only 15 ± 3% exon-included transcripts (Fig. 4, lane 3), similar to that observed in the transient transfection of smooth and nonmuscle cells. This same construct in the TIAmut DT40 cells generated 5 ± 4% exon-included transcripts (Fig. 4, lane 4), suggesting that the U-rich flanking sequence remaining in this construct has residual TIA-dependent enhancer activity (consistent with TIA protein-binding studies; see below). TIA Proteins Bind to the U-rich IE1 and SR Proteins Bind to the ESE—The results of co-transfection experiments suggested that TIA activation of splicing of MYPT1 alt exon required both the IE1 and the ESE. We next carried out RNA-protein binding assays to determine what was binding to these elements and whether the co-dependence resulted from a requirement for binding. Nuclear extracts from ED15 gizzard tissue incubated with a 19-mer RNA oligonucleotide containing the IE1 resulted in two retarded bands that were not observed in gel shift experiments with Cmut1 + 2 (mutIE1) oligonucleotides. The addition of TIA-1-specific antibody ML 29 (23Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Google Scholar) reduced the intensity of this band, suggesting that this represents TIA-1 binding (data not shown). In order to demonstrate that the gel-retarded bands represented TIA binding, we used streptavidin affinity columns to purify nuclear proteins that bind to the biotinylated RNAs containing the IE1 sequence, a mutIE1, or the ESE sequence (Fig. 5A). Protein fractions containing the purified nuclear proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Silver staining of gels showed a nuclear protein of ∼42 kDa that bound to the U-rich IE1 (Fig. 5B, lane 1) but not to the mutIE1, ESE sequence (control), or beads (Fig. 5B, lanes 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Immunostaining with anti-TIA-1 ML-29 mAb or anti-TIAR 6E3 mAb (23Kedersha N.L. Gupta M. Li W. Miller I. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1431-1442Google Scholar) confirmed the identity of this band as TIA-1 (Fig. 5B, lane 5) and TIAR (not shown). On Western blot TIA-1 appeared as a single band at 42 kDa binding to the IE1. Immunostaining also revealed weak binding of TIA to mutIE1 with ∼15% as much binding as the to wild type IE1 sequence (Fig. 5B, lane 6). The assay provides direct evidence that ESE is not required for TIA binding to IE1 and that the requirement of an intact ESE for TIA enhancer function is not due to binding of the ESE by TIA. We next identified factors that bind to the ESE. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (26Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Google Scholar, 27Liu H.X. Chew S.L. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1063-1071Google Scholar) analysis of ESE defines it having an optimal binding site for SRp55 with less of a match for SRp40 and SRp20 (not shown). We carried out RNA affinity binding assays with nuclear extract from ED15 gizzard and probed for SR proteins by Western blot using the mAb 104 antibody that recognizes the RS domain of SR proteins (24Roth M.B. Murphy C. Gall J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2217-2223Google Scholar). SR proteins of 55 and 20 kDa bound to ESE sequence and not to the U-rich IE1 RNA (control) nor to beads only (Fig. 5D, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). All of the major SR proteins are detected in ED15 gizzard nuclear extracts (Fig. 5D, lane 9)or ED15 gizzard purified SR preparations (data not shown), indicating that SRp55 and SRp20 are specifically binding to the ESE. TIA Binding to IE1 and SR Binding to ESE Follows the Developmentally Regulated Pattern of MYPT1 Alt Exon Splicing—We next sought to determine whether there was a relationship between binding of the TIA and SR proteins to the enhancer sequences and the developmental switch from MYPT1 alt exon splicing to exon exclusion in the gizzard smooth muscle. Affinity binding assays were carried out using the NEs collected from four different periods of development with the following splicing pattern of MYPT1 alt exon: 1) ED15–100% exon-included; 2) ED19–78% exon included; 3) D1–40% exon-included; 4) D6–10% exon-included. No significant difference was observed in the binding of TIA to the IE1 between the NE from ED15 and ED19 (Fig. 5, B (lane 5) and C (lane 1)). However, there was a dramatic decrease in TIA-IE1 binding in NE from D1 (Fig. 5C, lane 3). No binding of TIA proteins was detected with the NE from D6 tissue (Fig. 5C, lane 5), even when 4-fold increased amounts of nuclear proteins were used in the binding reaction. A silver stain of the NEs used in these experiments (Fig. 5C, lanes 7–9) shows approximately equal amounts of intact protein in each sample. A similar pattern was observed for SRp55 and SRp20 binding to the ESE (Fig. 5D, compare lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). Down-regulated Expression of TIA and SR Proteins in Developing Chick Gizzard Correlates with Developmental Changes in MYPT1 Central Exon Splicing—The stage-dependent binding of TIA and SR proteins to the IE1 and ESE, respectively, prompted us to examine the expression of the TIA and SR proteins during smooth muscle phenotypic specification. We determined the abundance of these proteins in whole tissue extracts (WTEs) and nuclear fractions from ED15, ED19, D1, and D6 chicken gizzard. In NEs from ED15 and ED19, TIA-1 was detected as a singlet band and TIAR as a doublet at ∼42 kDa (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2), as previously reported in avian species (20Le Guiner C. Gesnel M.C. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10465-10476Google Scholar). Additionally, in ED19, D1, and D6 NEs, a band migrating at ∼55 kDa was also observed. This band of unknown identity has been previously reported (28Tian Q. Streuli M. Saito H. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Cell. 1991; 67: 629-639Google Scholar, 29Be"
https://openalex.org/W2006520248,"Nitric oxide (NO) production is known to be impaired in heart failure. A new compound (NCX 899), a NO-releasing derivative of enalapril was characterized, and its actions were evaluated in Bio 14.6 cardiomyopathic (CM) hamsters with heart failure. The hamsters were randomized to oral treatment for 4 weeks with vehicle (n=11), NCX 899 (NCX, 25 mg/kg, n=10), or enalapril (25 mg/kg, n=10). In the vehicle group, fractional shortening by echocardiography decreased (-23.6+/-2.0%) and LV end-diastolic dimension) increased (+10.9+/-1.0%), whereas fractional shortening increased (+17.5+/-4.4%) in NCX and was unchanged in the enalapril group (both P<0.01 vs. vehicle). End-diastolic dimension decreased only in NCX. LV contractility (LVdP/dt max and Emax) was significantly greater in NCX than in enalapril or vehicle, while relaxation (Tau) was shortened in both NCX and enalapril vs. vehicle. ACE activity was inhibited equally by NCX and enalapril in the CM hamster, and plasma nitrate levels were increased only in NCX (P<0.05 vs. enalapril and vehicle). In aortic strips endothelium-independent relaxation occurred only with NCX. The superior effects of NO-releasing enalapril (NCX) vs. enalapril alone to enhance vascular effects, increase LV contractility and prevent unfavorable remodeling and are consistent with vascular delivery of exogenous NO. NCX 899 may hold promise for the future treatment of heart failure."

Leduc R. Day R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 1-22Google Scholar). This post-translational modification permits the diversification and regulation of gene products. Seven distinct enzymes are included in the SPC family (2Chan S.J. Oliva Jr., A.A. LaMendola J. Grens A. Bode H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6678-6682Google Scholar) as follows: SPC1 (furin or PACE), SPC2 (PC2), SPC3 (PC1 or PC3), SPC4 (PACE4), SPC5 (PC4), SPC6 (PC5 or PC6), and SPC7 (LPC, PC7, or PC8). SPCs are highly specific proteases that cleave pro-protein precursors at positively charged amino acids (i.e. Arg-Arg, Lys-Arg, Arg-Lys, Lys-Lys, or even single Arg residues). Furthermore, distribution studies indicated that instead of expressing one SPC at a time, the various cell types expressed distinct combinations of the SPCs (3Day R. Schafer M.K. Watson S.J. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 485-497Google Scholar, 4Vieau D. Seidah N.G. Day R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1187-1196Google Scholar). The similarities in the cleavage recognition motif, combined with cellular co-localization, suggested the possibility of overlapping processing functions within SPC family members. This hypothesis was supported by studies on SPC2- and SPC3-null mice where the processing of pro-insulin was severely impaired but not completely blocked (5Furuta M. Carroll R. Martin S. Swift H.H. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3431-3437Google Scholar, 6Zhu X. Orci L. Carroll R. Norrbom C. Ravazzola M. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 16: 10299-10304Google Scholar). However, not all SPCs are amenable to null mouse models, because both SPC1- and SPC4-null mice are not viable (7Taylor N.A. Van de Ven W.J.M. Creemers J.W.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1215-1227Google Scholar). A good method for determining the functional specificity of each SPC resides in developing cultured cell lines in which the expression of a single member of the enzyme family is specifically inhibited, as this permits a fine control of the extracellular environment. To date, few endogenous inhibitors (e.g. 7B2 C-terminal peptide and pro-SAAS-derived peptides) or protein-based bio-engineered inhibitors (such as α1-antitrypsin Portland) have been described (for a review see Ref. 8Fugere M. Day R. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 549-562Google Scholar). Most of these inhibitory agents exhibited great potency against their target, but their specificity among the other SPCs remains to be studied/improved. Thus, their use may lead to some erroneous interpretations of the substrate specificity function of a discrete SPC when used in cell lines that contain other enzymes of the SPC family. Another way of inhibiting the function of SPCs in cultured cells is by targeting their mRNAs. The introduction of antisense oligonucleotide or small interfering RNA in cells may lead to a down-regulation of the targeted mRNA by the host molecular machinery. However, problems of potency-, specificity-, and/or cell type-dependent responses illustrate a lack of understanding of intracellular mechanisms involved (9Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Google Scholar, 10Lebedeva I. Stein C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 403-419Google Scholar). In an entirely different approach, we have investigated the use of δ ribozyme (δRz) as a molecular tool to specifically target a single SPC. The ability of ribozymes to specifically recognize and subsequently catalyze the cleavage of an RNA molecule makes them attractive in mRNA gene silencing approaches (for a review see Ref. 11Ananvoranich S. Perreault J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13182-13188Google Scholar). The δRz, which derives from the hepatitis δ virus, possesses several unique features all related to the fact that it is the only naturally occurring catalytic RNA discovered in humans (for reviews see Refs. 12Shih I.H. Been M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 887-917Google Scholar and 13Bergeron L.J. Ouellet J. Perreault J.P. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 2589-2597Google Scholar). The use of δRz for specific cleavage in trans of natural mRNA in vitro as well as in vivo has been demonstrated but not well characterized (14Bergeron L.J. Perreault J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4682-4691Google Scholar, 15Kato Y. Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Toda H. Taira K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15378-15385Google Scholar, 16Al-Anouti F. Ananvoranich S. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002; 12: 275-281Google Scholar). In this study, we applied δRz design strategy with the goal of the complete inhibition of SPC2 activity in βTC-3 cells that endogenously express the pro-dynorphin (pro-Dyn) substrate (4Vieau D. Seidah N.G. Day R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1187-1196Google Scholar). By demonstrating unambiguously the potency and the specificity of the δRz, we showed the potential utility of this molecular tool for SPC substrate specificity characterization studies. Bioinformatic Analysis of the SPC2 mRNA—Selection of the targeting sites was performed as described previously (14Bergeron L.J. Perreault J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4682-4691Google Scholar). Briefly, eight SPC cDNA sequences (GenBank™ data base accession numbers: X54056 (mouse SPC1), M55669 (mouse SPC2), M58589 (mouse SPC3), AF008222 (partial mouse SPC4), L31894 (rat SPC4), D01093 (mouse SPC5), D12619 (mouse SPC6), and U48830 (mouse SPC7)) were aligned using the ClustalW package (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). This sequence alignment was used to confirm the cleavage specificity with regard to the other SPCs. We used the full-length SPC2 mRNA sequence (Fig. 1A) to evaluate the most stable secondary structures. These values, expressed in terms of the variation of free energy (ΔG), were obtained using the program RNA Structure 3.5 (18Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Google Scholar). The resulting file was then analyzed for the probability of binding to complementary 7 nucleotide (nt) oligonucleotides using the OligoWalk software (19Mathews D.H. Burkard M.E. Freier S.M. Wyatt J.R. Turner D.H. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 1458-1469Google Scholar). SPC2 and δRz DNA Constructs—The fragment from nucleotides 70 to 661 of the SPC2 mRNA was amplified by PCR from βTC-3 cell total cDNA using sense (5′-CACTCCCAAAGAAGGATGGAG-3′) and anti-sense (5′-GGTCATTGCTGCTGAAGTCAT-3′) primers. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the vector pCRII-topo (Invitrogen), forming the plasmid pCRII/mSPC2-(70-661). The construction of δRz minigenes for in vitro transcription was performed as described previously (14Bergeron L.J. Perreault J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4682-4691Google Scholar). Plasmids harboring δRz are referred to pδRz-SPC2-X, where X corresponds to the position of its potential cleavage site within SPC2 mRNA. Finally, the tRNAVal-δRz chimeric genes were generated as follows. A pair of complementary and overlapping oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) corresponding to the δRz region was annealed and ligated to KpnI/EcoRV co-digested pPUR-KE vector (kindly provided by K. Taira; Ref. 15Kato Y. Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Toda H. Taira K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15378-15385Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pPUR-KE-δRz, was co-digested with EcoRI and BamHI in order to liberate the tRNAVal-δRz cloning cassette, which was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1/hygro (Invitrogen) digested with MfeI and BamHI. This produced a plasmid harboring a tRNAVal-δRz chimeric template referred as ptRNAVal-δRz-SPC2-X. All constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. RNA Synthesis—Partial SPC2 and δRz were transcribed in vitro using SmaI and HindIII linearized pCRII/mSPC2-(70-661) and pδRz-SPC2-X, respectively, as templates. Run-off transcriptions were performed in the presence of purified T7 RNA polymerase (10 μg), RNA-guard (24 units, Amersham Biosciences), pyrophosphatase (0.01 unit, Roche Diagnostics), linearized plasmid DNA (5 μg) and either with or without 50 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (14Bergeron L.J. Perreault J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4682-4691Google Scholar). After DNase digestion, phenol/chloroform extraction, and nucleic acid precipitation, both SPC2 mRNA and δRz were fractionated by denaturing 5-7.5% PAGE in buffer containing 45 mm Tris borate, pH 7.5, 7 m urea, and 1 mm EDTA. The reaction products were visualized by either UV shadowing or autoradiography. The bands corresponding to the correct sizes were cut out, and the transcripts were eluted overnight at room temperature in 0.5 m ammonium acetate and 0.1% SDS solution. The transcripts were desalted on Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) spun columns and were then precipitated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, washed, dried, resuspended in ultrapure water, and quantified by either absorbance at 260 nm or 32P counting. RNase H Hydrolysis and δRz Cleavage Assays—RNase H reactions were performed using internally 32P-labeled SPC2 mRNA. Briefly, SPC2 RNA (∼0.1 μm, ∼20,000 cpm) and ODN (7 nt, 5 μm) were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C in a final volume of 8 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. RNase H (0.5 unit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was then added (2 μl), and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were quenched by adding loading buffer (97% formamide, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.025% xylene cyanol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue) and fractionated through denaturing 5% PAGE gels, which were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For δRz cleavage reactions, internally 32P-labeled SPC2 mRNA (50 nm) was mixed with δRz (1 μm) in a 10-μl mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2 and then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of loading buffer, electrophoresed on denaturing 5% PAGE gels, and analyzed with a radioanalytic scanner. Cell Culture and DNA Transfections—βTC-3 cells (insulinoma, mouse) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with low glucose concentration supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 40 mg/liter garamycin (Schering Canada Inc., Pointe-Claire, Québec, Canada) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE, as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and were then selected for resistance to hygromycin B (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 175 μg/ml. Primer Extension of tRNAVal-δRz and U6 RNA—Total RNA from βTC-3 was extracted with TriReagent (BioShop Canada Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada). The primers, corresponding to the 3′ complementary sequence of δRz and U6 RNA (5′-GGGTCCCTTAGCCATGCGCGAACG-3′ and 5′-GGCCATGCTAATCTTCTCTG-3′, respectively), have been 32P-labeled by the usual procedure and annealed to 10 μg of total RNA in a 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 80 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 by a 2-min incubation at 65 °C and immediately chilled on ice. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 0.8 mm of dNTPs, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, and Superscript™ Reverse Transcriptase (100 units; Invitrogen) in a final volume of 12 μl. The samples were incubated at 45 °C for 30 min, stopped by adding loading buffer, and fractionated on 10% denaturing PAGE and visualized with a PhosphorImager. Northern Blot Hybridizations—Northern blot analyses of total RNA (5 μg) extracted from βTC-3 cells, using guanidinium isothiocyanate followed by lithium chloride precipitation, were performed as described previously (4Vieau D. Seidah N.G. Day R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1187-1196Google Scholar). The cDNAs cloned for the pro-hormone convertase probes are as follows: a 1231-bp rat SPC1 (4Vieau D. Seidah N.G. Day R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1187-1196Google Scholar), a 350-bp mouse SPC2 (20Joshi D. Miller M.M. Seidah N.G. Day R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2721-2729Google Scholar), a 500-bp mouse SPC3 (20Joshi D. Miller M.M. Seidah N.G. Day R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2721-2729Google Scholar), and a 650-bp rat SPC7 (21Seidah N.G. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi M. Dong W. Tardos H. Mbikay M. Chretien M. Day R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3388-3393Google Scholar). The cDNAs cloned for the carboxypeptidase E (CPE; kindly provided by L. D. Fricker, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), the prodynorphin (pro-Dyn), and for the 18 S rRNA probes were a 400-bp rat CPE (22Fricker L.D. Adelman J.P. Douglass J. Thompson R.C. von Strandmann R.P. Hutton J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 666-673Google Scholar), a 733-bp rat pro-Dyn (4Vieau D. Seidah N.G. Day R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1187-1196Google Scholar), and a 600-bp bovine 18 S (3Day R. Schafer M.K. Watson S.J. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 485-497Google Scholar), respectively. Complementary RNA probes were transcribed from linearized plasmids with T3, T7, or SP6 RNA polymerases in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. All hybridizations were carried out for 16-18 h at 65 °C. The membranes were then exposed to x-ray films for 2-72 h. The densitometry analysis was carried out on digitized film using the image analysis software Scion Image 1.62c (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Electron Microscopy—Cell pellets were fixed for 20 min with 5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by another 30-min fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. After a wash with 0.2 m sodium cacodylate buffer, cells were treated for 1 h with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer. Samples were washed and incubated for 45 min in 0.25% uranyl acetate in 2.5% sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.3, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in epoxy resin. Thin sections were counterstained with a solution of 1% uranyl acetate and 6% lead citrate, pH 10. Western Blot Hybridizations—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein assay. Total protein extracts (15 μg) were fractionated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The antibody against mouse SPC2 was C-terminally directed (23Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Paquet L. Boudreault A. Lazure C. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 735-743Google Scholar), and the antibody against CPE was kindly provided by Dr. L. D. Fricker. Proteins were revealed using the ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray films. Reverse Phase-HPLC (RP-HPLC) Analysis and Radioimmunoassay (RIA)—βTC-3 cells (Four 80% confluent 100 × 20-mm dishes) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. The cell pellets were extracted with 300 μl of 50% methanol, 0.05 n HCl solution. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants (≈1.5 mg of proteins) were diluted in 10 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) initially primed with 10 ml of 100% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and then with 10 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution from the cartridge was achieved by the injection of 40% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (4 ml). All fractions were lyophilized and resuspended in 15% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before injection onto a 5-μm C18 column (25 × 0.46 cm; Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Samples were loaded at 15% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and separated using a 15-30% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid linear gradient in 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The standard peptide Dyn A-(1-8) (porcine; Peninsula Laboratories Inc., Belmont, CA) was used to determine the elution time. The RIA against Dyn A-(1-8) has been extensively characterized (4Vieau D. Seidah N.G. Day R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1187-1196Google Scholar, 24Day R. Lazure C. Basak A. Boudreault A. Limperis A. Dong W. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 829-836Google Scholar). Briefly, the Dyn A-(1-8) antibody is C-terminally targeted and does not cross-react with Dyn A-(1-17) or larger forms of pro-Dyn-derived peptides. Mass Spectrometry—For consecutive analyses with mass spectrometry new samples were prepared. The extraction procedures for the cell lines, and the HPLC separations were performed as described above except for the following modifications. All of the HPLC steps were performed on a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with a Beckman 168 photodiode array detector. Column effluent was monitored by UV absorption at 220 and 280 nm. The HPLC was performed with either an Ultrasphere C18 column or a Macherey Nagel (4.6 mm × 25 cm) column. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0-60% ACN in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) over 60 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions corresponding to absorbance peaks were collected, dried, reconstituted in water, and tested in dot immunobinding assays (DIA) with anti-Dyn antibodies. For the DIA, the HPLC-eluted fractions were freeze-dried before resuspending in 100 μl of water. One μl was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with Dyn antisera (1:1000). Bound antibodies were detected by ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For mass spectrometry, the samples were analyzed using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA) as matrix. A two-layer preparation was chosen for the MALDI experiments. Briefly, 1 μl of HCCA in acetone (15 mg/ml) was applied to the MALDI target. After evaporation and preparation of a ultrathin layer of matrix, 1 μl of protein sample was applied on the first layer, immediately followed by 1 μl of classical HCCA solution (10 mg in trifluoroacetic acid 0.1%, ACN 3:7, v/v) prior to drying at room temperature. Analyses were carried out on a Voyager STR (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) MALDI-time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with a N2 laser (2-ns pulse duration and 3-Hz repetition rate). Mass spectra were recorded in the positive linear mode using delayed extraction. Laser flux was set at a value just above the threshold for ion production. Calibration was realized with four external calibrants covering the mass range of interest (Substance P, ACTH(18-39), ACTH(7-38), and bovine insulin) prepared in the same way as the samples. Identification of Potential Target Sites—The selection of the RNA cleavage site is the initial step in designing a specific δRz. Due to unfavorable competition with intramolecular base pairing, target sequences located in single-stranded regions of an mRNA are potentially more accessible for δRz binding than those in double-stranded regions. In order to identify cleavage sites with the greatest potential for targeting, we adopted a procedure that combined both bioinformatic tools and biochemical assays (14Bergeron L.J. Perreault J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4682-4691Google Scholar). The first step was the prediction of the mRNA secondary structure using the RNA folding algorithm in the RNA Structure 3.5 software. Five virtually identical structures were obtained for the full-length SPC2 mRNA (data not shown). These structures were analyzed using the OligoWalk software, which provided the degree of accessibility of each 7-nt potential site (19Mathews D.H. Burkard M.E. Freier S.M. Wyatt J.R. Turner D.H. RNA (New York). 1999; 5: 1458-1469Google Scholar). The results were obtained for the full-length SPC2 mRNA; however, only the sites between positions 70 and 661, which is the highly variable sequence relative to the other SPCs (Fig. 1A), were considered. In this region, 94 sites appeared to be relatively accessible for the binding of RNA oligonucleotides. Subsequently, this collection of potential sites was analyzed for criteria known to be essential for efficient cleavage by a trans-acting antigenomic δRz (Fig. 1B). These criteria were based on the fact that the first pairing of the P1 stem must be a GU wobble bp and that the presence of a guanosine at the cleavage site (position -1) results in an uncleavable substrate (25Deschênes P. Lafontaine D.A. Charland S. Perreault J.P. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2000; 10: 53-61Google Scholar). Finally, analysis of the sequences indicated that no other cleavages could occur within the SPC gene family. Therefore, the eight chosen sequences were specific to SPC2 mRNA. In order to validate the bioinformatic predictions, biochemical assays were carried out in vitro on SPC2 partial mRNA corresponding to the targeted region (i.e. from residues 70 to 661). RNase H hydrolysis assays using 7-nt ODNs corresponding to the recognition domain of the δRz were performed. RNase H specifically cleaves the RNA of an RNA-DNA duplex. Hence, the enzyme can be used to verify whether or not the binding of an ODN did indeed take place (14Bergeron L.J. Perreault J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4682-4691Google Scholar). Randomly labeled partial SPC2 mRNA was pre-incubated with unlabeled ODNs, digested by RNase H, and analyzed on a PAGE gel (Fig. 2A). Cleavage was observed with all ODNs, although at different levels. Moreover, nonspecific cleavage was also observed with some ODNs (e.g. ODN-394). Subsequently, the eight δRz with appropriate recognition sequences were synthesized, and their ability to cleave the labeled SPC2 mRNA fragment was studied under single-turnover conditions ([Rz] > [S]) and analyzed on PAGE gel (Fig. 2B). Four δRz cleaved the target (i.e. δRz-134, -154, -232 and -394; where the numbers indicate the position cleaved on SPC2 mRNA), although with varying efficiencies. Moreover, this experiment revealed the superior specificity of δRz as compared with RNase H, because no minor products were observed. Among the δRz cleaving SPC2 partial mRNA, only the most efficient were retained for the subsequent cultured cells studies (i.e. δRz-154 and -394). Expression of tRNAVal-δRz Chimeric Constructions—A vector including a modified tRNAVal promoter was used for the cell culture expression studies (15Kato Y. Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Toda H. Taira K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15378-15385Google Scholar). Briefly, the tRNAVal cassette from pPUR-KE vector was subcloned in a pcDNA3.1/hygro vector producing ptRNAVal-δRz-SPC2-X (Fig. 3A). In order to avoid double transcript production in cells (i.e. by the CMV and tRNAVal promoters simultaneously), the CMV promoter in this plasmid was removed. The use of the tRNAVal promoter permitted the production of a large amount of the chimeric RNA by the host RNA pol III. In addition, it is well known that the tRNAVal motif directs the expressed δRz to the cytoplasm (15Kato Y. Kuwabara T. Warashina M. Toda H. Taira K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15378-15385Google Scholar), where it will hybridize to the targeted mRNA (Fig. 3B). Thus, the δRz-154 and -394 were placed under the control of the tRNAVal promoter in the expression vectors ptRNAVal-δRz-SPC2-154 and -394 and in their catalytically inactive equivalents ptRNAVal-δRzC47A-SPC2-154 and -394. The δRzC47A mutants are inactive versions in which the cytosine in position 47 was mutated for an adenosine (16Al-Anouti F. Ananvoranich S. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002; 12: 275-281Google Scholar). These δRz exhibited the same binding but are completely deprived of cleavage activity; therefore, they are ideal controls for antisense effect. An expression vector lacking the δRz-coding sequence (ptRNAVal-KE) was also used as a control. βTC-3 cells were then transfected with these five expression vectors. This mouse pancreatic tumoral cell line was chosen for several reasons including the fact that it is well characterized for expression of SPCs (including SPC2), and it is easy to grow and transfect (4Vieau D. Seidah N.G. Day R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1187-1196Google Scholar). Stable cell lines for each construction were established by the selection of clones resistant to hygromycin B. Both primer extension (Fig. 3C) and Northern blot analyses (data not shown) were used to evaluate the expression levels of the chimeric tRNAVal-δRz transcripts in 15 established cell lines for each construction. Expression levels in cell lines 154-2 and 394-1 were among the highest, whereas other cell lines (154-1 and 394-9) showed a weaker expression. The further analyses were performed on extracts from these five selected cell lines. Initially, total RNA extracts were subjected to Northern blot analysis of SPC2 mRNA (Fig. 4A). The levels of SPC2 mRNA in cell line 154 were drastically reduced in comparison to the two control cell lines KE and 154C47A. However, the level of SPC2 mRNA in cell line 394 was virtually similar to the ones found in the KE and 394C47A cell lines. Because all chimeric transcripts were detected in the cell lines tested, these results suggest that the cleavage site at position 394 may not be as accessible in vivo as it was in the in vitro assays on partial mRNA transcripts. The ratio obtained was transformed in relative SPC2 mRNA levels using the values from the KE cell line as a reference (i.e. 100%; Fig. 4A). This indicated that cell line 154 had no detectable SPC2 mRNA (≪1%), whereas the levels of SPC2 mRNA in the other cell lines were approximately of the same order. More generally, we observed that the concentration of δRz-154 expressed in a cell and the level of SPC2 mRNA cleavage detected increased proportionately. The specificity of cleavage of the δRz was examined by monitoring the mRNA levels of the three other SPCs expressed in βTC-3 cells (i.e. SPC1, SPC3, and SPC7) and the CPE mRNA (Fig. 4, B-E). The CPE enzyme is implicated in the trimming of the basic residue(s) located C-terminally of the newly processed proteins within the regulated secretory pathway (26Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Google Scholar). Small variations were observed among all cell lines. However, these changes could not be linked to the catalytic activity of δRz because they were not uniquely associated with cell lines 154 or 394; thus, they are probably due to transfection-induced stress. Despite these changes, these results confirmed that the cleavage activity observed on SPC2 mRNA was both strong and specific because the effect observed on SPC2 mRNA was not repeated on the other mRNAs tested. Moreover, electron microscopy confirmed that the endocrine phenotype was not altered in cells lacking SPC2 as secretory granules could be observed in both βTC-3 and 154 cell lines (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W1988028386,"Terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells follows a precisely orchestrated program of transcriptional regulatory events at the promoters of both lineage-specific and ubiquitous genes. Here we show that the transcription factor ATF2 is associated with the induction of granulocytic differentiation, and the molecular interaction of ATF2 with a tissue-specific coactivator activating signal cointegator-2 (ASC-2) potentiates the differentiation procedure. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) induced the phosphorylation and expression of ATF2 in the early and middle phase of granulocyte differentiation, respectively. The activation of granulocyte-specific gene expression is increased with the concerted action of another basic regionleucine zipper factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα), and ASC-2, which function in a cooperative manner. The interaction between ATF2 and C/EBPα in RA-treated cells was enhanced by the ectopic expression of ASC-2. ATF2-mediated transactivation was also increased by co-transfection of ASC-2. This resulted from the direct protein interaction that the N-terminal transactivation domain of ATF2 interacts with the central region of ASC-2. Furthermore, the molecular interaction of ATF2 and ASC-2 was stimulated by RA treatment and inhibited by p38β kinase inhibitor. Taking these results together, these results suggest that the differentiation-dependent expression and phosphorylation of ATF2 protein physically and functionally interacts with C/EBPα and coativator ASC-2 and synergizes to induce target gene transcription during granulocytic differentiation.

The pluripotent blood stem cells mature by transcription factors that activate lineage-specific genes that are essential to the commitment and development of specific hematopoietic lineages, erythroid, myeloid, or lymphoid cells (1Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vitamin A metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid, induces the granulocytic differentiation of the promyelocytic cell line U937, similar to HL60. C/EBPα,1 C/EBPϵ, PU.1, etc. have been known to contribute in granulopoiesis (2Yamanaka R. Lekstrom-Himes J. Barlow C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Xanthopoulos K.G. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar). In particular C/EBPα is essential to granulocyte differentiation in an early stage, and in vitro it forms a heterodimeric DNA-binding complex with another transcription factor of the basic region-leucine zipper family, ATF2 in liver cells (3Shuman J.D.

A common characteristic of these factors is the presence of a transcriptional activation domain containing the metal finger structure located in the N-terminal region and basic region-leucine zipper proteins in the C-terminal region (6Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATF2 is capable of forming homodimers or heterodimers with c-Jun for binding to cAMP-response element (CRE) (5′-TGACGTCA-3′) (6Matsuda S. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol.

Some cofactors, structural modification, and phosphorylation were known to influence the transcriptional activation of ATF2. For example, TIP49b was reported as a regulator of ATF2 response to stress and DNA damage (10Cho S.G. Bhoumik A. Broday L. Ivanov V. Rosenstein B. Ronai Z. Mol.

To stimulate transcriptional activity of specific transcription factors, the cooperative association of transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 was necessary. Previously, we determined that differentiation-dependent expressed ASC-2 protein physically and functionally interacts with C/EBPα and increases its transactivation activity in granulocyte differentiation (21Hong S.

ASC-2, a typical ligand- and AF2-dependent interactor of nuclear receptors, enhances the receptor transactivation, either alone or in conjunction with SRC-1 and CBP/p300, and functionally interacts with specific transcription factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, thyroid receptor, NF-κB, AP-1, and serum response factor (27Lee S-K.

To understand the process of normal myeloid differentiation, it is important to identify and characterize the transcription factors that specifically activate important genes in the myeloid lineage. Until now, evidence is wholly lacking that ATF2 is involved in hematopietic differentiation. However, we already reported that retinoic acid activates the p38β kinase pathway leading to phosphorylation and activation of ATF2, thereby enhancing PEPCK gene transcription and glucose production (20Lee M.Y. Jung C.H. Lee K. Choi Y.H. Hong S. Cheong J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3400-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, this reflects the indirect evidence that ATF2 may be related in granulocyte differentiation. In this study, we show two novel points that ATF2 is required for the induction of granulocytic differentiation and associates with granulocyte-specific transcription factor C/EBPα by retinoic acid (RA) treatment and that the ASC-2 functions as a coactivator for ATF2 in the differentiation process. These results support that the granulocytic differentiation requires a specific transcription factor-regulated cascade action including a variety of specific transcription factors and coactivators. U937 Cell Culture and Induction of Differentiation—U937 promyelocytic leukemia cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin 100 units/ml, and streptomycin 100 μg/ml (Invitrogen). To induce granulocyte differentiation, the cells in logarithmic growth were seeded at 2 × 105/ml and grown in the presence of 1 μm all-trans RA for up to 4 days. At the end of differentiation experiments, differentiated cells were confirmed with nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay, harvested, and resuspended in an appropriate buffer for each experiments. Reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium by respiratory burst products was assayed with nitro blue tetrazolium tablets (Sigma) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols. Cells were cytospun and counterstained with safranin. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested on ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 1× protease inhibitor at 4 °C. The protein content of cell lysates was determined with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. After heating at 100 °C for 5 min in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, the samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The resulting gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P) membrane (Millipore). For Western blotting, the membrane was incubated with anti-phospho-ATF2 (New England Biolabs), anti-ATF2, anti-TATA-binding protein, anti-C/EBPα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Mac-1 (Caltag) in TBS containing 1% non-fat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with cold TBS-T (TBS containing 0.04% Tween 20), the blotted membranes incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times with cold TBS-T, the protein bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the recommended procedure (Amersham Biosciences). Transient and Stable Transfection—HeLa and U937 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotics. The cells were seeded in 24-well plates with growth medium and cotransfected with pRSV/β-galactosidase vector and expression vectors for ASC-2 and/or ATF2 by using Superfect (Qiagen) or electroporation. Total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding pcDNA3.1/His C. Relative luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 5th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2002: 9-32Google Scholar). All the transfection results represent the mean of three independent experiments. For establishment of the N-terminal domain ATF2 (ATF2-N)-expressing stable cell line, HeLa cells were transfected with 3 μg of ATF2-N expression plasmid (pcDNA3/hemagglutinin) using calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with BES. At 48 h after transfection, cells were cultured in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After 21 days in selective medium, individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assay between ASC-2 and ATF2—GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously. Equal amounts (∼1 mg) of GST and several GST-ATF2 proteins (1–323, 1–352, 323–352, 323–492, 1–492) immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]ASC-2 in the reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5% bovine serum albumin) for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, the bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione and boiled with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 100 °C for 3 min prior to electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and analyzed with the Molecular Imager Fx (Bio-Rad). Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay between ASC-2 and C/EBP α and ATF2—CV-1 and HeLa Cells were seeded in 24-well plates with growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics and co-transfected with expression vectors encoding Gal4-DNA-binding domain fusions (pCMX/Gal4N/-, pCMX/Gal4N-ASC-2 series) and VP16-activation domain fusions (pCMX/VP16/-, pCMX/VP16-C/EBP α, or pCMX/VP16-ATF2) as well as the previously described Gal4-tk-luc reporter plasmid. After 48 h, cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase expression. All the results represent the average of at least three independent experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Cell lysates (500 μg) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-ATF2 antibody at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation. Immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen). After washing three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (–) buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline), the precipitates were boiled with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C for 3 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Cells were lysed for 5 min in L1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Nuclei were pelleted at 3000 rpm and resuspended in L2 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA). Chromatin was sheared by sonication, centrifuged, and diluted 10 times in dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Extracts were precleared for 3 h with 60 μl of a 50% suspension of salmon sperm-saturated protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected with salmon sperm-saturated protein A for 30 min and washed three times (5 min each) with high-salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m NaCl) followed by three washes in no salt buffer (1× Tris/EDTA buffer). Immunocomplexes were extracted in 1× Tris/EDTA buffer containing 2% SDS, and protein-DNA cross-links were reverted by heating at 65 °C overnight. After proteinase K digestion, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated in ethanol. About one-twentieth of the immunoprecipitated DNA was used in each PCR. Quantitative duplex PCR assay was performed to analyze the amount of DNA precipitated by specified antibodies in proportion to input DNA. Two pairs of primers were used: forward (5′-TTGGGCGGGTTGCAGCAGGCA-3′) and reverse (5′-GTCTGTATTCATGATTCTTC-3′) for the G-CSF promoter. The PCR conditions were as follows: 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences), 100 ng of each primer, 200 μm dNTP, 2.5 μl of 10× Taq buffer, and double-distilled water to a final volume of 25 μl. The cycles were as follows: 94 °C for 180 s; 34 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 60 s and 72 °C for 60 s; final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. Protein Expression of ATF2 Is Induced by Exposure to RA in U937 Cells—Human U937 cells undergo differentiation in response to RA and have a commitment of mature granulocytic cells, suggesting that granulocytic differentiation of U937 cells may also require responsivenesses against distinct transcription factors by RA signaling. It is known that C/EBPα is expressed during early granulocytic differentiation induced by RA exposure. In addition to this, our previous two different results showed that C/EBPα physically and functionally interacts with ATF2 in vitro and in vivo in liver cells (3Shuman J.D. Cheong J. Coligan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12793-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The other finding is that RA increased ATF2-driven transactivation by inducing the phosphorylation and inhibiting the intramolecular interaction of ATF2 itself, although HepG2 cells were used (20Lee M.Y. Jung C.H. Lee K. Choi Y.H. Hong S. Cheong J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3400-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to examine whether ATF2 acts on RA-induced granulocytic differentiation of U937 cells. From the result of Fig. 1, the protein expression level of ATF2 was examined with Western blot analysis by using antibody against the full-length ATF2 during the granulocytic differentiation of U937 cells by exposure to RA. The protein expression of ATF2 was very low in untreated U937 cells, almost at a background level, but its expression was gradually induced after RA treatment. The time course study showed that the induction of ATF2 was detectable on day 2, and the level was slightly increased until day 4. Therefore, it can be considered that ATF2 is one of the markers for granulocytic differentiation. The level of C/EBPα protein was increased at early times after RA treatment, although C/EBPα is highly expressed and transcriptionally active in untreated U937 cells. Consistent with the finding of ASC-2 in blood cells (25Zhu Y. Kan L. Qi C. Kanwar Y.S. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13510-13516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the protein expression of ASC-2 here may provide a clue for a functional role in granulocytic differentiation. ASC-2 Functions as a Coactivator for ATF2-dependent Transactivation of Granulocyte-specific Gene Expression—Previously, we presented the conclusion that the coactivator ASC-2 specifically interacts with C/EBPα during granulocytic differentiation and was also known to induce the protein expression during the granulocytic differentiation. In addition to these results, the quantitative changes of ATF2 protein were observed in Fig. 1. Taken together, these results prompted us to examine whether ASC-2 functionally helps the transactivation activity with ATF2. First, the transactivation of ASC-2 on ATF2-mediated transactivation was examined. Second, ASC-2 increased the transactivation of ATF2 synergistically in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). As the stimulatory effects of RA are specific to the onset of the differentiation program, we examined the effect of RA treatment and expression of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) in the differentiation cascade, and the ability of the ATF2 to influence transcription from extended regions of G-CSFR promoters was assessed directly in transient transfection assays (Fig. 2B). In U937 cells, ATF2 and a combination of ATF2- and ASC-2 induced gene expression from the G-CSFR promoter between 3- and 11-fold (Fig. 2B). By contrast, c-Jun failed completely to activate transcription from the G-CSFR promoter. RA treatment had only a modest stimulatory effect on basal transcription from the G-CSFR promoter but a significant additional effect on expression induced by ATF2. In the presence of ATF2 and a combination of ATF2 and ASC-2, RA treatment enhanced expression from the G-CSFR promoter 22-fold while enhancing expression dependent on ATF2 alone a more modest 10-fold. Identification of the Protein-Protein Interaction of ATF2 and ASC-2 and Each Interacting Region—The association between ATF2 and ASC-2 was characterized by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. ATF2 was immunoprecipitated from freshly prepared RA-treated U937 cells, gel-fractionated, and analyzed for ASC-2 coprecipitation by Western blotting with anti-ASC-2 IgG. As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous ASC-2 was detected as a coprecipitant in ATF2 immunoprecipitates. A parallel immunoprecipitated formed with preimmune serum failed to sow ASC-2 immunoreactivity. This result suggests that ASC-2 can stimulate the ATF2 transactivation through direct protein-protein interaction. To further characterize the interacting region of ATF2 against ASC-2 in vitro, GST pull-down assay was performed. GST fusion proteins encoding the full-length, 1–323 amino acids, and 323–492 amino acids of ATF2 were expressed in Escherichia coli, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and incubated with 35S-labeled full-length ASC-2 produced by an in vitro translation system. The N-terminal-containing transactivation domain of ATF2 interacts with ASC-2 protein (Fig. 3B). The reciprocal strategy was used to delineate the region of ASC-2 required for interaction with ATF2 using the mammalian two-hybrid assay. For this study, Gal4-ASC-2 and VP16-ATF2 expression vectors were transfected into U937 cells. The 849–1057 region of ASC-2 including LXXLL the motif was interacted with ATF2 (Fig. 3C), similarly to the region bound by another transcription factor. As shown by a mammalian two-hybrid assay and GST pull-down assay, the central domain of ASC-2 specifically interacts with the N-terminal transactivation domain of ATF2. The Coactivator ASC-2 Enforces the Interaction between ATF2 and C/EBP a—From the previous results, ATF2 and C/EBPα associate with ASC-2 in the process of granulocytic differentiation and interact with each other. These results prompted us to examine whether the temporal expression of ASC-2 affects the intermolecular interaction of ATF2 and C/EBPα in U937 cells. For this, in the absence or presence of ASC-2 transfection, the mammalian expression plasmids for ATF2 and C/EBPα were ectopically expressed in U937 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, ASC-2 expression significantly increased the protein interaction of ATF2 and C/EBPα. In addition to these, we already observed that the 849–1057 region of ASC-2 interacts with ATF2 in Fig. 3C and that the 392–930 region of ASC-2 interacts with C/EBPα (data not shown). Next, we examined the dominant negative function of the 849–1057 domain or the 392–930 domain of ASC-2 in the interaction between ATF2 and C/EBPα. As shown by a mammalian two-hybrid assay, ASC-2 increased the interaction of ATF2 and C/EBPα (Fig. 4A, lane 5) and the 849–1057 region of ASC-2, the binding region to ATF2, or the 392–930 region of ASC-2, the binding region of C/EBPα, inhibited the interaction as a dominant negative mutant (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7). These results support that the coactivator ASC-2 specifically enforces the interaction between ATF2 and C/EBPα. To further confirm that ASC-2 induces a functional transcriptional protein complex with ATF2 and C/EBPα at the granulocytic target gene promoter site, it was addressed whether these factors interact and are assembled on promoters in cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with endogenous G-CSFR promoters as well as endogenous transcription factor proteins. After RA treatment, cells were lysed, and solubilized chromatin was immunoprecipitated, initially with antibodies against Myo-D ATF2, C/EBPα, or ASC-2, and recovered DNAs were amplified by PCR using promoter-specific primers. It is clear from the data in Fig. 4B that ASC-2 recruitment to the -ATF2 and C/EBPα-recognized promoter was confirmed in cells but not by Myo-D. Collectively, these findings support the notion that RA-induced differentiation controls the recruitment of essential components of the transcriptional activation machinery and consequently the efficiency of ATF2-dependent transcriptional activation of G-CSFR, which is one of the granulopoietic genes. RA Potentiates the Physical Association of ATF2 and C/EBPα in Granulocytic Differentiation—The results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the temporally increased coactivator increases the association of ATF2 and C/EBPα. The ASC-2 expression was induced in the process of RA-dependent granulocytic differentiation (Fig. 1). To investigate the possibility that the differentiation inducer, RA, regulates the similar increased protein association of ATF2 and C/EBPα as shown in ASC-2 expression, the same experimental strategy was applied with RA treatment. The synergistic transactivation effect of RA on ATF2 and C/EBPα transactivation prompted us to examine the direct effect on the protein-protein interaction of ATF2 and C/EBPα by RA. To identify the possibility, we applied the mammalian two-hybrid assay with the cognate ATF2 and C/EBPα constructs (Fig. 5). The physical interaction of ATF2 and C/EBPα was increased considerably by the treatment of 1 μm RA, but not Me2SO, as a vehicle. ATF2 and p38β Kinase Are Phosphorylated by RA during Granulocytic Differentiation—p38β kinase activity is high during the initial stages of differentiation but drastically lower as the U937 leukemic cells undergo terminal differentiation into granulocytes. To identify the phosphorylation control of ATF2 in differentiation, we applied the appearance of phosphorylated ATF2 protein after induction of granulocyte differentiation. The ability to stimulate ATF2 phosphorylation with differentiation-inducing agents clearly points to a role for ATF2 in granulopoiesis. The degree of phosphorylation of ATF2 by p38β kinase, which displayed earlier than the protein expression of ATF2, increased up to 4-fold (Fig. 6). To confirm these results further, the effect of the specific inhibitor of p38β, the pyridinyl imidazole derivative SB203580, on the granulocyte differentiation-induced phosphorylation of ATF2 was examined. Since the SB203580 treatment almost blocked the differentiation procedure, it was not detected in the phosphorylated ATF2 protein dependent on the differentiation (data not shown). To further confirm that p38β kinase activation is involved in the RA response, we assayed for the activation of p38β kinase itself by phosphorylation of the kinase following RA treatment. Total cell extracts were prepared at the times indicated and assayed for expression and phosphorylation of p38β kinase. As shown in Fig. 6, although p38β kinase expression levels do not change, its phosphorylation state increased from 1 day after RA treatment. This time course correlates with the phosphorylation of ATF2 as shown in Fig. 6. Hence, these data provide direct evidence that RA stimulation leads to p38β kinase activation and ATF2 phosphorylation, potentiating the transactivation activity of ATF2.

https://openalex.org/W2082542131,"Serine 171 in the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit is highly conserved in the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. In this paper, we report that mutating serine 171 within γ2 to glycine or cysteine prevents the interaction of γ2 with α2 and β1 when these subunits are co-expressed in human embryo kidney 293 cells, resulting in intracellular retention of γ2. Structure analysis based on a three-dimensional homology model of γ2 (Ernst, M., Brauchart, D., Boresch, S., and Sieghart, W. (2003) Neuroscience 119, 933-943) reveals that serine 171 may play a critical role in the formation and stabilization of an exposed turn structure that is part of the subunit interaction site. Mutation of serine 171 in the γ2 subunit could therefore result in alteration of the structure of the subunit interaction site, preventing correct subunit assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2123459281,"S100B binds tightly to a 12-amino acid peptide derived from heterodimeric capping protein. In native intact capping protein, this sequence is in the C terminus of the α-subunit, which is important for capping the actin filament. This C-terminal region is proposed to act as a flexible “tentacle,” extending away from the body of capping protein in order to bind actin. To this hypothesis, we analyzed the interaction between S100B and capping protein in solution. The C-terminal 28 amino acids of the α-subunit, the proposed tentacle, bound to S100B as a free synthetic peptide or a glutathione S-transferase fusion (Kd ∼0.4-1 μm). In contrast, S100B did not bind to whole native capping protein or functionally affect its capping activity. S100B does not bind, with any significant affinity, to the proposed α-tentacle sequence of whole native capping protein in solution. In the NMR structure of S100B complexed with the α-subunit-derived 12-amino acid peptide, the hydrophobic side of a short α-helix in the peptide, containing an important tryptophan residue, contacts S100B. In the x-ray structure of native capping protein, the corresponding sequence of the α-subunit C terminus, including Trp271, interacts closely with the body of the protein. Therefore, our results suggest the α-subunit C terminus is not mobile as predicted by the tentacle model. Addition of non-ionic detergent allowed whole capping protein to bind weakly to S100B, indicating that the α-subunit C terminus can be mobilized from the surface of the capping protein molecule, presumably by weakening the hydrophobic binding at the contact site. S100B binds tightly to a 12-amino acid peptide derived from heterodimeric capping protein.

In the NMR structure of S100B complexed with the α-subunit-derived 12-amino acid peptide, the hydrophobic side of a short α-helix in the peptide, containing an important tryptophan residue, contacts S100B. In the x-ray structure of native capping protein, the corresponding sequence of the α-subunit C terminus, including Trp271, interacts closely with the body of the protein. Therefore, our results suggest the α-subunit C terminus is not mobile as predicted by the tentacle model. Addition of non-ionic detergent allowed whole capping protein to bind weakly to S100B, indicating that the α-subunit C terminus can be mobilized from the surface of the capping protein molecule, presumably by weakening the hydrophobic binding at the contact site. Capping protein (CP) 1The abbreviations used are: CP, capping protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; SAS, spectrin-F-actin seeds; a.u., arbitrary units. 1The abbreviations used are: CP, capping protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; SAS, spectrin-F-actin seeds; a.u., arbitrary units. is an α/β heterodimer that tightly caps (Kd ∼0.1-1 nm) the barbed end of the actin filament, preventing actin subunit addition and loss (reviewed in Ref. 1Cooper J.A.

CP is important for actin assembly and actin-based motility in vivo in Dictyostelium (2Hug C. Jay P.Y. Reddy I. McNally J.G. Bridgman P.C. Elson E.L. Cooper J.A.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 61-70Google Scholar, 7Hart M.C. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1287-1298Google Scholar). In Drosophila, CP is essential for early development, morphogenesis, and actin organization (8Hopmann R. Cooper J.A. Miller K.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1293-1305Google Scholar, 9Rogers S.L. Wiedemann U. Stuurman N. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1079-1088Google Scholar). CP is also an essential component of the dendritic nucleation model to account for actin polymerization and protrusion at the leading edge of cells (reviewed in Ref. 10Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of CP inspired a model where the C termini (∼30 amino acids) of the α- and β-subunits of CP are mobile extensions, “tentacles,” and these regions are responsible for high affinity binding to, and functional capping of, the barbed end (11Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1529-1538Google Scholar). We tested one feature of the tentacle model with recombinant mutant chicken (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar) and budding yeast CPs (13Kim K. Yamashita A. Wear M.A. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 567-580Google Scholar). Loss of both tentacles causes a complete loss of capping activity, with the α-tentacle contributing much more to capping affinity and kinetics. Loss of the α-tentacle reduces the capping affinity by 5,000-fold and the capping on-rate by 20-fold in chicken CP (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar). In contrast, removal of the β-tentacle reduced the affinity by only 300-fold with no effect on the capping on-rate (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar). Qualitatively similar results were observed with budding yeast CP (13Kim K. Yamashita A. Wear M.A. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 567-580Google Scholar). Furthermore, the chicken β1-tentacle alone was sufficient to cap (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar). Thus, CP appears to use its two C-terminal regions as independent actin-binding sites to cap the barbed end, and the individual C termini may interact with more than one actin subunit at a subunit interface at the barbed end (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar). Another feature of the tentacle model is that in solution the C termini of both subunits are mobile and flexible extensions. In the x-ray structure the C terminus of CPβ protrudes away from the body of the protein, making no close contacts. The C terminus of CPα, however, is folded down, in close contact with the top surface of the body of the protein. Trp271 of the C-terminal region is oriented downwards, making hydrophobic contacts with the body of the heterodimer (11Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1529-1538Google Scholar). An important question is whether the C-terminal region of CPα is mobile and flexible, functioning as a tentacle, or whether the x-ray structure is representative of the structure in solution. We were able to test this hypothesis because S100B was found to bind to Trp271 in a peptide derived from the CPα C terminus. S100B is a 21.5-kDa symmetric homodimer, and a Ca2+-dependent conformational change is required to enable it to bind its target proteins, often substrates of kinase-dependent phosphorylation reactions (14Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Google Scholar, 15Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2729-2740Google Scholar, 16Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Google Scholar, 19Heizmann C.W. Fritz G. Schafer B.W. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1356-1368Google Scholar). A consensus binding sequence for S100B was identified as (K/R)(L/I)XWXXIL by phage display screening (20Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of human CPα (both α1 and α2 isoforms have identical sequences over the last 52 C-terminal residues) contains this consensus sequence. A 12-residue peptide termed TRTK-12 (TRTKIDWNKILS, corresponding to residues Thr265-Ser276 of CPα) was found to bind tightly (Kd ∼0.2-1 μm) to S100B (20Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Google Scholar, 21Barber K.R. McClintock K.A. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Dimlich R.V. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1502-1508Google Scholar). In an NMR solution structure of TRTK-12 bound to S100B, hydrophobic residues of an amphipathic α-helix in TRTK-12 make contact with a hydrophobic binding pocket in S100B (22Inman K.G. Yang R. Rustandi R.R. Miller K.E. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 1003-1014Google Scholar). Trp7 of TRTK-12, which corresponds to Trp271 of CPα, is a central component of the hydrophobic interaction. In the x-ray crystal structure of chicken CP(α1β1) the majority of the corresponding residues in the α-subunit, Trp271-Leu275, are also found in an amphipathic α-helix (11Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1529-1538Google Scholar). The hydrophobic surface of that α-helix contacts the body of CP, and Trp271 is a critical residue of the hydrophobic contact. We were able to test the tentacle model by asking whether the C-terminal region of CPα was sufficiently extended and mobile for S100B to bind to it. If this region is not mobile and remains down on the surface of CP, with the Trp271 occluded from the solution, then S100B should not be able to bind to whole native CP. A further motivation for testing the interaction of S100B with native CP is that the α C terminus is very important for the capping interaction and a protein, in this case S100B, that interacts with this region is likely to inhibit the activity of CP. This idea has been proposed as a mechanism for regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in vivo by S100 proteins (20Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Google Scholar, 23Ivanenkov V.V. Dimlich R.V.W. Jamieson G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 46-50Google Scholar). To test the tentacle model, we analyzed the interaction between recombinant S100B and CP in solution. No binding was observed. S100B also had no effect on the ability of CP to cap the actin filament barbed end in functional assays. In contrast, the isolated α-tentacle sequence (the C-terminal 28 amino acids) bound S100B with high affinity (Kd ∼0.4-1 μm). The proposed α-tentacle sequence can be induced to move off the surface of the protein, by non-ionic detergent, and then S100B can bind to it and inhibit the actin binding activity of CP. The data suggest that S100B does not bind, at least with any significant affinity, to the α-tentacle of whole native CP in solution. The α-tentacle sequence appears to be relatively immobile in solution, confined to the surface of the protein. Molecular Modeling—To generate a model for a putative CP-S100B structure, we made use of a separate molecular dynamics trajectory previously performed for the α C-terminal sequence (Arg259-Tyr277) of CP. 3D. Sept (Washington University), unpublished results. We selected an extended conformation from this trajectory and fit that conformation to the rest of the CP structure (11Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1529-1538Google Scholar) by using the backbone atoms of Arg259 and Arg260 in the α-subunit, giving us a structure where the α-tentacle was lifted off and extended away from the surface of the protein body. The S100B-TRTK-12 NMR structure (22Inman K.G. Yang R. Rustandi R.R. Miller K.E. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 1003-1014Google Scholar) was then superimposed onto the extended α-tentacle using the 12-amino acid stretch corresponding to the TRTK-12 peptide (CPα residues Thr265-Ser276). This complex was then energy-minimized to remove any atomic clashes. Protein Purification—The bacterial expression vector for rat S100B (pET-11b/S100B) was a kind gift from Dr. D. Weber (24Amburgey J.C. Abildgaard F. Starich M.R. Shah S. Hilt D.C. Weber D.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 171-179Google Scholar). Rat S100B was expressed and purified to homogeneity from BL21 Star™ (DE3) Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) as described (25Van Eldik L.J. Staecker J.L. Winningham-Major F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7830-7837Google Scholar), with minor modifications. A tandem CP bacterial expression vector (pET-3d/CPαβ), allowing for co-translation of chicken α1- and β1-subunits from a single plasmid, was a kind gift from Dr. T. Obinata (26Soeno Y. Abe H. Kimura S. Maruyama K. Obinata T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 639-646Google Scholar). CP was expressed and purified to homogeneity from BL21 Star™ (DE3) E. coli (Invitrogen), as described (27Palmgren S. Ojala P.J. Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 251-260Google Scholar). The plasmid pET-3d/CPα(ΔC28)β, encoding an α C-terminal 28-amino acid deletion mutant (codon Arg259 to a stop), was constructed, and the protein was expressed and purified as described (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar). Plasmids for expression of the C-terminal 28 amino acids of CPα (Arg259-Ala286; pGEX-KG/αC28) and the C-terminal 34 amino acids of CPβ1 (Arg244-Asn277; pGEX-KG/βC34) as GST fusion proteins were constructed as described (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar). GST fusions were purified with glutathione-agarose by standard protocols. The synthetic peptides αC28 and βC34 corresponding to the C-terminal 28 amino acids from chicken α (RRQLPVTRTKIDWNKILSYKIGKEMQNA) and the C-terminal 34 amino acids from chicken β1 (RSIDAIPDNQKYKQLQRELSQVLTQRQIYIQPDN), respectively, were obtained from commercial sources (Biomolecules Midwest Inc., Waterloo, IL) as described (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by A280, using the following extinction coefficients: CP(α1β1), 78,450 m-1 cm-1; CPα(ΔC28)β, 71,480 m-1 cm-1; GST-αC28, 47,590 m-1 cm-1; GST-βC34, 43,480 m-1 cm-1; αC28 peptide, 6,970 m-1 cm-1; βC34 peptide, 2,560 m-1 cm-1; rat S100B, 1,400 m-1 cm-1. αC28 Peptide Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra for the αC28 peptide, which contains a single tryptophan residue corresponding to Trp271 in CPα, were obtained on a PTI Quantmaster™ spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Santa Clara, CA), in a 2.5-ml cuvette at 25 °C. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 259 nm (1 nm bandpass), and emission was scanned from 305 to 450 nm (5 nm bandpass). Titration of αC28 peptide with rat S100B, which contains no tryptophan residues, was followed by monitoring the fluorescence enhancement (ΔF) at 334 nm. 0.12 μm αC28 peptide was incubated in the absence or presence of rat S100B in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 2 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm DTT, or the same buffer minus calcium, for 1 h at 25 °C, and the emission spectra were measured. Each spectrum was obtained from a separate incubation mixture, not sequential additions of S100B to the same sample of αC28 peptide. The ΔF at 334 nm was calculated using Equation 1. ΔF=(FαC28+S100B-FαC28)-(FS100B+Fbuffer)(Eq. 1) where ΔF is the difference between the intrinsic fluorescence of the αC28 peptide alone (FαC28) and the αC28 peptide in the presence of rat S100B (FαC28+S100B), background buffer, and S100B subtracted (FS100B + Fbuffer). We assumed the ΔF at 334 nm is proportional to the concentration of S100B-αC28 peptide complex. ΔF was plotted versus the total concentration of S100B. The data were least squares fit to Equation 2, using Kaleidagraph version 3.6 software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), ΔF=c×{(Kd+[αC28]+[S100B])-((Kd+[αC28]+[S100B])2-(4×[αC28]×[S100B]))}/2(Eq. 2) where ΔF is the fluorescence enhancement at 334 nm (in arbitrary units, a.u.); [αC28] is the αC28 peptide concentration; [S100B] is the rat S100B concentration; Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant; and c is a proportionality constant. Binding Assays by Supernatant Depletion—A fixed concentration of rat S100B (2.5 or 0.7 μm) was incubated alone or with increasing concentrations of either GST-αC28 or GST-βC34 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B FF beads, αC28 peptide, or βC34 peptide coupled to Affi-Gel® 10 (Bio-Rad), or CP(α1β1) coupled to Affi-Gel® 15 (Bio-Rad), for 10 min at 25 °C. Samples were incubated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 2 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3, or the same buffer minus Ca2+. The samples were then spun at 13,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the beads and any bound proteins. 30-50-μl samples of the supernatant were loaded onto 15-20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE gels. The amount of S100B present in the supernatant was calculated by densitometry of wet gels from analyzed using NIH Image software. Bound S100B was plotted versus the total bead-coupled ligand concentration and least squares fit to Equation 3, using Kaleidagraph version 3.6 software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), [S100B]bound={(Kd+[S100B]+[resin-coupledligand])-((Kd+[S100B]+[resin-coupledligand])2-(4×[S100B]×[resin-coupledligand]))}/2(Eq. 3) where [S100B]bound is the amount of rat S100B bound in complex with the bead-coupled ligand; [resin-coupled ligand] is the concentration of either GST-αC28 or GST-βC34 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose, αC28 peptide, or βC34 peptide coupled to Affi-Gel® 10, or CP(α1β1) coupled to Affi-Gel® 15; [S100B] is the rat S100B concentration; and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The amount of S100B bound to the beads was calculated using the equation, [S100B]bound = [S100B]total - [S100B]S/N - [nonspecific binding]. The amount of S100B trapped non-specifically by the resin was ∼4-9% for all experiments. Competition Binding Assays—Fixed concentrations of rat S100B (0.5 μm) were incubated with 1 μm GST-αC28 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B FF beads, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations free αC28 peptide or whole heterodimeric CP, for 10 min at 25 °C. Samples were incubated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 2 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3. The samples were then spun at 13,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the resin and any bound proteins. 50-μl samples of the pellet fraction were loaded onto 15-20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE gels. The amount of S100B bound to GST-αC28 was calculated by densitometry of wet gels analyzed using NIH Image software. GST-αC28 bound S100B was plotted versus the total αC28 peptide or CP(α1β1) concentration. The amount of S100B bound to the beads was corrected for nonspecific binding, ∼4-9% for all experiments. Spectrin-F-Actin Seeded (SAS) Actin Polymerization Assay—Proteins were prepared and assays performed essentially as described (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Mg2+-ATP-actin was used at a final concentration of 2 μm (3-10% pyrene-labeled) with final buffer conditions of either 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0; 100 mm NaCl; 3 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 0.2 mm ATP; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3, for calcium containing conditions (2 mm free Ca2+), or 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0; 100 mm NaCl; 0.2 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 0.2 mm ATP; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3, for non-calcium containing conditions (7 nm free Ca2+). CP and S100B were added to the actin followed by addition of a 1/20th volume of 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.0; 2 m NaCl; 20 mm MgCl2; 20 mm EGTA; plus or minus 60 mm CaCl2, and finally addition of SAS. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using “EGTA” software (PM Smith, The University of Liverpool, UK; www.liv.ac.uk/luds/people/cds/bds/pms/cal.htm/). Kinetic Modeling—The kinetic mechanism used for the modeling of rate constants for the interaction between S100B and CP is indicated below. Rate constants were determined by least squares minimization fitting of the data using the Berkeley Madonna package, version 8.01 (URL www.BerkeleyMadonna.com). For Reactions 1, Reactions 2, Reactions 3, A is the actin monomer concentration; Nb is the concentration of barbed ends (equal at the start to the concentration of SAS added and equivalent to the filament number); CP is the capping protein concentration; and S100 is the concentration of rat S100B. A+Nb↔Nbk+b;k-bReactions 1 CP+Nb↔CPNbk+cap;k-capReactions 2 S100+CP↔S100CPk+S100;k-S100Reactions 3 The concentration of SAS was determined by fitting the experimental data for seeded polymerization of actin alone (Reaction 1), with k+b and k-b of 11.6 μm-1 s-1 and 1.4 s-1, respectively (28Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Google Scholar). Actin polymerization was unaffected by addition of 1.4% Triton X-100. Addition of 1% Triton X-100 had no effect on the activity of CP. 1.4% Triton X-100 had a small reproducible effect on CP activity; the on- and off-rate constants of Reaction 2 were 2.1 μm-1 s-1 and 3.8 × 10-4 s-1 compared with 5.8 μm-1 s-1 and 5.6 × 10-4 s-1 in the absence of Triton X-100. These rate constants were determined by using a range of CP concentrations as described previously (12Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Google Scholar). The on- and off-rate constants for the interaction between S100 and CP (Reaction 3), k+S100 and k-S100, respectively, were determined from SAS-seeded actin polymerization assays in the presence of CP and 1.4% Triton X-100. The mechanism assumes no pointed end growth from the SAS, which we confirmed by determining that no actin polymerization occurred over 1000 s with SAS and 24 nm cytochalasin D. The contribution of spontaneous nucleation by actin monomers to these assays was so small as to be negligible. Critical Concentration Assays—The critical concentration for polymerization of actin and the equilibrium dissociation constant for capping of the barbed end (Kcap) were measured essentially as described (29Walsh T.P. Wever A. Higgins J. Bonder E.M. Mooseker M.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2613-2621Google Scholar, 30Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 793-799Google Scholar). Mg2+-ATP actin at 30 μm (3-9% pyrene-labeled) was polymerized in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 1 mm MgCl2; 0.2 mm ATP; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3, for 2 h at 25 °C. Actin was then diluted to a final concentration of 2 μm with final buffer conditions of either 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 3 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 0.2 mm ATP; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3, for calcium containing conditions (2 mm free Ca2+), or 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 0.2 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 0.2 mm ATP; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3, for non-calcium containing conditions (7 nm free Ca2+). CP alone or CP pre-incubated with S100B (at the indicated final concentrations), for 1 h at 25 °C in the respective buffer, were added, the mixture was incubated overnight at 25 °C and the fluorescence intensity recorded. Actin Filament Sedimentation Assays—Actin at 5 μm was polymerized in the absence or presence of 0.9 μm CP, 48 μm S100B, or both in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 3 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 0.2 mm ATP; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3 (2 mm free Ca2+), in a total volume of 100 μl. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 5 h. The polymerized mixture was then carefully placed onto a 10% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 90,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100.1 rotor for 30 min at 25 °C. 25 μl of the supernatant was removed from the meniscus and added to 25 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The remaining liquid was removed, avoiding the pellet, and the pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer. Equal loading volumes of the supernatant and pellets fractions were analyzed on 10-20% acrylamide Tricine-SDS-PAGE gels. Protein amounts were calculated by densitometry of wet gels stained with Coomassie Blue using NIH Image software. Non-denaturing PAGE—Native-PAGE was performed essentially as described (31Safer D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 32-37Google Scholar, 32Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 251-256Google Scholar), with minor modifications. CP alone, S100B alone, or mixtures of both (at the indicated concentrations) were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 1 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3, plus or minus 2 mm CaCl2. Gels (7% acrylamide) were run for 35 min at 200 V in 25 mm Tris; 194 mm glycine, pH 9.0; 0.5 mm DTT; minus or plus 2 mm CaCl2. In the absence of Ca2+, S100B migrates primarily as a smear, whereas in the presence of Ca2+ it migrates as a distinct focused band. This difference can be reconciled with the conformational changes that occur in S100 proteins upon Ca2+ binding (14Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Google Scholar, 15Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2729-2740Google Scholar, 16Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S. Kai Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 233-241Google Scholar, 22Inman K.G. Yang R. Rustandi R.R. Miller K.E. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 1003-1014Google Scholar). This structural rearrangement changes the charge distribution of the S100B homodimer and, in addition to the change in native charge that likely occur upon binding the Ca2+ ions themselves, is undoubtedly the cause of the differing electrophoretic characteristics observed. Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—200-μl samples of whole CP alone, S100B alone, or a mixture of both (7 μm CP and 16.3 μm S100B), pre-incubated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 100 mm NaCl; 2 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm DTT; 1 mm NaN3, for 1 h at 25 °C, were applied to a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) (Vt ≈22 ml; 1.0 cm × 28 cm) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was run at 0.6 ml min-1. The first fraction collected was 5 ml, and all subsequent fractions were 0.31 ml. The apparent molecular weights of CP (80.2 kDa) and S100B (dimer, 25 kDa; monomer, 10.7 kDa) alone were calculated from a curve of protein standards. Miscellaneous—Covalent coupling of αC28 peptide, βC34 peptide, and CP(α1β1) to Affi-Gel® resin (Bio-Rad) was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and Tricine-SDS-PAGE (34Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar) were performed as described, with minor modifications. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma. To investigate whether the C terminus of CPα is a “tentacle” in the sense of being flexible and extending out away from the rest of the protein in solution, we asked whether S100B is able to bind to whole CP in solution, because S100B is known to bind tightly to a peptide corresponding to the region in question. In particular, a tryptophan residue (corresponding to Trp271 of CPα) is involved in binding to S100B and in the contact of the α C terminus with the body of CP. First, we asked whether it was theoretically possible to sterically accommodate the binding of S100B to CP. We generated a model for the CP-S100B structure by moving the proposed α-tentacle sequence in the x-ray structure (residues Arg259-Ala286) off the top surface of the molecule, exposing Trp271 (compare Fig. 1, A and B). The S100-TRTK-12 NMR structure (22Inman K.G. Yang R. Rustandi R.R. Miller K.E. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 1003-1014Google Scholar) was then superimposed onto the 12 amino acids corresponding to the TRTK-12 peptide (CPα residues Thr265-Ser276) (Fig. 1C). This CP-S100B complex was then energy-minimized to remove steric clashes (Fig. 1D). The result shows that S100B can theoretically bind CP, without steric clashes, if the CPα C terminus is extended with Trp271 removed from the surface of CP. Second, we asked whether a 28-amino acid residue peptide (termed “αC28” peptide here) corresponding to the proposed α-tentacle sequence (CPα residues Arg259-Ala286) was able to bind S100B. Previous studies had shown that a shorter peptide, TRTK-12 (CPα residues Thr265-Ser276), binds tightly (20Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Google Scholar, 21Barber K.R. McClintock K.A. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Dimlich R.V. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1502-1508Google Scholar). We measured binding of a synthetic αC28 peptide to recombinant S100B (Fig. 2A) by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The αC28 peptide has a single tryptophan residue, corresponding to Trp271, whereas S100B has none. Titration caused a fluorescence enhancement and a blue shift in the emission wavelength maximum from 355 to 334 nm (Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed with the TRTK-12 peptide in previous studies"

Ten mutations isolated in a genetic screen for read-through of premature stop codons in mitochondrial genes were localized in the chromosomal gene encoding the mitochondrial release factor mRF1. The mrf1-13 and mrf1-780 mutant genes, in contrast to other alleles, caused a non-respiratory phenotype that correlated with decreased expression of mitochondrial genes as well as a reporter ARG8m gene inserted into mitochondrial DNA. The steady-state levels of several mitochondrially encoded proteins, but not their mRNAs, were dramatically decreased in mrf1-13 and mrf1-780 cells. Structural models of mRF1 were constructed, allowing localization of residues substituted in the mrf1 mutants and offering an insight into the possible mechanism by which these mutations change the mitochondrial translation termination fidelity. Inhibition of mitochondrial translation in mrf1-13 and mrf1-780 correlated with the three-dimensional localization of the mutated residues close to the PST motif presumably involved in the recognition of stop codons in mitochondrial mRNA.

The mitochondrial genetic system of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a subject of intensive studies. Seven genes in the yeast mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 1The abbreviations used is: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; Cox2 and 3, cytochrome c oxidase subunits 2 and 3; RF, release factor; mRF, mitochondrial RF. encode integral membrane proteins that are assembled together with subunits encoded in the nuclear DNA into multimeric respiratory complexes. Maintenance and expression of mtDNA require approximately 200 proteins encoded in the nuclear DNA and imported to mitochondria from the cytosol (1Barientos A. Korr D. Barwell K.M. Sjulsen C. Gajewski C.D. Manfredi G. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2292-2302Google Scholar, 2Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Jopich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13207-13212Google Scholar). Among them are mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, general translation factors, and translational activators. Current analysis of the proteome of yeast mitochondria allowed for identification of 65 mitoribosomal proteins (2Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Jopich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13207-13212Google Scholar); however, only ∼60% of these have recognizable homology with bacterial ribosomal proteins (3O'Brien T.W. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 73-79Google Scholar). Multiple mitoribosome-specific proteins in yeast and mammals demonstrate the considerable divergence of mitochondrial ribosomes from their prokaryotic ancestors (4Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moseley, A. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19363-19374Google Scholar, 5Koc E.C. Burkhart W. Blackburn K. Moyer M.B. Schlatzer D.M. Moseley A. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43958-43969Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control mitochondrial translation are difficult to study because no in vitro system for the expression of translation products encoded in mtDNA has yet been established. In contrast to the biochemical difficulties, the yeast S. cerevisiae, being a facultative anaerobe, offers distinct advantages for mitochondrial genetic studies. Several hundred point mutations or small deletions called mit- have been genetically mapped and assigned to genes in mtDNA. We have long been involved in a search for suppressors of mit- mutants that act at the level of mitochondrial translation. Analogous suppressor approach applied to chromosomal mutants allowed identification of proteins responsible for translation fidelity in the yeast cytosolic system. Ribosomal proteins from the decoding center of the ribosome and translation termination factors represented two classes of proteins that control decoding of the stop signal (6Alksne L.E. Anthony R.A. Liebman S.W. Warner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9538-9541Google Scholar, 7Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 385-395Google Scholar). An ochre mit- mutation cox2-V25, localized in the coding region of the mitochondrial COX2 gene, was used for suppressor screen. One dominant suppressor, NAM9-1 (8Boguta M. Dmochowska A. Borsuk P. Wrobel K. Gargouri A. Lazowska J. Slonimski P.P. Szczesniak B. Kruszewska A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 402-412Google Scholar), and 10 recessive suppressors (9Zoladek T. Boguta M. Putrament A. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 427-433Google Scholar) were identified. The cloning of the NAM9-1 gene identified a structural component of the mitochondrial ribosome homologous to the S4 ribosomal protein from bacteria and eukaryotes that controls translation fidelity (8Boguta M. Dmochowska A. Borsuk P. Wrobel K. Gargouri A. Lazowska J. Slonimski P.P. Szczesniak B. Kruszewska A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 402-412Google Scholar, 10Chacinska A. Boguta M. Krzewska J. Rospert S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7220-7229Google Scholar). Here we show that all of the remaining recessive nuclear suppressors are mutations in a gene specifying the mitochondrial translation termination factor mRF1 (11Pel H.J. Maat C. Rep M. Grivell L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6339-6346Google Scholar). mRF1 is the only release factor that recognizes stop codons in mitochondrial mRNAs (11Pel H.J. Maat C. Rep M. Grivell L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6339-6346Google Scholar, 12Askarian-Amiri M.E. Pel H.J. Guevremont D. McCaughan K.K. Poole E.S. Sumpter V.G. Tate W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17241-17248Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cytosol, also a single factor, eRF1, recognizes all three stop codons. In contrast, prokaryotes have two codon-specific factors, RF1 for UAA/UAG and RF2 for UAA/UGA. Eukaryotic eRF1s and prokaryotic RFs show no detectable similarity at the level of amino acid sequences, but their shapes mimic tRNA as seen from their crystal structures (13Song H. Mugnier P. Das A.K. Webb H.M. Evans D.R. Tuite M.F. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 2000; 100: 311-321Google Scholar, 14Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1375-1382Google Scholar). Functional mimicry of release factors and tRNA is supported by biochemical and genetic studies that point to tripeptide “anticodons” in bacterial RF1 and RF2 (15Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Google Scholar, 16Nakamura Y. Ito K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 99-105Google Scholar). The yeast mrf1 mutants described here are, to our knowledge, the first identified informational suppressors of mit- mutations that act by changing mitochondrial translation termination fidelity. We constructed mRF1 structural models that allowed localization of the amino acids substituted in the mutants and offered a clue to the possible mechanism of suppression. Interestingly, molecular analysis showed that some mrf1 mutations block translation of mitochondrially encoded proteins. Media and Growth Conditions—Rich media contained YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) and 2% galactose (YPGal) or 2% glycerol (YPGly). Minimal medium SC (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) was supplemented with 2% glucose, amino acids, uracil, and adenine as required (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). All of the reagents were from Difco. For determination of the respiratory (Gly) phenotype, yeast strains were grown on YPD plates, replica-plated on YPGly, and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. To estimate accumulation of [rho-] mutations, initially [rho+] strains were plated for single colonies on YPD and replica-crossed with a [rho0] tester followed by scoring of diploids on YPGly. For in vivo labeling and isolation of mitochondria, yeast were grown at 30 °C in liquid YPGly containing 0.3% glucose and harvested right after the point of glucose exhaustion as determined with Glucostix (Bayer). Yeast strains, Plasmids, and DNA Manipulations—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Cytoduction, generation of [rho0] derivatives, and standard genetic manipulations were according to published procedures (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). As reported before, R13 and R780 had the Gly- phenotype with wild type mtDNA but leaky growth on YPGly with the mit- mutant mtDNA (9Zoladek T. Boguta M. Putrament A. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 427-433Google Scholar). Genetic analysis was done to confirm the phenotype of R13, referred to here as the mrf1-13 mutant. 10 full tetrads from the cross-R13 [rho0] × W303-1B were analyzed. Clear 2:2 segregation of the mrf1-13 phenotype (Gly-) was observed. All of the ascospores were made [rho0] and then crossed back with the target mit- mutation cox2-V25 (strains CD111 and CD112). Only two clones per tetrad, those identified previously to carry mrf1-13, yielded Gly+/- because of suppression of cox2-V25.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeOriginAK5-13BMATa his-4C [cox2-V25]8R12, R13, R16MATa his-4C R [cox2-V25]8R705, R780, R726,R742, R752, R763, R780, R838MATα ade2-1 R [cox2-V25]8CK311/B145MATa nam3-1 kar1-1 leu1 canR [cob-M2101]27CK311/B136MATa nam3-2 kar1-1 leu1 canR [cob-M2101]27W303-1BMATα ade2-1 leu2-3 ura3-1 his3-11 trp1-1W303-2CMATa ade2-1 leu2-3 ura3-1 his3-11 trp1-1JC8/55MATa kar1-1 leu1 canR [rho0]G.

Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) was kindly supplied by M. Wysocka (Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences). Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method (19Chen D.C. Yang B.C. Kuo T.T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Google Scholar). MRF1 was subcloned as the SacI-SalI fragment in pRS306, pRS314, and pRS315, resulting in pRS306-MRF1, pRS314-MRF1, and pRS315-MRF1, respectively. For chromosomal integration in the MRF1 locus, pRS306-MRF1 was cut with EcoRI before transformation. The isogenic wild type MRF1 strain was generated by two-step gene replacement (20Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchel A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 73-83Google Scholar). pRS306-MRF1 was integrated in the MB143-3D/13 genome, resulting in the Ura+Gly+ phenotype. Homologous recombination, forced by growth of the integrant on SC medium supplemented with 5-fluoroorotic acid (2 mg/ml), resulted in excision of the URA3 plasmid and loss of either the MRF1 or mrf1-13 allele. The Gly+ clone containing MRF1 is referred to as MB143-3D. An analogous approach was subsequently applied to generate the isogenic mrf1-780 mutant (MB143-3D/780) using the PCR-amplified mrf1-780 allele of R780 subcloned in pRS306. All mrf1 alleles were amplified by PCR using Mastercycler gradient (Eppendorf), specific primers 5′-TCGGGCGTCGACTATGTGCGTCAG-3′ and 5′-AATACAAAGCTTTAATAGTGCGTATC-3′, TaqDNA polymerase (Promega), and genomic DNA prepared from strains R12, R13, R16, R705, R726, R742, R752, R763, R780, R838, B136, B145, MB143-3D/13, MB168-5A, and MB165-2D (see Table I). For each mutant, five PCR reactions were pooled and the PCR fragment was cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. The presence of each mutation was confirmed in three independent clones. MB168-2D and MB168-5A were spores from the cross-R780 × W303-2C. MB168-2D was subsequently crossed with JC8/55 to generate MB172-1B (mrf1-780, kar1-1). MJ14-1D (mrf1-780 kar1-1 arg8::URA3) was selected from the spore progeny of the cross-MB172-1B × DFS160. Cytoduction was applied to transfer mitochondria containing the ARG8m reporter gene from donor cells (DFS189) into the nuclear mrf1-780 background of recipient cell MJ14-1D [rho0] harboring the YCp314-MRF1 plasmid. Cytoductants were red as a result of the ade2-1 nuclear marker of MJ14-1D. The presence of the ARG8m mitochondrial reporter gene was confirmed by a cross with the tester strain AK5-13B (recombination of mtDNA carrying the point cox2-V25 mit- mutation with mtDNA carrying the cox3::ARG8m deletion gives wild type mtDNA, leading to the recovery of the Gly+ phenotype). In Vivo Labeling of Mitochondrial Translation Products—Cells grown as described above were suspended in buffer P (40 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 0.45% glucose, 0.0077% Complete supplement mixture-methionine (BIO101)) and incubated on a shaker for 30 min at 30 °C. Cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. After 10 min at 30 °C, the reactions were supplemented with 40 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mm, ICN). At time points indicated, the labeling reaction was stopped by rapid chilling of the cells on ice and simultaneous addition of unlabeled methionine to a final concentration of 20 mm. After centrifugation, the cells were washed in CM buffer (40 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 20 mm methionine) and collected. To measure [35S]methionine incorporation, cells were filtered under vacuum on GF/A glass microfiber filters (Whatman), washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 95% ethanol, and acetone, and dried. Radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. To determine mitochondrial translation products, total protein was extracted from collected cells as described by Yaffe and Schatz (21Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Google Scholar). Mitochondrial translation products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Analysis of Mitochondrial Protein and RNA—Yeast were grown as described above. Mitochondria were purified according to Glick and Pon (22Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Google Scholar). The Nycodenz purification step was omitted. Protein concentration was estimated with a Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Mitochondrial proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond C-Extra (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with antibody according to instructions. The monoclonal antibodies against Cox2 and Cox3 were from Molecular Probes. All of the other antibodies were from the collection of G. Schatz (Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland). Secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO) was visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) followed by autoradiography. Films were quantified using ImageQuant, version 1.1 with local average background correction (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). RNA was isolated from mitochondria using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 10 μg of each RNA sample was resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing 0.925% formaldehyde in NBC buffer (0.5 m boric acid, 10 mm sodium citrate, 50 mm NaOH). The RNAs were transferred from gel to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with probes according to instructions. 5′-TATAAGCCCACCGCAGGTTCCCCTACGGTAACTGTA-3′ and 5′-GTTCATTTAATCATTCCAAAAATTTAGGTAATGATACTGCTTCGATCTTA-3′ oligonucleotides labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase were used as probes for 16 S rRNA and COX2 mRNA, respectively. PCR fragment synthesized with 5′-TATGCCTTCACCATGACCTA-3′ and 5′-CATCAGTAGAAGACTACGTA-3′ primers and labeled with [α-32P]ATP using random-prime system served as a probe for COX3 mRNA. After hybridization, blots were washed 15 min in 6× SSC at room temperature and exposed to film or to a PhosphorImager plate. RNA was quantified using the laser densitometer GelScan XL (Pharmacia). COX2 and COX3 mRNA levels, measured for two independent blots, were corrected for 16 S rRNA levels. Cytochrome Spectra—Cells were grown on YPGal plates. Cytochrome absorption spectra were recorded for whole cells in liquid nitrogen as described previously (23Claisse M.L. Pere-Aubert G.A. Clavilier L.P. Slonimski P.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 430-438Google Scholar). Three-dimensional Models of mRF1—A three-dimensional model of S. cerevisiae mRF1 protein in the conformation unbound to the ribosome was generated with the MODELER program (24Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Google Scholar) using the Escherichia coli RF2 (1GQE) crystal structure (14Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1375-1382Google Scholar) as template. The N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence was not considered in the model. The critical step in the modeling, generation of the sequence-to-structure alignment, was based on the results of secondary structure prediction and tertiary-fold recognition carried out with the Meta Server (24Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Google Scholar) using the consensus alignment approach and three-dimensional assessment (25Ginalski K. Rychlewski L. Proteins. 2003; 53: 410-417Google Scholar). In addition, a Cα trace model of mRF1 bound to the ribosome was derived using the low resolution structure of E. coli RF2 in a complex with the ribosome (26Klaholz B.P. Pape T. Zavialov A.V. Myasnikov A.G. Orlova E.V. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. van Heel M. Nature. 2003; 421: 90-94Google Scholar). 1. Identification of mit- Suppressors as Mutations in the MRF1 Gene Specifying the Mitochondrial Translation Termination Factor—Several recessive suppressors of the mit- non-sense mutation cox2-V25 were isolated previously and characterized genetically (9Zoladek T. Boguta M. Putrament A. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 427-433Google Scholar) but not identified up to now. Specificity studies involving a collection of several hundred point mutations or small deletions in mtDNA revealed that the suppressors act on <20 mutations localized in different mitochondrial genes. The action spectra and growth phenotypes of the suppressors were similar but not identical, indicating that they are not identical mutations. 2 of 10 suppressors were temperature-sensitive, and these two mutants (designated previously as R13 and R780) did not grow on a medium containing non-fermentable carbon when combined with wild type mtDNA (9Zoladek T. Boguta M. Putrament A. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 427-433Google Scholar). To clone the gene able to complement the Gly- phenotype of the R13 mutant, the wild type yeast single copy genomic library was introduced into MB143-3D/13 cells (see Table I and “Experimental Procedures”). Screening of 12,000 Leu+ transformants for complementation of the respiratory defect resulted in two clones that showed a plasmid-dependent phenotype. Further analysis revealed two overlapping plasmids that have the MRF1 gene in common. MRF1 is known to encode the mRF1 release factor involved in decoding of stop signals during termination of protein synthesis on mitochondrial ribosomes (11Pel H.J. Maat C. Rep M. Grivell L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6339-6346Google Scholar). To confirm that R13 and possibly other recessive suppressors are alleles of MRF1, we first mapped these mutants by genetic recombination. The wild type strain W301-1B with the URA3 marker integrated into the chromosomal MRF1 locus was crossed with R13 and several other suppressors, including the CK311/B145 strain carrying the nam3-1 mutation (27Kruszewska A. Slonimski P.P. Curr. Genet. 1984; 9: 1-10Google Scholar). Diploids were sporulated, and >10 tetrads from each cross were analyzed for segregation of Ura+ and suppressor phenotypes. In none of the crosses did these traits co-segregate, providing strong evidence that the examined suppressor mutations are alleles of MRF1. All mrf1 alleles were amplified and sequenced on both strands. This confirmed that all of the previously isolated recessive suppressors of mit- cox2-V25 contained single point mutations in the mRF1-coding region, resulting in the following amino acid substitutions: mrf1-12 (V163D); mrf1-780 (G164C); mrf1-136 S216Y); mrf1-763 (V226F); mrf1-838 (R228G); mrf1-13 (R231G); mrf1-705 (A247P); mrf1-16 (R313I); mrf1-752 (Q349R); and mrf1-145 (S352I). Note that mrf1-145 and mrf1-136 represent nam3-1 and nam3-2, respectively. The remaining mrf1 allele numbers correspond to the R suppressors. 2. Localization of Suppressor Mutations in mRF1 Domains—The strong sequence conservation between the release factors from prokaryotes and mitochondria and the known crystal structure of E. coli RF2 (14Vestergaard B. Van L.B. Andersen G.R. Nyborg J. Buckingham R.H. Kjeldgaard M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1375-1382Google Scholar) allowed us to build a reliable three-dimensional model of the S. cerevisiae mitochondrial mRF1 protein (Fig. 1A). Moreover, on the basis of a low resolution structure of the E. coli RF2 termination complex (22Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Google Scholar), a Cα trace model for mRF1 in a complex with the ribosome was also derived (data not shown). mRF1 is composed of four domains (Fig. 1), largely corresponding to those predicted by Pel (11Pel H.J. Maat C. Rep M. Grivell L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6339-6346Google Scholar). The N-terminal helical domain 1, shown in brown, is apart from the compact structure formed by the remaining domains. The highly conserved domain 2 (blue) is supposed to be responsible for stop codon recognition. Domain 4 (magenta) is considered as a subdomain of domain 2. Domain 3 (green) contains the absolutely conserved GGQ motif responsible for hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond (9Zoladek T. Boguta M. Putrament A. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 427-433Google Scholar). The highly conserved Arg-313 in domain 3 is located close to the GGQ loop and possibly interacts directly with the tRNA molecule. Mutating this charged residue to the hydrophobic isoleucine in mrf1-16 may destabilize the interactions of domain 3 with tRNA, decreasing catalytic activity of mRF1 toward the peptidyl-tRNA bond. The PST motif in domain 2 of mRF1 corresponds to the tripeptide anticodons identified in the RFs of E. coli (15Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Google Scholar), resembling rather the PAT motif of RF1 than the SPF motif of RF2. This is consistent with the fact that the RF2-specific UGA codon is not a stop signal in yeast mitochondria (28Bonitz S.G. Berlani R. Coruzzi G. Li M. Macino G. Norberga F.G. Norberga M.P. Thalenfeld B.E. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3167-3170Google Scholar). We believe that the PST directly binds to the stop codons in mitochondrial mRNA. In addition, in the model of mRF1 in complex with the ribosome, the PST motif contacts helix 44 of 16 S rRNA. Helix 44 is involved in the interaction between the ribosomal subunits, possibly important for the signaling from the stop codon to the peptidyl transferase center (29Kisselev L. Ehrenberg M. Frolova L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 175-182Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, domain 2 contains the majority of the amino acid substitutions caused by our mrf1 mutations. These mutations can be divided into three groups. The first comprises mrf1-780 (G164C) and mrf1-13 (R231G), which cause lack of growth on media requiring respiration and inhibit mitochondrial translation (see results below). Interestingly, the substituted residues, Gly-164 and Arg-231, are located most closely to the PST motif (Fig. 1). Gly-164 is one of the two conserved glycines that form a tight loop from the middle β-strand in domain 2 to the central α-helix of mRF1. This structural feature seems to be important for the tight packing of mRF1 onto the ribosome as well as for PST loop maintenance and orientation. Replacement of Gly-164 with a bulky amino acid side chain probably causes several steric clashes and destabilizes the correct orientation of the PST loop. The positively charged side chain of the highly conserved Arg-231 seems to stabilize the conformation of the PST loop and, in addition, could be directly involved in contact with 16 S rRNA. The R231G substitution would destroy these interactions. The S216Y substitution, in a position occupied by small amino acids within homologous RFs, represents the second group of mutations in mRF1 domain 2. Ser-216 is buried in the mRF1 structure in a tight pocket formed by surrounding residues. Conversion of the serine side chain into the bulkier tyrosine could destroy internal packing, leading to a local conformational change of the backbone, possibly affecting the linker between domains 1 and 2 and, consequently, the relative orientation of these domains. The substitutions representing mutations from the third group, V163D, V226F, R228G, and A247P, cluster on the surface of the β-sheet of domain 2. Interestingly, in the structure of mRF1 complexed with the ribosome, these usually (when unbound to ribosome) solvent-exposed residues interact with the long loop-connecting domains 3 and 4 (data not shown). This linker between the domains contains two other amino acid substitutions detected in our study, Q349R and S352I, that interact directly with the mutations located on the surface of the β-sheet of domain 2 but only when mRF1 adopts the conformation observed in the complex with the ribosome. As a consequence, the V163D, V226F, R228G, A247P, Q349R, and S352I substitutions may influence the movement of domains 1 and 3 with respect to the functional unit formed by domains 2 and 4 and alter mRF1 interaction with the ribosome. In addition, change in physicochemical properties of the domain 2 surface caused by these mutations may also affect its direct binding to the ribosome (ribosomal protein S12 and 16 S rRNA). 3. mrf1 Mutant Cells Maintain Wild Type mtDNA and Mitochondrial Ribosomes—The non-respiratory phenotype of mrf1-13 and mrf1-780 point to an essential role of Gly-164 and Arg-231 for mRF1 activity. These two mutants do not grow on medium containing glycerol or other non-fermentable carbon sources if wild type mtDNA is present (9Zoladek T. Boguta M. Putrament A. Curr. Genet. 1985; 9: 427-433Google Scholar). In contrast, other mrf1 alleles do not cause respiratory defects. Because mRF1 is required for the maintenance of wild type mitochondrial genome, the loss of mtDNA could explain the respiratory deficiency of mrf1-13 and mrf1-780 cells. To determine mtDNA maintenance, mrf1-13 and mrf1-780 were crossed to a wild type [rho0] strain. The resulting diploids grew on non-fermentable carbon sources, indicating that the mutants are recessive and that the cells retained mtDNA (Fig. 2A). The fraction of accumulated [rho-] mutations, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” is 22% in mrf1-13 and 51% in mrf1-780, whereas the control strain and the remaining mrf1 alleles show 1-4% [rho-]. It is obvious that stronger defects in translation termination lead to increased accumulation of [rho-], although ∼50% of cells with mtDNA retained is enough to ensure expression of mitochondrial genes in a cell population. Unstable mitochondrial ribosomes in cells with a non-functional release factor could be an alternative reason of the respiratory deficiency of the mrf1-13 and mrf1-780 mutants. The steady-state levels of selected mitochondrial ribosomal proteins were examined to rule out the effect of ribosome degradation. It is known that Mrp13, Mrp20, and Mrp49 are relatively unstable in the absence of ribosome assembly (30Partaledis J.A. Mason T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3647-3660Google Scholar, 31Fearon K. Mason T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5162-5170Google Scholar) and free Mrp7 is relatively stable (32Fearon K. Mason T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3636-3646Google Scholar). As presented in Fig. 2B, the levels of all of the mitochondrial ribosomal proteins tested, Mrp7, Mrp"
https://openalex.org/W1587471662,"Traditional methods for identifying T cell-recognized tumor antigens (Ags) are laborious and time-consuming. In an attempt to simplify the procedure, a novel strategy, SING (SIgnal transduction molecule-mediated, NFAT-controlled, GFP expression) was established as a direct approach for cloning T cell-recognized tumor Ags. In the SING system, a mouse T cell line (BW5147) was transduced with a chimeric H-2Kb construct containing T cell-signaling domains and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene under the transcriptional control of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). The resultant BW5147 cells were named BS cells. This cell line could ""sense"" TCR stimulation through the T cell-signaling domains after coculture with Ag-specific T cells and then become fluorescent (expressing green fluorescence protein, GFP+) in the presence of Ag peptides. The interaction between BS cells and Ag-specific T cells could be enhanced by addition of costimulatory signals. Currently, BS cells have been optimized to ""sense"" TCR stimulation after being pulsed with the relevant peptides at concentrations as low as 10(-9) M. Endogenous Ag-expressing BS cells could also become fluorescent after coculture with Ag-specific T cells. Our results provide a proof of principle for using the SING system to directly isolate Ag-expressing BS cells from BS cell repertoires, which are retrovirally transduced with tumor-derived cDNA libraries. Once tumor Ag-marked BS cells are identified, the sequences encoding tumor Ags could be easily retrieved by PCR amplification of the genomic DNA using vector-specific primers."
