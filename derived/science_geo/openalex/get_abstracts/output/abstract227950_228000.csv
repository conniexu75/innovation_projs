https://openalex.org/W1987677365,"We report that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene (PTPN22) encoding the lymphoid protein tyrosine phosphatase (LYP), a suppressor of T-cell activation, is associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). The variants encoded by the two alleles, 1858C and 1858T, differ in a crucial amino acid residue involved in association of LYP with the negative regulatory kinase Csk. Unlike the variant encoded by the more common allele 1858C, the variant associated with T1D does not bind Csk."
https://openalex.org/W2146470265,"We have developed an inducible system to visualize gene expression at the levels of DNA, RNA and protein in living cells. The system is composed of a 200 copy transgene array integrated into a euchromatic region of chromosome 1 in human U2OS cells. The condensed array is heterochromatic as it is associated with HP1, histone H3 methylated at lysine 9, and several histone methyltransferases. Upon transcriptional induction, HP1alpha is depleted from the locus and the histone variant H3.3 is deposited suggesting that histone exchange is a mechanism through which heterochromatin is transformed into a transcriptionally active state. RNA levels at the transcription site increase immediately after the induction of transcription and the rate of synthesis slows over time. Using this system, we are able to correlate changes in chromatin structure with the progression of transcriptional activation allowing us to obtain a real-time integrative view of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2016786878,"Despite being one of the first eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory elements identified, the sequence of a native TATA box and its significance remain elusive. Applying criteria associated with TATA boxes we queried several Saccharomyces genomes and arrived at the consensus TATA(A/T)A(A/T)(A/G). Approximately 20% of yeast genes contain a TATA box. Strikingly, TATA box-containing genes are associated with responses to stress, are highly regulated, and preferentially utilize SAGA rather than TFIID when compared to TATA-less promoters. Transcriptional regulation in yeast appears to be mechanistically bipolar, possibly reflecting a need to balance inducible stress-related responses with constitutive housekeeping functions."

https://openalex.org/W2007793421,"Anopheles mosquitoes are major vectors of human malaria in Africa. Large variation exists in the ability of mosquitoes to serve as vectors and to transmit malaria parasites, but the molecular mechanisms that determine vectorial capacity remain poorly understood. We report that the hemocyte-specific complement-like protein TEP1 from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae binds to and mediates killing of midgut stages of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. The dsRNA knockdown of TEP1 in adults completely abolishes melanotic refractoriness in a genetically selected refractory strain. Moreover, in susceptible mosquitoes this knockdown increases the number of developing parasites. Our results suggest that the TEP1-dependent parasite killing is followed by a TEP1-independent clearance of dead parasites by lysis and/or melanization. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of TEP1-mediated parasite killing will be of great importance for our understanding of the principles of vectorial capacity in insects."
https://openalex.org/W1974578353,"The molecular mechanisms by which different mutations in the same gene can result in distinct disease phenotypes remain largely unknown. Truncating mutations of SOX10 cause either a complex neurocristopathy designated PCWH or a more restricted phenotype known as Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (WS4; OMIM 277580). Here we report that although all nonsense and frameshift mutations that cause premature termination of translation generate truncated SOX10 proteins with potent dominant-negative activity, the more severe disease phenotype, PCWH, is realized only when the mutant mRNAs escape the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. We observe similar results for truncating mutations of MPZ that convey distinct myelinopathies. Our experiments show that triggering NMD and escaping NMD may cause distinct neurological phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2125865850,"Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements reveal that a transmembrane sequence within a nascent membrane protein folds into a compact conformation near the peptidyltransferase center and remains folded as the sequence moves through a membrane bound ribosome into the translocon. This compact conformation is compatible with an alpha helix because nearly the same energy transfer efficiency was observed when the transmembrane sequence was integrated into the lipid bilayer. Since the transmembrane sequence unfolds upon emerging from a free ribosome, this nascent chain folding is ribosome induced and stabilized. In contrast, a nascent secretory protein is in an extended conformation in the exit tunnel. Furthermore, two ribosomal proteins photo-crosslink to nascent membrane but not secretory proteins. These interactions coincide with the previously described sequential closing and opening of the two ends of the aqueous translocon pore, thereby suggesting that ribosomal recognition of nascent chain folding controls the operational mode of the translocon at the ER membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2036535918,"Formin proteins participate in a wide range of cytoskeletal processes in all eukaryotes. The defining feature of formins is a highly conserved approximately 400 residue region, the Formin Homology-2 (FH2) domain, which has recently been found to nucleate actin filaments. Here we report crystal structures of the S. cerevesiae Bni1p FH2 domain. The mostly alpha-helical FH2 domain forms a unique ""tethered dimer"" in which two elongated actin binding heads are tied together at either end by an unusual lasso and linker structure. Biochemical and crystallographic observations indicate that the dimer is stable but flexible, with flexibility between the two halves of the dimer conferred by the linker segments. Although each half of the dimer is competent to interact with filament ends, the intact dimer is required for actin nucleation and processive capping. The tethered dimer architecture may allow formins to stair-step on the barbed end of an elongating nascent filament."

https://openalex.org/W1998276610,"Multisite hyperphosphorylation of tau has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the phosphorylation events critical for tau toxicity and mechanisms regulating these events are largely unknown. Here we show that Drosophila PAR-1 kinase initiates tau toxicity by triggering a temporally ordered phosphorylation process. PAR-1 directly phosphorylates tau at S262 and S356. This phosphorylation event is a prerequisite for the action of downstream kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5), to phosphorylate several other sites and generate disease-associated phospho-epitopes. The initiator role of PAR-1 is further underscored by the fact that mutating PAR-1 phosphorylation sites causes a much greater reduction of overall tau phosphorylation and toxicity than mutating S202, one of the downstream sites whose phosphorylation depends on prior PAR-1 action. These findings begin to differentiate the effects of various phosphorylation events on tau toxicity and provide potential therapeutic targets."

https://openalex.org/W1996941416,"Lenz microphthalmia is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern and comprises microphthalmia, mental retardation, and skeletal and other anomalies. Two loci associated with this syndrome, MAA (microphthalmia with associated anomalies) and MAA2, are situated respectively at Xq27-q28 (refs. 1,2) and Xp11.4-p21.2 (ref. 3). We identified a substitution, nt 254C-->T; P85L, in BCOR (encoding BCL-6-interacting corepressor, BCOR) in affected males from the family with Lenz syndrome previously used to identify the MAA2 locus. Oculofaciocardiodental syndrome (OFCD; OMIM 300166) is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern with presumed male lethality and comprises microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, radiculomegaly, and cardiac and digital abnormalities. Given their phenotypic overlap, we proposed that OFCD and MAA2-associated Lenz microphthalmia were allelic, and we found different frameshift, deletion and nonsense mutations in BCOR in seven families affected with OFCD. Like wild-type BCOR, BCOR P85L and an OFCD-mutant form of BCOR can interact with BCL-6 and efficiently repress transcription. This indicates that these syndromes are likely to result from defects in alternative functions of BCOR, such as interactions with transcriptional partners other than BCL-6. We cloned the zebrafish (Danio rerio) ortholog of BCOR and found that knock-down of this ortholog caused developmental perturbations of the eye, skeleton and central nervous system consistent with the human syndromes, confirming that BCOR is a key transcriptional regulator during early embryogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2118855111,"Myosin VI is thought to function as both a transporter and an anchor. While in vitro studies suggest possible mechanisms for processive stepping, a biochemical basis for anchoring has not been demonstrated. Using optical trapping, we observed myosin VI stepping against applied forces. Step size is not strongly affected by such loads. At saturating ATP, myosin VI kinetics shows little dependence on load until, at forces near stall, its stepping slows dramatically as load increases. At subsaturating ATP or in the presence of ADP, stepping kinetics is significantly inhibited by load. From our results, we propose a mechanism of myosin VI stepping that predicts a regulation through load of the motor's roles as transporter and anchor."
https://openalex.org/W2041494047,"Robust neuroprotective effects have been shown for minocycline. Whether it also protects nonneuronal cells or tissues is unknown. More importantly, the mechanisms of minocylcine protection appear multifaceted and remain to be clarified. Here we show that minocycline can protect kidney epithelial cells in vitro and protect the kidneys from ischemic injury in vivo. We further show that Bcl-2 is a key molecular determinant of minocycline protection. Minocycline protected kidney epithelial cells against apoptosis induced by hypoxia, azide, cisplatin, and staurosporine. The protection occurred at mitochondria, involving the suppression of Bax accumulation, outer membrane damage, and cytochrome c release. Minocycline induced Bcl-2, which accumulated in mitochondria and interacted with death-promoting molecules including Bax, Bak, and Bid. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 by specific antisense oligonucleotides abolished the cytoprotective effects of minocycline. Thus, minocycline can protect neuronal as well as nonneuronal cells and tissues.

Minocycline is a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline, which has been used as an effective antibiotic for decades (1Klein N.C. Cunha B.A. Med. Clin. North Am. 1995; 79: 789-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, have suggested bioactivities for minocycline that are unrelated to its antimicrobial property. For example, minocycline and related tetracyclines are anti-inflammatory (2Ryan M.E. Greenwald R.A. Golub L.M. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1996; 8: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

First, is minocycline protection specific for nervous systems? does minocycline protect nonneuronal cells or tissues? Second and more importantly, what is the molecular basis for minocycline protection? Here we show that minocycline protects kidney epithelial cells against injury and death induced by different types of insults. We further show that minocycline protects kidney from ischemic injury in vivo. A major cellular site for minocycline protection is the mitochondrion. Finally, we have identified Bcl-2 as a key molecular determinant of the cytoprotective effects of minocycline. Bcl-2 is induced by minocycline, accumulates in mitochondria, and may protect the organelles by antagonizing proapoptotic Bax, Bak, and Bid. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 by specific antisense oligonucleotides abolishes the cytoprotective effects of minocycline. Thus, minocycline can protect neuronal as well as nonneuronal cells and tissues. One mechanism for minocycline protection involves the induction of Bcl-2. Materials—Rat kidney proximal tubular cells were originally obtained from U. Hopfer (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). The cells were cultured and plated for experiments as described (18Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Wang J. Patel Y. Saikumar P. Semenza G.L.

All secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immuno-Research (West Grove, PA). Other reagents including minocycline were purchased from Sigma. In Vitro Experimental Treatment—For minocycline pretreatment, cells were cultured in the presence of 2 μm minocycline for 18 h. Apoptosis was induced by hypoxia, staurosporine, or azide. Hypoxia and staurosporine incubation were conducted as previously (18Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Wang J. Patel Y. Saikumar P. Semenza G.L. Force T. Nishiyama J. J. Biol.

For azide experiments, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove culture medium and then exposed to 10 mm azide in a glucose-free buffer. After azide incubation, cells were returned to culture medium to monitor the development of apoptotic morphology. In Vivo Renal Ischemia—The in vivo effects of minocycline were tested in a bilateral clamping model of renal ischemia, as described in our recent work (23Wei Q. Alam M.M. Wang M.H. Yu F. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F803-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats of 250–275 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital for flank incisions to expose renal pedicles. Both renal pedicles were clamped for 35 min to induce ischemia. The clamps were then released for 48 h of reperfusion. Finally, kidneys were collected for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) 1The abbreviations used are: TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; AFC, N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. assay of apoptosis (see below for details). Blood samples were also collected to measure serum creatinine levels to indicate renal function, using a kit purchased from Stanbio Laboratory (Boerne, TX) (23Wei Q. Alam M.M. Wang M.H. Yu F. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F803-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TUNEL Assay—Renal tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in Paraffin. Paraffin sections were cut into 4 μm for the TUNEL assay using the in situ Cell Death Detection kit purchased from Roche Applied Science, following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized and permeabilized by 2 h of incubation at 65 °C in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0. The sections were then exposed to a TUNEL reaction mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and nucleotides including fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dUTP. Positive staining was identified in cell nucleus with DNA fragmentation by fluorescence microscopy. Antisense Treatment—The sequences of Bcl-2 antisense and mismatch control were 5′-TCCCGGCTTGCGCCAT-3′ and 5′-CTGTCGCGCGCTCGACTC-3′, respectively (24Furukawa K. Estus S. Fu W. Mark R.J. Mattson M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized to contain a phosphorothioate backbone and purified by HPLC (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Cells were transfected with 0.5 μm oligonucleotides using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and examined 48 or 72 h later. Transfection of oligonucleotides was conducted as described by us recently (25Dong Z. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9215-9221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR Analysis of Bcl-2 mRNA—RNA was extracted from cells using the Qiagen protocol including DNase treatment. RNA concentration was measured on the Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Reverse transcription was carried out according to the Superscript protocol (Invitrogen). Real time PCR amplifications were carried out using an iCycler iQTM Real Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). SYBR Green dye was used to bind to the PCR products, which allows the CCD detector within the iCycler to provide immediate feedback on reaction success, thus reporting the data on the PCR in progress in a real time fashion. β-Actin was used as an internal control to normalize the results. Bcl-2-specific primers for PCR amplification were as follows: forward, 5′-GGAGGATTGTGGCCTTCTTTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CATCCCAGCCTCCGTTATCC-3′. Morphological Analysis of Apoptosis (18Dong Z.

To analyze the subcellular distribution of cytochrome c and Bax, cytosolic and membrane fractions extracted from the same amounts (∼1 × 105) of cells were subjected to electrophoresis. For other blots, 50 μg of proteins were loaded for each lane. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Subsequently, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk and exposed to primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antigens on the blots were revealed by exposure to chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce). Co-immunoprecipitation (21Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M.

After experimental incubation, the cells were fixed in a modified Zamboni's fixative and permeabilized with 0.1% SDS. The cells were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum and exposed to primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or Cy-3-labeled goat antimouse IgG). Images were captured by fluorescence microscopy. Statistics—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. (n ≥ 4). Statistical differences between means were determined using analysis of variance by two-tailed tests. p < 0.05 was considered to reflect significant differences. Minocycline Protects Kidney Epithelial Cells against Injury Induced by Different Types of Insults—We first determined whether minocycline could protect nonneuronal cells or tissues, using rat kidney proximal tubular cells, a cell line of epithelial origin. The basal level of apoptosis in control rat kidney proximal tubular cells was below 5% (Fig. 1a). Three hours of incubation with azide, a respiration inhibitor, induced apoptosis in 46% of cells (Fig. 1a). When the cells were pretreated with minocycline for 18 h, they became rather resistant to azide injury, and as a result, only 12% apoptosis was detected (Fig. 1a, +/P). In sharp contrast, minocycline added during azide incubation was not protective (Fig. 1a, +/D); brief (e.g. 2-h) pretreatment was not effective either (not shown). The cytoprotective effects of minocycline were further shown by measurements of caspase activity (Fig. 1b). Again, minocycline pretreatment for 18 h but not minocycline added during azide incubation drastically decreased caspase activation (Fig. 1b). These results were confirmed by subsequent analysis of the cleavage of an endogenous caspase substrate, lamin B (Fig. 1c). Azide incubation led to lamin B cleavage into an apoptotic fragment (lane 2), which was blocked by minocycline pretreatment (lane 3). We further examined apoptotic morphology (nuclear condensation and fragmentation) and caspase activation in the same cells. The results are shown in Fig. 1, d–i. Compared with control (Fig. 1, d and g), many nuclei in azide-treated cells appeared condensed and fragmented (Fig. 1e). The same cells showed caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1h). Minocycline treatment blocked azide-induced nuclear changes as well as caspase activation (Fig. 1, f and i). Similar protective effects of minocycline were demonstrated in the epithelial cells, following hypoxia, cisplatin, and staurosporine incubation (not shown). Thus, minocycline protected kidney epithelial cells against injury and death induced by various types of insults. Minocycline Protection of Kidneys in Vivo during Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion—To further establish the in vitro findings obtained from a kidney cell line, we tested the in vivo effects of minocycline in a relevant model of renal ischemia-reperfusion. Rats with or without minocycline pretreatment were subjected to bilateral clamping to induce renal ischemia. After ischemia, the clamps were released for reperfusion (23Wei Q. Alam M.M. Wang M.H. Yu F. Dong Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F803-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ischemia-reperfusion induced renal failure, as shown by increases in serum creatinine level. For example, 35 min of ischemia followed by 48 h of reperfusion increased serum creatinine from 0.3 to 5.9 mg/dl. Minocycline treatment significantly ameliorated ischemic renal failure, showing a serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dl. Consistently, the TUNEL assay detected significantly amounts of apoptotic cells in renal tubules of the ischemia-reperfused kidneys (Fig. 2b), which were again suppressed by minocycline (Fig. 2c). Thus, minocycline not only protected cultured kidney epithelial cells; it also protected renal tubular cells in vivo in the kidneys. Minocycline Protection Occurs at the Mitochondrial Level—To identify the mechanism of minocycline protection, we came back to the in vitro model. The observation that minocycline-treated cells were cross-resistant to several types of insults suggest that molecular alterations in the common death pathways might be responsible. Two major pathways of apoptosis have been delineated (i.e. the death receptor-mediated intrinsic pathway and the mitochondrion-mediated extrinsic pathway) (28Green D.R.

It has been shown that these stimuli activate proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to permeabilize the outer membrane of mitochondria, leading to the release of apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome c. Cytochrome c, after being released, binds Apaf-1 in the cytosol and activates caspase-9, which proteolytically activates downstream executioner caspases (19Dong Z. Saikumar P. Patel Y. Weinberg J.M.

Thus, we first determined whether minocycline-pretreated cells were resistant to cytochrome c release, a hallmark of outer membrane damage in mitochondria (31Wang X.

Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 3a. In control cells, cytochrome c was detected exclusively in the membrane-bound organellar fraction, with no signal in cytosol (lane 1). After 2 h of azide incubation, noticeable amounts of cytochrome c were released from the organellar fraction into the cytosol (lane 3). By the end of 3 h of azide, over 50% of cytochrome c was released. In minocycline-treated cells, azide-induced cytochrome c release was markedly inhibited (lanes 5–8). As a result, less than 20% of cytochrome c was released after 3 h of azide incubation (lane 8). The inhibitory effects of minocycline on cytochrome c release were confirmed by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3b, control cells had perinuclear organellar staining of cytochrome c, consistent with its mitochondrial location (Control). After azide incubation, over 50% of cells lost mitochondrial cytochrome c (Azide). Minocycline treatment preserved mitochondrial cytochrome c in a majority of the cells (Azide + minocycline). Targeting of mitochondria by proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (e.g. Bax, Bak, and Bid) can be a primary cause of outer membrane leakage (32Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol.

We therefore inferred that up-regulation of Mrp4 during cholestasis is a compensatory mechanism to protect the liver from accumulation of hydrophobic bile acids. We determined that the nuclear receptor CAR is required to coordinately up-regulate hepatic expression of Mrp4 and an enzyme known to sulfate hydroxy-bile acids and steroids, Sult2a1. CAR activators increased Mrp4 and Sult2a1 expression in primary human hepatocytes and HepG2, a human liver cell line. Sult2a1 was down-regulated in Mrp4-null mice, further indicating an inter-relation between Mrp4 and Sult2a1 gene expression. Based on the hydrophilic nature of sulfated bile acids and the Mrp4 capability to transport sulfated steroids, our findings suggest that Mrp4 and Sult2a1 participate in an integrated pathway mediating elimination of sulfated steroid and bile acid metabolites from the liver.

Under normal conditions, there is a balance between secondary bile acid uptake and canalicular efflux by BSEP and Mrp2 of monoanionic and dianionic conjugated bile acids, respectively, and bile acid synthesis (9St-Pierre M.V.

In the absence of liver pathology, little or no bile acid is detected in the serum; however, in cases of liver failure, bile duct obstruction, or production of excess bile acid from dietary sources, there is a dramatic increase in the serum concentration of bile acids, many of which exist as sulfated conjugates. These dianionic bile acids are potentially cholestatic. They are not substrates for BSEP (9St-Pierre M.V. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Exp.

In the Fxr knockout mice, absence of Fxr mimics intrahepatic cholestasis because serum bile acid levels increase. This condition is exacerbated when mice are challenged with bile acids or when the common bile duct is ligated (1Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the Mrp4 level is dramatically induced in the livers of Fxr-/- mice, whereas other ABC transporters (e.g. Mrp3) are only modestly affected (11Schuetz E.G. Strom S. Yasuda K. Lecureur V. Assem M. Brimer C. Lamba J. Kim R.B. Ramachandran V. Komoroski B.J. Venkataramanan R. Cai H. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol.

Indeed, Mrp3-/- mice are not detectably affected in transport of bile salts from the liver under cholestatic conditions (12Zelcer N. Mrp2-4, from Drug Resistance to Physiology. Academic Thesis, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam2003Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings suggested that, under cholestatic conditions, Mrp4 mediates bile acid transport from the liver. Notably, during cholestasis, sulfated bile acids increase in the serum (9St-Pierre M.V. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1673-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ostrow J.D. Tavolni N. Berk P.D. Hepatic Transport and Bile Secretion. Raven Press, New York1993: 673-712Google Scholar). Our demonstration that sulfated bile acids (taurolithocholate, glycolithocholate, and lithocholate (LCA)) interact with Mrp4 and the fact that serum bile acids are sulfated under cholestatic conditions (9St-Pierre M.V.

J. 2003; 371: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that a bile acid/steroid-preferring sulfotransferase would also participate in this process of removing bile acids from the liver. To test this hypothesis we specifically examined the relation between Mrp4 and Sult2a1, the sulfotransferase most highly expressed in the liver (15Shimizu C. Fuda H. Yanai H. Strott C.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1186-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sulfation of steroids, xenobiotics, and bile acids occurs by a phase II conjugation reaction catalyzed by sulfotransferases. It is known that rhesus monkeys defective in lithocholate sulfation activity accumulate LCA and this causes hepatotoxicity (16Gadacz T.R. Allan R.N. Mack E. Hofmann A.F. Gastroenterology. 1976; 70: 1125-1129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sult2a1 is a cytosolic enzyme that preferentially transfers a sulfate moiety to hydroxysteroid substrates such as LCA (17Kitada H. Miyata M. Nakamura T. Tozawa A. Honma W. Shimada M. Nagata K. Sinal C.J. Guo G.L. Gonzalez F.J. Yamazoe Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Sult2a1 is highly expressed in the liver and readily adds a sulfate to cholestatic bile acids (e.g. LCA) and steroids (e.g. DHEA, Ref. 15Shimizu C. Fuda H. Yanai H. Strott C.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1186-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This suggests that Sult2a1 could play an important role in the elimination of steroids and bile acids. It has recently been observed that CAR is up-regulated in the livers of Fxr-/- animals (18Guo G.L. Lambert G. Negishi M. Ward J.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Kliewer S.A. Gonzalez F.J. Sinal C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45062-45071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). 2J. Schuetz and M. Assem, unpublished observations. The increased expression of this nuclear receptor might account for the up-regulation of the ABC transporter, Mrp4 in the Fxr-/- animals (11Schuetz E.G. Strom S. Yasuda K. Lecureur V. Assem M. Brimer C. Lamba J. Kim R.B. Ramachandran V. Komoroski B.J. Venkataramanan R. Cai H. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39411-39418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Here we show that the nuclear receptor CAR orchestrates the coordinate up-regulation of Mrp4 (a transporter of sulfated steroids and bile acids) and Sult2a1 (a transferase that preferentially sulfates, steroids and bile acids). This process of coordinate Mrp4 and Sult2a1 up-regulation is conserved from mouse to man. Furthermore, we show that deletion of the Mrp4 gene results in a decreased expression of hepatic Sult2a1, a finding compatible with the idea that sulfation and transport of sulfated compounds are inter-related to form a pathway for excretion of sulfated steroids and bile acids.

Primary human hepatocytes were obtained and cultured as described elsewhere (11Schuetz E.G. Strom S. Yasuda K. Lecureur V. Assem M. Brimer C. Lamba J. Kim R.B. Ramachandran V. Komoroski B.J.

Retroviral Transduction—We used an MSCV-VP16-IRES-GFP that was constructed by the insertion of a synthetic polylinker with appropriate restriction sites, a VP16 transactivator domain, IRES and GFP instead of the neomycin resistance gene in the original plasmid (pM-SCV-Neo). A recombinant retrovirus vector carrying human CAR (MSCV-VP16-CAR-IRES-GFP) was constructed according to a previously reported procedure (15Shimizu C. Fuda H. Yanai H. Strott C.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1186-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In brief, CAR was excised from pcDNA3-hCAR by using NotI and SalI and inserted into the NotI and XhoI sites of the MSCV-VP16-IRES-GFP vector. The constructs were co-transfected with pEQPAM3-E helper and pRDII8 envelope plasmids into the 293T cell line. The recombinant retrovirus was grown in 293T cells, purified, and titered in NIH3T3 cells by conventional protocols. Hepa1c1c7 and HepG2 cells were transduced with either MSCV-VP16-CAR-IRES-GFP or MSCV-VP16-IRES-GFP. Briefly, 105 cells were plated on 60-mm tissue culture dishes, the medium was replaced with the retroviral supernatant supplemented with 10 μg/ml polybrene, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. This transduction was repeated two more times every 24 h. The GFP-positive-transduced cells were identified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, isolated by sterile sorting, and the culture was expanded. For both cell types, the retention of the insert was monitored periodically by assessing GFP by immunofluorescence and expression of CAR targets by Western blot. Isolation of RNA, Semiquantitative RT-PCR, and Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Specific mRNAs were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR and real-time PCR using the Abi Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following genes were amplified as described previously: Cyp3a11, Cyp2b10, Mrp2, Mrp3, Mrp4, Mrp5, Bcrp, Sult2a1, Sult1a2, Sult2b, and Gapdh (11Schuetz E.G. Strom S. Yasuda K. Lecureur V. Assem M.

Protein quantity was estimated by using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Crude membrane proteins or total homogenate (100 μg) were separated on 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with primary antibody (SPGP/BSEP Mrp4, CYP2B, CYP3A, and actin) and appropriate secondary antibody coupled with peroxidase. The blot was developed with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The mouse Mrp4 antibody was developed to a peptide derived from the predicted sequence of the C terminus of mouse Mrp4 (20Lamba J.K. Adachi M. Sun D. Tammur J. Schuetz E.G. Allikmets R. Schuetz J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This antibody did not cross-react with cells expressing Mrp1, Mrp2, BCRP, MDR1, Mdr1a, Mdr1b, and SPGP. Immunohistochemistry—The expression of Mrp4 and Bcrp were studied in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections with the anti-MRP4 and anti-BCRP antibodies described above. Deparaffinized slides were heated in a pressure cooker for 2 min at maximum pressure in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 6 (conditions for optimal antigen detection). Slides were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in water for 5 min and then with avidin and biotin blocking solutions for 15 min each (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Sections were labeled by the immunoperoxidase technique as follows. Slides were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with rabbit anti-Mrp4 antibody diluted in 5% goat serum, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween-20 (0.05%), and then incubated with a biotin-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). A tertiary complex of streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Dako) was used to develop the AEC chromogen or DAB diaminobenzidine chromogen (Dako). The protocol was similar for BCRP detection. Optimum antigen recovery for BCRP was obtained as described above but with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5 buffer. All slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—HepG2 cells were maintained in MEMα medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in a 24-well plate (3 × 105 cells per well). After 24 h, they were transfected overnight with 1 μg of mCAR or MSCV VP16-CAR plasmids and 1 μg of Mrp4 promoter-pGL2 Basic (Promega) by using FuGENE-6 (Roche Applied Science). The next day, the cells were washed twice and harvested, lysed, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. Luciferase activity was assayed in an aliquot of supernatant as directed by the manufacturer of the automated luminometer (Opticomp Luminoter). In most cases the results were expressed as luciferase activity per microgram of protein; however, in some cases an additional promoter driving β-galactosidase was included as a control. Regardless, the results of these assays were qualitatively similar. In Vivo Transcription Assays—C57/B6 mice matched for age and body weight were rapidly injected via the tail vein with linearized plasmid DNA in a total volume that did not exceed 10% of body weight. Seven hours later, animals were anesthetized with a 0.2-ml mixture of ketamine and xylene and given an intraperitoneal injection of firefly d-luciferin as described elsewhere (21Schuetz E. Lan L. Yasuda K. Kim R. Kocarek T.A. Schuetz J. Strom S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Optical images were obtained with a Xenogen Imaging System (www.xenogen.com/demo4.html). The images were quantitatively analyzed by IGOR Pro 4.0 image analysis software. PMEA Uptake—To measure Mrp4 function we determined the uptake of bis (pivaloyloxymethyl) PMEA, a PMEA pro-drug, as previously described (22Schuetz J.D. Connelly M.C. Sun D. Paibir S.G. Flynn P.M. Srinivas R.V. Kumar A. Fridland A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 23Adachi M. Sampath J. Lan L.B. Sun D. Hargrove P. Flatley R. Tatum A. Edwards M.Z. Wezeman M. Matherly L. Drake R. Schuetz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38998-39004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, PMEA uptake was measured in cells incubated with various concentrations of 3H-labeled bis(pivaloyloxymethyl) PMEA for 24 h at 37 °C. Monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove any free [3H]PMEA. Cells were lysed on an orbital shaker using 1.0 ml of 0.5 n NaOH in each well. The intracellular [3H]PMEA was assayed by liquid scintillation counting and normalized to the total protein in each well. Protein quantity was estimated with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Bovine serum albumin was used to prepare standard curves (Bio-Rad). Affymetrix Oligonucleotide Array Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol. Briefly, first-strand synthesis was accomplished by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and T7-oligo(dT) primer. Second strand was synthesized by using DNA polymerase I and RNase H. The double-stranded complementary DNA was used as a template for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of biotin-labeled UTP and CTP (Enzo Diagnostics Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Labeled cRNA (10.0 μg) was fragmented by heat and ion-mediated hydrolysis and hybridized to the U133 oligonucleotide array (Affymetrix) containing ∼32,000 full-length annotated and EST probe sets. After several washes, the arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and the fluorescence intensity was determined using a laser confocal scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Data were analyzed by using Affymetrix GeneChip software, Affymetrix Microarray Suite Version 5.0 and Affymetrix Microarray Suite 4.1 (Affymetrix). Hepatic MRP4 and Sult2a1 Are Up-regulated by CAR Activators—We previously demonstrated that hepatic Mrp4 is upregulated as a compensatory response when FXR-null mice are challenged with cholic acid and also after bile duct ligation (11Schuetz E.G. Strom S. Yasuda K. Lecureur V. Assem M. Brimer C. Lamba J. Kim R.B. Ramachandran V. Komoroski B.J. Venkataramanan R. Cai H. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39411-39418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Mrp4 up-regulation was attributed to hepatic bile acid accumulation, a consequence of strongly reduced expression of the major hepatic bile acid transporter, Spgp/Bsep (1Sinal C.J. Tohkin M.

Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). We evaluated whether CAR mediated Mrp4 up-regulation, because preliminary studies indicated that CAR expression increased in the FXR-null mice challenged with cholic acid,2 a finding that is consistent with a recent report suggesting that CAR is a bile acid sensor (18Guo G.L. Lambert G. Negishi M. Ward J.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Kliewer S.A. Gonzalez F.J. Sinal C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45062-45071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We treated mice with the prototypical CAR ligand, TCPOBOP (Fig. 1). Semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1A) found increased Mrp4 mRNA levels in their livers. Because we recently demonstrated that DHEA-s is a high affinity Mp4 substrate (14Zelcer N. Reid G. Wielinga P. Kuil A. van der Heijden I. Schuetz J.D. Borst P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), we also tested Sult2a1. Indeed, hepatic Sult2a1 expression was increased by TCPOBOP treatment whereas expression of the phenol-preferring sulfotransferase, Sult1a2 (24Strott C.A. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 703-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 25Raftogianis R.B. Wood T.C. Otterness D.M. Van Loon J.A. Weinshilboum R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) was not; a finding indicating that CAR activation does not generally up-regulate sulfotransferases (Fig. 1A). The increase in Mrp4 mRNA following exposure to TCPOBOP was accompanied by an increase in Mrp4 protein (Fig. 1B) detected with a new Mrp4 antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 1C shows that the CAR activator, phenobarbital (PB) also results in elevated levels of Mrp4 and Sult2a1 RNA, although induction by PB was less (4–6-fold) than by TCPOBOP (15–30-fold). Mrp4 and Sult2a1 were induced to a similar degree as the known CAR target Cyp2b10 (Fig. 1C) and Cyp3A11 (results not shown), supporting a role for CAR in activating Mrp4 and Sult2a1 expression. CAR Is Required for Mrp4 and Sult2a1 Up-regulation—To directly test the role of CAR in Mrp4 and Sult2a1 regulation in vivo, we assessed their level of expression in wild-type and CAR nullizygous mice after treatment with either PB or TCPOBOP (26Tzameli I. Pissios P. Schuetz E.G. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2951-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 27Wei P. Zhang J. Egan-Hafley M. Liang S. Moore D.D. Nature. 2000; 407: 920-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, both Mrp4 RNA and Sult2a1 RNA are unchanged by PB and TCPOBOP in the CAR-/- mice at concentrations that substantially increased their levels in the CAR+/+ animals; notably, the Mrp4 induction was more pronounced in the female mice. No increase was observed in the expression of other ABC transporters that are capable of transporting sulfated steroids (Fig. 2), i.e. Bcrp, Mrp2, and Mrp3 (28Imai Y. Asada S. Tsukahara S. Ishikawa E. Tsuruo T. Sugimoto Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 29Konig J. Nies A.T. Cui Y. Leier I. Keppler D. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition, no obvious changes in the level of Mdr2, the canalicular phospholipid flippase or Mdr1a at Mdr1b were detected (not shown). A previous study suggested Mrp2 was a CAR target. It is possible that our inability to detect CAR mediated up-regulation of Mrp2 reflects either the concentration of CAR activator or the fact that our studies were conducted in the whole animal, whereas Mrp2 activation was previously observed in hepatocyte cultures (32Kast H.R. Goodwin B. Tarr P.T. Jones S.A. Anisfeld A.M. Stoltz C.M. Tontonoz P. Kliewer S. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2908-2915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). The induction of Mrp3 by CAR appears controversial. We find no induction after a 48-h treatment whereas one previous study has reported rodent hepatic Mrp3 to be a CAR target (33Staudinger J.L. Madan A. Carol K.M. Parkinson A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) whereas, two other studies did not find a major role for CAR in activation of Mrp3 (34Xiong H. Yoshinari K. Brouwer K.L.

https://openalex.org/W1967904535,"The orphan nuclear receptor CAR (NR1I3) has been characterized as a central component in the coordinate response to xenobiotic and endobiotic stress. In this study, we demonstrate that CAR plays a pivotal function in energy homeostasis and establish an unanticipated metabolic role for this nuclear receptor. Wild-type mice treated with the synthetic CAR agonist 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) exhibited decreased serum concentration of the thyroid hormone (TH) thyroxine (T4). However, treatment of Car–/– mice with TCPOBOP failed to elicit these changes. To examine whether CAR played a role in the regulation of TH levels under physiological conditions, wild-type and Car–/– mice were fasted for 24 h, a process known to alter TH metabolism in mammals. As expected, the serum triiodothyronine and T4 concentrations decreased in wild-type mice. However, triiodothyronine and T4 levels in fasted Car–/– mice remained significantly higher than those in fasted wild-type animals. Concomitant with the changes in serum TH levels, both CAR agonist treatment and fasting induced the expression of CAR target genes (notably, Cyp2b10, Ugt1a1, Sultn, Sult1a1, and Sult2a1) in a receptor-dependent manner. Importantly, the Ugt1a1, Sultn, Sult1a1, and Sult2a1 genes encode enzymes that are capable of metabolizing TH. An attenuated reduction in TH levels during fasting, as observed in Car–/– mice, would be predicted to increase weight loss during caloric restriction. Indeed, when Car–/– animals were placed on a 40% caloric restriction diet for 12 weeks, Car–/– animals lost over twice as much weight as their wild-type littermates. Thus, CAR participates in the molecular mechanisms contributing to homeostatic resistance to weight loss. These data imply that CAR represents a novel therapeutic target to uncouple metabolic rate from food intake and has implications in obesity and its associated disorders.

Thus, CAR participates in the molecular mechanisms contributing to homeostatic resistance to weight loss. These data imply that CAR represents a novel therapeutic target to uncouple metabolic rate from food intake and has implications in obesity and its associated disorders. In Western societies, obesity is reaching potentially epidemic proportions. In the United States, it is estimated that 55% of adults are overweight, and nearly a quarter are obese (1Chopra M. Galbraith S. Darnton-Hill I. Bull. W. H. O. 2002; 80: 952-958PubMed Google Scholar). Associated with the rise in obesity are concomitant rises in the incidence of metabolic syndrome or syndrome X, typified by type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The epidemic of obesity inflicts significant disadvantages on both the individual and society, i.e. increased risk of death and disease, increased health care costs, and reduced social and educational status. A significant and discouraging factor for obese individuals trying to lose weight is that homeostatic resistance mechanisms operate to resist weight loss (2Krotkiewski M. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2000; 24: S116-S119Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). A major homeostatic barrier is decreased basal metabolic rate during periods of reduced caloric intake. Thyroid hormones (THs) 1The abbreviations used are: TH, thyroid hormone; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; TCPOBOP, 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene; TSH, thyrotropin; RT-QPCR, real-time quantitative PCR. 1The abbreviations used are: TH, thyroid hormone; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; TCPOBOP, 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene; TSH, thyrotropin; RT-QPCR, real-time quantitative PCR. (thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)) are the predominant regulators of basal metabolic rate. Serum levels of TH show a direct correlation with energy expenditure and caloric loss (4LiVolsi V.A. Pathology of the Thyroid. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1989Google Scholar), decreasing significantly during fasting. The most potent thyroid hormone, T3, has been observed to drop by as much as 33% in subjects in weight loss programs after 10 weeks (5Rosenbaum M. Hirsch J. Murphy E. Leibel R.L. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that regulate thyroid hormone during weight loss are not well understood. Understanding the molecular basis of this homeostatic resistance pathway could create pharmacological opportunities for the treatment of obesity. TH exerts its effects in virtually every tissue, and its action is mediated by binding and activation of the nuclear receptors TRα (NR1A1) and TRβ (NR1A2) (6Harvey C.B. Williams G.R. Thyroid. 2002; 12: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). T3 is derived by enzymecatalyzed deiodination of the prohormone thyroxine (T4) (7Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism of T4 regulates the level of T3 in the systemic circulation and other tissues. Type I deiodinase, the major deiodinase in liver and kidney, catalyzes outer ring deiodination to produce T3 as well as inner ring deiodination to produce the inactive metabolite reverse-T3. Remarkably, outer ring deiodination becomes undetectable when T4 is sulfated, whereas the rate of inner ring deiodinase activity increases over 130-fold (8Mol J.A. Visser T.J. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the hepatic phase II sulfotransferases are of particular significance in TH metabolism because they control the preferred site of deiodination of T4, effectively catalyzing a reaction that ultimately leads to a rapid and irreversible inactivation of TH (Fig. 1). In addition to deiodination, multiple pathways of T4 metabolism have been elucidated, including glucuronidation, ether bond cleavage, and oxidative deamination (9Larsen P.R. Ingbar S.H. Andreoli T.E. Appleton W.S. Aurbach G.D. Bierman E.L. Textbook of Endocrinology. 8th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1992: 357-487Google Scholar, 10Visser T.J. Acta Med. Austriaca. 1996; 23: 10-16PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, conjugation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), specifically by members of the UGT1 family (Fig. 1), increases the water solubility of TH, which promotes biliary and urinary excretion (11Burchell B. Coughtrie M.W. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 43: 261-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The net effect of hepatic metabolism of T4 is the production of TH metabolites, many of which are either less active on the thyroid hormone receptor or excreted rapidly. Notably, the relative quantitative contributions of conjugative metabolism pathways such as sulfation and glucuronidation in regulating T3 production during fasting have not been reported. The nuclear receptor CAR (NR1I2) is expressed mainly in liver and has been considered a xenobiotic receptor like its closest relative, the pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) (12Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wei P. Zhang J. Dowhan D.H. Han Y. Moore D.D.

Global gene expression analysis has shown that CAR regulates phase I and II pathways of oxidative metabolism, conjugation, and transport (15Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Recent studies utilizing phenobarbital have also demonstrated a CAR-dependent repression of genes involved in aspects of energy metabolism, including glucose synthesis and fatty acid oxidation (16Ueda A.

To understand the action of CAR on genes involved in energy homeostasis, we sought to identify a physiological function beyond its role as a xenosensor. Experimental Animals and Protocols—All procedures performed were in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and United States Department of Agriculture regulations and approved by the Glaxo-SmithKline Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Car-null mice were generated by Deltagen, Inc. (Redwood City, CA; www.deltagen.com/deltaone) by homologous recombination using a targeting vector that deletes nucleotides 38–159 of the Car open reading frame. This targeting event removes the first zinc finger of the DNA binding domain and results in a frameshift. The resulting protein product is expected to have neither the genomic nor non-genomic properties (e.g. ability to recruit cofactor proteins to the ligand-binding domain) of wild-type CAR. Embryonic stem cells derived from the 129/Sv-+P+Mgf-SLJ/J mouse substrain were used to generate chimeric mice. F1 mice were generated by breeding with C57BL/6 females. Offspring were screened by PCR analysis of DNA obtained from tail biopsies to identify those heterozygous for the mutant Car allele. The heterozygous offspring were then intercrossed to obtain mice homozygous for the Car mutation and wild-type littermate controls. Car–/– mice were normal in terms of gross morphology and bred with normal Mendelian characteristics. The characterization of this strain of Car–/– mice has been described previously (15Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Mice were maintained on standard laboratory chow and allowed food and water ad libitum. Differential Gene Expression Analysis—Male 10–12-week-old Car–/– and wild-type mice (4–5 mice/group) were utilized for gene expression analysis. For the 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) studies, wild-type or CAR-null mice were treated with the CAR-selective ligand TCPOBOP i.p. at 0.3 mg/kg once daily for 7 days, at which time blood and livers were harvested. For the fasting studies, food was removed from the mice (from both wild-type and Car–/– groups) at midnight on day 1, and the mice were fasted for 24 h. Livers and blood were harvested at 24 h. Total RNA from liver samples was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blot analysis was performed exactly as described previously (12Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized to 32P-labeled cDNAs corresponding to CYP2B10 (bases 7–1527) of the published cDNA (Gen-Bank™ accession number NM_009998), mSULT1A1 (bases 561–1300) of the published cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_001055), mSULT-N (bases 98–985) of the published cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF026073), and mUGT1a1 (bases 51–606) of the published cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_145079). The blots were subsequently probed with radiolabeled r18S (bases 293–970) of the published cDNA (GenBank™ accession number X01117) or β-actin (Clontech). Signal intensity was quantitated using IMAGEQUANT software (Amersham Biosciences). Values were normalized for expression of either β-actin (TCPOBOP study) or r18S RNA (fasting study). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) analysis was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System instrument and software (PE Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) exactly as described previously (15Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Primers and probes were designed using Primer Express Version 2.0.0 (Applied Biosystems) and synthesized by Keystone Laboratories (Camarillo, CA). All primers and probes were entered into the NCBI Blast program to ensure specificity. Fold induction values were calculated by subtracting the mean threshold cycle number (Ct) for each treatment group from the mean Ct for the vehicle group and raising 2 to the power of this difference. For animal studies, the average of each treatment group (4–5 animals/group) was used. Serum Analysis—Total serum T3 and T4 analysis was performed by Anilytics, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Total serum T4 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX). Quantitative Nuclear Magnetic Resonance—Quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance was performed on individual, unanesthetized animals using an EchoMRI Whole Body Composition Analyzer (EchoMedical Systems, Houston, TX). Caloric Restriction Studies—Car–/– mice and wild-type siblings (8 animals/group) were fed regular chow ad libitum for 3 months. Mice were then single-caged and fed an AIN-93 M diet (Bio-Serv) in 1-g pellets using a pellet feeding tube. Semipurified diet (17Reeves P.G. Nielsen F.H. Fahey Jr., G.C. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (6640) Google Scholar) was used rather than nonpurified (i.e. lab chow) because the latter is comprised of less refined foodstuffs than that found in a semipurified diet and more prone to being contaminated by nonnutritive substances. The animals ad libitum regular chow average consumption (total kcal) was calculated to be 13.3 kcal/day, and this was used as the measured normal diet control value in the caloric restriction studies. The animals were then divided into two groups, with half being fed a 40% reduced calorie diet of 8 kcal/day (16 × 1-g pellets/week). The number of calories we calculated for a 40% reduced calorie diet is in good agreement with averages from other studies (18Pugh T. Klopp R. Weindruch R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The animals were weighed weekly for 3 months. Effects of CAR Agonist on TH Levels—In rats, chronic treatment with the CAR activators phenobarbital and TCPOBOP has been shown to markedly lower T4 levels (19O'Connor J.C. Frame S.R. Ladics G.S. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 69: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Diwan B.A. Henneman J.R. Rice J.M. Nims R.W. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TH lowering by TCPOBOP was shown to be dramatic enough to lead to compensatory thyroid hyperplasia (20Diwan B.A. Henneman J.R. Rice J.M. Nims R.W. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using CAR-null mice, we examined whether the effects of TCPOBOP on TH levels were receptor-dependent. Mice were treated with TCPOBOP (i.p., 0.3 mg/kg) for 7 days, and total serum T3 and T4 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After a 7-day TCPOBOP treatment, decreases in the average concentrations of serum T3 and T4 levels were seen in the wild-type mice (Fig. 2A), but only the decrease in T4 levels was statistically significant. Average T4 levels decreased 27% (p < 0.005 in the T4 samples) in these animals. In contrast, no statistically significant changes in serum T3 or T4 were observed in TCPOBOP-treated Car–/– mice (Fig. 2A). The serum levels of both T3 and T4 in untreated wild-type mice are consistent with previously published values (21Hood A. Allen M.L. Liu Y. Liu J. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 188: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Vansell N.R. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 65: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Serum levels of TSH were also measured after this study and shown to increase by 33% (p = 0.03) in wild-type mice, whereas no significant increases were seen in Car–/– mice (data not shown). These results are consistent with the fact that T4 (a key regulator of the negative feedback loop controlling thyroid hormone homeostasis) is decreased only in wild-type mice. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis that TCPOBOP is effecting decreases in T4 by causing increased metabolism, rather than decreasing its synthesis. CAR target genes were assessed after the 7-day TCPOBOP treatment. With the exception of the prototypical CAR target gene, Cyp2b10, our analysis was biased toward genes previously linked to TH metabolism. Northern blot analysis revealed that the TCPOBOP treatment resulted in induction of Cyp2b10 (56-fold), Ugt1a1 (2.4-fold), SultN (6.8-fold), and Sult1a1 (1.5-fold). None of these gene changes were observed in TCPOBOP-treated Car–/– mice (Fig. 2B). We also examined the expression of the Sult2a1 gene. For this analysis, we used RT-QPCR due to the high sequence identity of this gene to other sulfotransferases. We observed that Sult2a1 was strongly induced (∼20-fold) after the 7-day TCPOBOP treatment in wild-type mice, but not in Car–/– mice (Fig. 2C). TH Levels during Fasting Are Dysregulated in Car–/– Mice—To identify a physiological role for CAR in TH metabolism, the effect of food deprivation was studied. Serum T3 and T4 levels in Car–/– mice and sibling wild-type mice were compared under standard feeding and 24-h fasted conditions. After a 24-h fast, a significant difference in serum T4 and T3 levels was observed in wild-type versus Car–/– mice (Fig. 3A). T3 and T4 levels decreased by 39% (p < 0.005) and 36% (p < 0.05), respectively, after a 24-h fast in wild-type mice. The magnitude of these changes is consistent with previously published mouse studies (23Wu S.Y. Acta Endocrinol. 1990; 122: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, the fasted Car–/– mice did not show statistically significant changes in either T3 or T4. The Car–/– mice had an average T3 relative decrease of only 24% and an average T4 decrease of 12%, but p values for both were >0.05 (Fig. 3A). These experiments suggested that CAR activity is required for the full response in TH metabolism during fasting. CAR Target Gene Expression Increases during Fasting—The mouse Cyp2b10 gene is a prototypical CAR target gene (24Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 25Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6043-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). We found that Cyp2b10 expression is increased during fasting in a CAR-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Northern blot analysis showed that Cyp2b10 is induced ∼7-fold over basal levels after 24 h of fasting (Fig. 3B). No increase in Cyp2b10 was observed in Car–/– mice. These results are consistent with previous studies that showed the CYP2B gene is induced upon fasting in rats (26Brown B.L. Allis J.W. Simmons J.E. House D.E. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 81: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As described earlier, the phase II glucuronidation and sulfotransferase enzymes play important roles in the regulation of extrathyroidal metabolism of TH. Both of these classes of genes have previously been shown to be induced by the CAR agonist TCPOBOP in mice (Fig. 1) (15Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). We investigated whether CAR-dependent increases in known mouse sulfotransferase genes occur upon fasting. The sulfotransferases examined included Sult-N, Sult-X1, Sult-1A1, Sult-1B1, Sult-2B1, and Sult2a1 (27Glatt H. Engelke C.E. Pabel U. Teubner W. Jones A.L. Coughtrie M.W. Andrae U. Falany C.N. Meinl W. Toxicol. Lett. 2000; 112–113: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Characterization of these genes was carried out by both Northern blot analysis and RT-QPCR. Three of the sulfotransferase genes were induced by fasting and in a CAR-dependent manner. Sult-N has previously been shown to be induced by TCPOBOP in mouse liver (15Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that during fasting, Sult-N was increased ∼4-fold, but no increase was seen in Car–/– mice (Fig. 3B). Sult1a1 expression was also shown to increase during fasting (Fig. 3B). SULT1A1 mRNA levels increased ∼2-fold during fasting but were not induced in the Car–/– mice. Finally, using RT-QPCR, we found that Sult2a1 was induced 4-fold by fasting in wild-type but not Car–/– animals (Fig. 3C). Our results suggest that induction of phase II sulfotransferase enzymes is one of the primary pathways for CAR-dependent increases in T4 metabolism during fasting. The expression of the major mRNA isoforms expressed from the Ugt1a gene (UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, and UGT1A9) was probed by Northern blot. Both the bilirubin UGT1A1 and the phenol UGT1A9 enzymes have been shown to glucuronidate T4 (28Findlay K.A. Kaptein E. Visser T.J. Burchell B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 2879-2883PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Ugt1a1 was modestly induced during fasting (1.5-fold increase) and that the induction was CAR-dependent (Fig. 3B). Ugt1a6, Ugt1a7, and Ugt1a9 were not induced by fasting in Car–/– mice, although Ugt1a7 and Ugt1a9 exhibited increased basal expression levels in the knockout mice. We conclude that the induction of phase II glucuronidation of TH by Ugt1a1 upon fasting is a CAR-mediated process that may also contribute to the TH phenotype. Caloric Restriction Study—Lowering of T3 and T4 levels during caloric restriction opposes weight loss. To assess whether the higher levels of thyroid hormones seen in Car–/– during caloric restriction were physiologically significant, we challenged Car–/– and wild-type littermates with a reduced calorie diet (an approximately 40% decrease in daily calorie intake) for 12 weeks. Statistically significant differences in the weights of the animals were observed at the end of the study (Fig. 4A). The wild-type animals lost an average of 2.8 g of weight, whereas the Car–/– lost an average of 6.9 g (p = 0.044), or >20% of their starting body weights. Thus, by 12 weeks, the Car–/– animals lost 2.5× as much weight as wild-type animals. Analysis of the weights of the animals during the course of the study revealed that the Car–/– mice lost weight for a longer period of time before reaching a plateau in weight. No differences in total serum T3 between wild-type and Car–/– mice were observed at the end of the study. At the end of the study, QNMR analysis was used to quantify lean mass and fat mass/total body weight. Changes in fat mass/total body weight were observed after caloric restriction in both wild-type (39% decrease) and Car–/– animals (46% decrease) (Fig. 4B). Similarly, corresponding changes in the lean mass/total body weight were also observed after caloric restriction in wild-type (32% increase) and Car–/– animals (50% increase) (Fig. 4B). Both of the ratios were consistent with the fact that Car–/– animals lost more weight versus wild-type animals. Importantly, these data indicate that the weight loss observed in the Car–/– animals was normal loss of stored fat from adipose tissue and not lean mass. In the current study, three sulfotransferase genes (Sult1a1, SultN, and Sult2a1) were induced in a CAR-dependent manner during fasting. The phase II sulfotransferase enzymes have previously been shown to be important contributors to extrathyroidal metabolism of TH (29Rutgers M. Pigmans I.G. Bonthuis F. Docter R. Visser T.J. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The human SULT1A1 gene, the functional ortholog of mouse Sult1a1 (30Honma W. Kamiyama Y. Yoshinari K. Sasano H. Shimada M. Nagata K. Yamazoe Y. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 274-281PubMed Google Scholar), has been extensively characterized (31Kong A.N. Ma M. Tao D. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1171: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both human SULT1A1 and CAR are expressed in the tissues that show the highest distribution of TH sulfation activity (32Hurd R.E. Santini F. Lee B. Naim P. Chopra I.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1951-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Human SULT1A1 has been shown to sulfate TH in vitro (33Li X. Clemens D.L. Cole J.R. Anderson R.J. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 171: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and it shows a higher affinity for iodothyronines compared with the closely related SULT1A3 isozyme (34Kester M.H. Kaptein E. Roest T.J. van Dijk C.H. Tibboel D. Meinl W. Glatt H. Coughtrie M.W. Visser T.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 1357-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, SULT-N has only recently been described, and its activity as a T4 sulfotransferase has not been elucidated. However, the fact that SULT-N is closely related to SULT1A1 (35Sakakibara Y. Takami Y. Zwieb C. Nakayama T. Suiko M. Nakajima H. Liu M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggests that this enzyme will have similar substrate specificity. Finally, SULT2A1 has recently been shown to exhibit low Km values for TH relative to other members of the human SULT family and is known to contribute to triiodothyronine sulfation (36Li X. Anderson R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There are several potential mechanisms for the nutritional regulation of CAR activity. In mouse primary hepatocytes and in mouse liver in vivo, CAR resides in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus upon activation (37Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Induction of CAR nuclear translocation does not require ligand binding, and phenobarbital has been shown to be an indirect activator in vivo through a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade (37Kawamoto T. Sueyoshi T. Zelko I. Moore R. Washburn K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6318-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may be utilized to regulate CAR translocation during fasting upon receipt of a signal from the cell surface. However, at present, the nature of this signal is unknown. Interestingly, the increases in CAR target genes during fasting are much less robust compared with the dramatic changes induced by the potent agonist TCPOBOP. This fact indicates that the mode of activation of CAR during fasting is more likely to be induced translocation of the receptor rather than activation by a hormonal ligand or metabolite. Interestingly, CAR activation may be related to the status of PGC-1α, a fasting-induced transcriptional cofactor that plays a critical role in regulating multiple aspects of energy metabolism (38Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Shiraki et al. (39Shiraki T. Sakai N. Kanaya E. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11344-11350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have recently shown that there is a functional coupling of CAR and PGC-1α in cells. We have also shown that PGC-1α can interact specifically with CAR in mammalian two-hybrid assays. 2J. M. Maglich, J. Watson, P. J. McMillen, B. Goodwin, T. M. Willson, and J. T. Moore, unpublished data. It is possible that CAR activation during fasting may be functionally related to induction of PGC-1α expression. Although our data demonstrate that CAR is required for the full decrease in T3 and T4 levels upon fasting, it is notable that a partial response was still observed in the CAR knockout mice, indicating that other mechanisms contribute to the process. The mechanisms leading to reduced plasma T3 appear to differ between humans and rats. For example, rats display an increased reliance on decreased TSH secretion during caloric restriction to effect decreased production of T3 and T3 (40Kinlaw W.B. Schwartz H.L. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 75: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, in rodents, TSH may play a role in the observed partial decrease in TH even after short-term caloric restriction. Another potential candidate is the related xenosensor PXR, which has also been shown to regulate Ugt and Sult gene expression (15Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). However, we only observed small changes during fasting in the expression of Cyp3a11 (data not shown), a target gene primarily regulated by PXR in mice (41Moore L.B. Parks D.J. Jones S.A. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Stimmel J.B. Goodwin B. Liddle C. Blanchard S.G. Willson T.M. Collins J.L. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15122-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that PXR is responsible for the partial decrease in T3 levels in the fasted CAR knockout mice. We observed CAR-dependent increases in Ugt1a1 gene expression during fasting. UGT1A1 has been shown to play a role in TH metabolism (22Vansell N.R. Klaassen C.D. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 65: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 42Vansell N.R. Klaassen C.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and both T4 and T3-glucuronides of TH are excreted in the bile (43Visser T.J. Greer M.A. The Thyroid Gland. Raven Press, New York1990: 255-283Google Scholar). In general, Ugt1a1 was not induced strongly by CAR during fasting. Consistent with this observation, treatment of wild-type mice with the potent CAR agonist TCPOBOP induced hepatic Ugt1a1 expression only 2–3-fold (Fig. 2B) (15Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Because we could detect only a relatively small change in a single glucuronidase compared with the larger increases in expression of multiple sulfotransferases, it is likely that the latter provide the major pathway for regulation of TH metabolism during fasting in mice. Because we only assessed a single time point after fasting (24 h), other significant gene expression changes may have occurred that were not captured in our analysis. For example, we only detected a modest (<2-fold) increase in hepatic deiodinase type I after a 24-h fast or after our 7-day TCPOBOP treatment (data not shown), but another group has shown that TCPOBOP induces this gene 4.9-fold after 3 h of treatment (44Locker J. Tian J. Carver R. Concas D. Cossu C. Ledda-Columbano G.M. Columbano A. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CAR is closely related to the xenobiotic receptor PXR, and it is noteworthy that TH metabolism and xenobiotic metabolism share common features. Multiple phase II enzymes show broad substrate specificity and are able to metabolize a range of xenobiotics and thyroid hormones. Furthermore, the major sites of xenobiotic and TH metabolism include liver, intestine, and brain, the same tissues in which CAR expression is highest. PXR and CAR have been shown to activate largely overlapping sets of genes in comparative global gene expression studies in mice (15Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Thus, it is the activation signals, not the target genes, that appear to differentiate the physiological roles of these receptors. In head-to-head comparisons, PXR was shown to be directly activated by a diverse spectrum of xenobiotics, whereas CAR was not (45Moore L.B. Maglich J.M. McKee D.D. Wisely B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Lambert M.H. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Significantly, CAR has also been shown to respond to another metabolic stress, hyperbilirubinemia (46Huang W. Zhang J. Chua S.S. Qatanani M. Han Y. Granata R. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4156-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 47Xie W. Yeuh M.F. Radominska-Pandya A. Saini S.P. Negishi Y. Bottroff B.S. Cabrera G.Y. Tukey R.H. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4150-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), through an indirect mechanism that does not require ligand binding. The ability of CAR to respond to a wide range of non-ligand-mediated signals may have allowed this receptor to develop a specialized function distinct from a PXR-like progenitor. Hence, whereas the predominant role of PXR is to coordinate a response to xenobiotic stress, the role of CAR may be to respond to metabolic and nutritional stress. Overall, our studies have shown that CAR is activated during fasting and required for the normal decrease in T3 and T4 levels. Thus, CAR inverse agonists represent potentially useful drugs because their activity may provide a therapeutic approach to uncouple metabolic rate from food intake. The caloric restriction studies using Car–/– animals support the concept that inhibiting CAR activity can have significant effects on weight loss. It is likely that decreases in thyroid hormone are ultimately lowered to equal levels by decreases in TSH, a known response to fasting in rodents (40Kinlaw W.B. Schwartz H.L. Oppenheimer J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 75: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because of species differences in thyroid hormone metabolism, it will also be important to test this hypothesis in a chronic weight loss model in primates or human clinical studies. The only CAR inverse agonist active in a human system that has been reported to date is androstanol, and this compound is not sufficiently orally available or receptor-selective for such studies, emphasizing a need to identify new human CAR inverse agonists."

https://openalex.org/W1983349903,"Eukaryotic cells tightly control DNA replication so that replication origins fire only once during S phase within the same cell cycle. Cell cycle-regulated degradation of the replication licensing factor Cdt1 plays important roles in preventing more than one round of DNA replication per cell cycle. We have previously shown that the SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitination pathway plays an important role in Cdt1 degradation. In this study, we demonstrate that human Cdt1 is a substrate of Cdk2 and Cdk4 both in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 and p27 dramatically suppresses the phosphorylation of Cdt1, disrupts the interaction of Cdt1 with the F-box protein Skp2, and blocks the degradation of Cdt1. Further analysis reveals that Cdt1 interacts with cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes through a cyclin/Cdk binding consensus site, located at the N terminus of Cdt1. A Cdt1 mutant carrying four amino acid substitutions at the Cdk binding site dramatically reduces associations with cyclin/Cdk complexes. This mutant is not phosphorylated, fails to bind Skp2 and is more stable than wild-type Cdt1. These data suggest that cyclin/Cdk-mediated Cdt1 phosphorylation is required for the association of Cdt1 with the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase and thus is important for the cell cycle dependent degradation of Cdt1 in mammalian cells."

The apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is a protein that is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and has been demonstrated to protect the heart against I/R injury (Gustafsson, A. B., Sayen, M. R., Williams, S. D., Crow, M. T., and Gottlieb, R. A. (2002) Circulation 106, 735-739). In this study, we have shown that transduction of TAT-ARCL31F, a mutant of ARC in the caspase recruitment domain, did not reduce creatine kinase release and infarct size after I/R. TAT-ARCL31F also failed to protect against hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell death in H9c2 cells, suggesting that the caspase recruitment domain is important in mediating ARC's protective effects. In addition, we report that ARC co-immunoprecipitated with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, which causes cytochrome c release when activated. TAT-ARC, but not TAT-ARCL31F, prevented Bax activation and cytochrome c release in hydrogen peroxide-treated H9c2 cells. TAT-ARC was also effective in blocking cytochrome c release after ischemia and reperfusion, whereas TAT-ARCL31F had no effect on cytochrome c release. In addition, recombinant ARC protein abrogated Bax-induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. This suggests that ARC can protect against cell death by interfering with activation of the mitochondrial death pathway through the interaction with Bax, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and release of pro-apoptotic factors. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is associated with an extensive loss of myocardial cells. The apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is a protein that is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and has been demonstrated to protect the heart against I/R injury (Gustafsson, A. B., Sayen, M. R., Williams, S. D., Crow, M. T., and Gottlieb, R. A. (2002) Circulation 106, 735-739). In this study, we have shown that transduction of TAT-ARCL31F, a mutant of ARC in the caspase recruitment domain, did not reduce creatine kinase release and infarct size after I/R. TAT-ARCL31F also failed to protect against hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell death in H9c2 cells, suggesting that the caspase recruitment domain is important in mediating ARC's protective effects. In addition, we report that ARC co-immunoprecipitated with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, which causes cytochrome c release when activated.

This suggests that ARC can protect against cell death by interfering with activation of the mitochondrial death pathway through the interaction with Bax, preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and release of pro-apoptotic factors. Apoptosis plays an important role in the cardiovascular system in the process of homeostasis and development but also plays a role in the pathogenesis of certain diseases. Apoptosis is implicated in the death of myocytes in animal models of myocardial ischemia (2Gottlieb R.A. Burleson K.O. Kloner R.A. Babior B.M. Engler R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), in humans with acute myocardial infarction (3Saraste A. Pulkki K. Kallajoki M. Henriksen K. Parvinen M. Voipio-Pulkki L.

Even though it is clear that the extensive death of cardiac myocytes after I/R 1The abbreviations used are: I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; ARC, apoptosis repressor with CARD; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. contributes to the decline of ventricular function and mortality, the pathways that initiate apoptosis during I/R in the heart are poorly understood. Studies have suggested that many factors, including Bcl-2 homologous proteins, ATP depletion, acidosis, calcium fluxes, and reactive oxygen species, cause cytochrome c release and apoptosis during I/R in cardiac myocytes (6Misao J.

Apoptosis repressor with CARD (ARC) is a ∼22 kDa protein expressed at high levels in heart and skeletal muscle (13Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). ARC was initially reported to interact with caspase-2 and -8 and to inhibit apoptosis induced by caspase-8 and receptor-induced apoptosis by Fas and TNF-R1, leading to the proposal that ARC protects by interfering with the function of initiator caspases (13Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 14Li P.F. Li J. Muller E.C. Otto A. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, other studies have reported that ARC-mediated protection may not necessarily operate through the inhibition of caspases. For instance, ARC suppressed hypoxia-induced apoptosis by inhibiting cytochrome c release from the mitochondria in a caspase-independent manner (15Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius F. C. $$ Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: E70-E77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ARC overexpression inhibited oxidant stress-induced cell death in H9c2 cells by preserving mitochondrial function independently of caspase inhibition, suggesting that ARC might act at the level of the mitochondria (16Neuss M. Monticone R. Lundberg M.S. Chesley A.T. Fleck E. Crow M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33915-33922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We recently reported that ARC can protect against I/R injury, where perfusion of TAT-ARC into isolated rat hearts reduced both creatine kinase release and infarct size (1Gustafsson A.B. Sayen M.R. Williams S.D. Crow M.T. Gottlieb R.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that ARC might interfere with the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in ischemia. Apoptosis that occurs through the mitochondrial pathway is partly regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins. Expression of Bcl-2 family proteins has been described in both developing and adult cardiac myocytes (6Misao J. Hayakawa Y. Ohno M. Kato S. Fujiwara T. Fujiwara H. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1506-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 17Cook S.A. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Kang P.M.

Bax is a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that translocates to the mitochondria in response to death stimuli, causing cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (21Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L.

In this study, we have examined the role of ARC and ARCL31F in I/R injury and hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death and their effect on Bax. We demonstrate that the CARD domain is important in mediating the protective effects of ARC. In addition, we report that ARC interacts with Bax, which prevents its activation and subsequent cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant TAT-fusion proteins were expressed and purified under denaturing conditions as described previously (1Gustafsson A.B. Sayen M.R. Williams S.D. Crow M.T. Gottlieb R.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). His-tagged ARC and ARCL31F were purified under native conditions. In brief, cells from 1-liter cultures were resuspended in native buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and 300 mm NaCl), followed by sonication. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatants were added to columns containing nickel-nitriloacetic acid (Qiagen). The resin was washed with native buffer plus 20 mm imidazole and the proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer, followed by de-salting on PD-10 columns (Amersham Bisociences). GST-Bax (1-171) was grown in BL21(DE) cells (Invitrogen) and expression was induced with 0.75 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h. The bacteria were recovered by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS and protease inhibitors and sonicated on ice. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 30 min on a rocker at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was mixed with glutathione-Agarose (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with PBS, and the protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Langendorff Perfusion and Ischemia/Reperfusion—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (225-250g) were anesthetized, and hearts were rapidly excised and cannulated onto the Langendorff perfusion apparatus using a protocol adapted from Tsuchida et al. (24Tsuchida A. Liu Y. Liu G.S. Cohen M.V. Downey J.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The hearts were perfused with Krebs-Ringer buffer (with or without 50 nm TAT protein) at a constant pressure of 60 mm Hg. Perfused hearts were stabilized for 20 min before being subjected to 30 min of global ischemia and up to 120 min of reperfusion. The creatine kinase activity in the coronary effluent was measured using a diagnostic kit (Sigma) and infarct size was measured using triphenyl tetrazolium staining (1Gustafsson A.B. Sayen M.R. Williams S.D. Crow M.T. Gottlieb R.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The Scripps Research Institute. Preparation of Mitochondria and Cytosol—At the end of perfusion, the ventricles were minced and briefly homogenized with the use of a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Basel, Switzerland) in ice-cold buffer A (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin). The homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g to remove unbroken tissue and nuclei, and the supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 × g to pellet mitochondria. The supernatant was further centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to obtain cytosol. The mitochondrial pellet was washed twice in buffer A and resuspended in incubation buffer containing 180 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm KH2PO4, and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Rat hearts were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were incubated with anti-Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.), anti-Bax6A7 (BD Pharmingen), or anti-ARC (H-150) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) overnight at 4 °C. The next morning, 25 μl of protein G-agarose (for monoclonal antibodies) or protein A-agarose (for polyclonal antibodies) were added to the lysates and incubated on rocker for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in PBS and resuspended in 40 μl of 2× sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-Bax or anti-ARC (CT) (Alexis Biochemicals). The protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie blue binding assay (Pierce Chemical) with bovine serum albumin standards. Immunofluorescence—Rat heart-derived H9c2 cells were grown on microscope slides for 48 h before transduction with TAT-linked proteins. TAT-fusion proteins were added to the cells for 1 h followed by treatment with hydrogen peroxide. For analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential and nuclear morphology, live cells were stained with 1 μg/ml Rhodamine 123 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at the end of the treatment period, rinsed once with media, and co-stained with 30 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for the last 5 min, followed by washing of cells with PBS. Images of 10 random fields totaling 500-1000 cells were captured and analyzed using MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging). Membrane potential was measured as the ratio of total fluorescence of Rhodamine 123 to the number of nuclei in each field. Percentage nuclear condensation was measured as the number of nuclei with saturating fluorescence divided by the total number of nuclei in each field. For Bax immunofluorescence, H9c2 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde after treatment with hydrogen peroxide, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBS. The cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-Bax NT (1:100; Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-COX IV (1:100; Molecular Probes) in blocking solution, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody coupled to Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes). After a 1-h incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS; in the last wash, 30 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 was added to the cells. All images were captured with a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope (Nikon) and digitally collected with a Spot2 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Cytochrome c Release Assays—H9c2 cells seeded on 150-mm dishes were transduced with 800 nm of TAT-ARC or TAT-ARCL31F for 1 h in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Earle's medium for 1 h and then treated with 600 or 800 μm H2O2 for 4 h. At the end of the treatment, cells were collected by trypsinization, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of buffer B (100 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm triethanolamine, and 5% Percoll). The cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 420 p.s.i. for 5 min, and sucrose was added to the fractionated cells to a final concentration of 300 mm. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet mitochondria. The pellets were resuspended in buffer C (300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4), washed twice, and finally resuspended in 40 μl of buffer C. Equal amounts of mitochondrial protein were loaded onto 10-20% Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Cytochrome c was identified by anti-cytochrome c antibody (BD Biosciences) and voltage-dependent anion channel by anti-Porin antibody (Calbiochem). For Bax-mediated cytochrome c release studies, mitochondria were isolated from rat hearts as described above. Purified recombinant Bax (1 μg) was pre-incubated with or without recombinant ARC or ARCL31F (10 μm) for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples were then mixed with 40 μg of mitochondria at 30 °C for 3 h in a final volume of 60 μl. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets and supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting for cytochrome c. For in vitro Bax binding, 400 ng of recombinant Bax was combined with 1 μg ARC or ARCL31F in Incubation Buffer. After a 1-h incubation at 30 °C, 500 μl of lysis buffer was added to each binding mixture. Samples were agitated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 5 μg of anti-Bax6A7. Protein G-agarose (25 μl) was added to each sample, incubated for 2 h, recovered by centrifugation, and washed four times in ice-cold PBS. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by addition of 50 μl of 2× sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Effect of TAT-ARC and TAT-ARCL31F on Myocardial Injury—The CARD is a sequence that is present in many proteins involved in the regulation of cell death pathways and is believed to mediate signaling through protein-protein interaction (25Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CARD is important in mediating the protective effects of ARC in I/R injury, we perfused hearts with TAT-ARC or TAT-ARCL31F, a point mutant of ARC with a single amino acid change in the conserved region of the CARD. Mutation of this conserved leucine residue in other CARD-containing proteins has previously been shown to lead to a disruption of conformation and protein binding (26Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 27Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). As reported previously (1Gustafsson A.B. Sayen M.R. Williams S.D. Crow M.T. Gottlieb R.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and as shown in Fig. 1, perfusion with TAT-ARC significantly reduced both infarct size and creatine kinase release after I/R. In contrast, perfusion of hearts with TAT-ARCL31F did not reduce creatine kinase release or infarct size after I/R, suggesting that the CARD domain is important for ARC function in mediating a protective effect in the heart. Effect of TAT-ARC and TAT-ARCL31F on Mitochondria—ARC has been shown to inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in H9c2 cells (1Gustafsson A.B. Sayen M.R. Williams S.D. Crow M.T. Gottlieb R.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Neuss M. Monticone R. Lundberg M.S. Chesley A.T. Fleck E. Crow M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33915-33922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CARD is important in protecting against oxidative stress, we investigated whether TAT-ARCL31F could protect against H2O2-induced cell death. Fig. 2 shows that treatment of H9c2 cells with hydrogen peroxide caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and nuclear condensation and that TAT-ARCL31F did not protect H9c2 cells against hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell death and, in some experiments, exacerbated the effects, raising the possibility that it interferes with the action of endogenous ARC. These results demonstrate that the CARD domain of ARC is important in protecting against oxidative stress. Heterodimerization of ARC with Bax—Mitochondria are the primary sites of action of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that respond to cellular stress by causing the release of apoptosis-promoting factors, including cytochrome c, from the mitochondria. Because overexpression of ARC can protect the mitochondria and prevent cytochrome c release in response to oxidative stress and hypoxia (15Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius F. C. $$ Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: E70-E77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Neuss M. Monticone R. Lundberg M.S. Chesley A.T. Fleck E. Crow M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33915-33922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ARC might have an effect on the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in the heart. To determine whether ARC directly associates with Bax, we examined the interaction between ARC and Bax in the heart by immunoprecipitation of Bax from rat heart lysate and then analysis of the precipitate by immunoblotting for coprecipitation of ARC. In a reciprocal experiment, ARC immunoprecipitate was analyzed for co-IP of Bax. As shown in Fig. 3A, ARC was present in the precipitate obtained by using anti-Bax, and Bax was seen in the anti-ARC immunoprecipitates. In addition, to determine whether Bax associates with TAT-ARC, we perfused rat hearts with TAT-β-galactosidase (TAT-β-gal), TAT-ARC, or TAT-ARCL31F, followed by homogenization and immunoprecipitation of Bax. Immunoblotting of Bax precipitate with an anti-HA antibody revealed that both TAT-ARC and TAT-ARCL31F, but not TAT-β-gal, co-immunoprecipitated with Bax (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that there could be a direct interaction between ARC and Bax and that this interaction might interfere with Bax activation. Effects of ARC on Bax Activation and Cytochrome c Release—To examine whether Bax activation can be inhibited by ARC, we treated H9c2 cells with TAT-ARC or TAT-ARCL31F followed by 2 h of hydrogen peroxide. We assessed activation of Bax using an antibody that preferentially recognizes the active conformation of Bax (28Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of cells subjected to hydrogen peroxide treatment demonstrated an increase in immunoreactivity for activated Bax (Fig. 4A). TAT-ARC treatment before hydrogen peroxide prevented the increase in Bax immunoreactivity, suggesting that ARC inhibits hydrogen peroxide-induced Bax activation. In contrast, TAT-ARCL31F failed to prevent the increase in Bax immunoreactivity hydrogen peroxide-treated cells. The appearance of Bax immunoreactivity in intact cells correlates with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (28Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 29Thomenius M.J. Distelhorst C.W. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14461-14468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We assessed cytochrome c release in H9c2 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide and determined whether the presence of ARC or ARCL31F would inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced cytochrome c release. Hydrogen peroxide treatment resulted in the loss of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in H9c2 cells, whereas cells transduced with TAT-ARC did not release cytochrome c from the mitochondria after hydrogen peroxide treatment (Fig. 4B). Hydrogen peroxide treatment was still able to elicit cytochrome c release in the presence of TAT-ARCL31F. Likewise, we found that the amount of cytochrome c increased in the cytosol in rat hearts subjected to I/R (Fig. 5A). Hearts perfused with TAT-ARC, but not TAT-ARCL31F, exhibited reduced cytochrome c release after I/R. These data suggest that ARC is blocking cytochrome c release by inhibiting Bax activation in the ischemic heart. To determine whether ARC could directly inhibit Bax-induced cytochrome c release, we investigated the ability of ARC to inhibit cytochrome c release from mitochondria isolated from the rat heart. Addition of recombinant Bax directly to mitochondria in vitro results in the release of cytochrome c (23Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 5B show that Bax induced cytochrome c release from isolated heart mitochondria. Pre-incubation of Bax with recombinant purified ARC reduced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria, confirming that the major effect of ARC in these mitochondria is to interfere with Bax function (Fig. 5B). In contrast, ARCL31F did not interfere with the effects of Bax on isolated mitochondria. We compared the ability of ARC and ARCL31F to bind to recombinant Bax. Consistent with the results obtained with the endogenous proteins immunoprecipitated from ischemic and reperfused heart (Fig. 3B), we found that both forms of ARC bound to Bax in a reconstituted system consisting of only the recombinant proteins (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the interaction between ARC and Bax does not depend upon the intact CARD domain, but the ability of ARC to block Bax function is CARD dependent. In addition, it reveals that accessory or bridging proteins are not required for the interaction. ARC is expressed at high levels in the heart, consistent with the need to prevent apoptosis in the terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. We have previously shown that increasing the levels of ARC through TAT-mediated protein transduction can reduce the incidence of cell death after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. In the present study, we have begun to evaluate the basis for cardioprotection. We show that the CARD domain of ARC is essential for its protective effect; mutation of Leu to Phe at position 31 is sufficient to disrupt CARD function, consistent with analogous mutations in other CARD-containing proteins (26Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 27Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Preservation of mitochondrial integrity is essential for maintaining energy production and preventing apoptosis. Consistent with this, ARC was able to preserve mitochondrial membrane potential and prevent cytochrome c release in H9c2 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide and in the isolated perfused heart subjected to ischemia and reperfusion. Bax has been shown to be a key determinant of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Using hydrogen peroxide to simulate the oxidative stress of ischemia/reperfusion, we showed that Bax undergoes the conformational change of activation in H9c2 cells. ARC interacts with Bax, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous ARC and Bax. We speculated that there could be a bridging protein, such as Aven or Bar, that would form an anti-apoptotic scaffold containing ARC and Bax (31Zhang H. Xu Q. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Xie Z.

Cell. 2000; 6: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, our experiments with recombinant proteins demonstrated that ARC and Bax interact directly, without a requirement for additional proteins to bridge the two molecules. There are precedents for interactions between CARD proteins and Bcl-2 family members, such as that between Bcl-XL and Apaf-1 (33Moriishi K. Huang D.C.S. Cory S. Adams J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9683-9688Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34Song Q. Kuang Y. Dixit V. Vincenz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, the binding site for Bcl-xL seems to be within the ATPase domain of Apaf-1 (35Yajima H. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the functional significance of this interaction has been disputed (36Conus S. Rosse T. Borner C.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Likewise, the interaction between Boo/Diva and Apaf-1 does not involve the CARD domain (34Song Q. Kuang Y. Dixit V. Vincenz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We have not yet determined whether the interaction between ARC and Bax depends upon the CARD domain of ARC. The interaction between Bax and ARC is not disrupted by the L31F mutation within the CARD domain; however, the intact CARD is required to prevent Bax activation. Likewise, the intact CARD domain is required to prevent cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria incubated with Bax. Our results demonstrate that ARC preserves mitochondrial integrity through an interaction with Bax to prevent its activation. Previous work had shown that ARC interacts with caspase 8 to interfere with receptor-mediated death signaling (13Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and suppresses potassium efflux through voltage-gated Kv channels (38Ekhterae D. Platoshyn O. Zhang S. Remillard C.V. Yuan J.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1405-C1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ARC has also been shown to block necrosis by preserving mitochondrial integrity (39Yaglom J.A. Ekhterae D. Gabai V.L. Sherman M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50483-50496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that ARC prevents cell death by interfering with multiple pathways. We thank Dr. Richard N. Kitsis for stimulating discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1975046646,"A delicate balance of signals regulates cell survival. One set of these signals is derived from integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Loss of cell attachment to the ECM causes apoptosis, a process known as anoikis. In searching for proteins involved in cell adhesion-dependent regulation of anoikis, we identified Bit1, a mitochondrial protein that is released into the cytoplasm during apoptosis. Cytoplasmic Bit1 forms a complex with AES, a small Groucho/transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE) protein, and induces cell death with characteristics of caspase-independent apoptosis. Cell attachment to fibronectin counteracts the apoptotic effect of Bit1 and AES. Increasing Bit1 expression enhances anoikis, while suppressing the expression reduces it. Thus, we have elucidated an integrin-controlled pathway that is, at least in part, responsible for the cell survival effects of cell-ECM interactions."

It is shown that the potent secreted phospholipase A2 inhibitor Me-Indoxam is cell-impermeable. By use of Me-Indoxam and the cell-impermeable, secreted phospholipase A2 trapping agent heparin, it is shown that hGIIA liberates free arachidonate prior to secretion from the cell.

Immunocytochemical studies by confocal laser and electron microscopies show localization of hGIIA to the cell surface and Golgi compartment. Additional results show that the interleukin-1β-dependent release of arachidonate is promoted by secreted phospholipase A2 expression and is completely dependent on cytosolic (group IVA) phospholipase A2.

Biomedical interest in these enzymes stems from the finding that the liberation of arachidonic acid for the biosynthesis of the eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and others) is mediated in mammalian cells by one or more PLA2s. Current evidence favors a role for cytosolic phospholipase A2-α (cPLA2-α, also known as group IVA PLA2) as a major component of the arachidonate releasing signal transduction pathway (1Leslie C.C. J.

The behavior of human group IIA (hGIIA) and human group X (hGX) sPLA2s when transfected in HEK293 and CHO cells has been extensively studied. hGIIA is secreted from HEK293 cells, and most of the extracellular enzyme is associated with the cell surface. This sPLA2 is highly basic and is thought to bind to the anionic heparan sulfate chains of cell surface glypican (21Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Yamamoto S. Kuwata H. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29927-29936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), a GPI-linked proteoglycan. hGX is not a highly basic protein and accumulates in the extracellular medium when transfected in HEK293 cells (18Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Horiguchi M. Arita H. Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31435-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Whereas serum stimulates arachidonate release from both hGIIA- and hGX-transfected HEK293 cells, only the former cells show an additional increase in fatty acid release if the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is added along with serum (18Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Horiguchi M. Arita H. Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31435-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for this cytokine effect is not known. In this cell model, it has been suggested that glypican-bound hGIIA is internalized into intracellular punctate domains near the cell nucleus. That this is due to import from the cell surface into caveolae and caveolae-derived vesicles is proposed based on confocal microscopy studies showing punctate co-localization of hGIIA and caveolin-2 throughout the cytosol including the perinuclear region (21Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Yamamoto S. Kuwata H. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29927-29936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that the site of fatty acid release by hGIIA is within intracellular vesicles. In contrast, the non-heparan sulfate-binding hGX is thought to act on the extracellular face of the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells and does not accumulate in intracellular domains (18Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Horiguchi M. Arita H. Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31435-31444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether there is a biochemical connection between IL-1β-induced arachidonate release and intracellular action of hGIIA. The possibility that hGIIA acts on a cellular membrane other than the extracellular face of the plasma membrane is appealing. This is because the extracellular face of the mammalian cell plasma membrane is rich in the zwitterionic phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, and it is well established that hGIIA displays extremely low enzymatic activity toward phosphatidylcholine-rich vesicles in vitro because this enzyme cannot bind to the zwitterionic interface (22Baker S.F. Othman R. Wilton D.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13203-13211Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Bezzine S. Bollinger J.G. Veatch S.L. Keller S.L. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48523-48534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, relatively large amounts (typically >10 μg/ml) of hGIIA need to be added exogenously to mammalian cells, including HEK293 cells, to cause detectable arachidonate release (23Bezzine S. Bollinger J.G. Veatch S.L. Keller S.L. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48523-48534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, it was surprising to find that HEK293 cells stably transfected with hGIIA, which produce ng/ml amounts of enzyme, are able to liberate arachidonate. This suggests that hGIIA releases arachidonic acid within a membrane compartment that is accessible to enzyme produced by transfection but not by enzyme added exogenously to cells. The very poor ability of exogenously added hGIIA to liberate arachidonic acid from HEK293 cells is seemingly at odds with the glypican-shuttling model described above. One would anticipate that exogenously added hGIIA would bind to the heparan sulfate chains of cell surface glypican and be imported into caveolae and caveolae-derived vesicles. For example cholera toxin readily labels caveolae when added exogenously to mammalian cells (24Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Perhaps hGIIA must be preloaded onto glypican during the secretory process, and exogenously added hGIIA cannot access the heparan sulfate chains of cell surface glypican. But it is difficult to conceive that amounts of exogenously added hGIIA 3 orders of magnitude higher than those produced by transfected HEK293 cells would not lead to loading of cell surface heparan sulfate chains. It is this paradox that prompted us to further investigate the mode of action of hGIIA in transfected CHO and HEK293 cells. In marked contrast to hGIIA, hGX binds with high affinity to phosphatidylcholine-rich membranes in vitro (23Bezzine S. Bollinger J.G. Veatch S.L. Keller S.L. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48523-48534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and ng/ml amounts of exogenously added hGX are sufficient to liberate arachidonic acid from HEK293 cells and other mammalian cells (8Bezzine S. Koduri R.S. Valentin E. Murakami M. Kudo I. Ghomashchi F. Sadilek M. Lambeau G. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34203-34211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Given these observations and the fact that hGX does not bind to heparan sulfate, it has been suggested that hGX acts on the extracellular face of the plasma membrane once secreted from hGX-transfected HEK293 cells (18Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. higashino K. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Horiguchi M. Arita H. Inoue K. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Thus, we also included hGX-transfected CHO and HEK293 cells in side-by-side comparative studies with hGIIA-transfected cells. Our results show that arachidonate release by hGIIA in transfected CHO and HEK293 cells occurs prior to secretion to the extracellular fluid. Arachidonate release by hGX occurs before and after secretion from CHO cells and prior to secretion from HEK293 cells. sPLA2 action prior to secretion resolves the paradox of why hGIIA is able to release arachidonic acid in transfected cells but not when added exogenously to cells.

Porcine intestinal mucosa low molecular mass heparin (∼3,000 Da) and heparin are from Sigma (H3400 and H3149, respectively). The Golgi-specific probe NBD-C6-ceramide is from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). pgsA-745 and GPI-LA1 CHO cells were obtained as gifts from J. Esko (University of California) and F. G. van der Goot (University of Geneva), respectively. The synthesis of Me-Indoxam radiolabeled in the benzylic position, [3H]Me-Indoxam, is given in the Supplemental Material. [3H]Arachidonate (200 Ci/mmol) is from American Radiochemicals Inc. Human recombinant IL-1β is from R & D Systems and was used from small frozen aliquots, thus avoiding freeze-thaw cycles. Recombinant human cPLA2-α was prepared as described (30Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and anti-cPLA2-α antisera were obtained from C. C. Leslie (National Jewish Medical Research Center) and M. Wakelam (University of Birmingham). Cell Culture and Preparation of Stable Transfectants—CHO-K1 and HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Ham's F-12 medium with 2 mm glutamine (Sigma N6658) containing 10% FBS for CHO-K1 cells and in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen catalog number 11875–093) containing 10% FBS for HEK293 cells. For both media, 2 mm glutamine was added to working solution every 2 weeks. To prevent, cross-clone contamination, pipette tips with cotton plugs were used when handling multiple cell clones. The cells were split using trypsin/EDTA (trypsin was removed from the cell monolayer prior to adding fresh medium to minimize the degradation of cell surface proteins). The plasmid for hGIIA expression, pRc-CMV/neo-hGIIA, contains the sequence GCGGCCGCC-ATG-hGIIA-TGA-TAAAGATCT (the NotI and XbaI sites are underscored, the full-length hGIIA cDNA from start to stop codon is italicized) ligated into the NotI and XbaI sites of the pRc-CMV/neo vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid for hGX expression, pRc-CMV/neo-hGX, contains the sequence GCGGCCGCC-ATG-hGX-TGA-TCTAGA. Note that the hGX cDNA contains two potential start sites, and pRC-CMV/neo-hGX uses the downstream start site, which corresponds to the sole start site of the mouse group X sPLA2 cDNA. Thus, the N-terminal sequence of the hGX produced is MLLL. Plasmids for transfection were prepared in endotoxin-free form from bacterial cultures using the SNAP MidiPrep Kit (Invitrogen K1910-01), and DNA was quantified by optical density at 260 nm. CHO-K1 cells were transfected using OPTI-MEM® I Reduced Serum Medium and LipofectAMINE (both from Invitrogen) using the optimized procedure for these cells provided by Invitrogen. Stable transfectants were selected by limiting dilution in 96-well plates using medium containing 600 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) (an antibiotic kill curve was carried out to establish that this concentration was effective for selection). HEK293 cells were transfected as above except the optimized procedure for these cells was used (provided by Invitrogen), and the Geneticin concentration was 500 μg/ml. Maintenance cultures of stably transfected CHO-K1 and HEK293 cells were routinely grown in medium containing Geneticin, but antibiotic was omitted when cells were plated for studies or during the initial plating of frozen stocks. Site-specific mutagenesis was prepared using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), and full-length coding sequences were submitted to DNA sequencing to verify that no additional mutations were introduced. Arachidonic Acid Release Studies—CHO-K1 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/ml in 24-well plates (Nunc catalog number 143982) (1 ml medium/well). When cells reached ∼80% confluence, 0.1 μCi of [3H]arachidonate was added per well, and the cells were placed in the incubator for 20–24 h. The cells were washed three times with complete medium (medium carefully removed with a pipette rather than by aspiration) and then covered with 1 ml of medium containing the desired additives (described in the figure legends). When IL-1β was used, it was added from a freshly prepared stock of 0.1 ng/μl in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were placed in the incubator for the desired time. After the desired time, the medium was removed and centrifuged for 7 min at 3,000 rpm to pellet any dislodged cells. A 0.5-ml aliquot of the supernatant was submitted to scintillation counting. To the cell pellet in the well was added 0.5 ml of trypsin/EDTA, and the plate was placed in the incubator for 30 min. The cells were resuspended by pumping the solution up and down several times with a pipettor, and all of the liquid was submitted to scintillation counting to give the cell-associated cpm. The percentage of [3H]arachidonate release to the medium was calculated as 100 × (dpm in medium)/(dpm in medium + cell associated dpm). [3H]Arachidonate release from HEK293 cells was carried out by plating cells in 24-well plates. When cells reached ∼80% confluency, 0.1 μCi of [3H]arachidonate was added to 1 ml of complete medium in each well. The cells were placed in the incubator for 20–24 h. The medium was removed with a pipette, and the cells were covered with 1 ml of complete medium. After 5–10 min the medium was removed, and the cells were covered with 1 ml of medium containing the desired additives (described in the figure legends). The cells were placed in the incubator for the desired time period, and the percentage of total [3H]arachidonate released to the medium was determined as for CHO-K1 cells. In some studies, the cells were extracted with organic solvent to determine the amount of tritium in the neutral lipid fraction. The cells were labeled with [3H]arachidonate and stimulated as described above. After removal of the medium, the cell pellets were treated with trypsin/EDTA as above, and the cell suspension was transferred to an Eppendorf tube. An aliquot of the cell suspension (125 μl) was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube, and 370 μl of CHCl3, MeOH, 10 n HCl (200/200/1 by volume) was added followed by 460 μl of CHCl3, MeOH, H2O (1/2/0.8) and then 240 μl of CHCl3, and finally 240 μl of H2O. After mixing with a vortex mixer for ∼1 min, the tubes were centrifuged for 2 min at ∼10,000 × g to separate the solvent layers. Most of the lower layer was transferred to a glass tube, and solvent was removed with a stream of N2. Oleic acid (10 pmol) was added followed by 1 ml of low boiling petroleum ether/ethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (70/30/1, by volume). The sample was mixed on a vortex mixer for ∼30 s and loaded onto a small column of silica gel in a glass wool-plugged Pasteur pipette. The eluant was collected into a scintillation vial along with the eluant after washing the column with an additional 4 ml of the same solvent. The solvent was removed with a stream of air, and the residue was submitted to scintillation counting. In some studies, the cells were extracted with organic solvent, and the extract was analyzed for [3H]arachidonic acid after TLC on a silica plate. The cells were labeled with [3H]arachidonate and stimulated as described above. After removal of the medium, the cell pellets were treated with trypsin/EDTA as above, and the cell suspension was transferred to an Eppendorf tube. A portion of the cell suspension was extracted with organic solvent and prepared for silica gel chromatography as described above. To the extract was added ∼50 μg of nonlabeled arachidonic acid, and the solution was spotted on one lane of a 20 × 20-cm silica TLC plate. The plate was developed in a tank with n-hexane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (70:30:1 by volume). The arachidonic acid spot was located by placing the plate in a tank of iodine vapor. The spot was scrapped from the plate, the silica was transferred to a vial containing scintillation fluid and submitted to scintillation counting. sPLA2 Enzymatic Assay—sPLA2 enzymatic activity of cell culture medium was measured using a variation of the fluorimetric assay (31Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The substrate, 1-palmitoyl-2-(10-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (Molecular Probes) was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in toluene/isopropanol (1/1), and the concentration was determined from the absorbance at 342 nm (ϵ 40,000 m–1 cm–1). A 0.2-ml aliquot of substrate stock solution was concentrated to dryness with a stream of N2 followed by the addition of 1 ml of absolute ethanol (any undissolved material was removed by centrifugation at ∼14,000 × g for 2 min). After redetermination of the substrate concentration, a working solution of substrate mixture was prepared by diluting the ethanol stock of substrate into 30 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) while mixing on a vortex mixer to give a final substrate concentration of 1 μm. The 1-ml assay mixture is prepared by mixing 980 μl of substrate mixture with 10 μl of fatty acid free BSA (10 mg/ml, w/v in water; Sigma) and 10 μl of CaCl2 (1 m in water) in a fluorescence cuvette equipped with a magnetic stir bar. After the addition of tissue culture medium (typically 20–40 μl for hGIIA and 100–200 μl for hGX-transfected cells) or recombinant sPLA2, the fluorescence was monitored with excitation at 342 nm and emission at 395 nm at room temperature with stirring. The assay is calibrated to give moles of product by the addition of a standard solution of 10-pyrenedecanoic acid in ethanol to the complete assay mixture lacking sPLA2. Extraction of Cell Surface hGIIA with Salt—The cells were covered with complete medium supplemented with various amounts of NaCl (see figure legends). The cells were placed in the incubator for 15 min, and then the medium was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 7 min and 3,000 rpm to pellet any dislodged cells. The supernatant was submitted to the fluorimetric sPLA2 assay (see above) or stored at –20 °C prior to assay. Confocal Laser Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells for microscopy were grown on nitric acid-washed coverslips (12-mm diameter, #1.5; Electron Microscopy Sciences catalog number 72230-01, autoclaved before use) to 50–60% confluence, stimulated if desired, and fixed as follows. The medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were washed once with PBS at room temperature. The cells were covered with ice-cold formaldehyde (3% w/v, prepared by dilution of an ampule of 16% formaldehyde; Electron Microscopy Sciences catalog number 15710, with PBS). After 20 min at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with PBS at room temperature. For permeabilization, Triton X-100 (0.2% v/v in PBS) was added, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1% BSA in PBS. After removing the blocking agent, the cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 1% BSA containing anti-hGIIA antiserum (1/500 dilution, antiserum prepared as described (2Degousee N.

The cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with 1% BSA in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After removing the blocking agent, secondary antibody (1/200 dilution of affinity purified, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2, Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) was added in 1% BSA in PBS. After 1 h at room temperature, the cells were washed four times with PBS. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with mounting solution (0.1 m n-propyl gallate in 9:1 glycerol:PBS) and sealed to the slide with nail polish. The slides were viewed within 15 h with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope equipped with a 60× oil immersion objective. NBD-C6 ceramide was used as a Golgi marker. CHO-K1 cells were fixed as described above. After washing the cells, the coverslips were placed at 4 °C, and 1 ml of freshly prepared NBD-C6 ceramide (5 μm in 1% BSA in PBS) was added per well. After 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were washed several times with 3% BSA in PBS to remove excess reagent and viewed by confocal microscopy. In some experiments the cells were permeabilized with saponin. After the third PBS wash (see above), the cells were permeabilized with 1% saponin (w/v) (Sigma catalog number S7900), 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed once with 1% BSA in PBS and then covered with 1% BSA in PBS containing the primary antiserum. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature. The cells were covered with 1% BSA in PBS with the secondary antibody and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were washed four times with PBS at room temperature and prepared for confocal microscopy as described above. Electron Microscopy—hGIIA-transfected HEK293 cells (clone 1) were grown in 10-cm dishes to ∼70% confluence. The medium was removed and replaced with fresh complete medium with or without 4 ng/ml IL-1β. After 4 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cell layer was washed twice with PBS. In some experiments, the cells were incubated with complete medium containing 0.5 mg/ml heparin for 20 h at 37 °C in the presence or abs"

However, the connection between p53 and the dynein motor protein complex has not been established. Here, we show that hsp90·binding immunophilins link p53·hsp90 complexes to dynein and that prevention of that linkage in vivo inhibits the nuclear movement of p53. First, we show that p53·hsp90 heterocomplexes from DLD-1 human colon cancer cells contain an immunophilin (FKBP52, CyP-40, or PP5) as well as dynein. p53·hsp90·immunophilin·dynein complexes can be formed by incubating immunopurified p53 with rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and we show by peptide competition that the immunophilins link via their tetratricopeptide repeat domains to p53-bound hsp90 and by means of their PPIase domains to the dynein complex. The linkage of immunophilins to the dynein motor is indirect by means of the dynamitin component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex, and we show that purified FKBP52 binds directly by means of its PPIase domain to purified dynamitin. By using a temperature-sensitive mutant of p53 where cytoplasmic-nuclear movement occurs by shift to permissive temperature, we show that p53 movement is impeded when p53 binding to hsp90 is inhibited by the hsp90 inhibitor radicicol. Also, nuclear movement of p53 is inhibited when immunophilin binding to dynein is competed for by expression of a PPIase domain fragment in the same manner as when dynein linkage to cargo is dissociated by expression of dynamitin. This is the first demonstration of the linkage between an hsp90-chaperoned transcription factor and the system for its retrograde movement to the nucleus both in vitro and in vivo.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor that can induce cell growth arrest, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and DNA repair in response to DNA strand breakage and other types of cell stress (1Ljungman M.

Although most p53 mutations in human tumors are located in the DNA-binding domain and inactivate its transcriptional activity (4Hollstein M. Hergenhahn M. Yang Q. Bartsch H. Wang Z.Q. Hainaut P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 431: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), p53 inactivation may occur in other ways (2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5706) Google Scholar). As has been shown for steroid receptors and some other transcription factors, p53 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus (7David-Pfeuty T. Chakrani F. Ory K. Nouviandooghe Y.

Wawrzynow A. Hohfeld J. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that assembles steroid receptor heterocomplexes (13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol.

One effect of heterocomplex assembly between hsp90 and its “client” proteins is to stabilize the client protein to degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of proteolysis (17Neckers L.

Partial but complementary sets of observations regarding the mechanisms of GR·hsp90 and p53·hsp90 movement have been made that will be connected in this work to form a more complete model of the retrograde movement of p53. GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from cell lysates contain cytoplasmic dynein (23Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

These heterocomplexes also contain one of several immunophilins with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that interact with a TPR acceptor site on hsp90 (13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The immunophilins are widely expressed proteins with peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) domains that bind immunosuppressant drugs of the FK506 and cyclosporine A class. GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes contain one of four TPR domain immunophilins: FKBP52, FKBP51, CyP-40, or PP5, the latter being a protein phosphatase that also contains TPR and PPIase homology domains (13Pratt W.B.

In these complexes, the PPIase domain functions as a protein-protein binding domain to link the GR·hsp90 unit to cytoplasmic dynein (27Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C.

Although the linkage to the dynein motor has been in large part worked out for the GR, it has not been demonstrated that receptor movement is dynein-dependent. In contrast, p53 movement to the nucleus has been shown to be dynein-dependent, and it is immunoadsorbed in complexes that contain tubulin and cytoplasmic dynein (30Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Ward Y. Webster K.R. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar); however, the linkage of p53 to dynein has not been defined. Here, we demonstrate that p53·hsp90 and GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes from DLD-1 human colon cancer cells exist in identical heterocomplexes containing cytoplasmic dynein and one of three immunophilins, FKBP52, CyP-40, or PP5. Competition with peptides in vitro shows that the PPIase domain of the immunophilin is required for dynein presence in the p53·hsp90 heterocomplexes. The immunophilin linkage to dynein is indirect by means of the dynamitin component of the dynein-associated dynactin complex, and we show that purified FKBP52 binds directly via its PPIase domain to immunopurified dynamitin. Expression of the immunophilin PPIase domain fragment in HT29-tsp53 cells inhibits nuclear translocation of p53 when cells are shifted to permissive temperature in the same manner as expression of myc-dynamitin. Our observations demonstrate that the hsp90-binding immunophilins are required both for p53 linkage to dynein in vitro and for dynein-dependent transport of p53 to the nucleus in vivo.

The pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitors) containing 20 mm Na2MoO4. Immune pellets were resolved on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.1% Ab421 for p53, 0.25 μg/ml BuGR2 for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, 1 μg/ml N27F3-4 for hsp70, 0.1% MAB1618 for dynein, 0.1% UPJ56 for FKBP52, 0.1% anti-CyP-40, 0.1% anti-PP5, 0.1% JJ3 mouse ascites for p23, or 0.1% A-14 for myc-dynamitin. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated counter-antibody to visualize immunore-active bands. p53 was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Because PP5, FKBP52, p53, and dynamitin migrate in the same region on gel electrophoresis, as do hsp70 and the dynein intermediate chain, we electrophoresed replicate samples of both non-immune and immune pellets and probed replicate immunoblots with antibody specific for each protein. Thus, the Western blots of Figs. 1, 2, and 6 are necessarily composites prepared from two or more replicate immunoblots.Fig. 2Effects of geldanamycin and competition with TPR and PPIase domain peptides on p53 heterocomplexes assembled by reticulocyte lysate. p53 was immunoadsorbed from DLD-1 cytosol with the Ab421 antibody, and the p53-associated proteins were stripped from the immunopellet with NaCl (conditions 3-8).

After immunoadsorbing p53, coadsorbed proteins were dissociated from the immune pellet by incubating for 2 h with TEG buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl. The pellet was washed twice with TEG buffer and twice with 10 mm Hepes buffer at pH 7.4. p53·hsp90 heterocomplexes were then assembled by incubating the stripped immune pellets with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml of creatine phosphokinase). The assembly mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2-3 min. Pellets were then washed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold TEG buffer supplemented with 20 mm Na2MoO4 and boiled in SDS-sample buffer. In peptide competition experiments, the reticulocyte lysate was preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C with either 10 μl of lysate (8 mg of protein/ml) of Sf9 cells expressing the TPR domain fragment of rat PP5 or with 30 μg of purified PPIase domain fragment of rabbit FKBP52 (29Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M.

Cell Transfection—When HT29-tsp53 cells were ∼50% confluent, the culture medium was replaced by Opti-MEM transfection medium containing 5% bovine calf serum, and the incubation continued for 1 h as described above. The medium was aspirated and replaced by a transfection mixture (at a 3 μl liposome/1 μg of DNA ratio) preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in Opti-MEM, which contained either 0.4 μg of pCMVH50m or 1.0 μg pEGFP-C3 and 4.0 μg of pSG5PL-PPIase core domain I. Controls were transfected with pCMV or pEGFP-C3 and pSG5PL. After 1.5 h of transfection, the mixture was replaced by regular medium and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at the non-permissive temperature of 39 °C. The expression of dynamitin was evidenced by indirect immunofluorescence with an anti-myc antibody, and the co-transfection of EGFP and the PPIase domain I due to the green fluorescence exhibited by transfected cells. When myc-dynamitin was overexpressed in 293-T human fibroblasts, 6 μg of pCMVH50m plasmid was used. After 48 h, the cells were ruptured by Dounce homogenization in one volume of HE buffer supplemented with 20 mm Na2MoO4. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Nuclear translocation of p53 was triggered by incubating HT29-tsp53 cells at 32 °C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized by immersion in cold (-20 °C) methanol at the indicated times, and immunostained by inverting the coverslip on 50 μl of solution of phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin containing 1 μl of mouse monoclonal IgG against mouse p53 or 0.5 μl of rabbit polyclonal IgG against the c-myc tag of dynamitin. The coverslips were washed and reincubated with 1/100 dilution of the corresponding counter-antibody (rhodamine-conjugate goat anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugate donkey anti-rabbit IgG). Cells were observed with a Leitz Aristoplan epi-illumination microscope and scored for p53 nuclear translocation as described before for the GR (21Galigniana M.D. Scruggs J.L. Herrington J. Welsh M.J. Carter-Su C. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1903-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar): a score of 4 was used for nuclear fluorescence much greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 3 for nuclear fluorescence greater than cytoplasmic fluorescence, 2 for nuclear fluorescence equal to cytoplasmic fluorescence, 1 for nuclear fluorescence less than cytoplasmic fluorescence, and 0 for nuclear fluorescence much less than cytoplasmic fluorescence. The translocation scores represent the mean ± S.E. from three experiments, in which ≥100 cells/condition/experiment were counted. Significance was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni t test. Formation of Dynamitin·Immunophilin Complexes—Cytosol (200 μl) from 293-T cells transfected with myc-dynamitin was incubated with 10 μl of 9E10 mouse monoclonal IgG against myc and 16 μl of protein-A Sepharose. After 2 h, 0.5 m NaCl and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 were added and the incubation was continued for two more hours to strip dynamitin of associated proteins. After the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of TEG buffer and twice with HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), they were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate and 5 μl of the ATP-regenerating system. The samples were washed 4× with TEG buffer with 20 mm Na2MoO4 before gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal antibody against c-myc oligopeptide and specific rabbit antibodies against immunophilins. Prior to the reconstitution assay, the lysates were preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C with HKD buffer plus or minus purified PPIase core domain I of FKBP52. For direct binding of purified dynamitin to purified FKBP52, myc-dynamitin was immunoadsorbed from 293-T cell cytosol and stripped of associated proteins, as described above. After washing, the immunopellets were incubated for 30 min on ice with FKBP52, purified as described previously (27Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. J.

The final volume was adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer. Pellets were washed 4 times with TEG buffer with 20 mm Na2MoO4, and proteins were revealed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-myc antibody and the UPJ56 anti-FKBP52 antibody. Composition of p53·hsp90 Heterocomplexes in DLD-1 Cells—To examine the composition of native p53·hsp90 heterocomplexes, we selected the DLD-1 human colorectal cancer cell line, which possesses a point mutation that converts Ser-241 of p53 to Phe (36Rodrigues N.R. Rowen A. Smith M.E.F. Kerr I.B. Bodmen W.F. Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7555-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). This mutant p53 is localized in the cytoplasm and exists in cytosolic heterocomplexes with hsp90 (20Peng Y. Chen L. Li C. Lu W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, mutant p53 and the GR were immunoadsorbed from DLD-1 cytosol, and proteins in the washed immunopellets were identified by immunoblotting. Hsp90 was coadsorbed with both proteins, as was some hsp70, which is an essential component of the multiprotein chaperone machinery that forms “client protein” heterocomplexes with hsp90 (13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Also present in both heterocomplexes was p23, a ubiquitous 23-kDa acidic protein that binds to the ATP-dependent conformation of hsp90 when the client protein·hsp90 complex has been assembled (13Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). It has been shown that p23 binds dynamically and stabilizes the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex (37Dittmar K.D.

Here we show that vMIA induces several changes in Bax that resemble those found in apoptotic cells yet take place in unstimulated, non-apoptotic vMIA-expressing cells. These changes include the constitutive localization of Bax at mitochondria, where it associates tightly with the mitochondrial membrane, forming high molecular weight aggregates that contain vMIA. vMIA recruits Bax to mitochondria but delays relocation of caspase-8-activated truncated Bid-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (t-Bid-GFP) to mitochondria. The ability of vMIA and its deletion mutants to associate with Bax and to induce relocation of Bax to mitochondria correlates with their anti-apoptotic activity and with their ability to suppress mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Taken together, our data indicate that vMIA blocks apoptosis via its interaction with Bax. vMIA neutralizes Bax by recruiting it to mitochondria and “freezing” its pro-apoptotic activity.

Taken together, our data indicate that vMIA blocks apoptosis via its interaction with Bax. vMIA neutralizes Bax by recruiting it to mitochondria and “freezing” its pro-apoptotic activity. These data unravel a novel strategy of subverting an intrinsic pathway of apoptotic signaling. Apoptosis is mediated through two main pathways, the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway and the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by ligation of a plasma membrane death receptor, which results in a stepwise recruitment of adaptors and initiator caspases (in particular, caspase-8) into the death-inducing signaling complex. In some cells (type I), activation of caspase-8 directly triggers activation of the caspase cascade (1Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar), whereas in other cells (type II), caspase-8 mediates apoptosis only via proteolytic processing of BID (2Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.

The intrinsic pathway is induced by various apoptotic stimuli that converge on mitochondria to trigger MMP (4Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar). This permeabilization causes the release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors, which in turn activate the caspase pathway. MMP is tightly controlled, negatively and positively, by the proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 inhibit MMP, whereas pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues such as Bax, Bak, and BH3-only proteins such as Bid and Bad enhance MMP (3Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 4Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat.

Recent evidence suggests that many stress signals trigger apoptosis, at least in part, by activation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (3Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins seem to induce MMP by two different pathways: either by direct activation of Bax/Bak (e.g. Bid or Bim) or by inhibition of anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL (e.g. Bad, Bik) (3Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 6Cheng E.H.-Y.A. Wei M.C. Weiler S.

Tung K.S. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). This protein is predominantly cytosolic in a conformation in which its hydro-phobic α-5/6 helix and its N-terminal helix-1 are hidden within a hydrophilic globular structure. Upon pro-apoptotic signaling, for instance following exposure to t-Bid, Bax undergoes a conformation change that exposes its N terminus and, possibly, its BH3 domain (8Nechushtan A. Smith C.L.

Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). This allows its translocation and its tight association with the mitochondria, apparently through integration into the outer membrane, forming homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with Bak (3Letai A.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the association of Bax with the mitochondrial outer membrane during apoptosis is not well understood. Some data suggest that Bax interaction with cardiolipin (a mitochondria-specific lipid) is sufficient to trigger MMP (12Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G.A. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R.

On the other hand, Bax has been shown to interact (directly or indirectly) with sessile mitochondrial proteins, voltage-dependent anion channel (13Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y.

Apoptotic elimination of virally infected cells is one of the basic anti-viral responses of multicellular organisms. During evolution, viruses have developed a variety of strategies to suppress the extrinsic and/or the intrinsic pathways. Thus, some viral proteins block the extrinsic pathway by suppressing the activation of initiator caspases such as viral Flice-like inhibitory proteins (FLIPs) encoded by γ-herpesviruses (19Tschopp J. Thome M. Hofmann K. Meinl E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), vICA homologues of β-herpesviruses that associate with and prevent death-inducing signaling complex-dependent activation of pro-caspase-8, (20McCormick A.L. Smith V.L. Chow D. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), CrmA of poxvirus, a serpin that inhibits the enzymatic activity of caspase-8 (21Zhou Q.

Sutter G. Bertagnoli S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7830-7839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other viruses encode inhibitors of the intrinsic pathway in particular structural and functional Bcl-2 homologues. Examples of structural homologues of Bcl-2 include KSbcl-2, a Bcl-2 homologue from human herpesvirus (HHV8), which resembles Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in its three-dimensional structure and, likely, in its function (23Huang Q. Petros A. Virgin H. Fesik S. Olejniczak E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3428-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Another cell death suppressor BHRF1, encoded by Epstein-Barr virus, shares some homologies with Bcl-2, but its mechanism of cell death suppression remains unclear (24Huang Q. Petros A. Virgin H. Fesik S. Olejniczak E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The E1B19K cell death suppressor of adenovirus shares only a modest amino acid sequence homology with Bcl-2 and appears to suppress cell death via its interaction with Bax and Bak, preventing their oligomerization (25Sundararajan R.

This applies to Myxoma virus, which encodes both M11L (27Everett H. Barry M. Sun X. Lee S.F. Frantz C. Berthiaume L.G. McFadden G. Bleackley R.C. J. Exp.

Although vMIA shares no sequence homology with Bcl-2, it has functional similarities with Bcl-2: it localizes at mitochondria, inhibits MMP, and is a potent cell death suppressor (29Goldmacher V.S.

Two domains of vMIA are necessary and, together, sufficient for its cell death-suppressing activity, its N-terminal domain (amino acids 5-34), and a segment between amino acids 117 and 147 (32Hayajneh W.A. Colberg-Oley A.M. Skaleskaya A. Bartle L.M. Lesperance M.M. Contopoulos-Ionnidis D.G. Kedersha N.L. Goldmacher V.S. Virology. 2001; 279: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain targets vMIA to mitochondria, whereas the function of the second domain as well as the molecular mechanism of cell death suppression by vMIA until now remained unknown. Here we report that vMIA inhibits apoptosis through a unique mechanism distinct from that of any previously characterized cell death suppressor-targeting MMP. We show that vMIA, through an association with Bax, recruits Bax to mitochondria, inducing its oligomerization and tight association with mitochondrial outer membrane while inhibiting its proapoptotic function. Our findings thus reveal a yet undescribed viral strategy for interfering with the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. Cell Lines, Culture Conditions, and Transfection/Infection—HeLa and BJAB cells were stably transfected with UL37 exon 1 (vMIA), a deletion mutant of vMIA (32Hayajneh W.A. Colberg-Oley A.M.

The MRC-5 human normal fibroblasts and CMV strain AD169varATCC were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. CMV-infected cells were fixed at 24 h after infection for immunofluorescence analysis. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 (PAA laboratories), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2.

Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% w/v) and permeabilized with 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline (34Castedo M. Ferri K.F.

Cells were then stained for the detection of cytochrome c (monoclonal antibody 6H2.B4 from Pharmingen) and the c-Myc epitope of tagged vMIA (monoclonal antibody 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To detect subcellular localization of Bax, cells were stained with either monoclonal anti-Bax (6A7, Pharmingen), rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax antiserum (N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit polyclonal vMIA (29Goldmacher V.S. Bartle L.M. Skletskaya S. Dionne C.A. Kedersha N.L. Vater C.A. Han J.W. Lutz R.J. Watanabe S. McFarland E.D.C. Kieff E.D. Mocarski E.S. Chittenden T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Epifluorescence analyses were performed using a Leica microscope (DMIRE2), and confocal analyses were performed using an LSM 510 Zeiss microscope equipped with a ×63 objective (oil immersion). Isolation of Mitochondria—Cells resuspended in a homogenization buffer (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm TES, 300 μm EGTA) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) were disrupted by cavitation (PAR system; 150 p.s.i., 2 × 15 min) and centrifuged at 900 × g for 15 min twice to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 9000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was used as a fraction enriched in mitochondria (“mitochondrial fraction”). The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to yield the cytosolic cell fraction. Preparation of Mitochondrial Extracts—The mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in the homogenization buffer supplemented with 2% CHAPS (Sigma), incubated on ice for 1 h, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (“soluble mitochondrial fraction”) was then recovered. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Detection of Tight Association of Bax with Mitochondrial Membranes—The mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 12, to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated on ice for 20 min. Subsequently, the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant, which contained loosely attached proteins, was recovered, and CHAPS was added to a final concentration of 2%. The pellet, which contained tightly membrane-associated proteins, was suspended in the homogenization buffer containing 2% CHAPS, incubated on ice for 1 h, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtrations were performed at 4 °C on a Superdex 200 column (16/60 and 10/30, Amersham Biosciences), as described before (10Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Briefly, the column was equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, 300 mm NaCl, 200 μm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, pH 7.5, and run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was calibrated with gel filtration standard proteins from Amersham Biosciences. Fractions of 2 ml were collected. The proteins present in these fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10%) in water and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cell-free Assay of Bax Incorporation into Mitochondria—The association of Bax or vMIA with purified rat liver mitochondria was determined as described (36Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver E. Maya C. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins labeled with [35S]Met (Amersham Biosciences) were synthesized from cDNA using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Labeled proteins were incubated with mitochondrial fractions at 37 °C for 1 h in homogenization buffer. Radiolabeled proteins bound to the mitochondria were recovered in the pellet after centrifugation of the incubation mixture for 10 min at 4 °C at 8000 × g. [35S]Met-labeled vMIA associated with isolated mitochondria was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by quantitation of the radioactivity in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using the IPLab program (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Cell-free Association of vMIA Bax Δ2-37 and Bax Δ2-20—His-tagged Bax (4 fmol) was incubated overnight with 10 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads (Qiagen) at 4 °C. The reaction mix was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of LB buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm NaP04, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8) in the presence of in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled vMIA (4 fmol) and the incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and the beads were then washed in LB buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted from the beads with 250 μm imidazole (20 min, 4 °C) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation—BJAB cell clones stably transfected with vMIA, a vMIA deletion mutant, or an empty vector were used in these experiments. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, supplemented with either 1% Triton X-100 or 2% CHAPS) in the presence of protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged (5 min at 1000 × g) to remove nuclei and cell debris, and the supernatants were rotated overnight at 4 °C with the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody covalently bound to Affi-prep10 beads (29Goldmacher V.S. Bartle L.M. Skletskaya S. Dionne C.A. Kedersha N.L. Vater C.A. Han J.W. Lutz R.J. Watanabe S. McFarland E.D.C. Kieff E.D. Mocarski E.S. Chittenden T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12536-12541Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The beads were then washed in lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted from beads in non-reducing NuPAGE (Invitrogen) sample buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions. Cell lysates were also run as controls. The gels were then analyzed by a standard immunoblot protocol using anti-Bax antibody (N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Bax Is Predominantly Localized at Mitochondria of Nonapoptotic vMIA Cells—We examined the localization of Bax in two clones (clones 3 and 8) of HeLa cells stably transfected with vMIA by immunofluorescence with the anti-Bax N20 antibody. A representative experiment with HeLa/vMIA#3 and the control HeLa/pcDNA3 (Neo) cells stably transfected with the empty vector is shown in Fig. 1A. In control HeLa/pcDNA3 cells, Bax was diffusely distributed and did not co-localize with cytochrome c, consistent with cytoplasmic localization of Bax. In the HeLa clones constitutively expressing vMIA, Bax largely co-localized with both cytochrome c (Fig. 1A) and vMIA (not shown), two proteins that are localized at mitochondria (20McCormick A.L.

The finding that Bax was predominantly localized at mitochondria in HeLa/vMIA cells was unexpected since relocation of Bax to mitochondria is considered to constitute an early step in apoptosis (38Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) followed by MMP. Instead, vMIA-expressing HeLa cells are resistant to apoptosis due to the ability of vMIA to prevent MMP (29Goldmacher V.S. Bartle L.M. Skletskaya S. Dionne C.A. Kedersha N.L. Vater C.A. Han J.W. Lutz R.J. Watanabe S. McFarland E.D.C. Kieff E.D. Mocarski E.S. Chittenden T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12536-12541Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To find out whether vMIA-induced recruitment of Bax to mitochondria is limited to HeLa cells or is a general phenomenon, we examined localization of Bax in MEF transiently transfected with vMIA/pcDNA3 (or with pcDNA3 as a control) and in MRC5 normal human fibroblasts infected with the AD169varATCC strain of human cytomegalovirus. We observed in both experimental systems that ectopic expression of vMIA induces relocation of Bax to mitochondria (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas in control MEFs (Fig. 1B) and non-infected MRC5 fibroblasts (data not shown), Bax is diffusely distributed. To study the kinetics of vMIA expression and Bax relocation to mitochondria, we examined the time course of both vMIA and Bax staining in transiently transfected HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, 2 h after transfection in the absence of vMIA protein, Bax shows a diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm, whereas from 4 h after transfection to 17 h, we noted that even low expression level of vMIA (at 4 h) was sufficient to trigger significant relocation of Bax to mitochondria. Next, we determined whether exposure of vMIA-expressing cells to various apoptotic stimuli induced apoptosis. HeLa/vMIA#3, were exposed to staurosporin (STS) and analyzed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy for the intracellular distribution of Bax and cytochrome c. Representative images of the distribution of Bax (Fig. 2A, red fluorescence) and cytochrome c (Fig. 2A, green fluorescence) in HeLa/vMIA#3 cells (vMIA) and HeLa/pcDNA3 cells (Neo) that have or have not been exposed to STS are shown in Fig. 2A. In non-treated Neo cells, Bax staining is diffuse and is not colocalized with cytochrome c. Following the exposure of Neo cells to STS, Bax distribution becomes punctate and co-localized with cytochrome c (Fig. 2A, yellow) in mitochondria, which induces cytochrome c release (Fig. 2A, inset). In HeLa/vMIA#3 cells, Bax is constitutively co-localized with cytochrome c in granular structures irrespective of whether the cells were or were not exposed to STS (Fig. 2A). Cells were then exposed to STS, cis-platin, oligomycin + carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or anti-CD-95 + CHX. To quantitate the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis, cytochrome c staining and chromatin condensation were examined either 3 or 16 h later. In vMIA-expressing cells, both cytochrome c release and chromatin condensation were blocked (Fig. 2B). Anti-apoptotic effects of vMIA were subsequently tested in transiently transfected cells (vMIAt) in comparison with vMIA#3. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, the transient expression of vMIA was effective in inhibiting both cytochrome c release and chromatin condensation induced by CD-95 ligation. The subcellular distribution of Bax in HeLa/Neo and HeLa/vMIA that had or had not been exposed to STS was also determined by cell fractionation. As shown in Fig. 2E, exposure of HeLa/Neo cells to STS resulted in redistribution of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria/heavy membrane-enriched fraction and release of cytochrome c, in accord with previous observations (10Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In contrast, both Bax and cytochrome c predominantly associated with the mitochondria-enriched fraction of vMIA cells that had or had not been treated with STS. One important observation made in these experiments was that in vMIA-express"

While the precise function of these proteins remains unclear, KaiA has been shown to be a positive regulator of the expression of KaiB and KaiC. The 2.0-Å structure of KaiA of S. elongatus reported here shows that the protein is composed of two independently folded domains connected by a linker. The NH2-terminal pseudo-receiver domain has a similar fold with that of bacterial response regulators, whereas the COOH-terminal four-helix bundle domain is novel and forms the interface of the 2-fold-related homodimer. The COOH-terminal four-helix bundle domain has been shown to contain the KaiC binding site. The structure suggests that the KaiB binding site is covered in the dimer interface of the KaiA “closed” conformation, observed in the crystal structure, which suggests an allosteric regulation mechanism.

Circadian timekeeping systems are present in virtually all eukaryotic organisms and modulate diverse physiological processes ranging from leaf movement to transcription regulation (1Büenning E.

Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar). The evolutionary importance of an endogenous circadian oscillator is further emphasized by its presence in ancient organisms such as cyanobacteria (4Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), the subject of this work. Indeed, it has been shown that a circadian oscillator tuned to the light-dark cycle period increases the fitness of the organism (5Ouyang Y. Andersson C.R. Kondo T. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8660-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The cyanobacterial clock is the simplest and the oldest (6Dvornyk V. Vinogradova O. Nevo E. Proc. Natl.

Iwasaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2388-2395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Genomic analysis indicates that KaiC is a member of the bacterial RecA/DnaB family (9Leipe D.D. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 5-16PubMed Google Scholar). The KaiC phosphorylation state has been shown to change in vivo with a circadian pattern (10Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 11Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and it is known that ATP binding by KaiC promotes formation of a hexameric KaiC particle (12Hayashi F. Suzuki H. Iwase R.

Experimental evidence suggests that KaiC binds forked DNA when in the ATP-dependent hexameric form (13Mori T. Saveliev S.V. Xu Y. Stafford W.F. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17203-17208Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). KaiA, the positive element of the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator, activates KaiC autophosphorylation and/or inhibits KaiC dephosphorylation, which is believed to be important for its circadian clock function (10Iwasaki H. Nishiwaki T. Kitayama Y. Nakajima M. Kondo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15788-15793Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 14Williams S.B. Vakonakis I. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). KaiB alone does not affect KaiC autophosphorylation in vitro, but it antagonizes the action of KaiA both in vivo and in vitro (11Xu Y. Mori T. Johnson C.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2117-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 14Williams S.B. Vakonakis I. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Iwasaki et al. (7Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Kai proteins directly associate in all possible combinations with data from a two-hybrid system, in vitro, and in cyanobacterial cells. The association between KaiA and KaiB is weak but can be dramatically enhanced by KaiC (7Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A KaiA long period mutation allele (E103K, kaiA1) was reported to dramatically enhance the KaiA-KaiB interaction in vitro but without any effect on KaiAKaiC interaction (7Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). More interestingly, KaiC failed to enhance the kaiA1-KaiB interaction (7Iwasaki H. Taniguchi Y. Ishiura M. Kondo T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). KaiA is composed of two domains, both solution structures of which were recently solved (14Williams S.B. Vakonakis I. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 16Vakonakis I. Sun J. Wu T. Holzenburg A. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The structure of the NH2-terminal domain of KaiA is that of a pseudo-receiver domain (14Williams S.B. Vakonakis I. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), similar to those found in bacterial response regulators (17Volz K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11741-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Although the fold is that of a canonical receiver domain, the primary sequence is dissimilar, and it lacks the conserved aspartate residue necessary for phosphorylation. The solution structure of KaiA COOH-terminal domain showed a novel all α-helical homodimeric fold (16Vakonakis I. Sun J. Wu T. Holzenburg A. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our earlier results show that the COOH-terminal domain of KaiA possesses a groove, which likely binds to the linker region between the CI and CII domains of KaiC. This interaction between KaiA and KaiC enhances the autokinase activity of KaiC. Here, we present the structure of full-length KaiA, which was determined by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.0 Å. The full-length structure provides insight into the mechanism of KaiA regulation. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The gene corresponding to Synechococcus elongatus KaiA was subcloned in a pET32a+ (Novagen) expression vector, and protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by making the solution 1 mm in isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell lysates were prepared by French press in a buffer containing 200 mm potassium chloride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography, cleaved by enterokinase (Novagen), and further purified by metal affinity chromatography, two steps of ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. During the last gel filtration step KaiA was exchanged to the final buffer of 20 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The protein was concentrated to 10-15 mg/ml by stirred ultrafiltration. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm, using a corrected extinction coefficient as suggested by Pace et al. (18Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar). KaiA, as prepared, has the following leading NH2-terminal sequence AMADIV followed by the wild-type sequence starting on residue Leu 2L. Esser, personal communication. from our overexpression system. The protein was crystallized in Micro Batch plates at 20 °C under Al's oil (Hampton Research) with a 4-μl sitting droplet consisting of a 1:1 mixture of the stock protein solution and a solution containing 130-180 mm ammonium sulfate, 85 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 19-22% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 15% v/v glycerol. Thick plate shaped crystals appeared in about 2 days and grew to about 0.5 mm in the longest dimension and varying width and thickness. Our attempts to obtain crystals of Se-Met incorporated KaiA were unsuccessful. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Determination—For x-ray data collection, crystals were flash-frozen at 100 K using paratone as cryoprotectant. KaiA crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 47.1 Å, b = 125.8 Å, c = 56.8 Å and β = 114.9°, two monomers per asymmetric unit, and a solvent content of 45.6%. Data were collected at Advanced Photon Source (APS) beamlines and processed with HKL2000 programs (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). Several native data sets were collected, the best one diffracted to 2.0 Å. For heavy atom derivatization, the native crystals were soaked in varying concentrations of heavy atom solutions made in synthetic mother liquor. Extensive screening of a large number of heavy atom soaked crystals resulted in one useful 2.8-Å Nd derivative. This derivative was obtained by 24-h soaking of crystals grown under the aforementioned conditions in a 1:1 mixture of stock solution (20 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) and a solution containing 170 mm ammonium acetate, 85 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 8000, 15% v/v glycerol, and 10 mm neodymium acetate. Molecular replacement trial with the KaiA135N model (14Williams S.B. Vakonakis I. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) using the program AMoRe (20Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar) yielded a weak solution for the first molecule with correlation coefficient of 28.8%, but failed in searching the second KaiA135N molecule. A highly redundant data set to 2.8 Å collected at an in-house x-ray generator lacked isomorphism with the existing native data sets. Experimental phases were derived by SAD 1The abbreviations used are: SAD, single wavelength anomalous dispersion; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. methods using only the Nd derivative. The substructure of Nd in the asymmetric unit was solved with the program SHELXD (21Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar) with only one Nd site. The Nd site was refined using the program SHARP (22Fortelle E.D.L. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), and initial protein phases were calculated. The phases resulting from Nd derivative were improved by solvent flattening using the program DM (20Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). The resulted phases were too poor to be used for chain tracing and model building. Real space molecular replacement search was performed with the KaiA135N model on the molecular replacement server of New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium (NYSGRC) (russel.bioc.aecom.yu.edu/cgi-bin/inhouse/rotptf/rotptf.cgi). Encouragingly, the top solution from the real space molecular replacement search matched the solution from AMoRe. Therefore, the top two solutions were combined to be a dimer model. The dimer model looked reasonable judged by their packing in the lattice. A molecular replacement search with the dimer model yielded a solution with a correlation coefficient of 33.8%. The experimental phases were further improved by solvent flattening and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging averaging using the program DM (20Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar) by assuming the model was correct. Since CD spectra of the KaiA COOH-terminal domain revealed primarily α-helical structures (14Williams S.B. Vakonakis I. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), a real space molecular replacement search was performed again with several α-helices with different lengths. The results were conformed upon electron density map, and six α-helices were added to the model (two of the six α-helices, corresponding to α9 of the two molecules, turned out to be correct).

Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar) on the 2.0-Å resolution data set were performed for improving the quality of the model. Water molecules were added in the difference electron density maps at positions corresponding to peaks (>3.0 σ) and with appropriate hydrogen bonding geometry.

The asymmetric unit consists of two chains forming a homodimer. The structure was determined by a combination of SAD phasing, real space molecular replacement, ARP/wARP phase improvement and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. Five NH2-terminal non-KaiA residues, two COOH-terminal residues, and two loop regions (residues 85-92 and 137-146) are highly flexible and were omitted from the refinement (Table I). The current model, refined at 2.0-Å resolution, has a crystallographic R value of 21.0% and an Rfree of 27.1%. The model has good geometry (Table I), and 100% of the non-glycine backbone dihedral angles is in the most favored or allowed regions. KaiA exists as a dimer in the crystal (Fig. 1A), in agreement with the data from gel filtration and ultracentrifugation equilibrium (16Vakonakis I. Sun J. Wu T. Holzenburg A. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and previous reports that KaiA exists as homodimer or heteromultimeric protein complexes with other clock components in vivo in a circadian fashion (8Kageyama H. Kondo T. Iwasaki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2388-2395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). One subunit of KaiA contains two independently folded domains connected by a canonical linker (NH2-terminal pseudo-receiver domain, residues 1-164, canonical linker, residues 165-173, COOH-terminal four-helix bundle domain, residues 174-284). One unique feature of the KaiA dimer is domain swapping (27Bennett M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), in that the domains are swapped so that the NH2-terminal domain of one chain pairs with the COOH-terminal domain of the other. There are no interdomain interactions within a subunit, unlike most other multidomain proteins. The two subunits twist around each other forming a dimer, related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. The dimer interface between the two monomers buries a total of 3440 Å2 accessible surface areas per subunit, about 21% of the total surface of a single subunit, which is on the high side of the range of buried surface area observed in other dimeric proteins (28Chothia C. Janin J. Nature. 1975; 256: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Structure of the KaiA. A, ribbon representation of S. elongatus KaiA dimer as observed in the crystal structure. Molecule A is shown in red and molecule B in green. The dimer interfaces are marked. Regions of disordered structure are shown as interrupted coils.

The cis-peptide proline (Pro130) is conserved in KaiA sequences and is shown in blue. The residues involved in dimer interface are shown in magenta. KaiA alleles are marked with an asterisk.

C, thirty-four KaiA alleles involving mutations on 28 different residues are mapped onto the KaiA structure. Mutated residues are colored by their roles: red, structural role; yellow, dimer interaction; gold, potential KaiC binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The NH2-terminal portion (residues 1-135) of this domain is structurally similar to the response regulator receiver family, which is involved in a wide range of regulatory processes (29Pao G.M. Saier M.H.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 136-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), discussed in detail below. This domain consists of a central five-stranded (β1 to β5) parallel β-sheet flanked by two groups of α-helices (α1, α4 and α2, α3) packed on either side of the β-sheet and an additional α-helix (α5) lying near the amino terminus of the central β-strand (Fig. 1A). The COOH-terminal domain contains two parallel helix-hairpin-helix motifs that form a four-helix bundle, which represents a new protein folding motif (16Vakonakis I. Sun J. Wu T. Holzenburg A. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Structure and Function of the NH2-terminal Pseudo-receiver Domain—The portion of the NH2-terminal domain that is structurally similar to the response regulator receiver family was previously studied by NMR (14Williams S.B. Vakonakis I. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The backbone root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the KaiA crystal structure and KaiA135N solution structure (average minimized structure, Protein Data Bank ID code 1M2E) is 1.31 ± 0.04 Å for residues 4-83 and 98-135. The sequence alignment (Fig. 1B) shows gaps/insertions in two loop regions of the NH2-terminal domain among the four known homologs. Most of the gaps/insertions are in disordered regions of the protein except for those that happen to fall in crystal lattice contacts. The first disordered loop (residues 84-97) was also observed to be highly dynamic in the solution structure (14Williams S.B. Vakonakis I. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, a cis-peptide (Ala129-Pro130) was observed in the structure and this proline is well conserved in KaiA sequences (Fig. 1B). The structural similarity between the KaiA NH2-terminal domain and the response regulator receiver family was unanticipated since no amino acid sequence homology was detected prior to solving the structure. All receiver domains contain four highly invariant residues necessary for a common Mg2+-dependent phosphoryl-transfer mechanism in the carboxyl-terminal crevice of the central β-strand, which correspond to Asp12, Asp13, Asp57 (phosphate-accepting residue) and Lys109 in E. coli. CheY (17Volz K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11741-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We aligned the amino acid sequence of KaiA NH2-terminal domain against the response regulator receiver family based on a Hidden Markov model (HMM), downloaded from the PFAM web site (pfam.wustl.edu), using the HMMER software (30Durbin R. Eddy S. Krogh A. Mitchison G. Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Cambridge University Press, 1998Crossref Google Scholar). However, the resulting sequence alignment (Fig. 2) shows that none of the four highly invariant residues involved in phosphorylation is conserved in the KaiA sequence, indicating that the KaiA NH2-terminal domain lacks the phosphorylation-dependent regulatory function. The very weak relationship of KaiA to the response regulator receiver family suggests migration of function for this domain relationship. An α-helix (α5) that lies near the amino terminus of the central β-sheet is also not found in the receiver protein structure. Three well conserved leucine residues (Leu156, Leu160, and Leu164) (Fig. 1B) anchor the α-helix to a hydrophobic pocket on the KaiA135N surface. The residues forming the hydrophobic pocket, including Ile5, Val77, Pro78, Leu122, Phe125, and Leu126, are either conserved or chemically similar (Fig. 1B). This hydrophobic feature is not found in the response regulator receiver family (Fig. 2). Thirty-four KaiA alleles involving mutations to 28 different residues have been reported to alter the periodicity of clock-regulated gene expression rhythms in S. elongatus (4Ishiura M. Kutsuna S. Aoki S. Iwasaki H. Andersson C.R. Tanabe A. Golden S.S. Johnson C.H. Kondo T. Science. 1998; 281: 1519-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 31Nishimura H. Nakahira Y. Imai K. Tsuruhara A. Kondo H. Hayashi H. Hirai M. Saito H. Kondo T. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2903-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The alleles are mapped onto the KaiA structure (Fig. 1, B and C) and are distributed throughout the two domains and the canonical linker, with 44.1% of the alleles mapping to the pseudo-receiver domain, 52.9% to the four-helix bundle domain and 3.0% to the canonical linker. The alleles map to residues with structural roles, to residues with roles in dimer interactions, or to residues with potential roles in KaiC interactions, indicating that both domains and the linker are important for the circadian clock function of KaiA. The alleles mapping to the NH2-terminal pseudo-receiver domain involve mutations of twelve residues. Eight of the twelve residues (Ile9, Ile16, Leu31, Ser36, Cys53, Val76, Glu103, and Val131) are buried residues. Mutation of these residues resulted in unfolded domains or aggregation (14Williams S.B. Vakonakis I. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15357-15362Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), reflecting their structural roles. Three residues (Gln113, Gln117, and Asp119) mapped to the α4 helix are involved in the dimer interface, as discussed later. The role of Asp136 is unclear, since it is in a flexible surface loop. The COOH-terminal Four-helix Bundle Domain and Its Involvement in Dimer Structure—The solution structure of the KaiA COOH-terminal domain from the Thermosynechococcus elongatus (ThKaiA180C) was recently solved independently of this study (16Vakonakis I. Sun J. Wu T. Holzenburg A. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The backbone r.m.s.d. is 1.28 ± 0.07 Å between the KaiA crystal structure and the ThKaiA180C solution structure (average minimized structure, Protein Data Bank ID code 1Q6A) for residues 184-282. The main conformational change between KaiA and ThKaiA180C occurs in the loop prior to α-helix 6 (α6), which is highly dynamic and in the NH2 terminus of the ThKaiA180C solution structure (16Vakonakis I. Sun J. Wu T. Holzenburg A. Golden S.S. LiWang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This loop, from Asp174 to Pro183, makes a type-I reverse turn from Phe178 to Asn181 and a 310-helix from Asp174 to Arg177 that snake across the four-helix bundle to the canonical linker, interacting with the loop between α7 and α8, and α4 from the other monomer in the dimer (Fig. 3B). Three alleles were mapped to Phe178 and Arg180 in this loop, which are well conserved (Fig. 1, B and C). Arg180 forms a salt bridge with conserved residue Asp227, and the side chain of Phe178 stacks with Pro175 and forms hydrophobic interactions with the Cβ of Asp227 and Cβ of Arg173 (Fig. 3B). Hence, the role of Phe178 and Arg180 might be structural. The two subunits within a KaiA dimer in the crystal interact with each other throughout the dimer interface. We divide the dimer interactions to three regions (Fig. 1A). The first region (dimer interface I) is between the four-helix bundle domains of the two monomers. The two domains pack head-to-head in a 2-fold symmetric manner (Fig. 3A). The interactions are dominated by the coiled-coil interactions along the long helices (α9) involving residues 260-280 from each chain. Additional interactions involve the connecting loop between α7 and α8 from 227-230. The interface is primarily hydrophobic, containing hydrophobic clusters and aromatic stacking interactions including residue Pro229, Val230, Leu263, Leu265, Ile266, Ile269, Ala270, Leu272, Cys273, Tyr276 and Ile280 from both molecules. The hydrophobic interactions appear to be the main force driving dimer formation in this interface. The packing is further stabilized by t"

LIM-nebulette is an alternative splice variant of the sarcomeric protein nebulette, which, in contrast to nebulette, is expressed in non-muscle cells. It displays a modular structure with an N-terminal LIM domain, three nebulin-like repeats, and a C-terminal SH3 domain and shows high similarity to another cytoskeletal protein, Lasp-1 (LIM and SH3 protein-1). Co-precipitation studies and results obtained with the two-hybrid system demonstrate that LIM-nebulette and Lasp-1 interact specifically with zyxin. Moreover, the SH3 domain from LIM-nebulette is both necessary and sufficient for zyxin binding. The SH3 domains from Lasp-1 and nebulin can also interact with zyxin, but the SH3 domains from more distantly related proteins such as vinexin and sorting nexin 9 do not. On the other hand, the binding site in zyxin is situated at the extreme N terminus as shown by site-directed mutagenesis. LIM-nebulette and Lasp-1 use the same linear binding motif. This motif shows some similarity to a class II binding site but does not contain the classical PXXP sequence. LIM-nebulette reveals a subcellular distribution at focal adhesions similar to Lasp-1. Thus, LIM-nebulette, Lasp-1, and zyxin may play an important role in the organization of focal adhesions. Zyxin is a versatile component of focal adhesions in eukaryotic cells.

Thus, LIM-nebulette, Lasp-1, and zyxin may play an important role in the organization of focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are essential cellular structures of metazoan organisms that link the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. The controlled assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions is critical for a diversity of biological functions, including cell adhesion, motility, and spreading. Typically, focal adhesions are found at sites where a number of proteins from different signaling pathways converge to respond to extracellular signals (1Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Thus far, more than 50 different focal adhesion proteins have been identified (2Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them are several adapter proteins with protein-protein interaction motifs that play an important role in the dynamic assembly of focal adhesions. One of these adapter proteins is zyxin. Zyxin was originally identified in chicken fibroblasts as a protein associated with stress fibers and focal adhesions (3Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologue of avian zyxin was subsequently cloned from a subtracted cDNA library enriched with clones that are down-regulated in transformed fibroblasts (4Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At the same time, human zyxin was also cloned from umbilical vein endothelial cells by cross-hybridization (5Macalma T. Otte J. Hensler M.E. Bockholt S.M. Louis H.A. Kalff-Suske M. Grzeschik K.H. von der Ahe D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31470-31478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Analysis of the protein sequence revealed the typical structure of a multidomain protein. At the C terminus, zyxin contains three LIM domains arranged in tandem. LIM domains are cysteine-rich motifs with two zinc finger-like structures that mediate specific protein-protein interactions. Three different binding partners for the LIM domains of zyxin have been identified, namely, the cysteine-rich protein CRP, the adapter protein p130cas, and the tumor suppressor protein H-warts/LATS1 (6Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Yi J. Kloeker S. Jensen C.C. Bockholt S. Honda H. Hirai H. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol.

Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). At the N terminus, zyxin features an extended, proline-rich domain, which contains a nuclear export signal and several proline clusters. By virtue of these proline clusters, zyxin binds to proteins of the Ena/VASP family, which control the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments (9Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 243-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The proline clusters also serve as docking sites for the oncoprotein Vav, a nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho family of GTPases (10Hobert O. Schilling J.W. Beckerle M.C. Ullrich A. Jallal B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1577-1581PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the extended N-terminal domain is responsible for the interaction of zyxin with the actin-bundling protein α-actinin (11Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that a linear sequence motif found at the extreme N terminus of zyxin is essential for this interaction (12Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Li B. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33328-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our observation is supported by the fact that LPP (lipoma preferred partner), another member of the zyxin family containing the same linear motif, binds to α-actinin, too (14Li B. Zhuang L. Reinhard M. Trueb B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several pieces of evidence from different lines of investigation suggest that zyxin might play an important role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Zyxin induces the polymerization of actin on the surface of mitochondria when artificially targeted to these ectopic sites (15Beckerle M.C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Actin polymerization and the resulting tension appear to be crucial for the dynamic assembly of focal adhesions (1Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). On the other hand, zyxin is one of the first molecules that dissociate from dissolving focal adhesions (17Rottner K. Krause M. Gimona M. Small J.V. Wehland J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3103-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This observation raises the intriguing possibility that zyxin might represent one of the target molecules responsible for the controlled disassembly of focal adhesions. Although tremendous efforts have been made to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which zyxin regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, no details are yet known. The identification of binding partners for zyxin might provide some valuable clues. In this paper, we report on the interaction of zyxin with the sarcomeric protein nebulette. Furthermore, we identify a novel splice variant of nebulette, termed LIM-nebulette, which closely resembles Lasp-1. Similar to zyxin, nebulette and Lasp-1 are cytoskeletal proteins found in focal adhesions. Nebulette is specifically expressed in the cardiac muscle of vertebrates, where it interacts with actin filaments (18Millevoi S. Trombitas K. Kolmerer B. Kostin S. Schaper J. Pelin K. Granzier H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Moncman C.L. Wang K.

It contains an acidic N terminus, an extended ring of nebulin-like repeats, and a C-terminal SH3 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SNX, sorting nexin. 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SNX, sorting nexin. domain. It has been postulated that the SH3 domain of nebulette, located 25-30 nm within the Z-disk, might play a crucial role in the assembly of Z-disks in cardiac muscles (18Millevoi S. Trombitas K. Kolmerer B. Kostin S. Schaper J. Pelin K. Granzier H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Lasp-1 is composed of an N-terminal LIM domain, two nebulin-like repeats, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (21Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Regnier C.H. Schreiber V. Basset P. Rio M.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Schreiber V. Masson R. Linares J.T. Mattei M.G. Tomasetto C. Rio M.C. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast to nebulette, however, Lasp-1 is ubiquitously expressed in most cell types. It might therefore play a more general role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (23Chew C.S. Parente Jr., J.A. Chen X. Chaponnier C. Cameron R.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2035-2045PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chew C.S. Chen X. Parente Jr., J.A. Tarrer S. Okamoto C. Qin H.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4787-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that all the related proteins nebulette, LIM-nebulette, and Lasp-1 interact with zyxin and that the C-terminal SH3 domain of the three proteins is responsible for this interaction. The fact that zyxin interacts with a multitude of actin-associated proteins suggests that these molecules cooperatively regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. cDNA Cloning and Plasmid Construction—A full-length cDNA for human zyxin (GenBank accession number X95735; Ref. 4Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was cloned previously and characterized in our laboratory. Expressed sequence tags for mouse LIM-nebulette (IMAGE ID 5249766), human Lasp-1 (IMAGE ID 2301763), nebulin (IMAGE ID 4245063), vinexin (IMAGE ID 4328970), and SNX 9 (IMAGE ID 4869158) were obtained from the German Resource Center for Genome Research (Berlin, Germany). For two-hybrid interactions in yeast, the matchmaker system from Clontech was utilized. Selected constructs were prepared by PCR with the help of synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Microsynth GmbH). The fragments for zyxin were subcloned into the bait vector pAS2-1 downstream of the sequence for the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. Likewise, selected fragments for LIM-nebulette, Lasp-1, nebulin, vinexin, and SNX 9 were subcloned into the prey vector pGADT7 downstream of the transactivation domain of GAL4. For expression in bacteria, GST-tagged fusion constructs were prepared. A cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 1-42 of human zyxin was subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences) downstream of the gst gene. Likewise, two nearly full-length cDNA clones for zyxin that lacked the codons for amino acids 19-42 (Δ1) or 261-283 (Δ2), respectively, were placed into pGEX-5X-2 (12Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fusion constructs with GFP were prepared by ligating full-length or partial cDNA sequences for Lasp-1 and LIM-nebulette, respectively, into the expression vector pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) downstream of the GFP reporter gene. Authenticity and reading frame of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Northern Blotting—The multiple tissue Northern blots used in this study contained 2 μg of poly(A+) RNA from various healthy adult human and mouse tissues (Clontech). The membranes were hybridized at 42 °C with different cDNA probes in a buffer containing 50% formamide (4Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The probes corresponded to the N-terminal portion of human LIM-nebulette (residues 1-87, human 5′ probe), the C-terminal portion of human LIM-nebulette (residues 126-270, human 3′ probe), the LIM domain of mouse LIM-nebulette (residues 1-61, mouse 5′ probe), and the SH3 domain of mouse LIM-nebulette (residues 202-270, mouse 3′ probe). The fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primed oligolabeling method. After overnight hybridization, the nylon membranes were washed in 1× sodium citrate buffer and exposed to X-Omat AR x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Yeast Two-hybrid System—Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed essentially as described in the manuals provided by the supplier (Clontech). Bait and prey plasmids were co-transfected into the yeast reporter strain Y190 by the lithium acetate method. Selection for the activation of the HIS3 reporter gene was carried out on agar plates lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine. Colonies that appeared after incubation at 30 °C for 5-10 days were tested for the activation of the lacZ reporter gene using the colony filter lift assay. For quantitative data, the colonies were grown in liquid media and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity using O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (13Li B. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33328-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Li B. Zhuang L. Reinhard M. Trueb B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The ExSite PCR-based mutagenesis method was used to replace the codons for selected amino acids (25Costa G.L. Bauer J.C. McGowan B. Angert M. Weiner M.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 239-248PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, a cDNA for the N-terminal fragment of zyxin (residues 1-81) was ligated into pUC19. PCR was performed with a forward primer that harbored the desired mutation and a reverse primer that was phosphorylated at its 5′ end and selected in a way that it annealed directly adjacent to the 5′ end of the forward primer. After amplification, the maternal DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme DpnI (Roche Applied Science). The ends of the linear products were joined by ligation with T4 DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science), and the plasmids were transfected into competent bacteria (Escherichia coli XL-1 blue). Authenticity and reading frame of all mutated clones were verified by DNA sequencing. GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as suggested by the supplier (Amersham Biosciences). The bacteria were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The fusion proteins were purified from the lysate by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose and stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline while still immobilized on the beads. On the other hand, the sequences for Lasp-1, LIM-nebulette, and several fragments derived thereof were transcribed and translated in vitro from pGADT7 plasmids using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each pull-down experiment, 20 μl of 35S-labeled protein was diluted with 300 μl of ice-cold binding buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5). One tablet of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added per 10 ml of buffer. To reduce background binding, 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads without GST fusion protein was added, and the suspension was mixed at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. After incubation for 30 min, the beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The GST fusion protein (∼5 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was added, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed five times with washing buffer (150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5). Bound proteins were solubilized in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed on a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel. As input control, 5 μl of the 35S-labeled in vitro translation mixture was resolved in parallel on the same gel. The gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to BioMax MR film. Cell Culture and GFP Fusion Protein Expression—HeLa (CCL-2) and HT1080 (CCL-121) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and kept in the laboratory at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells grown to 60% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with the GFP plasmids (1 μg/well) that had been dissolved in 100 μl of Opti-MEM 1 (Invitrogen) containing 3 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Two days after transfection, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (12Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antiserum that had previously been prepared in our laboratory against human zyxin (amino acid residues 134-147) was used at a dilution of 1:50 (12Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After incubation with rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies, the slides were inspected under a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. Electronic pictures were taken with filter settings optimized for green (515-565 nm) and red (>590 nm) light emission, respectively, and merged with the help of a computer software program. Identification of Human and Mouse LIM-nebulette—Extensive screening for potential binding partners of human zyxin utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system had previously led to the identification of 54 positive cDNA clones coding for a total of 14 independent proteins (13Li B. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33328-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One of these clones (novel 26) that appeared to encode a novel protein was analyzed in more detail in the present study. It contained an open reading frame of 810 nucleotides that could be translated into a polypeptide of 270 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A, GenBank accession number AJ580772). A detailed analysis with the simple modular architecture research tool SMART (26Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar) predicted a protein of 31 kDa with an N-terminal LIM domain, three central nebulin-like repeats, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Fig. 1B). The gene for the novel protein was identified on human chromosome 10 in band 10p12 by comparing the cDNA sequence with the complete human genome sequence. This gene spanned 390 kb and encompassed seven exons. Surprisingly, the last three exons of the novel gene were found to be identical to three exons from the 3′ part of the human gene for the cytoskeletal protein nebulette (27Arimura T. Nakamura T. Hiroi S. Satoh M. Takahashi M. Ohbuchi N. Ueda K. Nouchi T. Yamaguchi N. Akai J. Matsumori A. Sasayama S. Kimura A. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore concluded that the novel protein must represent a splice variant of human nebulette. Consequently, it was termed LIM-nebulette to distinguish it from regular nebulette, which does not possess an N-terminal LIM domain. The mRNA of LIM-nebulette comprised the sequences of four novel exons located at the 5′ end of the nebulette gene as well as the sequences of exons 24, 27, and 28 from the 3′ end of this gene. Exons 1-23 and 25-26 of the nebulette gene were missing in LIM-nebulette. Because the 5′-untranslated region of the LIM-nebulette mRNA differed substantially from that of the nebulette mRNA, it seemed likely that the two mRNAs were transcribed from the nebulette gene by usage of two alternative promoters. To exclude the possibility that LIM-nebulette was simply the result of a cloning artifact, we also searched the mouse expressed sequence tag data bank for homologous sequences. In fact, we were able to identify several expressed sequence tag clones that coded for mouse LIM-nebulette (Fig. 1A). At the amino acid level, human and mouse LIM-nebulette differed only at seven positions and shared an overall identity of 97%. A comparison with the mouse genome sequence further demonstrated that the gene for mouse LIM-nebulette was located on mouse chromosome 2 in region 2A2, which is syntenic to human region 10p12. Similar to the human homologue, the mouse LIM-nebulette gene encompassed seven exons and spanned ∼390 kb. The first four exons were found to be located in the 5′ upstream region of the mouse nebulette gene, whereas the other three exons were identical to exons 24, 27, and 28 of the mouse nebulette gene. A comparison of the amino acid sequences from human and mouse LIM-nebulette with all entries of the Swiss Protein Database revealed a striking similarity with the cytoskeletal protein Lasp-1 (Fig. 1A). Similar to LIM-nebulette, Lasp-1 has a modular structure with an N-terminal LIM domain, two central nebulin-like repeats, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Fig. 1B). At the amino acid level, human LIM-nebulette and human Lasp-1 showed 66% sequence identity or 73% sequence similarity if conserved amino acid substitutions were included (Fig. 1A). The highest degree of similarity (78% identity) was observed between the SH3 domain of LIM-nebulette and that of Lasp-1. Thus, LIM-nebulette is a novel splice variant of nebulette that displays a modular structure similar to Lasp-1. Tissue Expression of LIM-nebulette—To determine what tissues might express LIM-nebulette, Northern blotting experiments were performed utilizing two different probes. One probe (human 5′ probe) was specific for LIM-nebulette and encoded the N-terminal sequence that is not found in regular nebulette (depicted in gray in Fig. 1B). The other probe (human 3′ probe) was designed to recognize the mRNAs for both LIM-nebulette and nebulette and corresponded to the sequence of the C-terminal half of the molecule (depicted in black in Fig. 1B). After hybridization to a human multiple tissue Northern blot, the 5′ probe detected a transcript of ∼7 kb that was expressed in a wide range of tissues, including kidney, lung, brain, placenta, and pancreas (Fig. 2A). When the same blot was stripped and hybridized with the human 3′ probe, a different expression pattern was observed (Fig. 2B). Three prominent bands of 10, 8, and 4 kb were detected in addition to the 7-kb transcript. The 7-kb transcript occurred as a faint band in the samples from kidney, lung, brain, placenta, and pancreas as observed above, but the additional bands of 10, 8, and 4 kb were exclusively detected in the sample from heart. Thus, nebulette is specifically expressed in heart as described previously, whereas the novel splice variant LIM-nebulette is expressed at a relatively low level in a wide range of tissues. To corroborate our results, a similar Northern blotting experiment was performed with probes specific for mouse LIM-nebulette. On a mouse multiple tissues Northern blot, the 5′ probe coding for the LIM domain of mouse LIM-nebulette hybridized to a transcript of ∼7 kb that occurred in the samples from lung, brain, and kidney (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the 3′ probe coding for the SH3 domain of mouse LIM-nebulette and nebulette detected a major transcript of 10 kb in the sample from heart as well as a minor transcript of 7 kb in the samples from lung, brain, and kidney (Fig 2D). Thus, human and mouse LIM-nebulette show a very similar tissue expression. Zyxin Interacts with the SH3 Domain of LIM-nebulette—The yeast two-hybrid system was used to map the binding site of zyxin in LIM-nebulette. To this end, several fragments of human LIM-nebulette cDNA were ligated into the prey vector pGADT7 downstream of the sequence for the GAL4 transactivation domain. The resulting constructs were introduced into yeast cells together with the bait vector pAS2-1 that contained the cDNA sequence for the N terminus of zyxin (residues 1-42) fused to the sequence for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. A potential interaction of the resulting fusion proteins was analyzed by growth of yeast on histidine-deficient agar plates and by transcription of the reporter gene lacZ. As expected, full-length LIM-nebulette showed a positive interaction with zyxin-(1-42) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, LIM-nebulette did not interact with lamin 5, which had been included as a negative control (data not shown). Furthermore, no binding to zyxin was detected with the N-terminal fragment of LIM-nebulette (residues 1-87) or with its central region (residues 126-219). However, a positive interaction was observed with the C-terminal half of LIM-nebulette (residues 126-270) as well as with the SH3 domain alone (residues 207-270). Thus, the SH3 domain, which occurs in nebulette and LIM-nebulette, appears to be sufficient for zyxin binding. The results obtained with the two-hybrid system were confirmed by GST pull-down assays. To this end, the N-terminal fragment of zyxin (residues 1-42) was expressed as a GST fusion protein in bacteria and bound to glutathione beads. Various fragments of LIM-nebulette were produced by coupled in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine and tested for their ability to bind to the GST-zyxin fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 3B, full-length LIM-nebulette was precipitated by GST-zyxin-(1-42). Likewise, the C-terminal half (residues 126-270) interacted with zyxin, whereas the N-terminal half (residues 1-87) did not. Further truncation of the C-terminal fragment indicated that the SH3 domain (residues 207-270) was sufficient for binding. In contrast, GST alone was not able to precipitate any of the fragments from LIM-nebulette used in this study (data not shown). Taken together, the results obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system and the GST pull-down assay clearly demonstrate that zyxin interacts specifically with LIM-nebulette and that the SH3 domain of LIM-nebulette is sufficient for this interaction. Zyxin Also Interacts with the SH3 Domain of Lasp-1—Because the structure of LIM-nebulette was highly related to that of Lasp-1, we investigated whether Lasp-1 would also interact with zyxin. As outlined above, two different approaches were used, the yeast two-hybrid system and GST pull-down assays. For the first set of experiments, cDNA sequences for full-length Lasp-1 and for two fragments derived thereof were inserted into the prey vector pGADT7. The resulting constructs were transfected into yeast together with the bait vector pAS2-1 that contained the sequence for zyxin-(1-42). Growth on histidine-deficient plates and expression of the reporter gene lacZ demonstrated that full-length Lasp-1 was indeed capable of binding to zyxin-(1-42) (Fig. 4A). This interaction was specific because neither zyxin-(1-42) nor Lasp-1 showed any interaction with the unrelated proteins p53 or lamin 5 (data not shown). Truncation of full-length Lasp-1 further indicated that the SH3 domain (residues 187-261) was responsible for the interaction, whereas the other fragment containing the LIM-domain and the two nebulin-like repeats showed no binding. In the second set of experiments, we performed GST pull-down assays with 35S-labeled Lasp-1 and the GST-zyxin fusion protein. Fig. 4B demonstrates that GST-zyxin-(1-42) was able to precipitate full-length Lasp-1, indicating a direct interaction of the two proteins in vitro. Moreover, binding to zyxin was observed with the SH3 domain of Lasp-1, but not with the N-terminal fragment. On the other hand, GST alone was not able to pull down full-length Lasp-1 or any of its truncated fragments (data not shown). Lasp-1 can therefore bind, through its SH3 domain, to zyxin in a way similar to that of LIM-nebulette. Binding Site i"

NO attenuates cardiac contractility and contributes to contractile dysfunction in heart failure, although the precise molecular mechanisms for these effects are poorly defined. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms type 5 and 6, which are preferentially expressed in cardiac myocytes, may be inhibited via a direct nitrosylation by NO. Because endothelial NO synthase (eNOS and NOS3), β-adrenergic (βAR) receptors, and AC6 all can localize in lipid raft/caveolin-rich microdomains, we sought to understand the role of lipid rafts in organizing components of βAR-Gs-AC signal transduction together with eNOS. Using neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, we found that disruption of lipid rafts with β-cyclodextrin inhibited forskolin-stimulated AC activity and cAMP production, eliminated caveolin-3-eNOS interaction, and increased NO production. βAR- and Gs-mediated activation of AC activity were inhibited by β-cyclodextrin treatment, but prostanoid receptor-stimulated AC activity, which appears to occur outside caveolin-rich microdomains, was unaffected unless eNOS was overexpressed and lipid rafts were disrupted. An NO donor, SNAP, inhibited basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in both native cardiac myocytes and cardiac myocytes and pulmonary artery endothelial cells engineered to overexpress AC6. These effects of SNAP were independent of guanylyl cyclase activity and were mimicked by overexpression of eNOS. The juxtaposition of eNOS with βAR and AC types 5 and 6 results in selective regulation of βAR by eNOS activity in lipid raft domains over other Gs-coupled receptors localized in nonraft domains.

Numerous GPCR, including β-adrenergic (βAR) and certain prostanoid receptors, couple to Gs to stimulate adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and the generation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). In cardiac myocytes, increased cAMP levels change several aspects of cardiac function to enhance, for example, rate and force of contraction and the rate of relaxation. cAMP action primarily occurs via activation of protein kinase A, which alters intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and contractile function by phosphorylating calcium channels, troponin I and phospholamban (1Rapundalo S.T. Solaro R.J. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Hartzell H.C. Mery P.F. Fischmeister R. Szabo G. Nature. 1991; 351: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). βAR, activated by catecholamines, is the predominant Gs-coupled GPCR in cardiac myocytes, but other receptors are also capable of regulating AC activity in these cells (3Ostrom R.S.

We and others have demonstrated that β1AR are efficiently coupled to activation of AC in cardiac myocytes due to their high degree of co-localization in a membrane microdomain composed of lipid rafts or caveolae, where AC is preferentially expressed (3Ostrom R.S.

Thus, co-localization of components in a signal transduction cascade appears to be a critical determinant of signaling efficiency by receptors that stimulate AC. Caveolae, detectable as plasma membrane invaginations enriched in the protein caveolin, are considered a subset of lipid rafts, membrane regions that are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol. The distinct lipid environment in lipid rafts and caveolae favors retention of certain plasma membrane proteins, creating a unique signaling microdomain (7Shaul P.W. Smart E.J. Robinson L.J.

The fact that only certain GPCR, AC, and portions of cellular Gs reside in this microdomain challenges the traditional concept that membrane-associated signaling proteins are randomly distributed in the plasma membrane and interact via diffusion (9Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Instead, many proteins involved in GPCR signal transduction are apparently restricted to lipid raft domains, perhaps in preformed signaling complexes that facilitate rapid and specific signal transduction (12Ostrom R.S.

NO appears to have mixed effects; at certain concentrations and certain subcellular locations, NO enhances Ca2+ transients by activating ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels, whereas at other concentrations and locations NO can inhibit βAR-induced cardiac inotropy (21Hare J.M. Loh E. Creager M.A. Colucci W.S. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2198-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 22Hare J.M. Givertz M.M. Creager M.A. Colucci W.S.

The effect of NO on βAR signaling is specific to eNOS relative to other NOS isoforms, perhaps because of the spatial co-localization of this isoform with βAR and AC in caveolae (24Barouch L.A. Harrison R.W. Skaf M.W. Rosas G.O. Cappola T.P. Kobeissi Z.A. Hobai I.A. Lemmon C.A. Burnett A.L. O'Rourke B. Rodriguez E.R. Huang P.L. Lima J.A. Berkowitz D.E. Hare J.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 337-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NO regulation of βAR-mediated inotropy may contribute to blunted function in failing hearts perhaps because of an increased number of caveolae (25Hare J.M. Lofthouse R.A. Juang G.J. Colman L.

The precise mechanism by which NO attenuates βAR signaling is not well characterized, but it has been suggested that NO can regulate AC types 5 and 6, the predominant AC isoforms expressed in the heart, via S-nitrosylation (26McVey M. Hill J. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18887-18892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Hill J. Howlett A. Klein C. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to examine the role of lipid rafts/caveolin-rich domains in GPCR-Gs-AC signaling and to assess if NO is an important regulator of cAMP production stimulated by GPCR. By using an NO donor and by overexpressing eNOS and AC6 in cardiac myocytes and vascular endothelial cells, we conclude that NO inhibits AC activity, attenuating signaling via GPCR that are co-localized with eNOS and AC in lipid rafts. Thus, NO selectively regulates βAR-stimulated cAMP production by inhibiting raft-localized AC6. In contrast, AC activity stimulated by GPCR not localized in lipid raft domains is unaffected by NO or raft disruption unless eNOS is overexpressed and lipid rafts are disrupted. The data thus emphasize the key role of lipid rafts in maintaining the association between caveolin and eNOS so as to facilitate regulation of βAR-Gs-AC signaling. Materials—Adenovirus expressing the murine AC6 cDNA was generated as described previously (28Gao M. Ping P. Post S. Insel P.A. Tang R. Hammond H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing the bovine eNOS cDNA was kindly donated by Dr. Donald Heistad and the Vector Development Core at the University of Iowa (29Ooboshi H. Chu Y. Rios C.D. Faraci F.M. Davidson B.L. Heistad D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H265-H270PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies for β1AR, β2AR, and AC5/6 and all secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Primary antibodies for caveolin-3 and eNOS were obtained from BD PharMingen. Primary antibody for EP2R was obtained from Cayman Chemical. Radiolabeled chemicals were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Forskolin, N-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), and SNAP were obtained from Calbiochem. All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. Measurement of cAMP Production—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were prepared and maintained as described previously (3Ostrom R.S. Violin J.D. Coleman S. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1075-1079PubMed Google Scholar). One day after plating, cells were incubated with indicated adenoviral construct(s) for 20 h (10–100 multiplicity of infection/cell), following which cells were washed extensively and allowed to equilibrate for 24 h. Myocytes were washed three times with serum-free and NaHCO3-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (DMEH). In some assays, cells were treated with 2% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (βCD) for 1 h at 37 °C to disrupt lipid rafts and washed with DMEH. Other cells were treated with βCD for 1 h, washed with DMEH, and then treated with βCD-cholesterol complexes (10 μg/ml cholesterol-βCD in a 1:6 molar ratio; Sigma catalog no. C4951) to deliver cholesterol back to the cells (30Rong J.X. Shapiro M. Trogan E. Fisher E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13531-13536Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Cells were equilibrated in DMEH for 30 min and then assayed for cAMP accumulation by adding drugs of interest in the presence of a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine for 10 min. When inhibitors were used, these agents were incubated with cells for 5 min before the addition of agonists. Assay medium was aspirated, and 250 μl of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (7.5%, w/v) was immediately added to each well to terminate reactions. Trichloroacetic acid extracts were assayed for cAMP content by radioimmunoassay, as previously described (4Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Drenan R.M. Xiang Y. Regan J.W. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42063-42069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CPAE; ATCC number CCL-209) were cultured in minimum essential medium containing Earle's salt (Invitrogen) and 20% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific) at 37 °C in 95% humidified air, 5% CO2. Cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks and passed once a week with a split ratio of 1:5. cAMP accumulation was measured as described above on passage 7–15 CPAE seeded in 24-well plates. Measurement of NOS and AC Activity—AC and NOS activities were measured in membranes prepared from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and then scraped into hypotonic homogenizing buffer (30 mm Na-HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and homogenized with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was then transferred to a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in buffer (30 mm Na-HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) to attain ∼1 mg/ml total protein concentration before being added into tubes containing drug and either AC assay buffer (30 mm Na-HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 5 μm GTP, 60 unit/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5.) or NOS assay buffer (Stratagene). AC activity assays were terminated after 15 min by boiling, and cAMP content was determined by radioimmunoassay. NOS activity was assayed by measuring the conversion of [3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline using the NOSdetect™ assay kit (Stratagene). Membrane Fractionation—Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were fractionated using a detergent-free method adapted from Song et al. (31Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and described previously (4Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Drenan R.M. Xiang Y. Regan J.W. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42063-42069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in 500 mm sodium carbonate plus mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog no. P-8340) with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, three 10-s bursts in a tissue grinder, and then three 20-s bursts with a sonicator. The homogenate was brought to 45% sucrose by the addition of 90% sucrose in 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, and loaded in an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was layered on top of the sample by placing 4 ml of 35% sucrose and then 4 ml of 5% sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 33,000 rpm on a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 16–20 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected in 1-ml aliquots from the top of the gradient. Immunoprecipitation—Caveolin-3 was immunoprecipitated from isolated lipid raft fractions and from whole cell lysates using a protein A- or protein G-agarose method. For precipitations from lipid raft fractions, we pooled fractions 4 and 5 from the gradient after membrane fractionation and treated half the sample with 2% βCD and the other half with vehicle for 2 h on ice. For precipitations from whole cells, 10-cm plates of either control or βCD-treated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630 plus mammalian protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma catalog no. P-8340) and homogenized on ice with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Both types of samples were precleared with protein A-agarose or protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) and then incubated with primary antibody for 1–3 h on a rocking platform at 4 °C. Antibody conjugates were precipitated by incubating with protein A/G-agarose overnight on a rocking platform at 4 °C and centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Protein A/G-agarose pellets were then washed once in lysis buffer followed by three washes each in wash buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Igepal CA-630) and wash buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Igepal CA-630). Pellets and immunoprecipitation supernatants were suspended in sample buffer containing 20% β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 70 °C for 10 min. Proteins in both the immunoprecipitates and the supernatants were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (32Ostrom R.S. Liu X. Head B.P. Gregorian C. Seasholtz T.M. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were loaded into polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked in 3% phosphate-buffered saline/milk, incubated with primary antibody (see “Materials”) followed by secondary antibody with conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were visualized using chemiluminescence and a digital imaging system (UVP, Inc.). All bands shown migrated at the expected size, as determined by comparison with molecular weight standards (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The amount of protein per fraction was determined using a dye-binding protein assay (Bio-Rad). Data Analysis and Statistics—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments or as representative images of at least three separate experiments. Statistical comparisons (t tests and one-way analysis of variance), nonlinear regression analysis, and graphics were performed using Graph Pad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software). For analysis of concentration-response curves, individual experiments were fitted by nonlinear regression, and paired t tests were performed comparing EC50 values and maximum responses between treatment conditions. NO as a Regulator of cAMP Production in Cardiac Myocytes and Endothelial Cells—To determine if NO is a regulator of cardiac myocyte cAMP production, we used a NO donor, (±)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and measured both basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Inclusion of SNAP (10 μm) significantly reduced basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in both control cardiac myocytes and myocytes incubated with an adenovirus to overexpress AC6 (Fig. 1A). The inhibition by SNAP of forskolin-stimulated cAMP was greater in AC6-overexpressing cells in terms of absolute amounts of cAMP (197 ± 36 pmol of cAMP in control cells and 525 ± 93 pmol of cAMP in AC6-overexpressing cells) but similar in proportional terms (38 ± 5.3% inhibition in control cells, 38 ± 2.2% inhibition in AC6-overexpressing cells). We also investigated whether a NOS inhibitor, l-NMMA, could release a tonic inhibition of cAMP production. Inclusion of 1 mm l-NMMA did not alter basal or forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in control cardiac myocytes but significantly increased forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in AC6-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1A). These data imply that increases in NO can blunt formation of cAMP in neonatal cardiac myocytes but that NO derived from endogenous NOS activity does not tonically inhibit cAMP production in these cells unless adenylyl cyclase is expressed at greater than ambient levels. In cardiac fibroblasts, NO production can act via soluble guanylyl cyclase to induce the expression of a phosphodiesterase, PDE2, which inhibits cAMP accumulation stimulated by forskolin or isoproterenol (33Gustafsson A.B. Brunton L.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C463-C471Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested a 5-fold higher concentration of isobutylmethylxanthine (1 mm), the nonspecific PDE inhibitor used in our other assays, a PDE2-specific inhibitor, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine, and a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalon-1-one, in measurements of AC activity in membranes from cardiac myocytes to determine if a similar mechanism exists in these cells. We found that neither high levels of isobutylmethylxanthine nor inclusion of erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine or 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalon-1-one altered the ability of SNAP to inhibit forskolin-stimulated AC activity (Fig. 1B). These data are consistent with the idea that NO inhibits activity of AC5 and AC6 independent of guanylyl cyclase activation or induction of a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. We hypothesized that direct NO regulation of AC activity would be evident in other cell types that expressed eNOS and AC6. To test this idea, we used CPAE and measured the effects of an NO donor on cAMP production. By contrast with the results that we observed in cardiac myocytes, SNAP (10 μm) did not reduce basal or forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in CPAE cells (Fig. 2). However, SNAP did reduce forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in CPAE cells engineered to overexpress AC6. Although l-NMMA (1 mm) did not alter basal or forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in control CPAE cells, l-NMMA significantly (p < 0.05 by paired t test) increased forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in AC6-overexpressing CPAE cells. Thus, CPAE cells only demonstrate NO-inhibited cAMP production when engineered to overexpress AC6, a result consistent with the idea that eNOS-derived NO preferentially inhibits activity of AC6 (26McVey M. Hill J. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18887-18892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Hill J. Howlett A. Klein C. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Role of Intact Lipid Rafts in GPCR-Gs-AC Signal Transduction—Previous reports indicate that eNOS is highly localized in lipid rafts and caveolae in endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes and that its activity is inhibited by binding to the caveolin scaffold (18Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that intact lipid rafts or caveolae retain eNOS in the inactive state, thereby perhaps minimizing its role in regulating cAMP production under normal conditions (Fig. 1B). To test this hypothesis, we disrupted lipid rafts by treating cells with 2% βCD, a cholesterol binding agent, for 1 h and then measured cAMP production. These conditions lead to the disruption of morphologically identified caveolae (34Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar) and to the loss of caveolin-3, eNOS, and AC5/6 immunoreactivity from buoyant fractions of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (Fig. 3) (6Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We overexpressed AC6 in these studies in order to enhance the absolute extent of NO inhibition of cAMP accumulation (as shown in Fig. 1). βCD treatment inhibited forskolin- and isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production but did not inhibit PGE2-stimulated cAMP production (Fig. 4A), consistent with the co-localization of βAR and AC6 in lipid raft/caveolin-rich domains and the exclusion of PGE2 receptors from those domains (3Ostrom R.S. Violin J.D. Coleman S. Insel P.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1075-1079PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Adding cholesterol back to the cells by treating with βCD-cholesterol complexes following βCD treatment largely reversed these effects, indicating the specificity and reversibility of βCD treatment. To investigate the impact of βCD treatment in more detail, we measured cAMP production in response to multiple concentrations of forskolin, isoproterenol, and PGE2. βCD treatment caused a 5.8 ± 0.3-fold rightward shift (p < 0.01) in the forskolin concentration-response curve with no significant change in the maximal response (Fig. 4B). Although inclusion of l-NMMA (1 mm) did not alter the forskolin response in untreated cells (Fig. 1B), l-NMMA partially reversed the rightward shift induced by βCD treatment (a 2.3 ± 0.3-fold leftward shift as compared with the βCD response, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). NOS activity was increased in membranes prepared from cardiac myocytes treated with βCD as compared with those prepared from vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 4A, inset). Therefore, lipid raft disruption appears to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production due, in part, to an increase in NOS activity. By contrast with the impact of βCD treatment on forskolin response, we found different effects on the concentration-response curves for isoproterenol and PGE2 (Fig. 4, C and D), the receptors for which show different patterns for localization in lipid raft, caveolin-rich domains (Fig. 3) (4Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Drenan R.M. Xiang Y. Regan J.W. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42063-42069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). βCD treatment caused no shift in the isoproterenol concentration-response curve and reduced the maximal response by 37 ± 8% as compared with untreated cells (p < 0.05; Fig. 4C). Inclusion of the NOS inhibitor caused a leftward shift of the response curve (1.5 ± 0.2-fold as compared with control, 1.6 ± 0.4-fold versus βCD treated alone, both p < 0.05) but did not alter the βCD-induced reduction in maximal response. Thus, βCD treatment has qualitatively different effects on βAR-stimulated versus forskolin-stimulated cAMP production; for βAR, but not forskolin, we found an inhibition of maximal response, whereas for both types of agonists, we observe a NOS-dependent component that decreases potency (to a greater extent in the case of f"

Distinct promoters in the Runx2 gene transcribe the “bone-related” Runx2-II and non-osseous Runx2-I isoforms that differ only in their respective N termini. Existing mutant mouse models with both isoforms deleted exhibit an arrest of osteoblast and chondrocyte maturation and the complete absence of mineralized bone, but they do not distinguish the separate functions of the two N-terminal isoforms. To elucidate the function of the bone-related isoform, we generated selective Runx2-II-deficient mice by the targeted deletion of the distal promoter and exon 1. Homozygous Runx2-II-deficient (Runx2-II-/-) mice unexpectedly formed axial, appendicular, and craniofacial bones derived from either intramembranous ossification or mesenchymal cells of the bone collar, but they failed to form the posterior cranium and other bones derived from endochondral ossification. Heterozygous Runx2-II-deficient mice had grossly normal skeletons, but were osteopenic. The commitment of mesenchymal cells ex vivo to the osteoblast lineage occurred in Runx2-II-/- mice, but osteoblastic gene expression was impaired. Chondrocyte maturation appeared normal, but the zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes was not transformed into metaphyseal bone, leading to widened growth plates in Runx2-II-/- mice. Compensatory increments in Runx2-I expression occurred in Runx2-II-/- mice but were not sufficient to normalize osteoblastic maturation or transcriptional activity. Our findings support distinct functions of Runx2-II and -I in the control of skeletogenesis.

Thus, Runx2-II and I differ only in their 5′-UTRs and N-terminal amino acids and are identical with respect to their runt domains and C termini. The functional consequences of these apparently redundant Runx2 gene products, which differ only in their N termini, are poorly understood.Runx2-II and Runx2-I are presumed to have distinct roles based on the predominant expression of the type II isoform in bone (13Ducy P.

Transgenic mouse studies overexpressing Runx2 isoforms by using heterologous promoters also fail to identify important differences between Runx2-I and II (15Ueta C. Iwamoto M. Kanatani N. Yoshida C.

These forced expression studies are limited by high levels of expression and alterations in the temporal-spatial expression of the isoforms that may lead to erroneous conclusions about the physiological differences in function of these isoforms.

The selective deletion of Runx2-I or Runx2-II in vivo is necessary to understand their separate functions.In the present study, we generated selective Runx2-II-deficient mice to assess the role of the “bone-specific” isoform in skeletogenesis. We show an unexpectedly mild phenotype in the skeletal system of selectively Runx2-II-/- mice. Rather than the complete absence of osteoblasts and mineralized skeleton that occurs with the deletion of both Runx2-I and II, selective Runx2-II-deficient mice have limited impairment of osteoblast maturation and form an almost complete mineralized skeleton characterized by greater defects in endochondral than in intramembranous bone formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Runx2-II Mutant Mice—We isolated Runx2-II genomic clones from a 129/SVJ genomic library (Stratagene). We prepared a targeting construct in which the Runx2-II sequence between NheI and XbaI, including the P1 promoter and exon1, was removed and replaced with a Neor cassette. We linearized the targeting plasmid with NotI and transfected it into embryonic stem cells. Targeted clones were identified by PCR. We used two embryonic stem cell lines with disruptions in Runx2-II to generate Runx2-II-deficient mice. The correctly mutated embryonic stem clones were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6J and implanted into 2.5-day-old pseudopregnant females by the Duke Transgenic Facility. The resulting chimeric animals were backcrossed to C57BL/6J, and heterozygous mutants were genotyped by PCR using tail-tip DNA. Brother-sister mating was then carried out to generate homozygous mutants.Skeletal and Histological Preparations—Whole mouse carcasses were collected from newborn mice after euthanasia, defatted for 2-3 days in acetone, stained sequentially with Alcian blue and Alizarin red S in 2% KOH, cleared with 1% KOH and 20% glycerol, and stored in 50% EtOH and 50% glycerol (31Tu Q. Pi M. Karsenty G. Simpson L. Liu S. Quarles L.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Tibias from newborn mice were decalcified at 4 °C in 12.5% EDTA and 2.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to assess the histology of the growth plate in tibias.Microcomputed Tomography (μCT) Analysis—The whole mouse skeleton and proximal tibial metaphyses were scanned using a μCT 40 (Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland), and the three-dimensional images were generated using the following values for a gauss filter: σ = 0.8; support = 1; and threshold = 194. A three-dimensional analysis was done to determine bone volume/tissue volume, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, and trabecular separation. Cortical bone was measured on the mid-shaft region of cortical bone. 50 slices of the diaphysis, constituting 0.3 mm in length, were selected. The mean cortical thickness was determined by distance measurements at eight different points on the cortical slice.Real Time Reverse Transcription PCR—For quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR, 2.0 μg of total RNA isolated from the long bone of newborn mice was reverse transcribed as described (32Xiao Z.S. Simpson L.G. Quarles L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PCR reactions contained 100 ηg of template (cDNA or RNA) and 300 ηm each forward and reverse primer and 1X iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in 50 μl. Samples were amplified for 40 cycles in an iCycler iQ™ real time PCR detection system with an initial melt at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. PCR product accumulation was monitored at multiple points during each cycle by measuring the increase in fluorescence caused by the binding of SybrGreen I to double-stranded DNA. The threshold cycle of tested gene product from the indicated genotype was normalized to the threshold cycle for cyclophilin A.

For super-shift experiments, polyclonal Runx2 antibody was added. Osteoblasts were transfected with the following: 1) pcDNA 3.1 expression empty vector or pcDNA 3.1 expression vector containing the Runx2-I or II isoform (0.25 μg); 2) 1.3-kb mouse osteocalcin promoter-luciferase fusion plasmid (p1.3OC-luc, 1.0 μg); and 3) a pCMVβ-gal plasmid (0.1 μg) using a Lipofectin (Invitrogen) protocol. After 48 h, we assayed luciferase activity in cell lysates as described previously (35Xiao Z.S. Liu S.G. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by quantifying the β-galactosidase activity and dividing by the value obtained with cotransfection of the pcDNA 3.1 empty expression vector and p1.3OCLuc in wild-type osteoblasts.Statistics—We evaluated differences between groups by one-way analysis of variance. All values are expressed as means ± S.E. All computations were performed using the Statgraphics statistical graphics system (STSC Inc.).RESULTSCreation of Selective Runx2-II-deficient Mice—Our targeting strategy (Fig. 1A) resulted in selective deletion of the P1 promoter and exon 1 encoding the N terminus and the first 19 amino acids (i.e. MASNSLFSAVTPCQQSFFW) of the Runx2-II isoform, respectively. Wild-type, Runx2-II+/-, and Runx2-II-/- mice were genotyped by PCR (Fig. 1, B and C). Mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency. The gross appearance of wild-type and Runx2-II+/- mutant mice were indistinguishable, whereas the Runx2-II-/- mutants were smaller in size (Fig. 2A) and had significantly (p < 0.05) lower body weight (1.2 ± 0.05 g) and length (3.6 ± 0.07 cm) compared with the respective values for wild-type litter mates (1.7 ± 0.05 g and 4.5 ± 0.04 cm) (Fig. 2, B and C). The Runx2-II+/- mice had an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 2, A-C) with body weight (1.5 ± 0.03 g) and length (4.3 ± 0.4 cm) also significantly less than those of wild-type mice. Approximately 20% of the selective Runx2-II-/- mice survived for at least 1 week (Fig. 2D); death appeared to be due to respiratory failure. The survival of Runx2-II+/- mice was not different from that of wild-type litter mates.Fig. 2Gross appearance, body size, and survival in newborn Runx2-II-deficient mice.

This skeletal phenotype was much less severe than the complete absence of mineralized bone in the previously described Runx2 null mice lacking both Runx2-I and II (8Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S.

https://openalex.org/W1997455769,"Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) coats the malarial sporozoite and functions to target the liver for infection, which is the first step to developing malaria. An important tissue ligand for CSP is the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS) found on the surface of hepatocytes and in the basement membrane of the space of Disse. To better understand this efficient targeting process, we set out to identify and characterize the HS binding site(s) of CSP. We synthesized a series of peptides corresponding to five regions of Plasmodium falciparum CSP containing basic residues, a common requirement of HS binding sites, and screened them for heparin and HS binding activity. Only one of these peptides (Pf 2), which contains a motif we have named region I-plus, demonstrated both high affinity heparin/HS binding activity and the ability to block the binding of recombinant CSP to heparin-Sepharose 4B. Analysis by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that region I-plus has a binding constant of Kd = 5.0 μm and a stoichiometry of n = 7.8 binding sites/heparin chain. Heparin binding was dependent on the amino acid sequence of region I-plus, and the binding sites on heparin/HS are contained within a decasaccharide. Furthermore, HS oligosaccharides rich in sulfate and iduronic acid content (heparin-like) are required for efficient binding. Because liver HS is exceptionally high in both these components relative to the HS of other organs, the HS structural requirements for efficient region I-plus/HS binding are consistent with this peptide sequence functioning to target sporozoites to the liver for attachment to hepatocytes. Finally, the region I-plus heparin/HS binding site was also discovered for two other species that infect humans, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium vivax, further supporting the existence of a HS binding domain in the N-terminal portion of CSP.

Four species of the protozoan genus Plasmodium (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae) cause malaria, the most devastating parasitic disease in humans. Worldwide 300–500 million people are infected yearly, leading to 1.5–2.7 million deaths caused mostly by P. falciparum (1World Health OrganizationWkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 1997; 72: 269-274PubMed Google Scholar). The complex life cycle of parasites involves several stages, which probably contributes to its ability to evade immune detection and complicates the development of vaccines. Malarial infection is initiated when as few as 10 sporozoites (2Ungureanu E. Killick-Kendrick R. Garnham P.C. Branzei P. Romanescu C. Shute P.G. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.

Vanderberg J.P. Terzakis J.A. J. Protozool. 1982; 29: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). There they divide asexually into large numbers of merozoites, which leave the liver and infect erythrocytes causing the severe symptoms of malaria. The initial rapid and specific invasion of hepatocytes is mediated by the interaction between the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), 1The abbreviations used are: CSP, circumsporozoite protein; CS, chondroitin sulfate; DS, dermatan sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GlcA, β-d-glucuronic acid; GlcNS, N-sulfation of GlcNac; HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; IdoA, α-d-iduronic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; rCSP, recombinant circumsporozoite protein; RT, retention time; TSR, thrombospondin type I repeat; Pm, P. malariae; Pf, P. falciparum; Pv, P. vivax. 1The abbreviations used are: CSP, circumsporozoite protein; CS, chondroitin sulfate; DS, dermatan sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GlcA, β-d-glucuronic acid; GlcNS, N-sulfation of GlcNac; HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; IdoA, α-d-iduronic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; rCSP, recombinant circumsporozoite protein; RT, retention time; TSR, thrombospondin type I repeat; Pm, P. malariae; Pf, P. falciparum; Pv, P. vivax. which coats the surface of the sporozoite (4Dame J.B.

Microbiol. 2002; 45: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Numerous proteins such as growth factors, serine protease inhibitors, extracellular matrix proteins, lipoproteins, and lipolytic enzymes are also known to associate with HS as part of their normal function (9Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 10Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), and many pathogenic organisms including Plasmodium have evolved proteins to target HS for attachment and invasion of specific host cells (11Wadstrom T. Ljungh A. J. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 48: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the last 15 years, there has been extensive characterization of HS binding sites and heparin, which is produced and stored only in mast cells, has been widely used in these studies because of its structural similarity to the more ubiquitously distributed HS. Heparin and HS are both acidic polysaccharides composed of alternating hexuronic acids and hexosamines (10Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 12Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Nascent chains of heparin and HS are composed of β-d-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine, which are linked through a tetrasaccharide “stem” to Ser residues of a core protein. During the process of elongation, the polysaccharide chains are further modified by a series of enzymatic reactions: N-deacetylation; N-sulfation of GlcNac (GlcNS); C-5 epimerization of GlcA to α-d-iduronic acid (IdoA) followed by further sulfation generating IdoA-2-OSO3G, GlcNS-6-OSO3G, and trace levels of GlcNS-3-OSO3G saccharide units. For heparin, the resulting mature chain contains >80% IdoA with >2.4 SO3G/disaccharide. By comparison, HS is generally less extensively modified with <50% IdoA and containing a more varied sulfation pattern with regions of high sulfation associated with high IdoA content and regions of little or no sulfation associated with high GlcA content.Polypeptide sequences of heparin or HS binding sites are typically relatively short continuous sequences rich in the basic residues R and K (13Caldwell E.E. Nadkarni V.D. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Weiler J.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which can interact electrostatically with the anionic groups (COO–, OSO–3) on HS. Based on the sequence alignment of several well characterized heparin/HS binding sites, three consensus sequences have been described, XBBXBX, XBBBXBBX, and XBBXXBBBXXBBX (B = basic, X = non-basic) (14Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sobel M. Soler D.F. Kermode J.C. Harris R.B. J. Biol.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), although there are many examples of heparin binding sequences for which consensus sequences have not been assigned. It has also been proposed that the three-dimensional structure for heparin binding sites are critical with the outer basic residues tending to be spaced approximately 20 Å apart with no significant sequence similarities for the intervening residues (17Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Malarial CSPs are ∼400 amino acids long organized into three domains: the N-terminal domain containing a conserved pentapeptide called region I; a highly repetitive species-specific central domain; and a C-terminal domain containing another conserved sequence called region II. This latter sequence has strong similarity to a portion of the type I cell adhesion motif called thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR), an ancient domain encoded in over 40 genes in humans (18Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) initially described for thrombospondin (19Lawler J. Blood. 1986; 67: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the region II-plus (region II plus eight downstream residues, EWSPCSVTCGNGIQVRIK) of CSP is responsible for sporozoite binding to HS on hepatocytes (20Cerami C. Frevert U. Sinnis P. Takacs B. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Sinnis P. Clavijo P. Fenyo D. Chait B.T. Cerami C. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19205-19213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, given its extensive duplication in so many genes, the cell surface receptors for the TSR domains are probably ubiquitously distributed throughout the body, which would argue that another region in the CSP mediates the highly specific attachment of the sporozoite to hepatocytes. Also, the basic residue content and spacing for region II-plus appears atypical for a heparin/HS binding motif.To our knowledge a systematic approach to localize the heparin/HS binding site(s) of CSP by direct heparin/HS binding assay has not been reported. In this paper we evaluate the heparin/HS binding potential of region II-plus and a series of other synthetic peptides corresponding to five different regions of P. falciparum CSP with a relatively high basic residue content. One high affinity heparin binding site we call region I-plus is identified in the N terminus of the CSP, which contains two copies of a heparin binding consensus sequence and the highly conserved pentapeptide, region I. The relative importance of the major side groups of heparin/HS for binding was determined. Finally, the heparin/HS binding potential of the region I-plus sequences for two other malaria-causing Plasmodium species, P. malariae and P. vivax, was also investigated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGlycosaminoglycans and Peptides—Heparin, heparan sulfate (bovine kidney), chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronan, and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) were purchased from Sigma. Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Modified heparins, low molecular weight heparins (Mr = 5000 and 3000), and highly sulfated HS were purchased from Seikagaku America Inc. (Ijamsville, MD) and Neoprin (San Leandro, CA). Carboxy-modified heparin was made by borohydride reduction in the presence of carbodiimide (23Taylor R.L. Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Cifonelli J.A. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3633-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized at the Advanced Protein Technology Centre, Peptide Synthesis Facility, University of Toronto (Toronto, Ontario Canada) and the Core Facility, Department of Biochemistry, Queen's University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada). They were purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on an analytical C-18 column, dissolved in water (10 mg/ml), aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C. Cysteine-containing peptides were reduced with iodoacetamide to prevent any interdisulfide bridging and re-purified.Recombinant Circumsporozoite Protein (rCSP)—A frozen stock of Escherichia coli transformants expressing the P. falciparum CSP (27–123-NANPNVDP)3(NANP)21-300–411)-(H)6 was kindly provided by Dr. Ute Frevert (Department of Medical and Molecular Parasitology, New York University Medical Center). Bacteria were grown in LB broth, 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, and 0.025 mg/ml kanamycin, and the expression of rCSP was induced with 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4–5 h. The rCSP was purified from a 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 6 m guanidine-HCl bacterial extract by affinity column chromatography. Purification and refolding of rCSP involved binding the bacterial extract to a 10-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) and washing with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, to remove the guanidine-HCl. The rCSP was then eluted from the column with 0.25 m imidazole in sodium phosphate, and to the eluant, 0.5 m l-arginine and 10%(v/v) glycerol were added and left overnight at 10 °C. Disulfide bond formation was then promoted by incubation with 0.9 mm GSSG (oxidized) for ∼8 h at 10 °C. The sample was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5 overnight at 4 °C. The dialysate was then applied to a heparin-Sepharose 4B column (5 ml) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Bound rCSP was eluted in Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl buffer and dialyzed as before. Dialysate was then collected and stored at –70 °C. The re-folded structure of rCSP was assessed by circular dichroism (CD) using a DSM 1000 CD spectrophotometer and analyzed with the CD deconvolution software CDNN, version 2.1.Heparin/HS Columns—Affinity columns were generated by coupling heparin or HS to Sepharose 4B based on the method of Smith et al. (24Smith P.K. Mallia A.K. Hermanson G.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Sepharose 4B was washed with 20 bed volumes of water, re-suspended in 1 ml of water, and transferred to a beaker and placed on ice. Heparin or HS was dissolved in water (2 mg/ml) and also cooled on ice. The two solutions were mixed and the pH was adjusted to pH 10–11 with NaOH (5N). Fresh CNBr in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 g/ml) was added drop-wise to a final concentration of 31 mg/ml. The pH of the reaction was kept at ∼pH 11 with the periodic addition of NaOH for 15 min and then left to stir overnight at room temperature. The gel was then washed with 20 bed volumes of water followed by 1 m ethanolamine pH 9, to block unreacted groups. The column was further washed with 10 bed volumes of (i) water, (ii) 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and (iii) 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.3, and then equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. By this procedure, heparin/HS was linked through its –NH2 and –OH groups. The amount of heparin coupled to the Sepharose was 0.5–0.75 mg/ml as determined by the toluidine blue assay (24Smith P.K. Mallia A.K. Hermanson G.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Affi-Gel heparin was purchased from Bio-Rad.Affinity Chromatography on Heparin/HS-Sepharose 4B—Peptides (35–45 μg) were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and loaded onto a 2-ml heparin-Sepharose column (0.5 mg heparin/ml) connected to an high pressure liquid chromatography system (Waters) and equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing the column at 0.6 ml/min with 3 bed volumes, the column was developed with a 0–1 m NaCl linear concentration gradient (12 bed volumes) at 0.75 ml/min. The eluate was monitored continuously at 214 nm, and the absorbance was plotted against retention time (RT). Unbound peptides eluted 2.5–2.8 min after injection, and based on the RTs for the bound peptides, the NaCl concentration at which desorption took place could be calculated as follows: desorption [NaCl] = RT – (2.8–10.0 min)/32 min. Each peptide was run at least twice, and the RTs were reproducible within 1–2%.Binding and Competition Assays—Binding and competition assays were performed on a series of heparin-Sepharose columns (0.2 ml) packed in disposable 2-ml polypropylene columns (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated with 10 bed volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.2 (elution buffer) by gravity feed. Peptides (16 nmol) were dissolved in 200 μl of equilibration buffer and applied to the columns, allowed to bind for 5 min and then washed with 7 bed volumes of the same buffer to remove unbound peptide. Bound peptide was eluted with 4 bed volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 2 m NaCl, pH 7.2, and the peptide concentration was determined by absorbance at 220 nm using a spectrophotometer. Nonspecific binding to the Sepharose 4B was <2%. To determine whether binding was saturable, assays were done with heparin columns serially diluted with unmodified Sepharose 4B. The heparin content of the columns was determined by the toluidine blue assay (24Smith P.K. Mallia A.K. Hermanson G.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Competition binding assays were performed by loading peptides with increasing concentrations of soluble heparin, low molecular weight heparin, chemically modified heparins, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronan, taurine, or a tri-sulfated disaccharide (hexuronic acid (2-OSO–3)-GlcNOSO–3 (6-OSO)) onto the heparin-Sepharose 4B columns (30 μg heparin/200 μl of Sepharose 4B) and incubating for 5 min. Bound peptide was assayed as previously described. All of the assays were performed at least three times, and the means ± S.D. were calculated. The concentrations for chemically modified heparins were determined by the carbazole assay (25Bitter T. Muir S.K. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5143) Google Scholar). The molecular masses for heparin and the modified heparins ranged from 9,000 to 12,000 Da with the average being 10,500 Da. For competition assays involving rCSP, the competing peptides were removed by filtration with a Microcon centrifugal filter (Mr = 10,000 cutoff, Amicon) prior to quantitation of rCSP.Heparin Binding Measured by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC measurements were performed at 25 °C on a MicroCal™ VP-ITC. Peptides (0.1–0.2 mm in 1.4 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) were titrated with 55 injections of 5 μl of heparin (0.28 mm) from a rotating syringe (430 rpm). Each injection generated a heat change, which was measured as μcal/s (thermal energy ΔH). The area under each injection peak was determined and analyzed by an iterative nonlinear least-squares algorithm using the Origin software (version 5) to calculate the binding constant (Kd), reaction stoichiometry (n), and enthalpy (ΔH). Assays were performed twice for each peptide, and the mean and range was determined.RESULTSA Heparin/HS Binding Site Identified in the N terminus of the CSP for P. falciparum—Malarial parasite CSPs, including that of P. falciparum, are approximately 400 amino acids in length organized into three domains (Fig. 1A): the N-terminal domain, which contains a conserved pentapeptide region I; a highly repetitive central domain; and a C-terminal domain containing region II, a sequence similar to the conserved adhesion sequence, TSR. Inspection of the CSP sequence for P. falciparum revealed five regions that are enriched for basic residues, two in the N-terminal domain and three in the C-terminal domain. Six CSP peptides (Fig. 1B) corresponding to 1) residues 53–75 (Pf 1), 2) residues 82–100 (Pf 2), 3) residues 309–326 (Pf 3), 4) residues 328–346 (Pf 4, also called region II-plus), 5) residues 341–372 (Pf 5), and 6) residues 348–372 (Pf 6) were synthesized and purified, and their heparin/HS binding activities were tested. Three of these peptides, Pf 1, Pf 6 and Pf 2, bound heparin-Sepharose 4B (2 ml) with retention times of 19.6, 20.4, and 25.2 min corresponding to desorption NaCl concentrations of 0.21, 0.24, and 0.39 m, respectively (Fig. 2A). Peptides Pf 3, Pf 5, and Pf 4 demonstrated little or no avidity for heparin and eluted in the void fraction. Pf 1, Pf 2, and Pf 6 also bound to HS-Sepharose 4B (Fig. 2B) with Pf 2 again having the highest affinity. Because Pf 4 (region II-plus) had previously been reported by others (20Cerami C. Frevert U.

The lack of binding activity was not because of cross-linking of peptides by interdisulfide bonds because iodoacetamide acetylation of the cysteine residues for Pf 4 did not improve its binding activity (data not shown).Fig. 2Screening the different P. falciparum CSP peptides for heparin/HS binding activity. Peptides (35–45 μg) were applied to heparin-Sepharose 4B (A) or HS-Sepharose 4B column (2 ml) (B) and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (3 bed volumes), and then developed with a 0–1 m NaCl concentration gradient in the same buffer (12 bed volumes). Eluant was monitored continuously at 214 nm. Peptides were run individually at least twice, and composite, representative elution profiles are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We were interested in performing competition assays and to economize on the amount of peptide and GAG competitor, the heparin-columns were reduced in volume (2–0.2 ml), and the amount of immobilized heparin reduced quantitatively by serial dilution with Sepharose 4B. From preliminary tests, it became apparent that the relative binding affinities of the Pf peptides could be rapidly compared this way in more detail. Testing the binding of equimolar amounts of the Pf peptides (16 nmol) in these assays confirmed the previous result, namely that only Pf 1, Pf 2, and Pf 6 bound heparin while Pf 3, Pf 4, and Pf 5 did not (Fig. 3A). However, the amount of Pf 1 and Pf 6 binding increased in a linear fashion as the heparin concentration was increased linearly, consistent with what one would expect for low affinity or nonspecific binding. For Pf 2, binding increased in a hyperbolic manner and was saturable. Furthermore, the binding of Pf 2 to heparin appeared to involve only electrostatic interactions as NaCl washes resulted in close to 100% recovery of the bound peptide. As a control, an apoE peptide (residues 139–169), which contains a high affinity heparin/HS binding site (26Cardin A.D. Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T.

Randomly changing the order of the amino acids in Pf 2 (random) significantly reduced the heparin binding activity, suggesting that the interaction was sequence-specific. The coupling modifications on the heparin-Sepharose (CNBr activation of –OH and –NH2) did not contribute or interfere with the binding because heparin Affi-Gel columns, which use a different coupling chemistry (carbodiimide activation modifying –COO– groups), exhibited similar binding characteristic with these peptides (data not shown).Fig. 3Pf 2 demonstrates saturable high affinity binding to heparin and it can inhibit rCSP binding to heparin.A, Pf peptides, 16 nmol dissolved in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, were applied to a series of heparin-Sepharose columns in which the immobilized heparin was increasing from 0 to 100 μg of heparin/200 μl. After washing the columns with 7 bed volumes of sample buffer to remove unbound peptide, the bound peptide was eluted with 4 bed volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 2 m NaCl, pH 7.2, and peptide concentration was determined by absorbance at 220 nm. Each curve represents the mean ± S.D. for n = 3 experiments. B, binding of rCSP was assayed as in A, and the ability of the Pf peptides at a 50-molar excess to block rCSP binding to heparin-Sepharose was evaluated (inset). C, Pf 2 (region I-plus) contains at least two consensus sequences for heparin/HS binding; B, basic residue (boldface); X, non-basic residue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm that Pf 2 contained the heparan/HS binding site for CSP, the ability of all of the Pf peptides to inhibit CSP binding to heparin-Sepharose was investigated. After purification from E. coli, rCSP was re-folded to generate a protein with 12.7% α-helix, 37.5% antiparallel β-sheet, 1.9% parallel β-sheet, 22.5% β-turn, and 31.7% random coil as determined by circular dichroism. The re-folded rCSP bound heparin-Sepharose saturably with high affinity (Fig. 3B). When rCSP was co-incubated with a 50 molar excess of each of the Pf peptides individually, only Pf 2 could significantly inhibit rCSP binding to heparin-Sepharose (Fig. 3B, inset). Closer examination of the Pf 2 sequence revealed that it contained a concatamer of two heparin binding consensus sequences (Fig. 3C).Pf 2 Binds Preferentially to Heparin over the Other Major GAGs—With heparin immobilized on Sepharose 4B, it was possible to compare the relative binding affinities of native heparin, low molecular weight heparin, HS, highly sulfated HS, chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), and hyaluronan by competition binding assays (Fig. 4A). Soluble heparin at a 10-molar excess over immobilized heparin was found to almost completely inhibit Pf 2 binding (95%). A similar molar excess of soluble HS over immobilized heparin showed only a 49% inhibition, whereas the same amount of highly sulfated HS inhibited binding by 70%, suggesting that highly sulfated oligosaccharide stretches on HS were important for binding. Soluble CS and DS showed approximately equal levels of inhibition (32%) well below that of heparin and HS with hyaluronan showing the least activity. Because CS and DS have a higher overall sulfate content over HS, these data indicate that Pf 2/heparin binding was not only sulfate-dependent but that full binding required the correct spacing or orientation of the sulfate groups.Fig. 4Testing different glycosaminoglycans as inhibitors of Pf 2/heparin binding. Pf 2 was applied to heparin columns (30 μg/200 μl) and co-incubated with increasing concentrations of different GAGs, A, heparin, low molecular weight heparin (heparin 3000), HS, highly sulfated HS (H-HS), CS, DS, and hyluronan (HN).

Pf 2 plus soluble GAG competitor were applied to heparin-Sepharose 4B columns and incubated for 5 min. Columns were then washed, and bound peptide was determined as in Fig. 3A.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W2150314512,"Cystic fibrosis is a fatal inherited disease that is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a cAMP-activated chloride channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). It has been suggested that the cystic fibrosis phenotype might be modulated by the presence of other Cl- channels that are coexpressed with CFTR in some epithelial cells. Because the broadly expressed plasma membrane Cl- channel, ClC-2, is present in the tissues whose function is compromised in cystic fibrosis, we generated mice with a disruption of both Cl- channel genes. No morphological changes in their intestine, lung, or pancreas, tissues affected by cystic fibrosis, were observed in these mice. The mortality was not increased over that observed with a complete lack of functional CFTR. Surprisingly, mice expressing mutant CFTR (deletion of phenylalanine 508), survived longer when ClC-2 was disrupted additionally. Currents across colonic epithelia were investigated in Ussing chamber experiments. The disruption of ClC-2, in addition to CFTR, did not decrease Cl- secretion. Colon expressing wild-type CFTR even secreted more Cl- when ClC-2 was disrupted, although CFTR transcript levels were unchanged. It is concluded that ClC-2 is unlikely to be a candidate rescue channel in cystic fibrosis. Our data are consistent with a model in which ClC-2 is located in the basolateral membrane.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) 1The abbreviations used are: CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, CF transmembrane conductance regulator; CLC, a gene family of chloride channels originally identified by the cloning of the Torpedo channel ClC-0; WT, wild type; DPC, diphenylcarboxylate; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel. is a severe autosomal recessive disease that is associated with pulmonary, pancreatic, and intestinal symptoms. Most patients eventually die in adulthood because of the pulmonary phenotype. In the lung and trachea, very viscous tracheal mucus results in reduced lung clearance and accompanying recurrent bacterial infections. In addition, the pancreas often undergoes cystic and fibrotic changes with aging, resulting in pancreatic insufficiency in some, but not all, patients. Further symptoms include male infertility due to the congenital absence of vas deferens and, in some cases, an intestinal occlusion due to thick feces (meconium ileus) and biliary cirrhosis. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (1Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5974) Google Scholar), the only member of the large ABC transporter family that is known to function as a cAMP-activated chloride channel. The most common CFTR mutation in Caucasians is ΔF508, which deletes a phenylalanine (Phe-508) in-frame. More than one thousand other mutations, many of them leading to a complete loss of function, are known. CFTR mediates chloride transport in the apical membranes of many epithelia. In addition, CFTR was suggested to have several other functions, including the regulation of various transport proteins such as the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC and certain other Cl- channels (2Stutts M.J.

If the pathological changes in cystic fibrosis were predominantly due to defective chloride transport, the pharmacological activation of other Cl- channels present in the same membranes would potentially prove beneficial in patients. Several CFTR mouse models have been generated. They include complete disruptions of the CFTR gene (as in the Cftrunc/unc mouse (5Snouwaert J.N. Brigman K.K. Latour A.M. Malouf N.N. Boucher R.C. Smithies O. Koller B.H. Science. 1992; 257: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), called Cftr-/- from here on) and mice that carry CFTR point mutations analogous to those found in patients (like the Cftrkth/kth mouse as a model for the human ΔF508 mutation (6Zeiher B.G. Eichwald E. Zabner J. Smith J.J. Puga A.P. McCray Jr., P.B. Capecchi M.R. Welsh M.J. Thomas K.R. J. Clin.

These mice, however, failed to show obvious pulmonary and pancreatic phenotypes, but rather exhibited intestinal occlusion (ileus). Without a laxative diet these mice rarely survive beyond the age of 30 days. But even when fed an osmotic laxative, no clear pulmonary and pancreatic phenotypes developed at older ages. The discrepancy between human and mouse pathology may be explained, for example, by differences in airway anatomy or by the expression of other Cl- channels that may compensate for the loss of CFTR in mice. Among the several putative modifier genes that co-determine the severity of CF, there may be genes encoding other Cl- channels (7Gyömörey K. Rozmahel R. Bear C.E. Pediatr.

Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Many other Cl- channels, probably including Ca2+-activated Cl- channels, have not yet been identified at the molecular level. Human mutations in several CLC channel genes underlie diseases as diverse as myotonia (10Koch M.C. Steinmeyer K. Lorenz C. Ricker K. Wolf F. Otto M. Zoll B. Lehmann-Horn F. Grzeschik K.H.

Only four CLC channels, i.e. ClC-1, ClC-2, ClC-Ka, and ClC-Kb, reside predominantly in the plasma membrane. ClC-2 is nearly ubiquitously expressed in epithelia and non-epithelial tissues (15Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). ClC-1 is muscle-specific (16Steinmeyer K. Ortland C. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and ClC-K expression is probably limited to certain renal cells and the stria vascularis (17Estévez R. Boettger T. Stein V. Birkenhäger R. Otto E. Hildebrandt F. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2001; 414: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical studies have suggested that ClC-2 is expressed in the apical membranes of lung and intestinal epithelia (18Murray C.B. Morales M.M. Flotte T.R. McGrath-Morrow S.A. Guggino W.B.

Physiol. 2000; 279: C1787-C1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it may transport Cl- in a pathway that is independent of and parallel to CFTR. Thus, ClC-2 appears to be a prime candidate for an alternative pathway for Cl- secretion in CF (20Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J.

Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), but blindness and male infertility were, surprisingly, the only phenotypes noted in ClC-2 knock-out mouse models (24Bösl M.R. Stein V. Hübner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 25Nehrke K. Arreola J.

An impaired transepithelial transport across the retinal pigment epithelium and Sertoli cells was hypothesized as the mechanism underlying the retinal and testicular degeneration, respectively (24Bösl M.R.

Indeed, Ussing chamber experiments revealed that transepithelial voltage and resistance were reduced in the pigment epithelium of Clcn2-/- mice (24Bösl M.R. Stein V. Hübner C. Zdebik A.A.

If ClC-2 transports chloride across the same cell membranes as CFTR, then a disruption of both channels should lead to a more severe phenotype in the respective tissues. This may then also include the lung and the pancreas, tissues that are affected in CF patients but not in CFTR mouse models. We therefore produced mice in which both genes are disrupted. In addition to histomorphological analysis, we performed Ussing chamber experiments on colon and trachea, tissues that are affected in CF. Mice—ClC-2 knock-out mice, described previously (24Bösl M.R. Stein V. Hübner C. Zdebik A.A. Jordt S.E. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Davidoff M.S. Holstein A.F. Jentsch T.J.

The resulting offspring were again mated. Genotypes were determined by touch-down PCR (3 + 37 cycles) on tail DNA, using the following: C2wtF1 (5′-GGGTACAGAGTAGGAACACTTTG-3′), C2wtR1 (5′-AGGTTAGCCCAATGACCTTAGC-3′), and PGK (5′-CTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACTGCC-3′) for genotyping the ClC-2 locus; primers IMR0269/0270/0271 (5′-TTCAAGCCCAAGCTTTCGCGA-3′, 5′-CTCCCTTCTTCTAGTCACAACCG-3′, and 5′-CATCTTGATAGAGCCACGGTGC-3′, respectively) for CftrΔF/ΔF; and primers IMR1125/1126/1127 (5′-GAGAACTGGAAGCTTCAGAGG-3′, 5′-TCCATCTTGTTCAATGGCC-3′, and 5′-TCCATGTAGTGGTGTGAACG-3′, respectively) for Cftr-/- (as described by Jackson Laboratories). Mice were fed a normal mouse diet (ssniff, Soest, Germany), but water was replaced by an osmotic laxative (26Grubb B.R. Boucher R.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S193-S214Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) containing 25 mm NaCl, 40 mm Na2SO4, 20 mm NaHCO3, 18 mm polyethylene glycol 3000, and 10 mm KCl. Mice were housed under virtually standard pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. For some experiments, mice in which only ClC-2 was disrupted were fed a low Na+ diet (100 mg NaCl/kg) for 2 weeks prior to the experiment. Ussing Chamber Measurements—In one series of experiments (Fig. 4), a custom-made, temperature-controlled (37° C), perfusable Ussing chamber with a tissue area of 10 mm2 (kindly provided by Dr. Markus Bleich) was used. Solutions were based on bicarbonate-free Ringer's solution (145 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 1.6 mm K2HPO4,5mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.3 mm calcium gluconate2). The colon of 1-3 months old mice was stripped of muscle and connective tissue layers (distal colon, only the most distal 3 cm ab ano were used). Any nerve plexus activity in the partially remaining myenteric plexus was blocked by the basolateral addition of tetrodotoxin acetate (1 μm), local PGE production was inhibited by the addition of indomethacin (10 μm, predissolved in methanol), and secretion was induced by the basolateral addition of forskolin (Tocris)(10 μm) to the luminal perfusate. Amiloride (Sigma) and bumetanide (ICN) were predissolved in Me2SO as a 1 m stock solution and diluted to 10 and 100 μm, respectively. A custom-made differential amplifier (U. Froebe, University of Freiburg, Germany) equipped with a current pulse generator was used to measure the transepithelial potential (Vte) in the open circuit mode (at I = 0). In regular intervals, a current of 1 μA was injected, and the transepithelial resistance (Rte) was calculated from the induced ΔVte. The equivalent short circuit current (I′sc) was calculated from Vte and Rte according to Ohm's law. Another set of experiments was performed essentially as described previously (27Cuffe J.E. Bertog M. Velazquez-Rocha S. Dery O. Bunnett N. Korbmacher C. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, a tissue area of 0.28 cm2 was mounted in a conventional Ussing chamber filled with bicarbonate-buffered Ringer's solution and gassed with 5% CO2. Secretion was stimulated by apical addition of 1 μm forskolin. Vte and Rte were measured as above by applying ± 50 μA current pulses under open circuit conditions, and I′sc was calculated. By convention, a lumen-negative Vte corresponds to a positive short circuit current, which may be due to electrogenic cation absorption or anion secretion or a combination of both. An unpaired Student's t test was used to evaluate statistical significance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Histology—Mice were fixed by perfusion through the heart for 3-5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. For cryo-sections, organs were immersed in 10, 20, and 30% sucrose, embedded in Tissue-Tec, frozen, and sectioned at 8 or 10 μm. For Mayer's hematoxylin and eosin staining, tissues were dehydrated with isopropanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5-8 μm. For staining, sections were deparaffinized using xylol and made hydrophilic by immersion in ethanol/water mixtures of decreasing ethanol content, and then stained and embedded in DPX resin (Merck) after water removal in the opposite order. Sections were visualized using the transmission mode of a Leica TCS2 confocal microscope or a Zeiss upright microscope equipped with a color CCD camera. Real Time PCR—Mouse distal colon total RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA was subjected to DNase I digestion and purified with RNeasy (Qiagen) columns. cDNA was transcribed from 5 μgof total RNA with superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. The cDNA was diluted 1:25 for PCR in the presence of SYBR green. PCR was carried out on an AbiPrism 7900HT thermo-cycler (Applied Biosystems, California). Primers were selected to amplify 100-120-bp fragments across exon-exon boundaries. The following pairs were used: CFTR forward (5′-CAACCCTACATCTTCCTAGCAACG-3′) and CTFR reverse (5′-CAGATTCCAGTTGTTTGAGCTGC-3′); KCNQ1 forward (5′-CAAAGACCGTGGCAGTAACACC-3′) and KCNQ1 reverse (5′-GGAGCATGTCTGTGATGATCACC-3′); and NKCC1 forward (5′-AACCAGAGATGCTGTGGTCGC-3′) and NKCC1 reverse (5′-CCCAAATGTTTAACATGCAGCG-3′). Three littermates were used for each genotype, and cDNA abundance was determined as the mean cycle at which the same predefined SYBR green signal was reached in each sample. Results are given as mean ± S.E. To investigate whether the disruption of both CFTR and ClC-2 leads to a more severe phenotype than a disruption of CFTR alone, we crossed ClC-2 knock-out mice (24Bösl M.R. Stein V. Hübner C.

Smithies O. Koller B.H. Science. 1992; 257: 1083-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Both mice displayed a severe intestinal phenotype that led to occasional intestinal occlusion independent of the ClC-2 genotype. Moribund mice showed decreased food intake, signs of abdominal distress, and weight loss. When an autopsy was performed on such animals, it invariably revealed intestinal obstruction (n = 9) The lethality of double mutant offspring from Clcn2+/-/Cftr+/ΔF or Clcn2+/-/Cftr+/- double heterozygous matings was highest in the first week after birth, but some of these mice survived for >6 months (5 of 13 and 3 of 7 animals, respectively). The genotypes of offspring from these matings were determined in mice that had survived until tail biopsies were taken at day 3 ± 1 after birth and conformed roughly to Mendelian inheritance (Table I, A and B). Surprisingly, CftrΔF/ΔF/Clcn2-/- mice survived better than CftrΔF/ΔF mice (Fig. 1). This difference, significant at a level of p < 0.05, was consistent with an apparent deviation from Mendelian inheritance of the number of mice that survived 3 ± 1 days after birth and resulted in a larger than expected number of CftrΔF/ΔF/Clcn2-/- animals (Table I, A and B). Unfortunately, attempts to perform a similar analysis with the Cftr-/- line did not yield meaningful results because of poor breeding and high perinatal mortality. Weight development of CftrΔF/ΔF/Clcn2-/- double mutant mice was indistinguishable from that of CftrΔF/ΔF mice and lagged behind the weight development of WT and Clcn2-/- mice (Fig. 1B).Table IBreeding results from doubly heterozygous parents compared to Mendelian predictions The number of mice of a given genotype that were observed at postnatal day 4 (when genotyping was completed) is compared to Mendelian inheritance expected at birth. As lethality is highest during the first week, some animals of the litters are expected to have died until genotyping was possible. This is expected to contribute to the apparent divergence from Mendelian prediction for mice with altered CFTR function.A.

Boucher R.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S193-S214Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), but, in contrast to human patients, the mice rarely develop lung or pancreatic phenotypes. We therefore investigated whether the additional disruption of the ClC-2 Cl- channel led to morphological changes in these and other tissues. Comparative histological analysis was performed at 1, 2, 3, 8, and 12 months of age. Lung sections of 2, 8, and 12-month-old mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (staining nucleic acids and proteins, respectively) or with azan, which stains fibrotic tissue in blue (Fig. 2). No difference in lung morphology could be detected between age-matched wild type (Fig. 2, Aa and Ba), CftrΔF/ΔF (Fig. 2, Ab and Bb), and Clcn2-/-/CftrΔF/ΔF (Fig. 2, Ac and Bc) mice, or between litter mate wild type (Fig. 2, Ca, Da, and Ea), Cftr-/- (Cb, Db, and Eb), and Clcn2-/-/Cftr-/- (Cc, Dc, and Ec) mice. In particular, there was no evidence for inflammatory infiltration or fibrosis. Even in 1-year-old Clcn2-/-/CftrΔF/ΔF mice there was no evidence for morphological lung abnormalities (Fig. 2, Ac and Bc). Histological analysis of the pancreas (Fig. 3, A-C) from WT (Fig. 3A), Cftr-/- (Fig. 3B), and Clcn2-/-/Cftr-/- animals (Fig. 3C) did not reveal differences up to an age of 8 months either. Specifically, the pancreas lacked the signs of fibrosis, cystic changes, or inflammation that are seen in human CF. Likewise, the colon of Clcn2-/-/Cftr-/- mice (Fig. 3, D and E) was unremarkable up to 8 months, when mice free of abdominal distress were investigated. The epithelium was normal, without inflammation or mucoid retention in goblet cells or at the base of the crypts. Similar results were obtained in the small intestine. The liver, including the bile duct epithelia, lacked pathological changes. However, an impairment of physiological function is not necessarily paralleled by morphological alterations. We therefore performed Ussing chamber experiments to assess whether the additional disruption of ClC-2 exacerbated the defects in trans-epithelial chloride transport that are caused by CFTR mutations (Fig. 4). Ion transport across colonic epithelia has three main components, i.e. aldosterone-stimulated Na+ reabsorption, cAMP-stimulated Cl- secretion, and K+ secretion. These processes involve luminal ENaC Na+ channels, luminal CFTR Cl- channels, and luminal K+ channels not yet identified at the molecular level, respectively. Na+ reabsorption and Cl- secretion result in positive I′sc components, whereas K+ secretion is manifested by a negative I′sc component. These different components can be dissected pharmacologically by using stimulatory and inhibitory drugs. To increase the sensitivity of detection for Cl- currents, ENaC was blocked by adding 10 μm amiloride to the apical perfusate. In experiments on WT colon (Fig. 4A), the subsequent basolateral addition of 10 μm forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, drastically increased I′sc. This positive current component is likely to represent cAMP-activated Cl- secretion into the lumen via CFTR. This was indirectly confirmed by the inhibitory effect of the subsequent basolateral addition of 100 μm bumetanide, an inhibitor of Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransport. The latter is responsible for the cytoplasmic accumulation of Cl- as a prerequisite for a chloride secretory response (see Fig. 6 for transport model). In the experiments of Fig. 4, B and C, which show typical recordings for the CftrΔF/ΔF and the Clcn2-/-/CftrΔF/ΔF colon, respectively, the positive forskolin-induced I′sc component was missing, which is consistent with the absence of an apical cAMP-stimulated CFTR chloride channel. In the absence of functional CFTR, forskolin induced a negative I′sc component. There was no statistically significant difference in forskolin-stimulated currents between the wild-type and the Clcn2-/- colon irrespective of the CFTR genotype (WT or CftrΔF/ΔF) (Fig. 4D). The negative current component observed under amiloride and forskolin in CFTR mutant mice cannot be due to a stimulation of Cl- secretion or a stimulation of cation reabsorption. Experiments using 5 mm Ba2+, an inhibitor of certain classes of K+ channels, revealed that this negative I′sc component can be explained by K+ secretion. Ba2+ caused a significant inhibition only from the luminal but not from the basolateral side, which is consistent with a specific effect on luminal K+ channels (Fig. 4B). Thus, genetic ablation of CFTR function essentially abolished cAMP-dependent Cl- secretion and unmasked a cAMP-stimulated K+ secretion. Both the basolateral KCNQ1/KCNE3 K+ channels (28Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and the NKCC1 cotransporter (29Tanimura A. Kurihara K.

This may explain the prominent secretion of K+ during stimulation with cAMP, although we cannot rule out a direct effect on apical K+ channels. In the Ussing chamber experiments described so far, colonic epithelia from CftrΔF/ΔF/Clcn2-/- (Fig. 4C) behaved similarly to tissues in which only CFTR has been mutated (Fig. 4B), as was evaluated statistically in Fig 4D. Although there was no obvious influence of ClC-2 on the short circuit current under stimulation in the experiments described so far, we performed additional experiments under more physiological conditions to further investigate this issue. A bicarbonate-buffered bath solution and lower concentrations of forskolin (1 μm instead of 10 μm) were used. These conditions may lead to less than maximal CFTR activation, thereby facilitating the detection of the relative contribution of ClC-2 to anion secretion. We also used mice that were kept on low sodium diet, a procedure known to up-regulate apical ENaC, thus allowing us to test the viability of the tissue. In Ussing chamber experiments, currents across Clcn2+/- control and Clcn2-/- colonic tissue were compared (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). The inhibitory effect of apical amiloride revealed that almost all resting I′sc was due to Na+ reabsorption through ENaC. In the continued presence of amiloride, the application of 1 μm forskolin to the apical bath elicited a positive I′sc component. This result was due to anion secretion, as revealed by the inhibition of this current component with the luminal addition of the chloride channel inhibitor DPC (1 mm) at the end of the experiment. Application of luminal Ba2+ resulted in a small additional increase in I′sc in both control and Clcn2-/- mice, revealing, as in Fig. 4, B and C, a K+-secretory component. This component was minor in comparison with the large anion secretory I′sc component. A statistical evaluation of the I′sc values is given in Fig. 5C. There was no significant influence of the Clcn2 genotype on the Na+ current (Fig. 5C, first two columns on the left). However, forskolin-induced anion secretory currents were roughly 40% larger in Clcn2-/- mice than in Clcn2+/- mice (p < 0.001) (Fig 5C). This result is surprising, as it is incompatible with the postulated secretory role of apical ClC-2 channels in colonic epithelia. One might argue, however, that CFTR may be up-regulated in response to the absence of ClC-2."

Our results show that histidine 226 and arginine 141 probably do not ligate iron-sulfur cluster N2 but that exchanging these residues specifically influences the properties of this redox center. Histidines 91 and 95 were found to be essential for ubiquinone reductase activity of complex I. Mutations at the C-terminal arginine 466 affected ubiquinone affinity and inhibitor sensitivity but also destabilized complex I. These results provide further support for a high degree of structural conservation between the 49-kDa subunit of complex I and its ancestor, the large subunit of water-soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases. In several mutations of histidine 226, arginine 141, and arginine 466 the characteristic EPR signatures of iron-sulfur cluster N2 became undetectable, but specific, inhibitor-sensitive ubiquinone reductase activity was only moderately reduced. As we could not find spectroscopic indications for a modified cluster N2, we concluded that these complex I mutants were lacking most of this redox center but were still capable of catalyzing inhibitor-resistant ubiquinone reduction at near normal rates. We discuss that this at first surprising scenario may be explained by electron transfer theory; after removal of a single redox center in a chain, electron transfer rates are predicted to be still much faster than steady-state turnover of complex I.

Our results question some of the central mechanistic functions that have been put forward for iron-sulfur cluster N2. The respiratory chain of the inner membrane of mammalian mitochondria consists of four enzyme complexes and creates the transmembrane protonmotive force used by ATP synthase to generate ATP. Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the largest and least understood of these multisubunit complexes. It oxidizes NADH to NAD+ and transfers electrons via FMN and up to eight iron-sulfur clusters to ubiquinone that is reduced to ubiquinol (1Brandt U. Kerscher S. Dröse S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Pumping of 4 H+/2 electrons across the inner mitochondrial membrane is coupled to this process. Since cluster N2 has been shown to couple magnetically with semiquinone (2Magnitsky S. Toulokhonova L. Yano T. Sled V.D. Hagerhall C. Grivennikova V.G. Burbaev D.S. Vinogradov A.D. Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is likely to be the immediate reductant for ubiquinone at the end of the electron transfer cascade formed by the iron-sulfur clusters of complex I. In recent years we have established the obligate aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a model to study structure and function of complex I (3Kerscher S. Dröse S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Based on a site-directed mutagenesis study we have proposed that the ubiquinone-reducing catalytic core of complex I has evolved from the active center of [NiFe] hydrogenases and resides at the interface between the 49-kDa and the PSST subunits (4Kashani-Poor N.

The 49-kDa subunit is homologous to the large and the PSST subunit to the small subunit of bacterial water-soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases (6Böhm R. Sauter M. Böck A. Mol.

Of the three iron-sulfur clusters bound to the small subunit of these hydrogenases only the proximal one is retained as cluster N2 in the PSST subunit of complex I (10Friedrich T. Brors B. Hellwig P.

Friedrich T. Schulte U. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, in all PSST subunits sequenced so far, only three of the four cysteines are left that ligate the proximal cluster in the small subunit of hydrogenases. A fourth cysteine is found immediately adjacent to the first of these three conserved cysteines in all known PSST sequences; for steric reasons, it has been generally considered unlikely that the resulting putative Cys-Cys-Xn-Cys-Xn-Cys motif ligates iron-sulfur cluster N2. However, this option has been put forward recently by Flemming et al. (12Flemming D. Schlitt A. Spehr V. Bischof T. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47602-47609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The earlier idea that an acidic residue may serve as the fourth ligand of cluster N2 (13Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) could be ruled out by mutating every single conserved aspartate and glutamate in the PSST subunit (5Garofano A. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Okun P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42435-42440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As cluster N2 is predicted to reside immediately at the interface between the two subunits, we have suggested that the missing fourth ligand may be provided by the adjacent 49-kDa subunit (4Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24082-24087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To explore this possibility and to gain further insight into structure-function relationships within the ubiquinone-reducing catalytic core of complex I, we have analyzed mutations of highly conserved histidines and arginines in the 49-kDa subunit of complex I (Fig. 1). The residues chosen for mutagenesis were predicted to be in the vicinity (within about 15 Å) of iron-sulfur cluster N2 based on the previously demonstrated conservation of the [NiFe] hydrogenase structural fold (4Kashani-Poor N.

To exclude the possibility of aneuploidy the absence of the wild type 49-kDa gene was checked by Southern blotting. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were generated by the QuikChange™ method (Stratagene). The PCR template was a 2870-bp NUCM genomic PCR product (4Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Kerscher S.

Purification of Complex I—Y. lipolytica strain Δnucm L1 was grown overnight at 27 °C in a 10-liter Biostat E fermenter (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) in complete medium containing 2% glucose, 2% yeast nitrogen base, and 1% Bacto™ peptone. Mitochondrial membranes were prepared according to published protocols (14Kerscher S. Okun J.G. Brandt U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2347-2354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zickermann V. Bostina M.

Complex I was purified from isolated mitochondrial membranes that were solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside essentially as described previously (16Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but the Ni2+-affinity column was equilibrated and washed with 55 mm imidazole. Protein content was determined according to a modified Lowry protocol (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.R. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Schägger (18Schägger H. Hunte C. von Jagow G. Schägger H. Membrane Protein Purification and Crystallization: A Practical Guide. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2003: 105-130Crossref Google Scholar). Measurement of Catalytic Activity, Km, and I50—dNADH was used as electron donor for complex I, and the ubiquinone analogue DBQ was used as electron acceptor. Inhibitor-sensitive dNADH:DBQ activity at 60 μm DBQ and 100 μm dNADH was measured using a Shimadzu MultiSpec-1501 or a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax PLUS384 spectrophotometer by following dNADH oxidation at 340–400 nm (ϵ = 6.22 mm-1cm-1) at 30 °C in 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCN, 20 mm Na+/MOPS, pH 7.2. The reaction was started by addition of mitochondrial membranes at 30–50 μg of protein/ml. Michaelis-Menten and I50 parameters were determined using microtiter plates in a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax PLUS384 spectrophotometer. dNADH oxidase activity of membranes was measured essentially in the same way, but omitting KCN and DBQ from the assay. The obtained data were fitted using “Enzfitter” (version 2.0.16.0, Biosoft 1999, Cambridge, UK). Specific NADH: HAR oxidoreductase activity was taken as a measure for complex I content and determined as described above in 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaN3, 20 mm Na+/HEPES, pH 8.0. EPR Spectroscopy—Low temperature EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer equipped with a liquid helium continuous flow cryostat, ESR 900 from Oxford Instruments. Samples were reduced with NADH (1–5mm final concentration), quickly frozen in cold isopentane/methylcyclohexane (5:1), and stored in liquid nitrogen. Generally, protein concentration was 3–10 mg/ml when isolated complex was measured, except for parental and His-226 mutant complex I samples, which were highly concentrated having ∼100 mg/ml. When mitochondrial membranes were used, protein concentrations were 20–40 mg/ml. If not indicated otherwise, EPR spectra were recorded at a temperature of 12 K and a microwave frequency of 9.48 GHz. 2-mW microwave power and 0.8-mT modulation amplitude were used for membrane samples, 1 mW and 0.64 mT for isolated complex I, respectively. Mutations of Histidine 226 Affect the Properties of Iron-Sulfur Cluster N2—His-226 is invariant in all known 49-kDa subunit sequences of complex I (Fig. 1). It corresponds to a highly conserved histidine in water-soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases that forms a hydrogen bond to the proximal iron-sulfur cluster of the small subunit (8Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). His-226 was mutagenized into alanine and the potential iron-sulfur cluster ligands glutamine, cysteine, and methionine. As judged by blue native-PAGE (data not shown) and NADH:HAR activity (Table I), complex I was fully assembled to normal expression levels in all His-226 mutants.Table ICharacterization of 49-kDa mutantsStrainComplex I contentaComplex I content was determined in at least two batches of mitochondrial membranes, and the mean value is expressed as relative specific NADH:HAR oxidoreductase activity that is not affected by the mutations (parental plasmid-complemented nucm::URA3 deletion strain = 1.0)Complex I activitybComplex I activity was determined in at least two batches of mitochondrial membranes, and the mean value is given as inhibitor-sensitive dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity relative to plasmid-complemented strain and normalized for complex I content (100% = 0.3 μmol min-1mg-1)Km of DBQI50Degree of conservationDQARotenone%μmnmParental1.01001113600H226AcData from Kashani-Poor et al.

A slight hypersensitivity of mutant H226 M and a minor resistance of mutant H226A toward the complex I inhibitors DQA and rotenone was observed. For mutants H226C and H226Q, the I50 values for DQA and rotenone were unchanged (Table I). No increase of inhibitor-insensitive dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase or dNADH oxidase activities was observed in membranes from the mutant strains (data not shown). In EPR spectra recorded from both mitochondrial membranes and purified complex I, marked effects on iron-sulfur cluster N2, but not on the other EPR-detectable iron-sulfur clusters, resulted from all four mutations (Fig. 2). The quality of the spectra obtained with purified complex I was much higher because of markedly increased protein concentrations and the exclusion of interference from other paramagnetic components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. However, the analysis of EPR spectra of mitochondrial membranes was critical to decide whether iron-sulfur clusters were lost during the purification procedure and allowed a direct comparison with the functional data summarized in Table I. Again, mutation H226A had the most drastic effect resulting in complete loss of characteristic iron-sulfur cluster N2 signals that were not even observed upon reduction of the sample with NADH/dithionite (Eh ≅ -450 mV; data not shown). To exclude the possibility that the signal had disappeared due to a dramatic change in the spectroscopic properties of cluster N2, we scanned at different EPR settings (temperature, microwave power, and field ranges) but could not find any new paramagnetic species in mutant membranes or isolated enzyme complex (data not shown). If the tetranuclear iron-sulfur cluster had been turned into a Fe3S4 cluster, it would have become paramagnetic in the oxidized state, resulting in a characteristic EPR spectrum, which was not observed (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for mutants H226C and H226Q, but residual signals of cluster N2 corresponding to less than 10% of wild type level were observed in EPR spectra of purified complex I within the gz and gxy regions and of mitochondrial membranes within the gxy region. In membrane preparations from mutant H226M, the gz signal of cluster N2 was reduced by about two-thirds compared with enzyme from the parental strain. At this level the signal was still hardly detectable in mitochondrial membranes, but as for all His-226 mutations loss of cluster N2 upon purification of complex I could be ruled out. Only in membranes from H226M, a clear gz signal of cluster N2 could be detected; the gxy signal region was shifted to lower field, now strongly overlapping with the gxy signal of cluster N1. Spectra of purified H226M complex I allowed a more detailed analysis of changes in the N2 EPR signals. The intensity was reduced by about one-third, and all components of the g-tensor, obtained by simulation (data not shown), were shifted to lower field values (N2 parental: gz = 2.051, gy = 1.926, and gx = 1.918; N2 H226M: gz = 2.054, gy = 1.931, and gx = 1.923). Mutations of Arginine 141 Have Moderate Effects on Activity but Drastically Reduce Iron-Sulfur Cluster N2 EPR Signals— Arg-141 is invariant in all known 49-kDa subunits of complex I and large subunits of [NiFe] hydrogenases (Fig. 1). In the hydrogenase structure it is found in close vicinity to the proximal iron-sulfur cluster (8Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). We have changed this residue to alanine, lysine, and methionine. In all Arg-141 mutants complex I was assembled (data not shown), and complex I content in mitochondrial membranes tended to be even slightly higher than in the parental strain (see Table I). In a pattern rather similar to the His-226 mutations, mitochondrial membranes from mutant R141A exhibited an inhibitor-sensitive dNADH:DBQ activity that was some 80% reduced, while the two more conservative exchanges R141K and R141M reduced activity only by about 50%. For different batches of mitochondrial membranes from mutant R141K ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity varied quite substantially between 30 and 70% of wild type activity; the value given in Table I is the average of the values from three membrane preparations. The Km value for DBQ was not changed in any of the three mutants, but mutation R141K resulted in a 4–5-fold higher I50 for DQA and a 2–3-fold higher I50 for rotenone. Of the two other mutations only R141A seemed to have a subtle effect on DQA sensitivity. Again, no increase of inhibitor-insensitive dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase or dNADH oxidase activities was observed in membranes from the mutant strains (data not shown). In stark contrast to these rather normal functional properties, EPR spectroscopy revealed drastic effects specifically on iron-sulfur cluster N2 (Fig. 3); in membranes and purified complex I from mutants R141M and R141A, cluster N2 signals were undetectable. Again, this was not changed following reduction of membrane samples at a lower potential of about -450 mV with NADH/dithionite (not shown). Scanning at different EPR settings or spectra of oxidized samples gave no indications for any newly formed paramagnetic species (data not shown). A small amount of cluster N2 in the order of 5% compared with wild type level was detectable in complex I from mutant R141K; the very weak gz signal seemed to be shifted toward lower field values. To further address the question of whether cluster N2 was in fact missing in the mutant membranes or whether the cluster had become just undetectable under standard EPR conditions, we considered the possibility that the mutations had turned the spin of the ground state of cluster N2 to S = 3/2. EPR signals from Fe4S4 clusters with S = 3/2 ground states should appear in the g = 4.0–5.5 region but are notoriously difficult to observe, particularly in the event of significant cluster heterogeneity (19Conover R.C.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We recorded EPR spectra from parental and mutant isolated complex I samples over a wide field range at low temperature (4.3 K) and high microwave power (63 mW). Fig. 4 shows spectra of complex I from wild type and mutants R141A and R141M for which the discrepancy between catalytic activity and missing N2 EPR signals was most obvious. Under the EPR conditions used, all signals in the 300–400-mT region (from S = ½ spin states of clusters N1, N4, and N5) were highly power-saturated, and contributions from clusters N2 and N3 were completely abolished. Apart from more or less pronounced signals at g = 6 and g = 4.3, which could be assigned to contaminations by cytochrome oxidase and adventitious Fe(III), respectively, there were no additional EPR signals detectable in the mutant complex I samples. However, EPR detection of S = 3/2 states is typically performed at high cluster concentrations (∼1 mm), a concentration range not accessible for complex I samples. Consequently, the existence of a S = 3/2 spin state could not be ruled out completely, due to low complex I concentrations especially in the mutant samples (5–10 μm) and resulting base-line problems in the relevant field region. Mutations of Histidine 91 and Histidine 95 Result in Complete Loss of Catalytic Activity—Residues His-91 and His-95 are strictly conserved in all complex I 49-kDa subunit sequences but not in [NiFe] hydrogenases (see Fig. 1). Conservation of the structural fold between homologous subunits predicts both residues to be close enough to iron-sulfur cluster N2 to be candidate ligands. His-91 and His-95 were changed into alanine, methionine, and arginine. All His-91 and His-95 mutants contained normal or, in the case of H91M and H91R, only slightly reduced amounts of complex I (see Table I) that was assembled normally (data not shown). In mitochondrial membranes from all six mutant strains inhibitor-sensitive dNADH: DBQ activity was below the detection level of 5%. However, EPR spectra of all iron-sulfur clusters, including cluster N2, were indistinguishable from those of the parental strain (data not shown). This was also true for complex I from mutant H95A that was purified as a representative of this group of mutations. Mutations of Arginine 466 Change Functional Properties of Complex I—The C-terminal arginine 466 is also strictly conserved in complex I. In [NiFe] hydrogenases it corresponds to a strictly conserved histidine that is ligand to a Mg2+ site and resides about 9 Å from the [NiFe] site and 14 Å from the proximal iron-sulfur cluster. Arg-466 was changed into alanine, methionine, histidine, and glutamate. Assembled complex I was found in membranes from all Arg-466 mutants (data not shown), but with the exception of mutant R466H, content was significantly reduced by 30–50%. As a strictly aerobic organism, Y. lipolytica does not regulate expression levels for complex I subunits. Hence diminished content usually indicates structural destabilization of the complex. In fact, reduced stability made it difficult to isolate sufficient amounts of protein for EPR spectra of purified complex I from these mutants. Still, inhibitor-sensitive, specific ubiquinone reductase activity was strongly reduced only in membranes from R466M, while the other mutants showed around 80% (R466A and R466H) or about 50% (R466E) of wild type activity (see Table I). Steady-state kinetics revealed a 2–3-fold increase in the Km for DBQ for mutant R466H, while this parameter was unaltered in mutants R466A and R466E. These three mutations also exhibited a small but significant resistance toward DQA and rotenone. The normally assembled and most active mutant in this set, R466H, also gave rise to EPR spectra of mitochondrial membranes that were indistinguishable from a parental spectrum (Fig. 5). With spectra from mitochondrial membranes only, a detailed analysis of the spectral signature of mutants R466A, R466M, and R466E was not possible. However, it seemed clear that iron-sulfur cluster N2 was drastically reduced in all three mutants, but even in membranes from R466A a trace amount of cluster N2 was clearly detectable in the gxy region. We have explored the function of conserved histidines and arginines of the 49-kDa subunit within the ubiquinone-reducing catalytic core of complex I. One of the specific aims of this study was to test whether these residues may act as the fourth ligand of tetranuclear iron-sulfur cluster N2, completing the set of three cysteine ligands located in the neighboring PSST subunit (21Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 22Videira A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). His-91 and His-95 can be excluded as ligands because even their replacement by alanine had no effect at all on the EPR spectra of cluster N2. Also Arg-466 seems an unlikely candidate because even mutation R466A did not completely abolish the EPR signature of cluster N2. The fact that the cluster was hardly detectable in mitochondrial membranes from three of the four Arg-466 mutants rather seemed to reflect a severe structural destabilization of complex I. Much more specific and remarkably parallel effects on cluster N2 were observed when residues His-226 and Arg-141 were exchanged (see Figs. 2 and 3). In both cases, cluster N2 was not detectable after substitution with a small hydrophobic alanine residue. On the other hand, the more conservative changes R141K and H226M gave rise to reduced but shifted EPR spectra. Other mutations in these positions resulted in dramatic reduction (H226C and H226Q) or virtually complete disappearance (R141M) of cluster N2 EPR signals. Based on these results one could consider both His-226 and Arg-141 as possible fourth ligands of cluster N2. However, the parallel pattern observed for mutagenesis of these two positions rather seemed to suggest that loss of the cluster N2 spectral signature reflected similar structural changes in its surroundings rather than an exchange or removal of its immediate ligand. These structural changes appeared to be local in nature, as, in contrast to mutations of Arg-466, no global destabilization of complex I or loss of residual cluster upon purification was observed. Thus, while we could not identify the fourth ligand of cluster N2, our data demonstrate a specific significance of Arg-141 and His-226 for the local environment of iron-sulfur cluster N2 and provide strong support to the structural model of the ubiquinone-reducing catalytic core of complex I (23Kerscher S. Kashani-Poor N. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. Brandt U. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutations of His-91 and His-95 did not provide any information on the ligation or properties of iron-sulfur cluster N2. However, our results still suggested a central functional role for these two residues; independent of the specific amino acid exchange made, all mutations in these two positions resulted in virtually complete loss of catalytic activity without affecting iron-sulfur cluster N2 or dramatically reducing stability of the complex. This behavior is strikingly similar to the results recently obtained for mutagenesis of two conserved aspartates (Asp-99 and Asp-115) in the PSST subunit (5Garofano A. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Okun P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42435-42440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on the structures of homologous water-soluble [NiFe] hydrogenases, histidines 91 and 95 in the 49-kDa subunit and aspartates 99 and 115 in the PSST subunit are predicted to be located on opposing surfaces of the two proteins. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that they might form specific ion pairs critically involved in the catalytic mechanism of complex I. It should also be noted that the two histidines reside in a loop connecting the first two strands of a predicted β-sheet of the 49-kDa subunit; recently, by electron microscopic single particle analysis of co-complexes of Y. lipolytica complex I and monoclonal antibody 49.2 we localized the second putative β-strand of this predicted β-sheet bound by glycines 96 and 106 near the end of the peripheral arm of complex I opposite to its connection to the membrane part (15Zickermann V. Bostina M. Hunte C. Ruiz T. Radermacher M. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29072-29078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We consider the identification of two functionally deficient mutants in this part of complex I as another indication that critical parts of the catalytic machinery of complex I are clearly separated from the membrane domain. We made a puzzling observation for a number of mutants when we compared spectroscopic properties and catalytic activities; the pronounced effects on the EPR spectra of cluster N2 caused by mutagenesis of His-226, Arg-141, or Arg-466 were in stark contrast to comparably moderate reductions in inhibitor-sensitive ubiquinone reductase activities. In the three alanine mutations hardly any cluster N2 was detectable, but still around 20% (H226A and R141A) or even 75% (R466A) specific activity could be measured. This was most evident in the case of mutation R141M, where cluster N2 was not detectable but inhibitor-sensitive, specific dNADH:DBQ activity was still 40%. We could rule out that these rates were due to an artificial reaction with decylubiquinone that does not occur with endogenous ubiquinone-9; inhibitor-insensitive residual rates were not increased in mutant membranes, no matter whether we measured dNADH oxidase or dNADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity. The most obvious explanation for this apparent paradox would be that the redox center assumed to be the immediate electron donor for ubiquinone was still present in the mutant enzymes but could not be detected anymore by standard procedures. In principle, this could have been caused by two types of changes in the properties of iron-sulfur cluster N2. (i) The mutations could have altered the redox potential of the cluster to very negative values, preventing reduction by NADH or NADH/dithionite. However, this seems highly unlikely; the absence of even residual reduction in some mutants would correspond to midpoint potentials of below -450 mV, reflecting a shift of at least -300 mV. (ii) The mutations could have profoundly changed the magnetic properties of the cluster making it undetectable by the standard EPR conditions used; the option that the tetranuclear iron-sulfur cluster was turned into a Fe3S4 cluster by the mutations was ruled out by analyzing oxidized samples. Reduced samples were scanned at many different EPR settings (temperature, microwave power, and field ranges), but we could not find indications for a new paramagnetic species in the mutant membranes or isolated enzyme complexes. Even a wide range scan at very low temperature (4.3 K) and high microwave power (63 mW) to explore the possibility that the spin of the ground state of the cluster might have turned into S = 3/2 gave no hints at an altered state of the cluster. While in a strict sense, it is impossible to actually prove the absence of an iron-sulfur cluster by EPR spectroscopy, it still seemed rather unlikely to us that a conversion of the cluster N2 ground state into the unusual S = 3/2 species had been caused in a similar fashion by several mutations at different positions in the 49-kDa subunit. Therefore, we concluded from our extensive EPR spectroscopic analysis that some mutations of His-226 and Arg-141 probably had resulted in the loss of most or all of iron-sulfur cluster N2. It should be noted at this point that in previous studies exploring the ligation of iron-sulfur cluster N2 (10Friedrich T. Brors B. Hellwig P. Kintscher L. Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Schulte U.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47602-47609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) only standard EPR conditions were applied, and the possible explanations for the disappearance of the typical EPR signature outlined above were not even considered. Therefore, the data and conclusions drawn from these studies have to be reconsidered critically in the light of the discussion presented here. If in some of the mutants that still showed rather high specific catalytic activities the disappearance of the EPR spectrum of cluster N2 indeed reflected loss of this redox center, the question arises how this apparent paradox could be resolved. In fact, electron transfer theory offers a straightforward though at this point speculative explanation; in electron wires consisting of a series of iron-sulfur clusters or other components, distances between redox centers are typically around 5 Å (8Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 9Montet Y. Amara P. Volbeda A. Vernede X. Hatchikian E.C. Field M.J. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This should be a good approximation for the iron-sulfur clusters of complex I as well. Estimating electron transfer rates using the “Moser-Dutton ruler” (24Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar), this distance corresponds to a rate of at least 108–109 s-1 if no driving force is assumed. In a simple scenario, the electron would have to travel around 10 Å if one redox center in a chain of iron-sulfur clusters was removed. The estimated electron transfer rate would then drop by about two orders of magnitude but still would be in the range of 106–107 s-1. Comparison of these estimates with the steady-state turnover number of about 102 s-1 illustrates that removal of iron-sulfur cluster N2 does not necessarily limit steady-state turnover because electron transfer is still predicted to be much faster. A similar situation, although involving entirely different redox centers, has been analyzed recently by time-resolved absorption spectroscopy on the picosecond time scale in mutants of Escherichia coli DNA photolyase (25Byrdin M. Eker A.P. Vos M.H. Brettel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8678-8681Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, no methods are available so far to study electron transfer within complex I even in the submillisecond time range. If, as suggested by our results, complex I can catalyze ubiquinone reduction at essentially normal rates even in the absence of cluster N2, this questions some of the central mechanistic functions that have been discussed for iron-sulfur cluster N2. The key issue that is now under investigation in our laboratory is whether the mutations discussed in this work interfere with the proton pump of complex I. We thank Andrea Böttcher, Franz-Josef Streb, Gudrun Beyer, and Jolanta Maria Brzoska for excellent technical assistance and Stefan Dröse, Hermann Schägger, and Volker Zickermann for helpful discussions. We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer who pointed us to the fact that Fe4S4 clusters may exist in a S = 3/2 ground state under certain conditions."

A possible explanation for these differences is that native receptors are not identical to expressed receptors perhaps because of specific interactions that occur in native but not heterologous cells. A GABAA receptor-associated protein, GABARAP, is an intracellular protein that can interact with the γ2 subunit of GABAA receptors (7Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W.

When co-expressed with GABAA subunits in QT-6 quail fibroblasts, GABARAP causes clustering of GABAA receptors accompanied by changes in whole cell current kinetics (8Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S.

Although this protein was not found in close proximity to mature native GABAA receptors in the plasmalemma of cortical neurons in a study using fluorescent antibodies to GABARAP (9Kneussel M.

These observations suggest that GABARAP may be involved at an early stage in the clustering of GABAA receptors even though it appears not to be present as part of the anchoring mechanism for the receptors. Because it has been suggested that the clustering of GABAA receptors may allow co-operative opening of channels and hence a higher apparent single channel conductance (see Ref. 10Laver D.R. Gage P.W. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 99-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar for review), we have co-expressed GABARAP with subunits of GABAA receptors in an attempt to cause clustering of the receptors. We report here that co-expression of GABARAP with subunits of GABAA receptors causes the clustering of receptors in L929 fibroblasts and also causes the appearance of high conductance channels that are only rarely seen in control cells transfected in the same way with the same GABAA subunits but without GABARAP. Plasmid cDNAs and Antibodies—Full-length cDNAs for the human GABAA subtypes α1, β1, and γ2S were subcloned individually into the pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector. Green fluorescent protein was expressed off of the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Full-length human GABARAP cDNA, cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), was a gift from Dr. R. W. Olsen (UCLA). The monoclonal antibody bd24 was purchased from Chemicon International, and fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG was purchased from DAKO. Cell Culture—Mouse L929 fibroblasts (American Type Tissue Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (CSL), 10 mm HEPES, and 4 mm l-glutamine. Cells for passaging were lifted using a cell scraper or following a 2-min incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) containing 0.5% trypsin and 0.2% EDTA. Transfection—Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GABAA subunits α1, β1, γ2S, and green fluorescent protein, with or without GABARAP. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips in multiwell dishes at a density of 1.0–1.5 × 105 cells/ml. Twenty-four hours later cells were washed with Optimem (Invitrogen) and then transfected with a total of 20 μg of plasmid DNA (in equal amounts) plus 10 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. After a 5-h incubation at 37 °C the mixture was replaced by fresh medium, and 48–72 h later the cells were used for electrophysiological experiments. Western Blotting—Lysates from untransfected and transfected cells were run on 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) in MES buffer. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry buffer system. Following blocking in milk powder the blot was incubated in the anti-GABARAP polyclonal antibody (7Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) (1/3000) at 4 °C overnight. After thorough washing the blot was incubated in secondary antibody (antirabbit horseradish peroxidase) for 2 h at room temperature and then visualized by ECL (West-Pico, Pierce). All blots included purified GABARAP as a positive control. Immunofluorescent Labeling—Cells were transfected (as described above) with plasmids encoding GABAA subunits α1, β1, and γ2S with or without GABARAP. Staining and fixation were carried out at 4 °C 48 h post-transfection. Cells on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin then incubated for 1 h with the anti-α1 monoclonal antibody bd24 (1:50). Following fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:50), and then washed again prior to mounting onto slides in Slowfade (Molecular Probes). Cells were imaged on a Radiance 2000 confocal microscope with a 60× oil-immersion objective. Non-transfected cells treated as described above did not show any immunofluorescence. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological experiments were performed using conventional patch clamp techniques in cell-attached or outside-out patches. Cells were viewed using a light fluorescent attachment (Olympus BH2-RFL) so that only those cells successfully transfected with green fluorescent protein were selected for patching. Electrodes made from borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical) and coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning) had resistances between 10 and 15 megohms. Cell-attached Patches—The bath solution contained (in mm): 142 NaCl, 4 KCl, 6 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, and 10 TES, pH 7.4. Patch electrodes contained (in mm): 140 choline chloride, 0.3 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 5 MgCl2, and 10 TES, pH 7.4, in addition to the indicated concentration of GABA (3–10 μm, Sigma). Outside-out Patches—The bath solution contained (in mm): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 TES, pH 7.4. Patch electrodes were filled with a solution containing (in mm): 50 NaCl, 80 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, and 10 TES, pH 7.3–7.4. With these solutions the predicted chloride equilibrium potential was close to 0 mV. Drugs were made up to final concentration in bath solution (as described below) and were applied to outside-out patches directly via gravity-fed flow tubes. The flow tubes had a diameter of 300 μm and were placed directly in front of the outside-out patch. The presence of GABAA receptors in outside-out membrane patches was confirmed by an initial application of GABA (1 mm) applied via the flow tube. Testing Drugs—Where indicated, pentobarbital (Sigma) was dissolved in bath solution. Diazepam (Hoffman-La Roche) was initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Sigma) before being dissolved in bath solution. The final concentration of Me2SO in the bath solution was 0.01%. Both drugs were applied by gravity-fed perfusion through the bath. For application of bicuculline (Sigma) to a cell-attached patch, a sudden bolus of drug was ejected from the end of a fine polyethylene tube inserted in the electrode to within 0.5–1.0 mm of the tip. Because the increases in channel conductance caused by diazepam and pentobarbital were more prominent the lower the predrug (control) conductance (4Eghbali M. Curmi J.P. Birnir B. Gage P.W. Nature. 1997; 388: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Eghbali M. Gage P.W. Birnir B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was, patches containing low conductance (<30 pS) channels were normally used for testing the effects of these drugs on channel conductance. Analysis of Currents—Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A current-to-voltage converter (Axon Instruments), filtered at 5 or 10 kHz, digitized at 44 kHz using a pulse-code modulator (Sony PCM 501), and stored on videotape for analysis. In some experiments, currents were digitized at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1200 A–D converter and stored on computer disk. Currents were played back and digitized at a frequency of 10 kHz for analysis using a computer program, Channel 2. 2Written by P. Gage and M. Smith, JCSMR, ANU, Canberra, Australia. Current amplitudes were measured from all-points amplitude probability histograms or from the directly measured amplitudes of individual currents. Where single channel currents displayed subconductance states, the single channel current amplitude was taken as the most frequently occurring and highest state. Channel conductance was calculated by dividing current amplitude by the difference between the pipette potential and the reversal potential, the latter being close to 0 mV for the solutions used (see Fig. 2, B and D). “Mean currents” were measured over periods of 10 s or more by integrating all data points, normally sampled at 10 kHz, to obtain total current and then dividing by the number of data points. The base-line current level was set during periods when there was no channel activity, and current variance was at a minimum. The base-line level was monitored throughout a record to ensure that no shift had occurred. This measure is a rapid and observer-free method of monitoring changes in channel open probability when channel conductance is not changing. Average results are expressed as mean ± 1 S.E., and the probability of significant differences between means was calculated using the Student's t test. In L929 cells transfected with GABAA α1, β1, and γ2S cDNAs, the fluorescently labeled antibody bd24 that labels the α1 subunit was diffusely distributed over the surface of the plasmalemma (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when L929 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs for the same three subunits plus GABARAP a punctate distribution of fluorescent staining, as illustrated in Fig. 1B, was observed in 58–69% of cells. This punctuate appearance was visible in cells taken from five different sets of cells cotransfected with GABARAP but was not seen in “control” cells that had been transfected with the GABAA subunits but not GABARAP. These results are similar to those obtained in QT-6 fibroblasts (8Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 97: 11557-11562Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and indicate that GABARAP causes clustering of GABAA receptors in L929 fibroblasts also. Conductance—Typical single channel currents recorded in cell-attached patches on cells transfected with the three GABAA subunits are shown in Fig. 2A (GABA concentration in the pipette was 3 μm). The currents reversed at a pipette potential (Vp) close to 0 mV, as expected for chloride currents with the pipette solutions used, and showed no rectification (Fig. 2B). The maximum conductance (γm) of the channels shown in Fig. 2, A and B was 21 pS. The average maximum conductance level of channels recorded in the 15 cell-attached patches was 22.3 ± 1.2 pS (mean ± 1 S.E.). In none of the 15 cell-attached patches was γm above 35 pS. The application of bicuculline (100 μm) to the outer membrane surface (facing the pipette solution) in three of the patches blocked channel activity. Single channel currents were also recorded in outside-out patches. Typical currents activated by 1 μm GABA in one of these patches can be seen in Fig. 2C (Vp = +60 mV top trace, –60 mV bottom trace). The currents reversed at 0 mV and were non-rectifying (Fig. 2D). In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 2, C and D, channels had an average conductance of 29.2 ± 0.008 pS (n = 934 openings). In 33 outside-out patches, similar nonrectifying currents had an average maximum conductance of 30.5 ± 0.41 pS. Effects of Diazepam—In five of the six patches tested, diazepam caused no significant increase in conductance of recombinant channels formed by the three GABAA subunits alone as illustrated in Fig. 3, A and B. Channels were activated in a cell-attached patch with 3 μm GABA (Fig. 3A, Vp = –60 mV). The channels had a conductance of 17–23 pS and mean current was 0.17 pA. Within 2–3 min of switching to a bath solution containing 10 μm diazepam (Fig. 3B), channel activity had clearly increased (mean current 0.75 pA) and channel conductance was 22–26 pS. Similar results (an increase in open probability but no significant increase in channel conductance) were obtained in five cell-attached patches where the mean conductance of channels activated by 3 μm GABA was 16.6 ± 3.60 pS before exposure to 1 or 10 μm diazepam and 26.4 ± 3.40 pS after exposure to diazepam. In one of six patches channel conductance increased from 16 to 56 pS following the application of 10 μm diazepam. In eight outside-out patches, channels activated by 1 μm GABA had an average conductance of 29.8 ± 0.74 pS before exposure to 1 μm diazepam and a conductance of 29.6 ± 1.0 pS in the presence of 1 μm GABA plus 1 μm diazepam. Effects of Pentobarbital—Pentobarbital also increased channel activity but there was no increase in channel conductance, as illustrated in Fig. 3, C and D. Channels in a cell-attached patch (Vp = –60 mV) activated by 3 μm GABA (Fig. 3C) had a maximum conductance of 25 pS (mean current 0.09 pA). Within 1 min of exposing the cell to 100 μm pentobarbital (Fig. 3D) channel activity had increased, and currents from two channels were superimposing. Mean current had doubled (0.18 pA), but there was no significant change in channel conductance. Similar results were obtained in three cell-attached patches exposed to 100 μm pentobarbital. Average channel conductance before exposure to pentobarbital was 21.7 ± 5.0 and 30.0 ± 1.0 pS after exposure to the pentobarbital. Conductance—Single channel chloride currents were recorded in cells expressing the three GABAA subunits together with GABARAP. Typical examples of these currents in a cell-attached patch are shown in Fig. 4. Current traces shown in this figure were recorded at a series of potentials from a Vp of –80 mV (top trace) to +80 mV (bottom trace) in 20-mV steps. The currents reversed at a Vp of ∼0 mV (Fig. 4C) as expected for chloride currents with the pipette solution used. An all-points histogram constructed from a longer section of the record at a Vp of –80 mV shows a base-line peak at 0 pA and another prominent peak at ∼6 pA with little in between indicating that subconductance states were infrequent. The maximum current amplitude was 6.5 pA when Vp was –80 mV and –4.8 pA when Vp was +80 mV. As the currents reversed close to 0 mV (Fig. 4, A and C) these currents correspond to conductances of about 80 and 60 pS, respectively. Such high conductances were not seen in cells expressing α1 β1 γ2S channels but not co-expressing GABARAP. The current-voltage curve in Fig. 4C shows some outward rectification. In 16 of 25 cell-attached patches, channels activated by GABA had a significantly higher maximum conductance than channels recorded in the control cells not expressing GABARAP. In the 16 patches showing high conductance channels average γm (Vp = –60 mV) was 60.7 ± 4.3 pS, which is significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than in the 15 patches in cells not expressing GABARAP (22.3 ± 1.2 pS). The average channel conductance in the nine patches not showing a high conductance was 29.1 ± 1.94 pS. Application of bicuculline (100 μm) to the outer membrane surface (facing the pipette solution) in two patches containing high conductance channels blocked channel activity. Effects of Diazepam—Diazepam has been reported to increase the open probability (11Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar) and conductance (4Eghbali M. Curmi J.P. Birnir B. Gage P.W. Nature. 1997; 388: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Guyon A. Laurent S. Paupardin-Tritsch D. Rossier J. Eugene D. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) of native GABAA channels. Diazepam produced both effects on channels in 11 cell-attached patches on cells cotransfected with the GABAA subunits and GABARAP. An increase in γm caused by 10 μm diazepam is illustrated in Fig. 5. Before exposure to diazepam, the amplitude of single channel currents (Vp = –40 mV) activated by 3 μm GABA (Fig. 5A) was 1.32 pA corresponding to a conductance of 33 pS. The traces in Fig. 5B, recorded 2.5, 26, and 80 s after the exposure of the cell to 10 μm diazepam, and the associated all-points histograms to the right of each trace, show a progressive increase in channel conductance and open probability during the exposure to diazepam. The average channel conductance recorded in the 11 cell-attached patches activated by 3 μm GABA was 32.3 ± 4.74 pS and after exposure to 10 μm diazepam was increased to 56.3 ± 7.74 pS (p < 0.01). Conductance after diazepam application increased regardless of the initial conductance seen in the patch. In 3 of the 11 patches in which the initial GABA-activated conductance was on average 52.0 ± 8.93 pS, conductance increased to 85.3 ± 14.7 pS (p = 0.05) after exposure to diazepam. In the eight patches containing lower conductance channels with an average conductance of 24.9 ± 3.40 pS, conductance increased to 45.4 ± 5.70 pS (p < 0.005) after exposure to diazepam. Similar results were obtained from four inside-out patches in which γm increased from 52.3 ± 8.93 to 84.3 ± 6.30 pS (p < 0.05) after exposure to diazepam. Effects of Pentobarbital—Barbiturates have also been reported to increase GABAA channel-open probability (11Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar) and conductance (6Eghbali M. Gage P.W. Birnir B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in native channels. In patches in cells cotransfected with the GABAA subunits but not with GABARAP, pentobarbital caused no increase in channel conductance as illustrated for a cell-attached patch in Fig. 3, C and D. In contrast, in 10 patches from cells expressing the GABAA subunits and GABARAP, pentobarbital did increase channel conductance from 41.9 ± 5.65 to 63.9 ± 5.52 pS (p < 0.01). The effect of pentobarbital on conductance was most marked in 5 of the 10 patches where the initial GABA-activated currents were small (corresponding to a γm < 40 pS) increasing from 28.4 ± 4.50 to 59.8 ± 5.16 pS following application of 100 μm pentobarbital (p < 0.001). This effect is illustrated in Fig. 6. Before exposure to pentobarbital (Fig. 6A), single channel conductance was 25 pS (Vp = –40 mV), and the all-points histogram contained multiple peaks that corresponded to the superimposed activity of several channels in the patch. The separation of 1.0 pA between adjacent peaks reflects the single channel conductance of 25 pS. Following exposure of the patch to 100 μm pentobarbital, channel activity became greater and single channel current amplitude increased (Fig. 6B). There was still evidence of several channels in the patch, but the separation between current levels in the all-points histogram was now 2.72 pA (Fig. 6B) corresponding to a conductance of 68 pS. The increase in the areas of the non-base-line peaks relative to the base-line peak at 0 pA indicates an increase in channel-open probability, and the increased separation between peaks indicates an increase in channel conductance. Conductance—High conductance channels were seen in a lower percentage of outside-out patches than in cell-attached patches from cells transfected with the GABAA subunits plus GABARAP. GABAA channels with conductances above 40 pS were recorded in 6 of 20 outside-out patches activated with 1 μm GABA. Examples of these high conductance channels recorded in one of these outside-out patches are shown in Fig. 7A. The traces are shown on a fast time base to illustrate that there were immediate (within 100 μs) transitions between conductance levels, i.e. they were “single” channel openings and not superimposed non-synchronous openings. The average maximum conductance of the channels in the patch illustrated in Fig. 7A was 61.9 ± 0.011 pS (n = 475 openings). In the six patches containing the high conductance channels, the average γm was 53.7 ± 2.8 pS, which is significantly different from the γm in cells not expressing GABARAP described above (p < 0.0001). In the other 14 patches, channel conductance was 28.5 ± 0.85 pS, which is not significantly different from results obtained in cells not transfected with GABARAP. Effects of Diazepam—In 5 of 13 outside-out patches tested with diazepam, channel conductance was increased by the drug. Two of these were exposed to 10 μm diazepam, the other three were exposed to 1 μm diazepam. Examples of this effect in two of the patches are shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, B and C, single channel currents increased in amplitude after the patch was exposed to 10 μm diazepam (Vp = –60 mV). The channels in Fig. 7B had a maximum conductance of ∼30 pS (30.1 ± 0.012 pS, n = 193). After exposure to diazepam, γm increased by a factor of 2 to 60.0 ± 0.02 pS (n = 255). In the two patches showing an increase in channel conductance when exposed to 10 μm diazepam, γm increased from 27.7 to 42.3 pS and from 30.6 to 58.7 pS. The effect of 1 μm diazepam is illustrated in Fig. 7, D and E. The histograms show the distribution of channel conductances measured before (D) and after (E) exposure to 1 μm diazepam. There is a clear shift in channel conductance to higher values. The average channel conductance before diazepam was 25.9 ± 0.40 pS (n = 100) and after diazepam was 40.7 ± 0.52 pS (n = 133). In the three patches exposed to 1 μm diazepam, γm increased from 28.0 ± 0.71 to 48.8 ± 1.73 pS. To test the possible link between channel clustering and conductance, cells were transfected with the three GABAA subunits plus a truncated GABARAP. A truncated form of GABARAP (deletion of the first 35 residues) loses the ability to bind to tubulin or microfilaments and to cause clustering (12Wang H. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 75: 644-655Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effects of full-length GABARAP, high conductance channels were not seen in cells expressing truncated GABARAP together with the three GABAA subunits. In seven cell-attached patches, γm was 28 ± 1.7 pS (Vp = –60 mV) (Table I), which is similar to the conductance of channels in the absence of GABARAP. In another series of experiments, we recorded GABAA single channel currents in cells expressing GABAA α1 and β1 subunits (no γ2S) together with full-length GABARAP. Because the GABARAP binding site is on the γ subunit, GABARAP would not bind to these receptors, and indeed there is no clustering of receptors under these conditions (8Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 97: 11557-11562Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In seven cell-attached patches on cells expressing α1 and β1 subunits plus GABARAP, no high conductance channels were seen (Table I). The average channel conductance was 18.9 ± 0.91 pS. These observations suggest that the effects of GABARAP on channel conductance require binding of GABARAP to the GABAA γ subunit at some stage of trafficking or assembling of GABAA receptors.Table IThe influence of GABARAP on GABAA channel conductanceConductanceα1β1γ2S + truncated GABARAPα1β1 + GABARAPpS27aHolding membrane potential VP = -60 mV.19aHolding membrane potential VP = -60 mV.23162723251737202717302028 ± 1.7bMean ± S.E.18.9 ± 0.91bMean ± S.E.a Holding membrane potential VP = -60 mV.b Mean ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Our results show that co-expression of GABARAP with α1, β1, and γ2S subunits of GABAA receptors can cause changes in the properties of GABAA channels. When compared with recombinant GABAA channels in cells expressing α1, β1, and γ2S subunits, channels formed by these subunits in cells also expressing GABARAP often had a higher maximum conductance (above 40 pS), and their conductance could be increased by diazepam or pentobarbital. These properties are strikingly similar to those of GABAA channels in cultured hippocampal neurons from neonatal rats (3Curmi J.P. Premkumar L.S. Birnir B. Gage P.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Eghbali M. Curmi J.P. Birnir B. Gage P.W. Nature. 1997; 388: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Eghbali M. Gage P.W. Birnir B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Fatima-Shad K. Barry P.H. Proc. R. Soc. Ser. B. 1992; 250: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GABARAP has been shown to cause the clustering of GABAA receptors (8Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 97: 11557-11562Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The cause of this clustering has not been established, and in particular whether GABARAP is closely associated with the receptors (14Kneussel M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 39: 74-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whether or not GABARAP anchors GABAA receptors to the cytoskeleton, it is clear that co-expression of GABARAP does produce aggregation of receptors in hot spots in Japanese quail QT-6 fibroblasts (8Chen L. Wang H. Vicini S. Olsen R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 97: 11557-11562Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar) perhaps by influencing their trafficking or insertion in the plasmalemma. We have confirmed that co-expression of GABARAP in the L929 fibroblasts we were using in the electrophysiological experiments caused the aggregation of receptors (Fig. 1). We did not detect endogenous GABARAP in L929 cells using Western blotting with the GABARAP antibody (7Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Hence, if L929 cells do contain very low amounts of endogenous GABARAP below the sensitivity of Western blotting, it does not cause the same clustering as the co-expressed GABARAP. We believe that it is the clustering of receptors produced by the co-expressed GABARAP that is responsible for the changes in “single channel” characteristics. It has been suggested previously that channels can open cooperatively (for reviews see Ref. 10Laver D.R. Gage P.W. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 99-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). There is evidence for direct protein-protein interactions (cross-talk) between the intracellular domains of different channels in close proximity (15Liu F. Wan Q. Pristupa Z.B. Yu X.M. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Nature. 2000; 403: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 16Khakh B.S. Zhou X. Sydes J. Galligan J.J. Lester H.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is possible that GABARAP, by aggregating receptors, promotes interaction(s) between the intracellular domains of the closely packed receptors so that several pentameric channels open cooperatively. This hypothesis would predict that any method of aggregating receptors might induce cooperative opening and closing of channels. This remains to be tested. Not all cell-attached patches and fewer outside-out patches from cells co-expressing GABARAP showed high conductance channels. If the high conductance channels depend on the dense packing of receptors, it would not be surprising if some patches did not contain clustered receptors and high conductance channels. Although receptors are presumably in their native state in cell-attached patches, in forming an outside-out patch it is necessary to drag both membrane and receptors into the patch, and it would not be surprising if interactions between receptors and receptor clusters were often disrupted during formation of the patch. This may explain why high conductance channels were seen less frequently in outside-out than in cell-attached patches from cells expressing GABARAP with the three GABAA subunits. Although the absence of endogenous GABARAP in our L929 expression system is able to explain why high conductance recombinant GABAA channels are not observed here, it is not clear why there appears to be a discrepancy in some native systems. Perhaps there too, the presence or absence of proteins involved in the clustering mechanism is responsible. Also, our data indicate that patch configuration affects the probability of recording high conductance channels. Whatever the mechanism of the changes caused by GABARAP, our results suggest that recombinant channels may not always be ideal preparations for characterizing the properties, or the responses to drugs, of native channels.

https://openalex.org/W2137892602,"NY-ESO-1, a commonly expressed tumor antigen of the cancer-testis family, is expressed by a wide range of tumors but not found in normal adult somatic tissue, making it an ideal cancer vaccine candidate. Peptides derived from NY-ESO-1 have shown preclinical and clinical trial promise; however, biochemical features of these peptides have complicated their formulation and led to heterogeneous immune responses. We have taken a rational approach to engineer an HLA A2-restricted NY-ESO-1-derived T cell epitope with improved formulation and immunogenicity to the wild type peptide. To accomplish this, we have solved the x-ray crystallographic structures of HLA A2 complexed to NY-ESO (157-165) and two analogues of this peptide in which the C-terminal cysteine residue has been substituted to alanine or serine. Substitution of cysteine by serine maintained peptide conformation yet reduced complex stability, resulting in poor cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition. Conversely, substitution with alanine maintained complex stability and cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition. Based on the structures of the three HLA A2 complexes, we incorporated 2-aminoisobutyric acid, an isostereomer of cysteine, into the epitope. This analogue is impervious to oxidative damage, cysteinylation, and dimerization of the peptide epitope upon formulation that is characteristic of the wild type peptide. Therefore, this approach has yielded a potential therapeutic molecule that satiates the hydrophobic F pocket of HLA A2 and exhibited superior immunogenicity relative to the wild type peptide. NY-ESO-1, a commonly expressed tumor antigen of the cancer-testis family, is expressed by a wide range of tumors but not found in normal adult somatic tissue, making it an ideal cancer vaccine candidate. Peptides derived from NY-ESO-1 have shown preclinical and clinical trial promise; however, biochemical features of these peptides have complicated their formulation and led to heterogeneous immune responses. We have taken a rational approach to engineer an HLA A2-restricted NY-ESO-1-derived T cell epitope with improved formulation and immunogenicity to the wild type peptide. To accomplish this, we have solved the x-ray crystallographic structures of HLA A2 complexed to NY-ESO (157-165) and two analogues of this peptide in which the C-terminal cysteine residue has been substituted to alanine or serine. Substitution of cysteine by serine maintained peptide conformation yet reduced complex stability, resulting in poor cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition. Conversely, substitution with alanine maintained complex stability and cytotoxic T lymphocyte recognition. Based on the structures of the three HLA A2 complexes, we incorporated 2-aminoisobutyric acid, an isostereomer of cysteine, into the epitope. This analogue is impervious to oxidative damage, cysteinylation, and dimerization of the peptide epitope upon formulation that is characteristic of the wild type peptide. Therefore, this approach has yielded a potential therapeutic molecule that satiates the hydrophobic F pocket of HLA A2 and exhibited superior immunogenicity relative to the wild type peptide. Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Ag, antigen; TCD8, CD8+ T lymphocytes; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte(s); Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; TAA, tumor-associated antigen(s); Abu, 2-aminoisobutyric acid.1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Ag, antigen; TCD8, CD8+ T lymphocytes; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte(s); Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; TAA, tumor-associated antigen(s); Abu, 2-aminoisobutyric acid. molecules play a crucial role in immune surveillance by selectively binding to intracellular peptide antigens (Ag) and presenting them at the cell surface to CD8+ T lymphocytes (TCD8), including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Eradication of tumors is associated with a robust cytotoxic T cell response to antigens expressed by the tumor (tumor-associated antigens (TAA)). Because many TAA are self-proteins or closely related to self-proteins, they tend to be poorly immunogenic (1Boon T. Vanderbruggen P. J. Exp.

Moreover, many TAA-derived peptides are not strong binders to class I molecules, making strategies that revolve around tumor Ag delivery poor inducers of CD8 T cell immunity (6Sette A. Fikes J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptide-based vaccines offer a flexible, relatively simple and cost-effective way to treat a variety of human diseases, including the immunotherapy of cancer. Moreover, synthetic peptides are easily engineered to improve the efficacy of the immunogen. Such engineering may include optimizing target MHC class I binding by substituting key residues with more appropriate anchor residues. In addition, peptide-based therapeutics can be engineered to improve formulation and storage properties, and strategies exist to protect labile peptide bonds by incorporating nonpeptidic structures (7Purcell A.W.

Ideally such candidates are expressed solely in cancerous tissue and are essential for the malignant phenotype; however, few examples of such antigens exist. More often, TAAs are self-proteins overexpressed in tumors or self-proteins that contain mutations that may or may not be discernible by the immune system. The risk of potential autoimmune complications in eliciting anti-tumor immunity requires strategies to minimize autoimmunity. One such strategy is to limit the immune response toward tumor-specific epitopes (e.g. in mutated antigens) or to a few defined and easily monitored epitopes rather than whole antigen. Boon and colleagues cloned the first human tumor antigen capable of eliciting spontaneous CTL responses in melanoma patients (1Boon T. Vanderbruggen P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). This antigen, known as MAGE-A1, is expressed only in normal testis yet is frequently found in many different cancers. This expression pattern has led to MAGE and related antigens being termed cancer-testis antigens. Because normal testis germ cells do not express class I MHC molecules, this family of antigens has been extensively studied by the tumor immunotherapy community. NY-ESO-1 is another cancer testis Ag, expressed in many different types of tumors, including melanoma, breast, lung, and bladder cancers. In addition to its widespread expression by different cancers, it is also immunogenic in patients with late stage disease, with evidence of spontaneous humoral and cellular immune responses toward this antigen (18Jager E. Chen Y.-T. Drijfhout J.W. Karbach J. Ringhoffer M. Jager D. Arand M. Wada H. Noguchi Y. Stockert E. Old L.J. Knuth A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Both Class I and Class II restricted T cell determinants have been identified, making NY-ESO-1 or peptides derived from it potentially useful vaccine components (19Gnjatic S. Atanackovic D. Jager E.

Peptide vaccination with NY-ESO-1 determinants has been very promising, but along the way these studies have highlighted problems of stability and bioavailability associated with peptide immunization and the frequent failure to elicit robust CTL that kill tumors (21Valmori D. Dutoit V. Lienard D. Rimoldi D. Pittet M.J. Champagne P. Ellefsen K. Sahin U. Speiser D. Lejeune F. Cerottini J.C. Romero P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4499-4506PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jager E. Nagata Y.

Three peptides from an overlapping region of the NY-ESO-1 protein (residues 155-163, QLSLLMWIT; residues 157-165, SLLMWITQC; residues 157-167, SLLMWITQCFL) have previously been reported as HLA A*0201-restricted determinants recognized by tumor-reactive TCD8 from a melanoma patient (18Jager E. Chen Y.-T. Drijfhout J.W. Karbach J. Ringhoffer M. Jager D. Arand M. Wada H. Noguchi Y. Stockert E. Old L.J. Knuth A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Despite poor binding to HLA A2, tumor-reactive TCD8 clones mainly recognize the NY-ESO-(157-165) determinant (21Valmori D. Dutoit V. Lienard D. Rimoldi D. Pittet M.J. Champagne P. Ellefsen K. Sahin U. Speiser D. Lejeune F. Cerottini J.C. Romero P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4499-4506PubMed Google Scholar). The immunogenicity of these peptides was first evaluated in a trial vaccination of cancer patients in which a mixture of the peptides was administered intradermally to patients bearing NY-ESO-1+ tumors (28Jager E. Gnjatic S. Nagata Y. Stockert E. Jager D. Karbach J. Neumann A. Rieckenberg J. Chen Y.-T. Ritter G. Hoffman E. Arand M. Old L.J. Knuth A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12198-12203Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). A vigorous TCD8 response to NY-ESO-(157-165) was observed, whereas reactivity against NY-ESO-(157-165) appeared later and at a lower level. The TCD8 response to NY-ESO peptide vaccination has also been examined by HLA A2/peptide tetramer analysis and revealed a heterogeneous response directed against several distinct overlapping epitopes, including cryptic determinants generated by aminopeptidase activity (24Dutoit V. Taub R.N. Papadopoulos K.P. Talbot S. Keohan M.L. Brehm M. Gnjatic S. Harris P.E. Bisikirska B. Guillaume P. Cerottini J.C. Hesdorffer C.S. Old L.J. Valmori D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, only CTL recognizing the precise NY-ESO-(157-165) determinant also recognize the endogenously processed determinant on NY-ESO+ tumor cells, probably because it is the only constitutively presented determinant on tumor cells (20Gnjatic S. Jager E. Chen W. Altorki N.K. Matsuo M. Lee S.Y. Chen Q. Nagata Y. Atanackovic D. Chen Y.T. Ritter G. Cebon J. Knuth A. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11813-11818Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Analogs of NY-ESO-(157-165) where the C-terminal Cys residue has been replaced with more conventional anchor residues, namely Leu9 and Val9 analogs, have been generated (25Chen J.-L. Dunbar P.R. Gileadi U. Jager E. Gnjatic S. Nagata Y. Stockert E. Panicali D.L. Chen Y.-T. Knuth A. Old L.J. Cerundolo V. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Whereas these analogs bind more efficiently to HLA A2 and are recognized by CTL raised against the natural NY-ESO-(157-165) peptide, they do not induce effective anti-tumor CTL. Indeed, the presence of the Cys at the C terminus seems critical for generating CTL that recognize endogenously processed NY-ESO determinants on tumor cells. The presence of this amino acid causes problems with formulation due to oxidative damage and dimerization, both of which reduce the efficacy of the peptide Ag as an immunogen (25Chen J.-L. Dunbar P.R. Gileadi U. Jager E. Gnjatic S. Nagata Y. Stockert E. Panicali D.L. Chen Y.-T. Knuth A. Old L.J. Cerundolo V. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 948-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the structure of NY-ESO-(157-165) complexed to HLA A*0201 and compared it with the C9A and C9S structures, which are more easily formulated and are potential vaccine candidates (see Table I). We have also examined the functional recognition of these analogues using a CD8+ T lymphocyte lines derived from melanoma patients immunized with overlapping peptides spanning NY-ESO 155-167 (24Dutoit V. Taub R.N. Papadopoulos K.P. Talbot S. Keohan M.L. Brehm M. Gnjatic S. Harris P.E. Bisikirska B. Guillaume P. Cerottini J.C. Hesdorffer C.S. Old L.J. Valmori D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1813-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that respond to NY-ESO-(157-165). In our studies, we have been careful to pretreat all of the peptides including the Cys-containing peptides with a reductant to prevent dimerization or cysteinylation of the peptides, which could mask the recognition of the wild type peptide relative to the analogs. This allowed for the first time a systematic analysis of relative antigenicity of the wild type peptide and analogues. Finally, we used structure guided design to test an analog that should satisfy the Cys requirement of anti-tumor CTL by substituting the Cys9 for a nonnatural isosteric analog of this residue 2-aminoisobutyric acid (Abu).Table IPeptides used in this study Peptides—All peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc synthesis and synthesized by Auspep Pty. Ltd. (North Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). All peptides were purified to >85% purity by preparative reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and purity was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using an Agilent 1100 LC-MSD SL ion trap instrument and a Stable Bond RP C18 column (100 × 0.5-mm inner diameter column) (see Table I). Peptides were dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 10-100 mg/ml. Expression, Purification, Crystallization, and Structure Determination—Truncated HLA A*0201 class I heavy chain, encompassing residues 1-274, was expressed as inclusion bodies (30Garboczi D.N. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using the BL21 (RIL) strain of Escherichia coli. At an A600 of 0.6, cultures were induced with 1 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h, bacteria were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation after washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, and washing in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, and then solubilized in 50 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 10 mm NaEDTA, pH 8.0, with the protease inhibitors 1 μg/ml pepstatin A and 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Recombinant protein (30 mg of A2 heavy chain and 10 mg of β2-microglobulin) was refolded with 6 mg of peptide reconstituted in 3 m guanidine HCl, 10 mm sodium acetate, and 10 mm NaEDTA, pH 4.2, in a refolding buffer composed of 0.1 m Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 400 mm l-arginine-HCl, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, 5 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 72 h. Following refolding, protein was dialyzed overnight against Milli Q using a 6,000-8,000-kDa molecular mass cut-off dialysis membrane (Spectrum). Protein was concentrated by ion exchange on a DE52 column (Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK) and subsequently purified by size exclusion on a Superdex 75pg gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and a final ion exchange on a MonoQ HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative analysis was based on comparisons with bovine serum albumin protein standards using SDS-PAGE. Protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml for use in crystallization trials. Crystallization—Large cubic crystals (0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm) were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at room temperature. The crystals were grown within 3-5 days by mixing equal volumes of 10 mg/ml HLA A2-NY-ESO-1 peptide (and analogues thereof) with the reservoir buffer (2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.5). The crystals belong to space group P213 with unit cell dimensions a = b = c ≈ 117.90 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. The crystals were flash-frozen prior to data collection using crystals that had been soaked in 15% glycerol. One 2.2-Å and two 2.5-Å data sets were collected for the NY-ESO-1 series and scaled using the HKL suite (31Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). For a summary of statistics, see Table I. Structure Determination—The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method, using the program AmoRe within the CCP4 suite (32Collaborative Computing Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 750-763Google Scholar). The previously solved monomeric HLA A2 structure (Protein Data Bank code 1DUY) (33Reid S.W. McAdam S. Smith K.J. Klenerman P. O'Callaghan C.A. Harlos K. Jakobsen B.K. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), minus the peptide, was used as the search probe. A clear peak in the rotation function yielded one clear solution in the translation function that packed well within the unit cell. Following rigid body fitting in AmoRe, the molecular replacement solution had an Rfactor and correlation coefficient of 68.2 and 38.1, respectively. Unbiased features in the initial electron density map, including that of the NY-ESO-1 peptide, confirmed the correctness of the molecular replacement solution. The progress of refinement was monitored by the Rfree value (4% of the data) with neither a sigma, nor a low resolution cut-off being applied to the data. The structure was refined using rigid body fitting of the individual domains followed by the simulated annealing protocol implemented in CNS (version 1.0) (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Tightly restrained individual B-factor refinement was employed, and bulk solvent corrections were applied to the data set. Water molecules were included in the model if they were within hydrogen-bonding distance to chemically reasonable groups, appeared in Fo - Fc maps contoured at 3.5σ, and had a B-factor less than 60 Å2. See Table I for a summary of refinement statistics and model quality. HLA A*0201 Assembly Assay—The cDNA encoding the ectodomain of HLA class I molecules HLA A*0201 (amino acids 1-276) was inserted into pET30 (Novagen) vector and verified by DNA sequencing. Inclusion body protein of the heavy chain and β2-microglobulin were prepared as described (30Garboczi D.N. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Kjer-Nielsen L. Clements C.S. Brooks A.G. Purcell A.W. Fontes M.R. McCluskey J. Rossjohn J. J.

In vitro assembly of HLA A2-peptide complexes in microassembly reactions was initiated by the sequential addition of recombinant β2-microglobulin (2 μm) and HLA A2 heavy chain (3 μm)to peptide (30 μm) in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.4 m arginine, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a final volume of 1 ml. The assembly reaction mixture was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 48 h, and aggregated material was removed by centrifugation. Quantitation of assembled HLA class I complexes was performed by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; briefly, 96-well plates were coated with affinity-purified pan-class I-specific monoclonal antibody W6/32 at 10 μg/ml, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and blocked with PBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Properly assembled and correctly conformed HLA-peptide complexes were captured and detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human β2-microglobulin polyclonal antibodies (DakoCytomation A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) and the chromogen o-phenylenediamine (Sigma). Thermostability Measurements of Recombinant Class I Complexes Using Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were measured on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter using a thermostatically controlled cuvette at temperatures between 20 and 90 °C. Far-UV spectra from 195 to 250 nm were collected with a 5-s/point signal averaging and were the accumulation of 10 individual scans; θ218 measurements for the thermal melting experiments were made at temperature intervals of 0.1 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. The midpoint of thermal denaturation (Tm) for each protein was calculated by taking the first derivative of the elipticity data and identifying the inflection point, which represents the Tm for each protein. All complexes were measured at 20 μg/ml in a solution of 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. T Cell Lines and Interferon-γ Assay—The NY-ESO-1-specific CTL lines with specificity against NY-ESO-1-(157-165) were derived from delayed type hypersensitivity biopsy after HLA A2+ patients bearing NY-ESO+ tumors received NY-ESO-1 peptide 157-165 vaccination. This clinical trial was conducted at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. It was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Austin Health, and the patients provided written informed consent. Due to potential oxidation of the wild type peptide and the rapid cysteinylation of this peptide in tissue culture medium during Ag presentation assays, all peptides were treated with 500 μm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (Pierce), which reduces oxidation, dimerization, and other modification of the cysteine residues without affecting T cell reactivity, allowing accurate comparison of T cell cross reactivity (38Chen W. Yewdell J.W. Levine R.L. Bennink J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Transporter associated with antigen processing-deficient T2 cells were pulsed with graded concentrations of the peptides at room temperature for 45 min and then washed. T cells were then added along with brefeldin A at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The cells were incubated for a further 4 h, harvested, and stained with anti-CD8-Cychrome conjugate in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min, washed, and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized with 0.2% saponin and intracellular interferon-γ that had accumulated in the presence of brefeldin A was detected using an anti-interferon-γ-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. 100,000 events were acquired on a FACScalibur flow cytometer, and the data were analyzed with Flowjo software (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA). Structure of NY-ESO-1-(157-165) Peptide Complexed to HLA A2—The HLA A2-NY-ESO complex and analogues thereof have been crystallized in the cubic space group P213, with one molecule per asymmetric unit, and diffracted to a resolution of 2.5 Å or better. The structures were determined via molecular replacement, using a previously determined HLA A2 structure as the search probe (Protein Data Bank number 1DUY (39Khan A.R. Baker B.M. Ghosh P. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6398-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)). The structure of HLA A*0201 complexed to the wild type NY-ESO-(157-165) peptide has been refined to 2.2 Å to an Rfactor and Rfree of 22.8 and 26.7% respectively; the structure of the C9A analogue has been refined to 2.3 Å to an Rfactor and Rfree of 23.6 and 27.3%, respectively; the structure of the C9S analogue has been refined to 2.5 Å to an Rfactor and Rfree of 23.0 and 27.9%, respectively (See Table II for a summary of the refinement statistics for each analogue). The three structures comprise residues 1-274 of the HLA A2 heavy chain, residues 1-99 of β2-microglobulin, and nine residues of the bound peptide, one sulfate ion, and a variable number of water molecules.Table IIData collection and refinement statistics The values in parentheses are for the h"

Bone sialoprotein accumulates within bone acidic glycoprotein-75-enriched matrix areas at a later stage in both models. Decalcification of initial sites of mineralization consistently revealed focal immunostaining for bone acidic glycoprotein-75 underneath these sites suggesting that mineralization occurs within bone acidic glycoprotein-75-enriched matrix areas. Ultrastructural immunolocalization of bone acidic glycoprotein-75 does not support a direct association with banded collagen fibrils, but rather suggests it is a component of a separate, amorphous scaffold occupying interfibrillar spaces. Double immunogold labeling demonstrated that a sizeable proportion of bone sialoprotein particles were located within a 50-nm radius of bone acidic glycoprotein-75. These results define bone acidic glycoprotein-75 as the earliest bone-restricted, extracellular marker of osteogenic mesenchyme. Based on this early bone-restricted expression pattern and a previously documented propensity of bone acidic glycoprotein-75 to form supramolecular complexes through self-association, bone acidic glycoprotein-75 may serve a key structural role in setting boundary limits of condensing osteogenic mesenchyme.

Several issues remain controversial including whether biomineralization of bone is an active or passive process (9Schinke T. McKee M.D. Karsenty G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 150-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). If an active process, it is unknown whether the same cell biological and biochemical mechanism is used for both endochondral and intramembranous pathways of new bone formation (10Gorski J.P. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 201-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In terms of the identity of an active initiation or nucleation complex, a large body of evidence supports a role for both extracellular membrane limited vesicles (2Wuthier R.E. Connect.

However, the physiological roles for each of these initiation mechanisms in embryonic and postnatal bone development and repair is yet to be determined.Marrow ablation of the rodent tibia and the postnatal tibial periosteum represent two non-pathological in vivo models of intramembranous bone formation. After removal of the marrow, the intramedullary cavity of the tibia rapidly fills with primary bone over a period of 7–8 days (11Schwartz Z. Sela J. Ramirez V. Amir D. Boyan B.D. Bone. 1989; 10: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Suva L.J. Seedor J.G. Endo N. Quartuccio H.A. Thompson D.D. Bab I. Rodan G.A. J. Bone Miner.

This bone is then removed through osteoclastic resorption coincident with the intramedullary cavity refilling with marrow tissue. The diaphyseal periosteum comprises morphologically separate layers, each representing different stages of osteogenesis and cell differentiation (15Jee W.S. Weiss L. Histology, Cell and Tissue Biology. Elsevier Biomedical, New York1983: 200-255Crossref Google Scholar). Its outermost and innermost cell layers reflect osteoprogenitor and osteoblastic cell stages of differentiation, respectively (16Jee W.S. Li X.J. Li Y.L. Bone. 1988; 9: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17McCulloch C.A. Tenenbaum H.C. Fair C.A. Birek C. Anat. Rec. 1989; 223: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Many investigators have used these models to relate the onset of expression of specific cell surface receptors such as syndecan (18Koyama E. Leatherman J.L. Shimazu A. Nah H.D. Pacifici M. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and extracellular matrix markers such as bone sialoprotein (BSP) 1The abbreviations used are: BSP, bone sialoprotein; AR-S, alizarin red S; BMF, biomineralization foci; BAG-75, bone acidic glycoprotein-75; TBS, neutral Tris-buffered saline. (19Riminucci M. Bradbeer J.N. Corsi A. Gentili C. Descalzi F. Cancedda R. Bianco P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1852-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to morphological landmarks (and the underlying regulatory mechanisms) of intramembranous bone development.Bone acidic glycoprotein-75 (BAG-75) is an acidic glycoprotein of 75 kDa in apparent size containing elevated contents of Asp/Glu (29%), sialic acid, and covalently bound phosphate (44 residues/mol) (20Gorski J.P. Shimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15938-15945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostaining of mouse and rat tissues, immunoprecipitations with a range of biosynthetically labeled tissues, and Northern blotting with a range of tissue-derived mRNA samples, 2J. P. Gorski, unpublished data. all indicate that BAG-75 is restricted in its expression to actively forming intramembranous bone and dentin (10Gorski J.P. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol.

Purified BAG-75 displays a strong propensity to self-associate in vivo and in vitro into supramolecular spherical complexes (10–20 μm diameter) composed of multiple 10–12-nm diameter microfibrils (23Sato M. Grasser W. Fullenkamp C. Gorski J.P. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2966-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Gorski J.P. Kremer E.A. Chen Y. Ryan S. Fullenkamp C. Delviscio J. Jensen K. McKee M.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A similar “fine filamentous” network is present at sites of primary bone formation (25Hoshi K. Kemmotsu S. Takeuchi Y. Amizuka N. Ozawa H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Sauren Y.M. Mieremet R.H. Groot C.G. Scherft J.P. Bone. 1989; 10: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Electronegative complexes composed of BAG-75 can sequester millimolar quantities of phosphate ions (24Gorski J.P. Kremer E.A. Chen Y. Ryan S. Fullenkamp C. Delviscio J. Jensen K. McKee M.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); BAG-75 also binds up to 135 atoms of Ca2+/molecule at saturation (27Chen Y. Bhajanit B.S. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24871-24878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have shown that the initial nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals mediated by cultured osteoblastic UMR-106 cells occurs within supramolecular biomineralization foci (BMF) containing BAG-75 and BSP (28Midura R.J.

It is found in the mineralizing boundaries of bone, dentin, and calcifying cartilage tissues (29Chen J. Shapiro H.S. Sodek J. J. Bone Miner.

BMF are envisioned as three-dimensional matrix volumes representing a sequestered environment within developing bone matrix that accumulates and organizes secreted materials (alkaline phosphatase containing matrix vesicles, nucleators, enzymes) required for initial nucleation of calcium phosphate crystals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMale Sprague-Dawley rats (250–276 g) were purchased from Sasco, Inc. (Willington, MA). All animal procedures performed were pre-approved by the University of Missouri-Kansas City institutional review committee. Monoclonal anti-BSP (WV1D1(9C5)) antibodies were produced by M. Solursh and A. Franzen and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health, and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. Anti-BAG-75 protein antibodies (number 504) were previously characterized (21Gorski J.P. Griffin D. Dudley G. Stanford C. Thomas R. Huang C. Lai E. Karr B. Solursh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).MethodsBilateral Marrow Ablation Surgery—All animals were kept two per standard cage and allowed free access to food (Purina number 5001 lab rodent chow) and water. Marrow ablation surgery was performed bilaterally as described previously (13Magnuson S.K. Booth R. Porter S. Gorski J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) under an approved University of Missouri-Kansas City laboratory animal protocol. Prior to surgery, rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally using a mixture of 80 mg/kg ketamine HCl and 12 mg/kg xylazine. After both hind limbs were shaved and scrubbed with betadine, a 2-cm longitudinal incision was made along the medial aspect of each proximal tibia, and the periosteum was exposed. While irrigating with saline, a 1-mm hole was drilled through the cortex 2–4-mm inferior to the epiphyseal growth plate using a round burr and high speed Dremel drill. A 20-gauge intravenous catheter connected to a vacuum line was used to aspirate the marrow tissue; aspiration was alternated with flushing of the intramedullary cavity with sterile saline. After 4–5 cycles of aspiration and flushing, the ablated marrow cavity was filled with sterile saline and the wound was sutured with wound clips. Ablated rats begin to ambulate within 3–4 h of the surgery. Rats were euthanized 5, 7, and 10 days following surgery. Tibiae were dissected free of soft tissues and muscle and the bones were split in half to expose the intramedullary cavity that was filled with developing bone at these time points. New primary bone was carefully removed in one or two large segments (about 1 cm in length), leaving the more dense cortical bone behind. Primary bone was immediately covered with OCT and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to cryomicroscopy.Electron Microscopy—Marrow ablation tissue used for electron microscopy was obtained 7 days after surgery, from the region most distal to the drill site. This region represents the earliest osteogenic phase (13Magnuson S.K. Booth R. Porter S. Gorski J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For conventional electron microscopy, tissue was fixed for 24 h with 2% glutaraldehyde in 150 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, at 4 °C, then dissected into samples of <1 mm3. Samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, embedded, sectioned, and stained according to published protocols (37Law D.J. Tidball J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar). For ultrastructural immunocytochemistry, distal tissue samples were fixed with 2% p-formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Samples were dissected into final-sized blocks, cryoprotected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned as described previously (38Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 39Herrera A.H. Elzey B. Law D.J. Horowits R. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 2000; 45: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Frozen sections of 80–100-nm thickness were processed for indirect immunolabeling using secondary antibodies coupled to 6- or 12-nm colloidal gold (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), under conditions designed to minimize cross-reactivity and nonspecific binding of antibodies (40Zhang J.Q. Elzey B. Williams G. Lu S. Law D.J. Horowits R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14898-14906Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In some cases, sections were decalcified in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid for 2 h prior to immunolabeling. Sections were examined using a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.Confocal Microscopy Protocol on Decalcified Frozen Sections of Marrow Ablation Tissue at Days 7 and 10: Color Segmentation Analyses— The fluorescence signal per pixel in a confocal image is assigned an 8-bit indexed color value from 0 to 255 for red and green color bands (the blue color band in these RGB images is set to zero). A mean background fluorescence value was determined separately for red and green color bands by averaging several areas in the image that do not exhibit an obvious signal. This mean value was subtracted from all pixel-indexed color values in its respective color band to correct for background fluorescence. An automated algorithm developed for a Silicon Graphics work station by the Whitaker Biomedical Imaging Laboratory (Dept. of Biomedical Engineering, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation) checks each pixel in the 512 × 512 pixel image array for its indexed color value. Color values in each pixel above the threshold set for each color band are assigned a new color (yellow) when both green and red signals co-localize in that pixel. There are two major parameters that need to be set for accurate quantitation of fluorophore co-localization. First, low-level fluorescence values that may represent nonspecifically bound fluorescent reporter in the tissue sections need to be excluded. This procedure restricts the co-localization analysis to pixels exhibiting high intensity fluorescence as a result of specifically bound fluorescent reporter. If there is only one color band present and the value of that color band is greater than or equal to a preset value, then it is represented as that color in the image. Otherwise, it is turned black and becomes part of the background. In these particular color segmentation analyses, the value for high level fluorescence was set at 40 or higher of 256 indexed color values, thus preserving all pixels with fluorescence levels greater than 15% of saturated levels. A second parameter to be set is the red/green (or green/red) ratio calculated for each pixel. If the intensity of the minor color band is less than a preset proportion of the intensity of the major color, then that pixel is assigned the major color and is not considered to exhibit a significant level of co-localization. If the intensity of the minor color band is above the preset threshold, then it is considered to exhibit a significant level of co-localization and the pixel color is changed to yellow. This assures that any pixels considered to contain co-localized color bands have a significantly high ratio of one fluorophore to the other. Here, in these analyses, we set that ratio to be 1:4; that is, the intensity of the minor colors must be equal to or greater than 25% of the intensity of the major color.Color segmentation analysis emphasizes co-localization as defined by the thresholds chosen and de-emphasizes intensity differences between the two color signals. Without use of color segmentation, visual recognition greatly underestimates the extent of yellow or co-localization.Paraffin Embedding and Colorimetric Immunostaining for Marrow Ablation Tissue Sections—Ablated tibias were fixed for 2 days in Bouin's solution and then decalcified in 4% p-formaldehyde containing 0.85% sodium chloride and 10% acetic acid (13Magnuson S.K. Booth R. Porter S. Gorski J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Tissues were dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions and infiltrated with xylene prior to embedding in paraffin and cutting into 5-μm sections. Sections were de-paraffinized through sequential immersion in xylene and a graded series of ethanol solutions according to conventional procedures. Following re-hydration in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), tissue sections were immunostained using a Vectastain ABC kit with glucose oxidase (Vector Labs, Inc.), tetranitro blue tetrazolium substrate, and anti-BAG-75 protein antibodies (number 504) according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Photomicrographs of stained sections were taken with an Olympus microscope.Visualization of Mineral and Immunofluorescent Staining of Primary Bone—Cryosections of undecalcified primary bone were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 1 h. Fixed sections were then washed three times with TBS, rinsed with de-ionized water, and then stained for 10 min with 0.4 mm alizarin red S (AR-S) dye, pH 4.2, at room temperature (34Wang A.

Sections were then rinsed five times with water followed by a TBS wash to reduce nonspecific AR-S staining and cover slipped. Photomicrographs were taken with a Nikon TE2000 microscope equipped with a DN100 digital camera controlled with Image Analysis software.Selected sections were decalcified and then immunostained. Briefly, coverslips were gently removed by soaking in TBS and sections were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in TBS containing 50 mm EDTA. Removal of AR-S stain was confirmed by microscopy. Decalcified sections were then processed for immunofluorescent staining with anti-BAG-75 protein antibodies (number 504) as described (28Midura R.J. Wang A. Lovitch D. Law D. Powell K. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25464-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Digital images were taken as described above. Digital images were assembled into collages using Photoshop software (version 7.0).Removal of Periosteal Layer from Tibial Diaphysis—Full thickness periosteum was microdissected from a 7-mm portion of the mid-diaphyseal region of tibia recovered from 21-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Labs) as described in Ref. 42Midura R.J.

Periosteum tissue was fixed in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 h at 4 °C, and then infiltrated with 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were then placed into cryomolds, cambium side downward, covered with TBS Tissue Freezing Medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC), and frozen on dry ice. Specimen blocks were stored at -80 °C until ready for cryostat sectioning at 10-μm thickness. Alkaline phosphatase staining was done using the Vector Red kit (Vector Labs., Burlingame, CA)RESULTSBAG-75 Expression Precedes BSP and Alkaline Phosphatase Expression within the Periosteal Layer Lining Growing Rat Bone—Radial growth in bone cortex width is mediated by the periosteum and follows an intramembranous pathway (15Jee W.S. Weiss L. Histology, Cell and Tissue Biology. Elsevier Biomedical, New York1983: 200-255Crossref Google Scholar). Cambium, or osseous, periosteum exhibits a developmental polarity with osteoprogenitor cells in the apical layers, and preosteoblasts and mature osteoblasts in the basal layer (Fig. 1, left panels) (42Midura R.J. Su X. Morcuende J.A. Tammi M. Tammi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51462-51468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The osteogenic nature of this tissue is demonstrated by its positive staining for alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 1, middle panels), and BSP expression in its basal cell layers (Fig. 1, right panels). Of particular interest are the confocal staining patterns of BAG-75 and BSP within this osteogenic tissue. BAG-75 displays two distinctive deposition patterns: a fibrillar or layered pattern evident in the apical cell layers (Fig. 1, right panels, yellow arrowhead), and a second more focal pattern in the basal cell layers (Fig. 1, right panels, white arrowhead). By comparison, BSP (and alkaline phosphatase) appears as focal distributions restricted to the basal cell layers. The size and shape of these focal deposits of BAG-75 and BSP in the basal cell layers range from 5 to 15 μm across, and are similar to the smaller-sized BMF observed in marrow ablation tissue sections and osteoblastic cultures (28Midura R.J. Wang A. Lovitch D. Law D. Powell K. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25464-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This change in BAG-75 staining pattern in the cambium periosteum coincides with the known developmental transition of osteoprogenitor cells to osteoblasts in this tissue, and suggests that the physical state of BAG-75 may change during osteoblastic differentiation. In addition, these data suggest that BAG-75 is expressed at an earlier stage of osteogenesis than either BSP or alkaline phosphatase. We next examined BAG-75 and BSP expression in the rat marrow ablation model of intramembranous bone development to extend our findings to an in vivo system that forms hydroxyapatite crystals.Initial Mineral Deposits in the Marrow Ablation Model Occur in Focal Areas Enriched in BAG-75—Earlier work with the ablation model documents that intramembranous bone forms in the intramedullary cavity within 7–8 days after surgery (13Magnuson S.K. Booth R. Porter S. Gorski J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A depicts a region at day 7 containing condensed mesenchyme in the shape of thin trabeculae that stain lightly with AR-S. The presence of initial mineral crystals is evident at focal sites of intense AR-S staining (Fig. 2, A–C and E, arrows). These focal AR-S-stained sites are roughly circular in shape with overall diameters of 50–75 μm (Fig. 2, B and E, arrows) and appear to be composed of multiple, smaller, 10–20-μm diameter, spherical complexes staining intensely for mineral (Fig. 2C). This two-dimensional organization of mineralizing matrix is similar to that of the two-sized populations of biomineralization foci observed in UMR cultures (28Midura R.J. Wang A. Lovitch D. Law D. Powell K. Gorski J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25464-25473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). While not rigorously proven, we assume that the focal sites marked by the box in Fig. 2A represent a cross-sectional view through tubular shaped trabeculae. After decalcification and immunostaining the same regions, it is apparent that patches of BAG-75 underlie all areas that earlier contained AR-S-stained mineral deposits (compare Fig. 2, B/C and E with D and F, respectively). Remarkably, the shape and position of the BAG-75 immunofluorescent signal closely paralleled that of the AR-S colorimetric stain (compare Fig. 2, B and D). However, the relative intensity of the BAG-75 signal did not correlate directly with the intensity of AR-S fluorescence (compare Fig. 2, C and D).Fig. 2Initial sites of mineralization in primary bone are spherical and enriched in BAG-75. All images were obtained with frozen sections of primary bone taken from a marrow ablation model. Two separate sections shown in A–C and E were decalcified with 0.05 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 50 mm EDTA, subjected to immunofluorescent staining, and then digitally imaged (D and F).

As shown in Fig. 3, a spherical acellular central region ∼50–75 μm in diameter and stained pink with eosin (marked by arrowheads) is mostly surrounded by osteoblastic cells staining intensely for alkaline phosphatase expression (arrows).

We report the X-ray crystal structures of a human enzyme of the soluble apyrase family in its apo state and bound to a substrate analog. The structures reveal a nucleotide binding domain comprising a five-blade beta propeller, binding determinants of the substrate and the active site, and an unusual calcium binding site with a potential regulatory function. Using a comparative structural biology approach, we were able to redesign the human apyrase so as to enhance its ADPase activity by more than 100-fold. The engineered enzyme is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and may serve as the basis for the development of a new class of antithrombotic agents."

In SecA, evidence for this is provided by the finding that, in the absence of tight C-domain association, the DEAD motor becomes a hyperactivated ATPase (15Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C.

Importantly, SecA with a short IRA1 deletion also becomes an unregulated, hyperactivated ATPase that is nevertheless incompetent for translocation (15Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This observation led us to propose that IRA1 is a molecular switch essential for coupling ATP hydrolysis to translocation work (15Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We now show that IRA1 contacts other SecA subdomains and through these it controls association and conformational cross-talk between the DEAD motor and the C-domain. Modulation of these physical contacts allows IRA1 to regulate DEAD motor subactivities. We propose that SecA ATP binding and hydrolysis become coupled to protein translocation through IRA1 acting as a global co-ordinator of translocase catalysis and conformation.

Next, the 2.9-kb NcoI fragment of pIMBB7 (HisSecA) was replaced by that of mutant genes, giving rise to pIMBB105, pIMBB106, pIMBB202, pIMBB107, pIMBB200, pIMBB108, pIMBB109, pIMBB110, and pIMBB201, respectively.

Fluorescence Measurements—Measurements were carried out in quartz cuvettes (1 ml; Hellma) with a Cary Eclipse fluorimeter supplemented with a four-position cuvette holder and a Peltier temperature controller (Varian). For determination of equilibrium dissociation constants, SecA was added at increasing concentrations (0.025-5 μm) to MANT-ADP (0.1 μm; Molecular Probes) in buffer B. Emission spectra of MANT-ADP were recorded at each step of the binding curve (380-550 nm; excitation 356 nm; slits at 2.5 and 20 nm). KD was determined by plotting the change of MANT-ADP emission spectra upon SecA addition against SecA concentration using the equation (F1 - F0)/F0 integral values (F0 = no SecA added, F1 = SecA added). To determine apparent Tm, we monitored changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission of SecA or C34 derivatives (0.25 μm in buffer B) as a function of increasing temperature (4 - 82 °C; ramping rate 0.8 °C/min; excitation 297 nm/emission 345 nm; slits at 2.5 and 20 nm; data acquisition interval = 0.5 min), in the presence or absence of ADP (2 mm). All data were collected using Cary Eclipse software (Bio Package; Varian) and analyzed by nonlinear regression using Origin 5.0 (Microcal). Surface Plasmon Resonance Assays—Optical biosensor measurements were on an IBIS II instrument (Echochemie). 3K7L (3 μgin50 μl from a 60 μg/ml stock in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.5) was added onto carboxymethylated dextran-coated gold sensor disks (CMD20; Xantec) and was cross-linked via NH2-specific N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide. The surface was regenerated with 100 mm HCl. Data were collected (750 s) and analyzed using IBIS Kinetic Analysis software (17Baud C. Karamanou S. Sianidis G. Vrontou E. Politou A.S. Economou A. J.

SecA Binding to SecYEG—Binding of 35S-labeled SecA proteins to inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) was performed as described elsewhere (5Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Briefly, urea-treated IMVs (64 μg/ml) were mixed with a range of 35S-labeled SecA concentrations (0.5-2000 nm; buffer B; 1 mg/ml BSA; 15 min; 4 °C). Reactions were overlaid on equal volume of buffer B, 0.2 m sucrose, 1 mg/ml BSA, in centrifuge tubes preblocked with BSA and sedimented (320,000 × g; 30 min; 4 °C; Beckman TLX120 ultracentrifuge). Pellets, rinsed (two times; 100 μl of buffer B) and resuspended by sonication, were spotted on nylon membranes in a vacuum manifold (Bio-Rad). Bound radioactivity was quantitated by phosphorimaging. Data were fitted to hyperbolae using nonlinear regression in Prism (GraphPad). Chemicals and Biochemicals—Proteases, inhibitors and nucleotides were from Roche; E. coli phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids; DNA enzymes from Minotech; oligonucleotides from MWG; dNTPs from Promega; [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol), [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), and chromatography materials (except Ni2+ affinity; Qiagen) from Amersham Biosciences; all other chemicals from Sigma.

IRA1 Mutations Compromise SecA-mediated Protein Translocation—To understand IRA1 function, we mutated its nine most highly conserved residues (Figs. 1 (A and B) and 5) (15Karamanou S. Vrontou E.

The ability of IRA1 mutants to complement the chromosomal thermosensitive secA gene of strain BL21.19 (15Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was examined (Fig. 1C). Six of the mutants (secAL785R, secAI789R, secAP799A, secAE802A, secAY803A, and secAE806A) were barely viable, as was partial deletion of IRA1 (secAΔ783-795) (15Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Jarosik G.P. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three mutants (secAW775A, secAF811A, and secAR792A) complemented the thermosensitive strain, albeit not as efficiently as secA. Oligohistidinyl-tagged SecA IRA1 mutants were purified and shown, like SecAΔ783-795 (15Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Jarosik G.P. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 860-868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to be stable, folded, and α-helical (far UV CD; data not shown) and dimeric (size exclusion chromatography, blue native PAGE, sedimentation equilibrium; data not shown). We concluded that IRA1 mutant proteins do not have significantly altered structures and were characterized biochemically. To verify that the in vivo phenotypes (Fig. 1C) are the result of defective protein export, HisSecA IRA1 mutants were used in an in vitro translocation assay with SecYEG-proteoliposomes and the secretory protein proOmpA (Fig. 1D) (6Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Of all IRA1 mutants, only SecAW775A (lane 5) supports protein translocation (lanes 6-13). SecAR792A (lane 8) and SecAF811A (lane 13) do not translocate in vitro, although they partially complement in vivo (Fig. 1C). Clearly, the more stringent and suboptimal in vitro proteoliposome assay exacerbates their defects. IRA1 Mutations Alter SecA ATPase Activities—To test whether IRA1 mutants are defective in ATP catalysis, we determined their basal, membrane, and translocation ATPase activities (Table I). Basal ATP catalysis is enhanced, either significantly (>13-fold; SecAW775A; >5-fold SecAF811A) or slightly (up to 2-fold; all other mutants except SecAI789R). Stimulation of basal ATPase upon addition of SecYEG-proteoliposomes (membrane ATPase) or proteoliposomes plus proOmpA (translocation ATPase) is seen only with SecAW775A, SecAR792A, and SecAF811A in agreement with the in vivo complementation test (Fig. 1C). All other IRA1 mutant proteins fail to further stimulate their basal ATPase.Table ISteady state ATPase kinetic constants of SecA IRA1 mutantsSecA derivativeKcatBasalMembraneTranslocationmin-1WT3.7 (±0.4)6.2 (±0.6)25 (±6)Δ783-79545 (±6)43 (±7)43.2 (±7)W775A50.4 (±7)54 (±10)76 (±13)L785R5.7 (±0.6)4.6 (±0.4)6.8 (±0.7)I789R3 (±0.3)3 (±0.3)2.6 (±0.2)R792A4.3 (±0.4)16 (±2.5)24.7 (±5)P799A5.2 (±0.5)3.2 (±0.3)9 (±1)E802A5.5 (±0.5)5.7 (±0.4)7.4 (±0.6)Y803A8.4 (±0.6)7.3 (±0.6)7 (±0.5)E806A4.1 (±0.3)1.3 (±0.2)5.4 (±0.4)F811A18.7 (±4)32 (±7)54 (±11) Open table in a new tab Based on the above results, IRA1 mutants fall into three classes: (i) the functional/hyperactivated W775A, (ii) the less-functional R792A and F811A, and (iii) the severely compromised L785R, I789R, P799A, E802A, Y803A, and E806A. To simplify presentation we will focus hereafter on three representative mutants: SecAW775A, SecAR792A, and SecAI789R. IRA1 Mutations Alter SecA Affinity for Nucleotide—To understand how IRA1 influences SecA ATP catalysis, we examined the effect of IRA1 single point mutations or partial deletion on nucleotide binding to SecA. To this end we developed a fluorescent MANT-ADP binding assay (Table II).Table IIEquillibrium dissociation constants of SecA and derivatives for MANT-ADP, at the indicated temperature Triplicates of 40-60 data points were used for each binding curve.SecA derivativeKDi4 °C37 °CμmSecA0.14 (±0.02)0.28 (±0.03)N680.28 (±0.03)>100Δ783-7950.75 (±0.1)8.18 (±2.5)W775A0.17 (±0.04)4.58 (±1.1)R792A0.4 (±0.08)0.38 (±0.02)I789R1.02 (±0.19)0.7 (±0.07) Open table in a new tab At 4 °C, MANT-ADP binds to SecA with high affinity (KD = 0.14 μm).

C34, the polypeptide carrying the C-domain alone (15Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol.

Temperature does not affect nucleotide binding to the DEAD motor in SecA (37 °C; Table II). In contrast, it drastically reduces binding to the isolated DEAD motor (>350-fold). This suggests that the C-domain acts in trans to determine DEAD motor nucleotide affinity at physiological temperature. Partial deletion or single point mutations in IRA1 reduce SecA nucleotide affinity, suggesting that IRA1 may be part of this mechanism. IRA1 Mutations Alter SecA Affinity for SecYEG—Because membranes do not stimulate the ATPase of most IRA1 mutants (Table I), their binding to SecYEG might be defective. To investigate this we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants of SecA IRA1 derivatives for SecYEG (Fig. 1E). SecA binds to SecYEG in IMVs with high affinity (KD = 30 nm; lane 1) (5Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). N68 binding to SecYEG is 4-fold reduced (KD = 110 nm; lane 2), whereas no C34 binding was measurable (data not shown) (32Dapic V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25000-25007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

This study reports the inhibitory effect of OPB-9195 (OPB), an inhibitor of AGEs formation, and the role of a collagen-specific molecular chaperone, a 47-kDa heat shock protein (HSP47) in diabetic nephropathy. Transgenic mice carrying nitric-oxide synthase cDNA fused with insulin promoter (iNOSTg) leads to diabetes mellitus. The iNOSTg mice at 6 months of age represented diffuse glomerulosclerosis, and the expression of HSP47 was markedly increased in the mesangial area in parallel with increased expression of types I and IV collagens. OPB treatment ameliorated glomerulosclerosis in the iNOSTg mice associated with the decreased expression of HSP47 and types I and IV collagens. The expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) was increased in glomeruli of iNOSTg mice and decreased after treatment with OPB. To confirm these mechanisms, cultured mesangial cells were stimulated with AGEs. AGEs significantly increased the expression of HSP47, type IV collagen, and TGF-β mRNA. Neutralizing antibody for TGF-β inhibited the overexpression of both HSP47 and type IV collagen in vitro. In conclusion, AGEs increase the expression of HSP47 in association with collagens, both in vivo and in vitro. The processes may be mediated by TGF-β.

Nephropathy is a morbid complication associated with diabetes mellitus and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (1Bojestig M. Arnqvist H.J. Hermansson G. Karlberg B.E. Ludvigsson J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by a mesangial expansion followed by glomerulosclerosis. The mechanism of these processes remains unknown. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) 1The abbreviations used are: AGEs, advanced glycation end-products; HSP47, 47-kDa heat shock protein; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; OPB, OPB-9195; TGF, transforming growth factor; CML, carboxymethyllysine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 1The abbreviations used are: AGEs, advanced glycation end-products; HSP47, 47-kDa heat shock protein; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; OPB, OPB-9195; TGF, transforming growth factor; CML, carboxymethyllysine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. have been recently reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, particularly in the progression of retinopathy and nephropathy (2Vlassara H. Bucala R. Striker L. Lab. Investig. 1994; 70: 138-151PubMed Google Scholar). AGEs, late compounds formed from early Amadori compounds produced during the Maillard reaction, slowly accumulate in various tissues. Direct evidence indicating the importance of AGEs in the progression of diabetic nephropathy has been reported previously (3Yamamoto Y. Kato I. Doi T. Yonekura H. Ohashi S. Takeuchi M. Watanabe T.

Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The administration of exogenous AGEs to normal rats induces glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial sclerosis, gene expression of matrix proteins, and production of various growth factors. An inhibitor of AGEs formation, aminoguanidine, ameliorates the mild glomerular changes and functional changes found in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats (6Soulis-Liparota T. Cooper M. Papazoglou D. Clarke B. Jerums G. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1328-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a synthetic thiazolidine derivative, OPB-9195, was shown to have a strong inhibitory effect of AGE formation (7Nakamura S. Makita Z. Ishikawa S. Yasumura K. Fujii W. Yanagisawa K. Kawata T. Koike T. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 895-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 47-kDa heat shock protein (HSP47) has been identified as a collagen-binding stress protein and plays a role in the intracellular processing of procollagen molecules as a collagen-specific molecular chaperone. We recently reported that the expression of HSP47 was markedly increased in parallel with the development of glomerulosclerosis in a rat renal ablation model (8Sunamoto M. Kuze K. Iehara N. Takeoka H. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also found that the inhibition of HSP47 ameliorated glomerulosclerosis (9Sunamoto M. Kuze K. Tsuji H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Lab. Investig. 1998; 78: 967-972PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a possible pathophysiological role of collagen-binding HSP47 in the fibrotic process in various organs, factors that modulate its expression remain undefined. To understand the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and to develop prophylactic and therapeutic measures against it, suitable animal models are needed. However, no single animal model that develops the renal changes seen in humans is available. Spontaneously diabetic animals such as the non-obese diabetic mouse develop only limited lesions, at most mild mesangial sclerosis (10Doi T. Hattori M. Agodoa L.Y. Sato T. Yoshida H. Striker L.J. Striker G.E. Lab. Investig. 1990; 63: 204-212PubMed Google Scholar). The same is the case with chemically induced diabetic rodents. In this study, we analyzed transgenic mice carrying the mouse, type 2-inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) cDNA under the control of an insulin promoter (iNOSTg) (11Takamura T. Kato I. Kimura N. Nakazawa T. Yonekura H. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2493-2496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The nitric oxide-mediated destruction of β cells results in a markedly reduced pancreatic islet mass and in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus. These characteristics were followed by glomerulosclerosis that resembled human diabetic nephropathy (3Yamamoto Y. Kato I. Doi T. Yonekura H. Ohashi S. Takeuchi M. Watanabe T. Yamagishi S. Sakurai S. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Yamamoto H. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β was originally identified in neoplastic cells and subsequently reported to be present in most cells in which it exerts a variety of effects on cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and embryogenesis. It has also been shown to stimulate the production of extracellular matrix components including collagens and fibronectin and to play a pivotal role in fibrogenesis (12Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-β is considered to be a mediator of collagen production in the models of fibrogenesis. Significant progress has recently been made in our understanding of the expression of the collagen genes and their transcriptional regulation by TGF-β (8Sunamoto M. Kuze K. Iehara N. Takeoka H. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Sunamoto M. Kuze K. Tsuji H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Lab. Investig. 1998; 78: 967-972PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that high glucose transiently induces a transcriptional activity of c-fos responsible for stimulation of the TGF-β (13Weigert C. Brodbeck K. Bierhaus A. Haring H.U. Schleicher E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, there is little information regarding the interaction between AGE and c-Fos. We investigated here the expression of c-Fos in cultured mesangial cells treated with AGE and examined whether c-Fos affected the expression of TGF-β. Furthermore, our recent report demonstrates that type IV collagen is up-regulated by AGE and its overexpression is transcriptionally regulated by Smad1 (14Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14201-14206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Smad1 also enhances the levels of expression of type I collagen and osteopontin and plays a critical role in TGF-β-mediated overexpression of extracellular matrix in diabetic nephropathy (14Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14201-14206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of Smad1 for regulating HSP47 expression by AGE stimulation in mesangial cells. In this study, we reported on a study of the inhibitory effect of OPB-9195 (OPB), a novel inhibitor of AGEs formation, in a model of diabetic nephropathy. The pathogenic role of HSP47 in the development of the glomerulosclerotic lesions in diabetes was examined. We also confirmed the mechanism of these processes with the use of cultured mesangial cells. Experimental Animals—iNOSTg were maintained on CD-1 mouse background (11Takamura T. Kato I. Kimura N. Nakazawa T. Yonekura H. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2493-2496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Male littermates were screened for the transgenes by the PCR amplification and used for analysis. The primers used for the detection of iNOSTg were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GTGGGCTATGGGTTTGTGGAAGGAGA-3′, and reverse primer 5′-CGATGTCACATGCAGCTTGT-3′. No expression of iNOS protein, whose synthesis is directed only in pancreatic islets, was detected in the kidney. The mice were divided into four groups: CD-1 as control mice (Control); control mice treated with OPB (Control + OPB); iNOSTg; and iNOSTg treated with OPB (iNOSTg + OPB). Each group was fed either normal chow or the chow containing 0.28% OPB (provided by Fujii Memorial Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokushima, Japan) from 1 to 6 months after birth. Blood Glucose and HbA1c Concentration—The levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were measured from the tail vein blood using Dexter Z sensor (Bayer-Medical, Tokyo, Japan) and DCA2000 analyzer (Bayer-Medical), respectively. Determination of AGEs Concentration—Levels of serum carboxymethyllysine (CML) and non-CML AGEs were determined using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (15Takeuchi M. Makita Z. Yanagisawa K. Kameda Y. Koike T. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 393-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1 unit/ml CML or non-CML AGEs corresponded to a protein concentration of 1 μg/ml CML-bovine serum albumin (BSA) or non-CML AGE-BSA, respectively. Renal Histology and Morphometric Analysis—Kidneys were processed for light microscopy examination, and the severity of the renal sclerosis was scored on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 4. The mean glomerular volume was determined as described previously (3Yamamoto Y. Kato I. Doi T. Yonekura H. Ohashi S. Takeuchi M. Watanabe T. Yamagishi S. Sakurai S. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Yamamoto H.

Immunofluorescence Analysis for HSP47, Types I and IV Collagens, and TGF-β —Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out as described previously using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody specific to HSP47, types I and IV collagens, and TGF-β (8Sunamoto M.

Laser-manipulated Microdissection and Laser Pressure Catapulating—Laser-manipulated microdissection is a method to cut out a small region from a specimen under microscope observation by means of laser beam. Laser pressure catapulating is a method to push up and collect samples that have been microdissected using laser-manipulated microdissection by means of a strong laser. These methods were performed using the Robot-Microbeam (P.A.L.M) and an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany) (17Schutze K. Lahr G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). By tracing around the glomeruli shown on the monitor, the targeted glomeruli were cut out by the laser. For laser pressure catapulating, the setting for the laser energy should be sufficiently high to catapult the microdissected glomeruli of the histologic specimen into the microcentrifuge cap, which was held in place by the micromanipulator. When the laser pressure catapulating was performed, the microdissected glomeruli “jumped up” and were attached to the cap. 60–80 glomeruli for each experiment were collected from this procedure. Glomeruli were obtained from those of control, iNOSTg, and iNOSTg-OPB mice at 24 weeks of age. Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was prepared from isolated glomeruli, and a cDNA synthesis was performed with reverse transcription. Real-time PCR was performed by using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primers for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for internal control. The primers for HSP47, type IV collagen, and TGF-β were as follows: HSP47 (forward primer, 5′-GCGAGATAATCAGAGCGGCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCACGCCCACTCTTGGACT-3′; and TaqMan Probe, 5′-CTTGCTCTTCATTGGCCGCCTGG-3′); type IV collagen (forward primer, 5′-GACCCCGAGGTTAGGAAGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CACTCGGTCCATGATCCCA-3′; and TaqMan Probe, 5′-ATCGAGCCGAGCCTAGAGCTGAAAGA-3′); and TGF-β (forward primer, 5′-AAGTCACCCGCGTGCTAATG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCCGAATGTCTGACGTATTGAA-3′; and TaqMan Probe, 5′-TGGACCGCAACAACGCAATCTATG-3′). The cleavage of the sequence-specific probe (TaqMan Probe) by 5′-nuclease activity of the TaqDNA polymerase releases the reporter dye, resulting in an emission increase. With each cycle, the fluorescence intensity of additional reporter dye molecules is monitored by the system. The threshold cycles were selected in the line in which all of the samples were in the logarithmic phase. The quantity of PCR products was calculated from the threshold cycle value. This real-time detection generates quantitative data based on PCR at early cycles when PCR fidelity is highest (18Fink L. Seeger W. Ermert L. Hanze J. Stahl U. Grimminger F. Kummer W. Bohle R.M. Nat.

The cells were passaged weekly with trypsin-EDTA. The cultured cells fulfilled the previously described criteria generally accepted for glomerular mesangial cells (20MacKay K. Striker L.J. Elliot S.

AGE content was measured by the fluorescence intensity at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Control BSA was prepared by incubating BSA without glucose 6-phosphate under the same conditions as those for AGE-BSA. AGE-BSA and control BSA contained 61.3 and 8.31 AGE units/mg protein, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using BSA as the standard. Mesangial cells were plated in the B medium, 20% fetal bovine serum at 5 × 105/well in six-well dishes, that had been coated with AGE-BSA or control BSA at 50 μg/cm2 for 72 h. After the treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). TGF-β-neutralizing Antibody Assay—The cells were resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and plated onto 100-mm dish either in the presence of 10 μg/ml TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems) or a control normal IgG (22Abe H.

After 24 h of incubation, the cells were harvested and underwent RNA isolation on real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Smad1 Morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotide—The antisense oligonucleotide for Smad1 was a 25-nucleotide morpholino oligomer (Genetools LLC) with the base composition of 5′-CAAGCTGGTCACATTCATAGCGGCT-3′. A standard morpholino oligomer with the base composition of 5′-CAtGCTcGTCACATTCAaAGCcGCT-3′ (points of mismatch are shown by small letters) was used as a control.

Western Blotting—Cultured mesangial cells were harvested in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, subjected to Western blot using a 1:500 dilution of antibody for HSP47, type IV collagen, and TGF-β (8Sunamoto M.

RNase Protection Assay—Total RNA was isolated from mesangial cells using the TRIzol reagent, and an RNase protection assay was performed as described previously (14Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N.

The RNA probes were prepared by linearizing the PvuII fragment of type IV collagen from p1234, the SacI fragment of Smad1 from pGEM-T, and the EcoRI fragment of GAPDH from pMGAP1. In addition, mouse riboprobe for HSP47 (5′-TCCTATACTGTGGGTGTTACGATGA-3′ and 5′-TACAACTCATCTCGCATCTTGTCTC-3′), c-fos (5′-TATCTCCTGAAGAGGAAGAGAAACG-3′ and 5′-AACAAGAAGTCATCAAAGGGTTCTG-3′), and TGF-β (5′-ATACCAACTATTGCTTCAGCTCCAC-3′ and 5′CACGTAGTAGACGATGGGCAGT-3′) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR fragments were sequenced to confirm to be cDNAs, respectively, and were cloned into a pGEM-T plasmid. After digesting the plasmid with SacI, an antisense riboprobe was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. The RNA probes and the test RNA were hybridized overnight at 45 °C. RNase A (40 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (2 μg/ml) were added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The RNase resistant fragments were analyzed by 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel electrophoresis. The protected bands for each RNA probe had the same size as the coding sequence for the specific mRNA. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) and Transfections—The siRNA sequence targeting c-fos (5′-CCAATCTGCTGAAGAGAAGGAAAA-3′) was purchased from Hokkaido Science (Sapporo, Japan). Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol in the presence of siRNA. siRNA against Luciferase GL2 (5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′) (Dharmacon) was used as a control. Blood Glucose, HbA1c, and AGE Concentration—Blood glucose levels of iNOSTg mice were >500 mg/dl (503 ± 19 mg/dl, n = 9), and OPB had no effect on this parameter (586 ± 74 mg/dl, n = 5). HbA1c levels were over 7% in iNOSTg mice (7.5 ± 0.8%), whereas that of controls was below the detection limit. Both serum levels of CML and non-CML AGEs were significantly higher in iNOSTg mice (7.3 ± 0.6 and 20.7 ± 2.5 units/ml, respectively) than controls (6.2 ± 0.4 and 12.6 ± 1.0 units/ml, respectively), whereas OPB treatment of iNOSTg mice led to a decrease to the control levels (4.3 ± 1.0 and 10.2 ± 2.6 units/ml, respectively). Response of Matrix Expansion to Treatment with OPB—The microscopic lesions in iNOSTg mice were observed as a diffuse proliferation of the mesangial matrix and the expansion of the mesangial area (Fig. 1). These lesions were ameliorated by treatment with OPB. OPB markedly improved the glomerulosclerosis of iNOSTg mice with no decrease in glomerular volume. No significant differences in glomerular cell number were detected among these groups (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Effects of OPB in diabetic glomerulosclerosis.

OPB treatment decreased this expression. Type IV collagen was expressed in both the glomerular basement membrane and the mesangium in control mice. Mesangial expression was increased in iNOSTg mice, which decreased after treatment with OPB. Immunofluorescent staining also revealed a remarkable increase in the expression of HSP47, which paralleled the expression of type I and type IV collagen and TGF-β in iNOSTg mice. These expressions were decreased as the result of OPB treatment (Figs. 3 and 4).Fig. 4Arbitrary scaling of expressions of HSP47, collagens, and TGF-β.

A remarkable increase in the expression of HSP47, type IV collagen, and TFG-β was seen in iNOSTg mice, and OPB treatment showed a significant decrease (Fig. 5). Stimulation by AGEs in Cultured Mesangial Cells—To confirm the mechanism, cultured mesangial cells were stimulated with AGEs. AGEs significantly increased both HSP47 and type IV collagen expressions. In addition, AGEs were found to enhance the expression of TGF-β in cultured mesangial cells (Fig. 6a). Similarly, the levels of both HSP47 and type IV collagen proteins increased in accordance with the elevation of TGF-β protein (Fig. 6b). Neutralizing antibody for TGF-β inhibited overexpression of both HSP47 and type IV collagen (Fig. 7, a and b).Fig. 7Inhibition of HSP47 and type IV collagen by TGF-β-neutralizing antibody. a, neutralizing antibody for TGF-β inhibited both HSP47 and type IV collagen mRNA expressions in cultured mesangial cells (number of experiments, 5; *, p < 0.05 versus Control (IgY)). b, Western blot analysis of HSP47 and type IV collagen protein expression in cultured mesangial cells treated with AGE in the presence of neutralizing antibody for TGF-β or control (IgY).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further elucidate the mechanism for AGE-mediated induction of TGF-β, we investigated the expression of c-fos in mesangial cells. We found that AGE treatment caused a significant increase of c-fos mRNA by RNase protection assay. The AGE-mediated induction of c-fos was completely abolished in the presence of the specific siRNA but not in the presence of control siRNA. Consistent with the inhibition of c-fos, the induction of TGF-β was strongly attenuated (Fig. 8). We next examined the involvement of Smad1 in TGF-β-mediated induction of HSP47 and type IV collagen expression. We transfected antisense morpholino oligomers to block Smad1-mediated effect in mesangial cells. Mesangial cells transfected with Smad1-antisense oligomers showed much less expression of HSP47 and type IV collagen transcripts after AGE stimulation than those with control oligomers (Fig. 9). This study shows that the collagen-specific chaperone protein, HSP47, is strongly expressed in glomerulosclerotic lesions in parallel with increased expression of collagens I and IV in diabetic nephropathy. The findings of the study also suggest that AGEs are a key factor in the synthesis of increased expression of both HSP47 and collagens in vitro and in vivo. Our in vitro study indicates that AGEs-mediated induction of HSP47 and collagens may be through TGF-β. Collagen is synthesized in the form of pro-α chains, and three pro-α chains form procollagen with a triple-helical structure in the endoplasmic reticulum. HSP47 is a collagen-binding stress protein and has been shown to be localized exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum. Procollagen polypeptides form a complex with HSP47 in the endoplasmic reticulum, which plays an important role as a collagen-specific molecular chaperone in the intracellular processing/folding of procollagen molecules (23Nagata K. Saga S. Yamada K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The crucial role of HSP47 in regulating biosynthesis of collagen molecules has been reported previously (25Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and transcriptional regulation for HSP47 expression was clarified (26Hirata H. Yamamura I. Yasuda K. Kobayashi A. Tada N.

However, its role in kidney diseases in relation to sclerosis/fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy and IgA nephropathy is completely unknown. We and others (8Sunamoto M. Kuze K. Iehara N. Takeoka H. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Razzaque M.S. Kumatori A. Harada T. Taguchi T. Nephron. 1998; 80: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that HSP47 in glomerulosclerosis is associated with collagen staining. Furthermore, the blocking of HSP47 with antisense oligonucleotides caused a dramatic amelioration of glomerular lesions in the rat glomerulonephritis model (9Sunamoto M. Kuze K. Tsuji H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Lab. Investig. 1998; 78: 967-972PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that HSP47 is a key factor in the development of various glomerular injuries. In this study, a close relationship of HSP47 to glomerulosclerosis in diabetic nephropathy was found. The blocking of AGEs formation inhibited the overreproduction of HSP47 and collagens, thereby suppressing the gene expression of type IV collagen, extracellular matrix accumulation, and glomerulosclerosis in diabetic nephropathy in vivo. AGEs also increased mRNA expression of both HSP47 and type IV collagen in vitro. Thus, our study implicates that AGEs are a key factor in the synthesis of both HSP47 and collagens in diabetic nephropathy in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism of these processes remains unclarified, but we demonstrated that AGEs stimulate several novel transcription factors in gene expression for glomerulosclerosis (5Iehara N. Takeoka H. Yamada Y. Kita T. Doi T. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1166-1172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that Smad1 transcriptionally regulates of type IV collagen under AGE stimulation (14Abe H. Matsubara T. Iehara N. Nagai K. Takahashi T. Arai H. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14201-14206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here, we also observed that the expression of HSP47 was regulated by Smad1 under AGE exposure. Yamamura et al. (29Yamamura I. Hirata H. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) has reported that TGF-β transcriptionally activates HSP47 gene expression. Thus, Smad1 may partially participate in the TGF-β-mediated up-regulation of HSP47. It has been shown that TGF-β stimulates the production of extracellular matrix components including collagens and fibronectin and that it plays a key role in glomerulosclerosis (12Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). TGF-β regulates the expression of the collagen genes and their transcriptional activities. In particular, the promoter analysis of the collagen genes revealed that TGF-β1 regulates the transcription of collagen genes via several cis-elements of their promoters (13Weigert C. Brodbeck K. Bierhaus A. Haring H.U. Schleicher E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TGF-β also increases HSP47 gene expression in other cell types (29Yamamura I. Hirata H. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We first demonstrated that TGF-β stimulates not only collagen but also HSP47 in mesangial cells. In addition, we showed that c-Fos participates in the induction of TGF-β under AGE exposure. These data suggest that TGF-β and its signaling pathway are important targets for treating diabetic nephropathy. Most experimental models of diabetic nephropathy are different from human pathological lesions (10Doi T. Hattori M. Agodoa L.Y. Sato T. Yoshida H. Striker L.J. Striker G.E. Lab. Investig. 1990; 63: 204-212PubMed Google Scholar, 30Velasquez M.T. Kimmel P.L. Michaelis IV, O.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2850-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the iNOSTg mice showed remarkably advanced glomerular lesions that resemble human diabetic glomerulosclerosis. From the analysis of this model, we confirmed that glomerular hypertrophy is important in the development of diabetic nephropathy because the iNOSTg mice showed glomerular hypertrophy in association with typical glomerulosclerosis. However, the intervention of AGE formation showed a decreased level of glomerulosclerosis with no evidence for diminished glomerular hypertrophy. The mechanism for this is unclear, but the regulation of HSP47 and collagens seemed to be independent of the control of glomerular hemodynamics. Further investigation will be needed to clarify the mechanism of these findings."

Here we extend the repertoire of another chimeric pro-apoptotic protein immunoGrB, which comprises an anti-HER2 single-chain antibody, a Pseudomonas exotoxin A translocation domain and active granzyme B. Human lymphoma Jurkat cells transfected with the immunoGrB gene expression vector were able to produce and secrete the chimeric protein. The immunoGrB molecule selectively recognized and destroyed HER2-overexpressing tumor cells both in vitro and in nude mouse after intramuscular injection of the immunoGrB expression plasmid. Further in vivo study showed that intravenous administration of immunoGrB gene-modified lymphocytes led to suppression of HER2-overexpressing tumor growth and prolonged animal survival because of continuous secretion of immunoGrB molecules into blood and lymph fluid. These results demonstrate that the chimeric immunoGrB molecule, which is capable of antibody-directed targeting and granzyme B-mediated killing, has therapeutic potential against HER2 tumors, especially in cases in which caspase-dependent apoptosis is inhibited.

Our previous studies exploited the in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity of immunotoxins by generating a new class of antigen-specific killer cells (18Chen S.Y. Yang A.G. Chen J.D. Kute T. King C.R.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but this approach may well be limited in its clinical applications because of antigenicity of heterogeneous toxin protein. Hence, our attention turned to human endogenous proteins, especially those acting as executioners during apoptosis, which in principle should be optimal candidates for triggering the death of tumor cells in an intrinsic physiological manner. Granzymes are a family of granular serine proteinases produced by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, with a triad of key residues, histidine, aspartate, and serine, conserved at the catalytic site (20Trapani J.A. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (REVIEWS3014): 1-7Crossref Google Scholar, 21Edwards K.M. Davis J.E. Browne K.A. Sutton V.R. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 76-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One member of the family, granzyme B (GrB), 1The abbreviations used are: GrB, granzyme B; GrBa, active GrB; mGrB, mutant GrB; PE, Pseudomonas exotoxin A; PE II-GrBa, a fusion protein comprising PE aa 280-364 (or 358) and GrBa; PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; aa, amino acids; MTT, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. plays an essential role in granule-mediated killing. GrB is originally synthesized as zymogen and activated by removal of the amino-terminal signal peptide and an acidic dipeptide after lymphocyte receptor recognition (21Edwards K.M. Davis J.E. Browne K.A. Sutton V.R. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 76-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The active GrB (GrBa) is then released from leukocyte granules by exocytosis, entering target cells to cause extensive proteolysis at specific amino acid residues (22Pinkoski M.J. Hobman M.

GrB-mediated apoptosis involves the caspase-dependent pathway, direct nuclear entry, and caspase-independent pathways (24Andrade F. Roy S. Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L.

The potential of GrB therapy to induce multiple apoptotic pathways makes this approach to tumor cell killing especially attractive. In our most recent previous study, chimeric immunocasp-3 protein was shown to have a potent selective antitumor effect both in vitro and in vivo (29Jia L.T. Zhang L.H. Yu C.J. Zhao J. Xu Y.M.

This result led us to another targeted pro-apoptotic fusion protein, designated immunoGrB, which consisted of a single-chain anti-HER2 antibody, e23sFv (30Pelegrin M. Marin M. Noel D. Piechaczyk M.

Davis J.E. Browne K.A. Sutton V.R. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 76-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The recombinant immunoGrB molecule was predicted to bind to tumor cells overexpressing HER2 and be internalized, such that endosomal cleavage would give rise to the active granzyme B domain that would consequently translocate into the cytosol to induce tumor cell death (18Chen S.Y. Yang A.G. Chen J.D. Kute T. King C.R. Collier J. Cong Y. Yao C. Huang X.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Yang A.G. Chen S.Y. Nat.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3257-3262PubMed Google Scholar). Here we evaluate the antitumor activity of immunoGrB and immunoGrB-secreting lymphocytes in both in vitro and in vivo models. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The human GrB gene was obtained by reverse-transcription PCR from total RNA derived from healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following stimulation with 15 μgml-1 phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) for 72 h using a Superscript kit (Invitrogen). A mutant GrB (mGrB) gene, in which a serine codon of a catalytic triad coding sequence was replaced with a cysteine codon (S183C), was generated by two-step overlapping PCR (36Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). GrBa (active GrB) and mGrBa (mutant active GrB) genes were amplified by PCR and fused in-frame at the 5′-end with part of the PE domain II sequence encoding amino acids (aa) 280-364 or aa 280-358. The resulting PE II-GrBa fusion genes were cloned into pcDNA3 (Clontech), pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), and pIND (Invitrogen), respectively. Then, the immunotoxin expression vector pCMV-e23sFv-PE40 (18Chen S.Y. Yang A.G. Chen J.D. Kute T. King C.R. Collier J. Cong Y. Yao C. Huang X.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in which a signal peptide-coding sequence was located upstream of the e23sFv-PE40 fusion gene, was used to generate the expression vector pCMV-e23sFv-PE II-GrBa (pCMV-immunoGrB). The fusion genes encoding PE domain II (aa 253-364 or aa 253-358) and GrBa (or mGrBa) were constructed by overlapping PCR and substituted for PE40 coding sequence in pCMV-e23sFv-PE40, yielding pCMV-immunoGrB. To generate the pLNCX-immunoGrB retroviral vector, we inserted the immunoGrB gene with the leader signal sequence into the pLNCX-e23sFv-PE40 vector (18Chen S.Y. Yang A.G. Chen J.D. Kute T. King C.R. Collier J. Cong Y. Yao C. Huang X.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with the cytomegalovirus promoter and the neomycin resistance gene. All constructed vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The detailed procedure for construction of the vectors will be provided upon request. Mammalian Cell Culture, Transfection, and Retroviral Gene Transfer—Human breast tumor cell line SKBR-3, human ovarian tumor cell line SKOV-3, human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa, African green monkey kidney cell line COS-7, human umbilical vein endothelial cell line ECV-304, and human lymphoma cell line Jurkat were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 24 h before transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates with a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. Transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the standard procedure. For transient expression, cells were harvested 72 h after transfection unless stated otherwise. In the case of stable transfection, cells were selected in medium containing G418 (Invitrogen, 500 μg ml-1 for HeLa cells and 800 μg ml-1 for Jurkat cells) and zeocin (Invitrogen, 800 μg ml-1 for HeLa cells) for 2-3 weeks. Established HeLa cells were induced by ponasterone A (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain retrovirus carrying the immunoGrB gene, we transfected the pLNCX-immunoGrB retroviral vector into the PA317 amphotropic packaging cell line followed by 600 μgml-1 G418 selection over 2 weeks. The virus-containing supernatants were collected from confluent cell monolayers, passed through a 0.22-μm pore size filter, and stored at -70 °C. Titers were determined on mouse fibroblast cells NIH3T3 selected in G418 (500 μg ml-1), and high producer clones (5 × 104 colony-forming units ml-1) were chosen for additional study. Forty-eight hours after stimulation with 1 μg ml-1 plate-bound anti-CD3 (Pharmingen) in medium supplemented with 20 units ml-1 interleukin 2 (IL-2) (Sigma) and 15 μg ml-1 phytohemagglutinin (Sigma), PBMCs from healthy individuals were infected with retrovirus supernatant in the presence of Polybrene (8 μgml-1, Sigma) by spin infection at 1000 × g for 90 min. Then, the infected PBMCs were selected in 300 μg ml-1 G418 for 1 week and expanded in the culture medium. Immunocytochemical and Histological Analyses—Cells on coverslips were transfected with DNA and stained 72 h after transfection. The samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 2% normal rabbit serum in PBS, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a mixture of goat anti-GrB polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:200 dilution and mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) at a 1:100 dilution. Cells were extensively washed with PBS and incubated in biotin-labeled anti-goat secondary antibody (Sigma) at 1:100 dilution for 2 h at room temperature followed by further rinsing and incubation in a mixture of Cy3-conjugated avidin-biotin complex (Sigma) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) at 1:100 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Then, cells were washed and mounted on slides. For immunohistochemical staining, the paraffin sections were dewaxed, hydrated, and incubated in methanol-H2O2 for 20 min to remove endogenous peroxidase. Tissue sections were then stained with the GrB antibody according to the immunohistochemical horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin-biotin complex procedure described above. Cell Viability Assay—For the MTT assay, transfected HeLa cells were plated in 96-well dishes at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well. The samples were triplicated and incubated for the indicated times. Aliquots of 20 μl of 5 mg ml-1 MTT (Sigma) in PBS were added to each well, and the cells were incubated for another 4 h followed by the addition of 150 μl of Me2SO. The A490 values were assayed in a Sunrise microplate reader (Tecan, Groedig, Austria). Cells were placed into 24-well plates (3 × 104/well) and counted at the indicated times. Viable cells were identified by trypan blue exclusion, and the mean of three parallel samples was calculated. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Following induction with ponasterone A (Invitrogen), transfected HeLa cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Recombinant PE II-GrBa proteins were immunoprecipitated by goat anti-GrB polyclonal antibody, and endogenous DFF45 proteins were immunoprecipitated by goat anti-DFF45 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) and, after extensive washes, boiled from the beads and subjected to Western blotting. Samples were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated with goat anti-GrB or anti-DFF45 antibody followed by immunohistochemical horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin-biotin complex analysis. Detection was performed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). GrB Activity Assay—The following procedures were done on ice unless stated otherwise. The lysates of transfected HeLa cells were triplicated in 96-well plates. A stock solution of Ac-IETD-pNA (Calbiochem) in Me2SO, a synthetic peptide substrate of GrB, was used at a final concentration of 0.2 mm in the buffer (0.2 m HEPES, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.0). After incubation for 5 min at 27 °C, substrate hydrolysis was measured by colorimetric absorbance changes at 405 nm. Cytotoxicity Assay in Vitro—Transwell filters (Costar), 12-mm diameter, 0.40-μm pore size, which separate the cells but not large molecules, were used for cocultivation assay. Tumor cells overexpressing HER2 (SKBR-3 and SKOV-3) and control cells expressing undetectable HER2 (HeLa and ECV-304) were placed at the bottom chamber, and the transfected Jurkat cells were placed at the top chamber at different ratios. Viable cells at the bottom chambers were counted by trypan blue exclusion at the indicated times after cocultivation. The percentages of cell killing were determined as follows: (1 - the number of cells cocultured with Jurkat-immunoGrB/the number of cells cocultured with Jurkat controls) × 100%. In Vivo Antitumor Activity of ImmunoGrB—SKBR-3 tumor cells (1 × 106) were injected subcutaneously into the right hind flank of athymic mice (4-6 weeks old). When palpable tumors (normally 75-150 mm3) arose within 16-21 days, mice were randomized to treatment and control groups. Two groups of eight mice each were injected intramuscularly in the right hind limb with 10 μg of LipofectAMINE-encapsulated pCMV-immunoGrB or empty pCMV vector every 3 days for 3 weeks. Two groups (five mice each) were intravenously administered pCMV-immunoGrB-transfected or pCMV-transfected Jurkat cells (5 × 106) weekly for 3 weeks. Another two groups (six mice each) received weekly intravenous injections of 5 × 106 immunoGrB-transduced or mock-transduced PBMCs for 3 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored by caliper-measuring two perpendicular tumor diameters every 3 days, and the volume of the tumor was calculated from the formula: tumor volume = (width)2 × length/2 (37Osborne C.K. Hobbs K. Clark G.M. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 584-590PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and various tissues were removed to prepare paraffin sections for histological staining. Ectopic Expression of GrBa Contributes to Effective Cell Death—Extensive studies have shown that purified natural or recombinant GrB protein or GrB-expressing cytotoxic T lymphocytes will induce target cells to initiate an internal suicide program via the well characterized granule exocytosis mechanism (21Edwards K.M. Davis J.E. Browne K.A. Sutton V.R. Trapani J.A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 76-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic activity of GrBa in the absence of perforin was further demonstrated by microinjection of GrBa protein into the cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells (22Pinkoski M.J. Hobman M. Heibein J.A. Tomaselli K. Li F. Seth P. Froelich C.J. Bleackley R.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1044-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether the same cytotoxic effect could be achieved in mammalian cells by self-expressed GrBa protein in the cytoplasm, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with GrBa expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 1A, in contrast to the mock transfectants, transient expression of the GrBa gene led to apparent cell death at 12 h after transfection, and enhanced cell death was observed at a prolonged time. In addition, about 5% of the GrBa transfectants appeared as a volume extension, often with multiple nuclei (Fig. 1B), which suggested some cytoskeletal changes caused by GrBa (27Browne K.A. Johnstone R.W. Jans D.A. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39262-39266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As assayed by immunofluorescent staining with an anti-α-tubulin antibody, GrBa-expressing giant cells displayed abnormal cytoskeleton with evidence of leakage of nuclear materials into the cytoplasm as well as multiple spindle poles (Fig. 1B). Abnormal mitotic poles indicated the arrest of normal mitosis (38Coopman P.J. Do M.T. Barth M. Bowden E.T. Hayes A.J. Basyuk E. Blancato J.K. Vezza P.R. McLeskey S.W. Mangeat P.H. Mueller S.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), which possibly contributed to the multilobed or multiple nuclei appearance of the giant cells. Moreover, the GrBa-transfected HeLa cells proliferated much slower than the non-transfectants and the mock transfectants (Fig. 1C). We conclude that the ectopic expression of GrBa causes cell death via apoptosis induction and division inhibition. Cytotoxicity of PE II-GrBa Fusion Proteins Similar to GrBa—The data presented above suggest that the introduction of an exogenous GrBa gene into tumor cells may result in cell death. The immunoGrB antitumor strategy requires activation of immunoGrB after binding and internalization to tumor cells. Such activation could be achieved by endosomal cleavage at Arg279 of the PE translocation domain, releasing into the cytosol a carboxyl-terminal fragment, PE II-GrBa, containing part of PE domain II (aa 280-364 or aa 280-358) and GrBa (33Prior T.I. FitzGerald D.J. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3555-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Kreitman R.J. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2001; 2: 1282-1293PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we constructed PE II-GrBa fusion protein genes in which a sequence encoding aa 280-364 or aa 280-358 of PE was included (Fig. 2A) and investigated their effects on transfected cells. Transient expression of PE II-GrBa fusion genes in HeLa cell line (Fig. 2B) and several other mammalian cell lines (data not shown) gave rise to impressive cell death, similar to that seen with GrBa. Electronic microscopy applied to PE II-GrBa transfectants demonstrated about 13% apoptotic cells (Fig. 2C, panel 1), over 25% cells characteristic of secondary necrosis (Fig. 2C, panel 2), and about 6% giant cells with multilobed or multiple nuclei (Fig. 2C, panel 3). To exclude the possibility that the effects were due to overexpression of exogenous genes, we established HeLa cells inducibly expressing PE II-GrBa fusion proteins. The expression of PE II-GrBa resulted in the cleavage of endogenous DFF45, a substrate of GrBa (28Thomas D.A. Du C. Xu M. Wang X. Ley T.J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 621-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), producing a 28-kDa proteolytic product, which is not found in the mutants in which catalytic Ser183 was replaced with a cysteine (Fig. 2D). Likewise, comparable 20-30-fold increases of GrB activity on Ac-IETD-pNA were detected in HeLa-PE II-GrBa cells after ponasterone A induction but not in cells expressing the inactivated mutants (Fig. 2D). In contrast to pIND-transfected and mutant-transfected cells, ponasterone A induction inhibited the growth of HeLa cells transfected with PE II-GrBa, and expression of the fusion protein containing PE aa 280-358 caused stronger growth inhibition (Fig. 2E). Cell cycle analysis demonstrated the decrease of G2 phase cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that NH2-terminal PE-derived peptide does not abrogate the activity of GrBa; hence, the PE II-GrBa fusion proteins maintain a cytotoxic effect on the cells that express them. Selective Killing of Tumor Cells Overexpressing HER2 by ImmunoGrB Gene-modified Jurkat Cells—To induce specific tumoricidal effects, we fused the gene of an anti-HER2 single-chain antibody (e23sFv) in-frame to the 5′-end of the fusion genes encoding PE domain II (aa 253-364 or aa 253-358) and GrBa or mGrBa, forming immunoGrB molecules with an NH2-terminal signal peptide sequence (18Chen S.Y. Yang A.G. Chen J.D. Kute T. King C.R. Collier J. Cong Y. Yao C. Huang X.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Jia L.T. Zhang L.H. Yu C.J. Zhao J. Xu Y.M. Gui J.H. Jin M. Ji Z.L. Wen W.H. Wang C.J. Chen S.Y. Yang A.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3257-3262PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Tumor-specific killer cells were generated by transfecting pCMV-immunoGrB into a CD4+ Jurkat cell line followed by G418 selection. The immunoGrB transcripts were identified in the G418-resistant cells by reverse transcription-PCR using a pair of primers that amplified the truncated PE II-GrBa fragments of about 500 bp, and the presence of the secreted immunoGrB proteins was confirmed in the culture medium by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). The immunoGrB gene-modified Jurkat cells showed normal proliferation rates and viability as compared with parental Jurkat cells (data not shown). We next evaluated the cytotoxicity of the immunoGrB-secreting lymphocytes toward tumor cells in vitro, first determining which of the immunoGrB molecules containing different PE II sequences exerted the more powerful killing activity. This assessment was made by cocultivating HER2-overexpressing SKBR-3 cells with various Jurkat-immunoGrB cell lines. As shown in Fig. 3C, Jurkat-e23sFv-PE II253-358-GrB killed the largest number of tumor cells, and its killing activity was enhanced by prolonged incubation, leading us to choose this line of modified cells for additional studies. To determine the specificity of cytotoxicity, the genetically altered Jurkat cells were cocultivated with SKBR-3 and SKOV-3 cells overexpressing HER2 or with HeLa and ECV-304 cells with undetectable HER2 expression (29Jia L.T. Zhang L.H. Yu C.J. Zhao J. Xu Y.M. Gui J.H. Jin M. Ji Z.L. Wen W.H. Wang C.J. Chen S.Y. Yang A.G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3257-3262PubMed Google Scholar). Significant killing of both HER2-overexpressing cell lines by Jurkat-e23sFv-PE II253-358-GrB was observed, especially SKBR-3 cells, which express higher levels of HER2, whereas neither HeLa nor ECV-304 cells were killed by this cell line (Fig. 3C). An increased ratio of Jurkat to target cells resulted in enhanced killing of cells overexpressing HER2 (Fig. 3C). Thus, immunoGrB molecules secreted by lymphocytes are capable of recognizing and destroying HER2-overexpressing tumor cells but not normal cells or tumor cells lacking HER2 expression. Growth Inhibition of HER2-overexpressing Tumors in Nude Mice—The in vivo antitumor activity of immunoGrB was also tested in nude mouse models. When palpable tumors arose in mice injected subcutaneously with SKBR-3 cells, the mice received seven doses of 10 μg of LipofectAMINE-encapsulated pCMV-immunoGrB intramuscularly every 3 days in the right posterior limb or three weekly intravenous injections of 5 × 106 Jurkat-immunoGrB or PBMCs-immunoGrB cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, injection with immunoGrB-expressing plasmid led to 53.7% inhibition of SKBR-3 tumor growth after a 3-week treatment, as compared with 63.3% inhibition in the mice injected with immunoGrB gene-modified Jurkat cells. The mice receiving intravenous injections of immunoGrB gene-transduced PBMCs survived longer than those intramuscularly injected with pCMV-immunoGrB (Fig. 4B). This result indicated that although immunoGrB molecules could be produced and secreted in vivo by modified muscle cells (Fig. 4C), the engineered lymphocytes exhibited higher antitumor activity presumably because of a sustained secretion of targeted killer protein and their diffusion through blood and lymph fluid. We next studied the in vivo distribution of immunoGrB in the mice that received genetically modified Jurkat cells. Immunohistochemical analysis with a GrB antibody demonstrated efficient local accumulation of immunoGrB molecules at a variety of tumor sites containing dying cells. There was n"

The very long- and long-chain acyl-CoAs are mainly chain-shortened and then transported to mitochondria for further metabolism. We have now identified and characterized two peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterases, named PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic, that hydrolyze acyl-CoAs to the free fatty acid and coenzyme A. PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic show 82% sequence identity at the amino acid level, and a putative peroxisomal type 1 targeting signal of -AKL was identified at the carboxyl-terminal end of both proteins. Localization experiments using green fluorescent fusion protein showed PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic to be localized in peroxisomes. Despite their high level of sequence identity, we show that PTE-Ia is mainly active on long-chain acyl-CoAs, whereas PTE-Ic is mainly active on medium-chain acyl-CoAs. Lack of regulation of enzyme activity by free CoASH suggests that PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic regulate intraperoxisomal levels of acyl-CoA, and they may have a function in termination of β-oxidation of fatty acids of different chain lengths. Tissue expression studies revealed that PTE-Ia is highly expressed in kidney, whereas PTE-Ic is most highly expressed in spleen, brain, testis, and proximal and distal intestine. Both PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic were highly up-regulated in mouse liver by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 and by fasting in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-dependent manner. These data show that PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic have different functions based on different substrate specificities and tissue expression.

PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic show 82% sequence identity at the amino acid level, and a putative peroxisomal type 1 targeting signal of -AKL was identified at the carboxyl-terminal end of both proteins. Localization experiments using green fluorescent fusion protein showed PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic to be localized in peroxisomes. Despite their high level of sequence identity, we show that PTE-Ia is mainly active on long-chain acyl-CoAs, whereas PTE-Ic is mainly active on medium-chain acyl-CoAs. Lack of regulation of enzyme activity by free CoASH suggests that PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic regulate intraperoxisomal levels of acyl-CoA, and they may have a function in termination of β-oxidation of fatty acids of different chain lengths. Tissue expression studies revealed that PTE-Ia is highly expressed in kidney, whereas PTE-Ic is most highly expressed in spleen, brain, testis, and proximal and distal intestine. Both PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic were highly up-regulated in mouse liver by treatment with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 and by fasting in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-dependent manner. These data show that PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic have different functions based on different substrate specificities and tissue expression. Peroxisomes are organelles present in most eukaryotic cells and play a key role in the metabolism of a variety of lipids such as very long-chain fatty acids, dicarboxylic fatty acids, bile acids, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, pristanic acid, and xenobiotic fatty acids and in the biosynthesis of ether-linked glycerolipids such as plasmalogens and structural ether lipids abundant in the central nervous system (for reviews, see Refs. 1Reddy J.K.

Peroxisomal β-oxidation of very long- and long-chain CoA esters results in chain shortening of fatty acids, which may then be transported to the mitochondria as carnitine esters for further oxidation. β-Oxidation of other types of lipids such as prostanoids leads to chain shortening in the peroxisome for excretion as free carboxylic acids in the urine (3Diczfalusy U. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. Björkhem I. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Almost 30 years ago a group of compounds was identified that were shown to cause peroxisome proliferation in rodents; hence they were named peroxisome proliferators. Peroxisome proliferators are a structurally diverse group of compounds including plasticizers, hypolipidemic drugs (for example, clofibrate), and WY-14,643. Peroxisome proliferators induce the expression of several genes involved in degradation of fatty acids and cause peroxisome proliferation, hepatomegaly, and hepatocarcinogenesis in rodent liver (4Nemali M.B.

PPARα induces the expression of many genes involved in peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation and ω-oxidation of fatty acids, and targeted disruption of this receptor in mouse has established its key role as a mediator of lipid metabolism (6Lee S.S.

One group of enzymes previously identified as responsive to treatment by peroxisome proliferators was the acyl-CoA thioesterases (for review, see Ref. 15Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 41: 99-130Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These enzymes are found in various compartments in the cell, including cytosol, mitochondria, microsomes, and peroxisomes. Acyl-CoA thioesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to the free fatty acid and coenzyme A, thereby regulating intracellular content of various acyl-CoAs, free fatty acids, and free CoASH. The acyl-CoA thioesterase activity in peroxisomes was characterized and activity was identified with acyl-CoA esters from C2- to C20-CoA, with highest activity detected for medium- and long-chain acyl-CoAs (16Wilcke M. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since then, several peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterases have been cloned and characterized. A family of acyl-CoA thioesterases was identified in mouse, named Type-I acyl-CoA thioesterases, which at the time was shown to contain four highly homologous genes: two peroxisomal (PTE-Ia and -Ib), one mitochondrial (MTE-I), and one cytosolic (CTE-I), all of which are located in a cluster on mouse chromosome 12 (17Hunt M.C.

In human, four Type-I acyl-CoA thioesterases have been identified, with putative localizations in cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes (17Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E.B. Huttunen M.K. Orii K.

Another peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase called PTE-2, which is unrelated to the Type-I gene family above, was identified as the major acyl-CoA thioesterase in mouse liver peroxisomes (19Hunt M.C.

This is a broad range acyl-CoA thioesterase that hydrolyzes almost all acyl-CoAs present in peroxisomes, including bile acid-CoA esters, short-, medium-, and long-chain acyl-CoAs and intermediates from β-oxidation of pristanoyl-CoA. It is hypothesized that this enzyme is important in regulating intracellular levels of acyl-CoAs and CoASH during times of high β-oxidation and fatty acid overload. In this study, we have cloned and characterized PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic, the latter of which is a newly identified member of the Type-I family of acyl-CoA thioesterases. Both these enzymes are peroxisomal, are highly homologous (>80% sequence identity at amino acid level), and hydrolyze long- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs, respectively. These enzymes may play a role in controlling acyl-CoA levels within the peroxisome in different tissues. Chemicals—All commercially available acyl-CoAs used in this study were from Sigma. Behenoyl-CoA, lignoceryl-CoA, cerotoyl-CoA, and dimethylnonanoyl-CoA were kind gifts from Dr. Ronald Wanders. Animals and Treatments—All tissues used in this study were excised from adult male wild-type and PPARα-null mice on a pure Sv/129 genetic background (kindly provided by Dr. Frank Gonzalez and Dr. Jeffrey Peters). The mice were fed a standard chow diet (R36; Lactamin, Vadstena, Sweden) or alternatively fed a diet containing 0.1% WY-14,643 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem International) or fasted for 24 h. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation; tissues were excised and stored at –70 °C for preparation of total RNA. cDNA Cloning and Expression—The putative open reading frames for PTE-Ia (17Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E.B. Huttunen M.K. Orii K. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34317-34326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and PTE-Ic were derived from genomic data bases and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the mouse EST data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), respectively, and were amplified using the following primers: for PTE-Ia, 5′-CATATGATGTTTTCTGTATAATCACTCC-3′ and 5′-CATATGCACGCATTTACCAC-3′ (which amplifies a splice variant named PTE-Ia 5′:1, see below), and for PTE-Ic using 5′-CATATGTGTCACTACTCAAAGAAAATCAT-3′ and 5′-CATATGGTGCCAACAGTAAGCCT-3′ (Cybergene AB, Huddinge, Sweden) with the addition of an NdeI site (indicated in bold). The full-length open reading frames were amplified by reversed transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) using a template of WY-treated mouse liver total RNA. RT-PCR was performed using the One-Step RNA PCR kit (avian myeloblastosis virus) (Takara Biomedicals). Thermal cycling for PTE-Ia was performed for 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2.5 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. For PTE-Ic, an annealing temperature of 55 °C, 4 min extension and 35 cycles was used. The open reading frames were cloned into the NdeI site of the pET-16b plasmid (Novagen Inc.) and fully sequenced. For expression of PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic in BL21(DES3)pLysS cells, bacteria were cultured in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C until an A600nm of about 0.6 was reached. Induction of protein expression for PTE-Ia was performed by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG), and growth was continued for 3 h. PTE-Ic was induced with 0.2 mm IPTG, and growth was continued for 15 h at 18 °C. The bacteria were collected and frozen at –20 °C. Bacterial pellets for PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic were thawed and resuspended in BugBuster™ protein extraction reagent (Novagen Inc.) with the addition of Benzonase (Novagen Inc.), incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then used for purification on a Hi-Trap™ column (Amersham Biosciences). Following equilibration of the column, the supernatant was applied, and the column was washed stepwise with 50, 100, 200, and 300 mm imidazole in 20 mm phosphate, 0.1 m sodium chloride to remove contaminating proteins. The PTE-Ia protein was eluted in the 500-mm imidazole fraction and PTE-Ic in the 300-mm imidazole fraction. These fractions were subsequently used for acyl-CoA thioesterase activity measurements. Determination of Acyl-CoA Thioesterase Activity—Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm with 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (19Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because PTE-Ia thioesterase activity was inhibited at substrate concentrations higher than 5–10 μm with acyl-CoAs between C14-C20, bovine serum albumin was added at a molar ratio of bovine serum albumin/acyl-CoA of 1:4.5. Enzyme activities were measured in three different recombinant protein preparations of PTE-Ia and in two different recombinant protein preparations of PTE-Ic. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211906) Google Scholar). The effect of CoASH on the enzyme activity was measured at 232 nm in phosphate-buffered saline. The enzyme kinetics were calculated using the Sigma plot enzyme kinetics program. Expression of PTE-Ia 5′-Splice Variants—Because analysis of mouse ESTs indicated the existence of two different 5′-splice variants for PTE-Ia, these were examined in liver and kidney under normal conditions and during fasting using RT-PCR. The two splice variants were amplified using the following primers: PTE-Ia 5′:1, 5′-GACTTTTGTAGCGGTATCTT-3′ (located at position 539–559 of cDNA sequence for 5′:1 submitted to GenBank™), and PTE-Ia 5′:2, 5′-TTAGCTCTTGACCTTGTCTGTCTGC-3′ (located at position 11–35 of cDNA sequence for 5′:2 submitted to GenBank™), together with a common primer 5′-CAGGTGGATAATGTCCATGTCCTTA-3′ (located at position 1383–1407 of cDNA for 5′:1 and 640–664 of cDNA for 5′:2). The 5′:1 splice variant was amplified by RT-PCR using an annealing temperature of 53 °C for 1 min and 35 cycles, whereas for the 5′:2 splice variant, 57 °C for 35 cycles was used. Localization of PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic Using Green Fluorescent Fusion Protein and Cell Transfection Experiments—To examine targeting of the proteins, oligonucleotides were designed based on the sequence of the open reading frames of PTE-Ia (5′:1) and PTE-Ic for cloning as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein (GFP). The open reading frames of PTE-Ia (5′:1) and PTE-Ic were amplified by RT-PCR, using the same primers used for cloning into the pET16b plasmid. Both PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the GFP at the amino-terminal end. Sequence analysis was performed on the cloned products. In addition, two carboxyl-terminal GFP constructs, one full-length construct, and one construct lacking the first 11 amino acids of PTE-Ia were cloned. These constructs were amplified using the following primers, 5′-AGGATGCACGCATTTACCAC-3′ (5′:1), 5′-AGGATGGCACCTACTGTGAT-3′ (5′:2), and 5′-GTTTTGCTGGGATTGTCT-3′ (common primer) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP vector (Invitrogen) as described above. Human skin fibroblasts from a control subject and a Zellweger patient were grown as described previously (19Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Both control and Zellweger cells were grown overnight in 60-mm dishes on glass coverslips and were transfected with 10 μg of PTE-Ia/GFP or PTE-Ic/GFP plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. Transfected cells were grown for 48 h, and cells were fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy as described in Ref. 19Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar. The cells were examined in a Leica DM IRBE fluorescence microscope using Hamamatsu C4742–95 Twain interface software. Tissue Expression and Regulation by WY-14,643 and Fasting by RT-PCR—The tissue expression of PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic was examined in liver, kidney, heart, lung, adrenal, spleen, testis, muscle, brain, brown adipose tissue, white adipose tissue, proximal intestine, distal intestine, and gallbladder. The regulation by WY-14,643 was investigated in WY-treated livers from wild-type (+/+) and PPARα-null (–/–) mice. Regulation by fasting was examined in liver, kidney, and heart from wild-type and PPARα-null mice. PTE-Ia was amplified using the following primers: 5′-TGGATGGCAAAAAGAAGACA-3′ and 5′-GGGTGCCCAAGGAGGTCA-3′ (representing a fragment of 505 bp from 2021–2525 of the 5′:1 cDNA sequence submitted to GenBank™, which will amplify both variants 5′:1 and 5′2 of PTE-Ia), and PTE-Ic using 5′-TAATCAATGGCGCCACGGTCAA-3′ and 5′-CCAGCTATGTCACTACTCAAAGAA-3′ (representing a 534-bp fragment from 900–1434 of the cDNA sequence). RT-PCR for PTE-Ia was performed for 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. For PTE-Ic, an annealing temperature of 54 °C and extension time of 2 min was used. A fragment of β-actin was amplified as a control using the following primers, 5′-ATGGATGACGATATCGCTGCGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GGTCATCTTTTCACGGTTGGCCTTAGGGT-3′. Thermal cycling was performed for 28 cycles with an annealing temperature of 65 °C and extension of 30 s. Western Blot Analysis of Tissue Expression and Regulation by WY-14,643 and Fasting—Tissue expression of PTE-Ia at protein level was examined in muscle, heart, lung, brown adipose tissue, brain, liver, and kidney from Sv/129 male mice. The regulation of expression by WY-14,643 and fasting was investigated in wild-type and PPARα-null mice. Tissue pieces (about 0.1 g in 200 μl of buffer) were homogenized in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Fifty micrograms of protein was analyzed by Western blot as described (14Hunt M.C. Lindquist P.J.G. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Diczfalusy U. Alexson S.E.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 814-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using an anti-rabbit PTE-Ia antibody (Sigma Genosys) generated against the first 15 amino acids of the protein, resulting in an antibody that specifically recognizes the long variant of PTE-Ia (5′:1). cDNA Cloning and Sequence Analysis—We previously identified and cloned a novel gene family of four Type-I acyl-CoA thioesterases with members identified in cytosol (CTE-I), mitochondria (MTE-I), and peroxisomes (PTE-Ia and PTE-Ib) (17Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E.B. Huttunen M.K. Orii K. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34317-34326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These genes are localized in a cluster on chromosome 12 in mouse. Recent EST data base searches have identified two further putative peroxisomal Type-I acyl-CoA thioesterases, namely PTE-Ic and PTE-Id, that are also located in the same cluster on mouse chromosome 12 (Fig. 1). Of the four putative peroxisomal genes identified in mouse, PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic show the highest homology to each other and were therefore cloned and characterized together in this study. The genomic organization for PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic was obtained from the mouse genomic data base (ENSEMBL, www.ensembl.org), as outlined in Fig. 2A. Both proteins are encoded by three exons, spaced by two introns. Analysis of EST sequences for PTE-Ia suggested the possible existence of an additional small exon (30–37 bp) further upstream in the 5′-end, which results in two different splice variants depicted as 5′:1 and 5′:2 in Fig. 2A. The existence of these two splice variants was further supported by sequence analysis because the exon-intron boundaries are consistent with the donor-acceptor splice rules, as shown in Fig. 2B. Furthermore, these two splice variants were amplified by RT-PCR from liver and kidney (see below).Fig. 2Structural organization of the PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic genes.A, the open reading frames for both PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic are encoded by three exons (boxes), spaced by two introns (broken lines). EST data base searches identified two 5′ variants of the PTE-Ia, which are denoted 5′:1 and 5′:2 and contain a short exon encoding a further 5′-untranslated region. The 5′:1 splice variant contains the first in-frame ATG, encoding an 11-amino acid-longer PTE-Ia. In the 5′:2 splice variant, the first ATG is spliced out, encoding a PTE-Ia protein that is 11 amino acids shorter. TGA, stop codon. B, sequence alignment and comparison of the 5′:1 and 5′:2 splice variants. Nucleotides of the open reading frame are shown in capital letters with the ATG codons underlined. Splice donor and acceptor sites are shown in italics. In 5′:1, 547 bp are spliced out, and in 5′:2 1293 bp are spliced out. In the sequence corresponding to 5′:1, 719 bp (–719) were omitted to allow sequence comparison to 5′:2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on the genomic sequences, the corresponding open reading frames were amplified by RT-PCR and fully sequenced. The full-length cDNAs were assembled based on ESTs corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and verified by analysis of mouse genomic sequences. Sequence analysis of the gene products for PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic shows a sequence identity of 82% at the amino acid level in their open reading frames (Fig. 3). The cDNAs isolated for PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic encode proteins of 432 and 421 amino acids, with calculated molecular masses of 47.4 kDa and 46.6 kDa, respectively. Interestingly, the PTE-Ia cDNA of the PTE-Ia 5′:1 splice variant contains an extra 11 amino acids in the amino-terminal end, whereas the 5′:2 splice variant splices out the first methionine, with the protein starting at the second methionine, similar to the cytosolic and the other peroxisomal thioesterases (17Hunt M.C.

Both sequences end -AKL at their carboxyl-terminal, which is a variant of the peroxisomal consensus type 1 targeting signal (PTS1) of -SKL (25Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). A catalytic triad containing serine (S), histidine (H), and aspartic acid (D) residues, located at positions 232, 360, and 326 of PTE-Ic, has been identified in this family of acyl-CoA thioesterases and is conserved also in these two enzymes (26Huhtinen K.

PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic Are Localized in Peroxisomes—The nomenclature of PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic was based on their putative consensus PTS1 of -AKL at their carboxyl-terminal ends. To test whether these proteins are indeed peroxisomal, we cloned both PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic in-frame with GFP, which leaves the carboxyl-terminal -AKL accessible. We transfected these plasmids into both control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from a Zellweger patient, which are unable to import peroxisomal matrix proteins. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and a Tritclabeled secondary antibody to GFP, PTE-Ia showed a punctate pattern of expression in control fibroblasts, indicative of a peroxisomal localization (Fig. 4A). However, in Zellweger fibroblasts, transfection of PTE-Ia resulted in a diffuse GFP expression showing that PTE-Ia remained in the cytosol (Fig. 4B). PTE-Ic also showed a punctate pattern of expression in control fibroblasts, although some cytosolic staining was visible in this case (Fig. 4C). Again, in Zellweger fibroblasts, transfection of PTE-Ic resulted in a diffuse GFP expression (Fig. 4D). Because of the 11-amino acid extension in the amino-terminal of PTE-Ia (5′:1), we also examined the possibility of a mitochondrial targeting of PTE-Ia. This was examined by expressing both the long (5′:1) and the short (5′:2) amino-terminal variants of PTE-Ia as carboxyl-terminal GFP fusion proteins in fibroblasts. However, the GFP experiments for these variants showed only cytosolic labeling with no mitochondrial localization (data not shown). Recombinant Expression and Characterization—The cloning of the open reading frames encoding PTE-Ia (5′:1) and PTE-Ic into the NdeI site in the pET16b vector results in expression of the proteins as His-tagged fusion proteins, which allows for purification using affinity chromatography. Following purification on a Hi-Trap™ column, the purified proteins were detected as single bands of about 47 kDa on SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (data not shown). Following initial enzyme activity characterization of the recombinant protein, it was evident that PTE-Ia activity, but not PTE-Ic activity, was inhibited with substrates ranging from C14-C20 at concentrations higher than 5–10 μm. However, addition of bovine serum albumin to the reaction at an albumin/acyl-CoA ratio of 1:4.5 prevented inhibition (data not shown). Recombinant PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic were analyzed for acyl-CoA thioesterase activity, which was determined at several concentrations for a variety of acyl-CoA substrates, including saturated and unsaturated straight-chain acyl-CoAs, branched-chain acyl-CoAs, and bile acid CoA esters. Interestingly, despite the very high sequence homology, PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic showed different chain length specificities for straight-chain acyl-CoAs. Whereas PTE-Ia is a long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase (highest activity with palmitoyl-CoA, C16-CoA), PTE-Ic is a medium-chain thioesterase (highest activity with decanoyl-CoA, C10-CoA) (Fig. 5). Neither of the enzymes was active on bile acid-CoA esters (tested with choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA). Vmax and Km values were calculated for those acyl-CoAs that were substrates for PTE-Ia and PTE-Ic (Table I). Further support for the difference in acyl-CoA chain length specificity stems from differences in the Km values. The Km values for PTE-Ia were generally much lower for long-chain acyl-CoAs than those for PTE-Ic. Also 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA, a metabolite in the β-oxidation of pristanic acid, was found to be a better substrate for PTE-Ic than for PTE-Ia (Table I).Table ICalculated Vmax and Km values for recombinant PTE-Ia and PTE-IcAcyl-CoAsPTE-IaPTE-IcVmaxKmVmaxKmμmol/min/mgμmμmol/min/mgμmHexanoyl0.0210.90.2328.4Octanoyl0.2346.20.747"

A study of the steps following oxygen binding and NO formation is important since NO is a mediator of a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes in humans and other mammals (1Ignarro L.J.

The formation of NO is catalyzed by nitric oxide synthases (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39) via a two-step mechanism. The substrate, l-Arg, is first converted to NG-hydroxy-l-Arg (NHA) at the heme active site. In the second step, NHA is further oxidized to NO and citrulline (3Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both steps, oxygen binding occurs after a one-electron reduction of the ferric heme. Prior to product formation, an electron stemming from tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) then further reduces the ferrous oxygen complex. Despite much effort, the reaction mechanism of these steps is still unclear. Even the spectral properties of the oxyferrous complex are not yet defined; conflicting observations report absorbance maxima differing by up to 15 nm. The origin of these differences is unknown. The strongest differences are those between observations at cryogenic temperatures yielding maxima in the 417–419-nm region (7Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, this distinction is not clear-cut; in some cases, low wavelength maxima are also found by rapid scan spectroscopy (11Sato H. Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and high wavelength maxima are also found by low temperature UV-visible spectroscopy (9Gorren A.C. Bec N. Schrammel A. Werner E.R. Lange R. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11763-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To clarify this confusing situation, we reanalyzed the temporal evolution of the spectral changes occurring upon oxygen binding to reduced eNOS oxygenase domain by rapid scanning stopped-flow, assisted by global fit analysis. The present spectral and kinetic data show that, depending on experimental conditions such as temperature and presence of substrate and pteridine cofactor, two different heme-oxy complexes are formed. These complexes are further distinguished by their ability to exchange oxygen by CO at –30 °C. The implication of two different oxygen complexes in NOS distinguishes this enzyme from other heme-thiolate-containing proteins. In addition, the dependence of these oxy-complexes on other reaction partners may be important in the mechanism of uncoupling of NADPH oxidation from product formation. Therefore, formation, stability, and decay of the oxygen complexes were followed within both eNOS reaction cycles (using l-Arg and NHA as substrate) and in the presence of different BH4 analogues. Materials—The oxygenase domain of bovine endothelial NOS (eNOSoxy) was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli (15Schmidt P.P. Lange R. Gorren A.C. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Andersson K.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All chemicals were from Sigma except for pteridines (Schircks Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland), argon, O2, and CO (Aga, Toulouse, France). Sample Preparation—Samples were prepared as described (7Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Gorren A.C. Bec N. Schrammel A. Werner E.R. Lange R. Mayer B.

Biochem. 2001; 87: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, NOS samples (2–6 μm eNOSoxy) in KCEM buffer (50 mm KPi at pH 7.5, 1 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), in the presence or absence of substrates (1 mm NHA or 0.5 mm l-Arg) and pteridines (100 μm) were deoxygenated under argon atmosphere and then reduced by sodium dithionite (1 mm final concentration) at 15 °C. CHAPS (which does not affect the spectral properties of the enzyme) was used to maintain the structural and functional integrity of NOS (17Klatt P. Pfeiffer S. List B.M. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7336-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For stopped-flow experiments, O2-saturated stock solutions were prepared by bubbling KCEM buffer with O2 for 45 min. The concentration of oxygen in these solutions was assumed to be 1 mm at 25 °C. Argon-saturated solutions were prepared by the same procedure. Stopped-flow Spectroscopy—Rapid-scanning experiments were performed at 7 °C using an SFM 300 BioLogic Instrument (Grenoble, France) stopped-flow apparatus equipped with a J&M TIDAS diode array detector (MCS/16-TSPEC/500kHz). Anaerobic solutions of ferrous eNOS oxygenase domain were mixed with equal volumes of oxygen-containing buffer. The final concentration of oxygen was varied by the use of three independent mixing syringes: one containing the enzyme, one containing the oxygen-saturated buffer, and one containing the argon-saturated buffer. The mixing dead time was 0.3 ms. After each injection, two hundred spectra from 350 to 700 nm were collected with an acquisition time of 2.5 ms. Rapid-scanning data were compiled and fitted to different reaction models using the Specfit global analysis program (provided by the instrument manufacturer), which evaluates the number of different enzyme species, their individual spectra, and the concentration of each species as a function of time, as well as the rate constant for each transition. In some experiments where the kinetics of formation of the oxygenated eNOSoxy complexes were too rapid to be detected with the diode array (lower limit of integration time: 2.5 ms), the kinetics were followed at a single wavelength (414 nm) with a PMS-250 photomultiplier (BioLogic Science Instruments), which allowed the kinetic resolution of reactions occurring within a couple of milliseconds. All experiments were performed at least twice, with different batches of eNOSoxy. The kinetics of formation and decay of oxygen complexes were not affected by the presence of excess dithionite; control experiments using different concentrations of dithionite (0.5–5 mm) and of oxygen (0.1–0.5 mm) did not reveal any effect of dithionite on the kinetics. Low Temperature Optical Spectroscopy—Low temperature UV-visible absorption spectra of the reaction between reduced eNOSoxy and O2 or CO were recorded with a Cary 3E (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) spectrophotometer, adapted for low temperature studies, according to previously published procedures (7Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9Gorren A.C. Bec N. Schrammel A. Werner E.R.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To avoid freezing, the experiments were carried out in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of aqueous buffer/ethylene glycol. The organic cosolvent did not change significantly the spectral properties of NOS, it did not induce a transition to the P420 state, and in its presence, the enzyme was still active in a standard assay (19Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Detection of Two Spectrally Distinct Oxygen Complexes— Depending on experimental conditions, rapid mixing of reduced eNOSoxy with oxygen-containing buffer resulted in two different spectral species. As shown in Fig. 1, one species is characterized by a Soret absorbance maximum of 420 nm and a single visible band at 560 nm, the other one is characterized by a considerably red-shifted Soret maximum (428 nm) and by two visible bands (560 and 595 nm). For simplicity, we denote the first one heme-oxy I, and we denote the latter one heme-oxy II. Inspection of Table I shows that heme-oxy I is formed in the absence of substrate, regardless of the nature of the pterin cofactor. In contrast, heme-oxy II is formed in the presence of substrate (l-Arg or NHA), irrespective of the pterin cofactor. In addition, heme-oxy II is also formed when both substrate and pterin cofactor are absent. A closer analysis of Table I reveals small spectral differences of heme-oxy II when formed in the presence of l-Arg or NHA. With l-Arg, a Soret maximum is found near 432 nm, and α/β bands are found at 564 and 597 nm. With NHA, the Soret band culminates at 428 nm, and the α/β bands culminate at 560 and 593 nm. Interestingly, when the experiments were carried out at –30 °C, under some conditions, different results were obtained. For instance, at low temperature, the presence of NHA and absence of pterin resulted in an oxygen complex of heme-oxy I spectral characteristics.Table ISpectral properties of heme-dioxy complexes detected in single turnover reactions of eNOS oxygenase domain with oxygenSubstratePterinλmaxIntermediateSoretα,βnmBH4421560heme-oxy I4-amino-BH4420561heme-oxy IBH2421560heme-oxy IArg433565/595heme-oxy IIArgBH4432563/597heme-oxy IIArg4-amino-BH4432565/600heme-oxy IIArgBH2431563/598heme-oxy IINHA428 (419)560/595 (560)heme-oxy II (I)NHABH4428560/590heme-oxy IINHA4-amino-BH4429 (425)560/593 (557/595)heme-oxy IINHABH2429 (426)560/594 (557/595)heme-oxy II-428560/595heme-oxy II Open table in a new tab Occurrence of Heme-oxy II within the Second Reaction Cycle— Rapid mixing of reduced eNOSoxy with O2-saturated buffer in the presence of BH4 and NHA resulted in a gradual red shift of the Soret band from 414 to ∼440 nm followed by a shift in the opposite direction finally yielding ferric heme (394 nm) (Fig. 2). The temporal sequence of spectra was best fitted to a sequential model with three monophasic transitions between four distinct species. The four spectral components revealed by global analysis were ferrous eNOSoxy (λmax 414 nm), heme-oxy II (characterized by absorbance peaks at 428, 560, and a shoulder at 600 nm), the Fe(III)-NO complex with λmax(Soret) 438 nm and λmax(α,β) 547/583 nm, and high spin ferric heme (λmax 394 nm). The Soret and visible absorbance features of the transient species after O2 addition and of ferric-NO match those of oxygenated (FeIIO2) and FeIIINO complexes of iNOSoxy, nNOSoxy, or eNOSoxy characterized previously at 10 °C (10Abu-Soud H.M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The transient occurrence of heme-oxy II and Fe(III)-NO also appears evident from the time course of the concentration of the four species, which was deduced by global fit analysis (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 3, a similar spectral evolution was observed when BH4 was replaced by ABH4, except that no Fe(III)-NO complex was observed, which is in line with recent observations (22Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13287-13303Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this case, the reaction contained only two steps: conversion of ferrous heme to heme-oxy II followed by its decay to ferric heme. Clear isosbestic points characterized both processes. Kinetic Analysis of Heme-oxy I and Heme-oxy II Formation— The formation of heme-oxy I was too fast for a precise determination of rate constants from rapid scanning stopped-flow data. Therefore, we used single wavelength stopped-flow. Fig. 4A is an example for the kinetic traces observed. Heme-oxy I forms within a few milliseconds and decays within 100 ms. In contrast, the kinetics of formation and decay of heme-oxy II were much slower and could be analyzed adequately from rapid scan data. Fig. 4B shows the dependence of the kobs of the formation of heme-oxy II as a function of oxygen concentration. Clearly, a linear relationship was observed, indicating a pseudo-first order reaction. Accordingly, kon and koff were determined using Equation 1. kobs=koff+kon×[O2](Eq. 1) The kinetic rate constants under the different experimental conditions are listed in Table II. In most cases, the formation of heme-oxy II was irreversible as evidenced by a koff value close to 0. 2With BH4 analogues or in the absence of pterins, a negative intercept value was estimated from plots of kobs versus O2 concentration for eNOSoxy in the presence of substrates. To indicate the irreversible process of O2 binding under these conditions, we tabulated the O2 dissociation constant value as 0. Exceptions were the reactions in the presence of substrate and BH4 (koff = 23 ± 1 s–1) and in the presence of NHA and BH2 (koff = 9.7 s–1). To enable a comparison of the formation rates of heme-oxy I and heme-oxy II, the experimental values of kobs for heme-oxy I were converted into second order rate constants, using a single concentration of oxygen (150 μm). At higher concentrations, oxygen binding occurred within the mixing time, precluding analysis of the [O2] dependence. For both heme-oxy I and heme-oxy II, the decay rate constants (reflecting the transition to ferric high spin or to Fe(III)-NO) were independent of oxygen concentration, i.e. the decay was a first order reaction.Table IIKinetic parameters of the intermediates after oxygen addition to reduced eNOS oxygenase domain in the presence and absence of substrates and pterinsConditionsHeme-oxyFeIII-NO (kdecay)konkoffkdecaymm-1·s-1s-1s-1s-1NHA+BH43422214.52.5+4-amino-BH427200.086+BH22279.70.134no pterin14500.358Arginine+BH4265246.2+4-amino-BH441000.0536+BH245200.181no pterin33801.49No substrate/pterin2480aPseudo first order rates estimated in the presence of 0.15 mm O2.NDbND, not determined.60/2.1BH42333aPseudo first order rates estimated in the presence of 0.15 mm O2.NDbND, not determined.144/184-amino-BH42758aPseudo first order rates estimated in the presence of 0.15 mm O2.NDbND, not determined.27/0.3BH22600aPseudo first order rates estimated in the presence of 0.15 mm O2.NDbND, not determined.34/0.3a Pseudo first order rates estimated in the presence of 0.15 mm O2.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab A particular situation was encountered when both substrate and pterin cofactor were absent. In this case, the starting spectrum recorded after 2.5 ms of mixing displayed essentially identical spectral features of heme-oxy II. This transient species decayed to form ferric eNOSoxy, as judged by a shift of the Soret band to a broad spectrum centered at 410 nm and build-up of visible absorbance at 630 nm (data not shown). Using single-wavelength stopped-flow, we showed that the formation kinetics of the oxygenated intermediate were very fast (a couple of milliseconds), similar to the formation of heme-oxy I (Table II). Kinetic Effects of Pterins and Substrates—As shown in Table II, the kinetics of heme-oxy I formation did not depend significantly on the nature of the pterin cofactor. In contrast, its decay rate was about 5 times higher in the presence of BH4 with respect to other pterins. Similarly, the kon rate of heme-oxy II did not vary strongly under the different conditions. However, its decay rate was tremendously (more than 100-fold) enhanced in the presence of BH4. Similar tendencies were observed for both substrates (l-Arg and NHA). Oxygen Exchange by CO—To further characterize heme-oxy I and heme-oxy II, we investigated their reactivity versus CO. To do that, we chose conditions at –30 °C where heme-oxy I or II were predominant and bubbled CO through the sample immediately after formation of the oxygen complex. As shown in Fig. 5, the two oxygen complexes behaved differently. Heme-oxy I transformed to a spectrum with contributions from two compounds; the Soret region exhibited maxima at 396 and 444 nm. The 396-nm peak most likely reflects the oxidized form, whereas the latter was typical of thiolate-ligated ferrous-CO heme (λmax 444 nm). In contrast, heme-oxy II did not exchange CO; its 427-nm Soret maximum shifted without intermediate to 395 nm, indicating a decay of heme-oxy II to ferric high spin. Are Heme-oxy I and Heme-oxy II Distinct Intermediates?— One of the most salient observations in the present study is the detection of intermediates in the oxygenation of reduced eNOSoxy of different spectral and kinetic properties (heme-oxy I and heme-oxy II). The question now is whether these two spectral forms represent distinct reaction intermediates. There are prior indications for the existence of different NOS oxygen complexes. Intermediates with absorbance maxima at 417–419 nm (of heme-oxy type I) have been observed in several low temperature optical studies under a variety of conditions (7Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C.

These spectral differences cannot be exclusively explained by different experimental temperature or the presence of cryogenic cosolvent (8Ledbetter A.P. McMillan K. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.

Bec N. Schrammel A. Werner E.R. Lange R. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11763-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Some of the reported spectral discrepancies may have been artificial in those cases, when incomplete formation of a 428-/432-nm intermediate resulted in an apparent maximum at lower wavelength, as discussed previously (9Gorren A.C. Bec N. Schrammel A. Werner E.R. Lange R. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11763-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the extreme stability of some of the observed intermediates appears to preclude such an explanation in many instances. The presence and identity of substrate and pteridines may also have affected the spectral properties of the oxyferrous complexes (9Gorren A.C. Bec N. Schrammel A. Werner E.R. Lange R. Mayer B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11763-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 9309-9314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several observations in the present study argue in favor of two distinct heme-oxy complexes: i) the observed spectra can be clearly distinguished in two groups with well defined properties in the Soret and α,β regions; ii) the effects of substrate and pterines on the spectra follow regular patterns; (iii) although in most cases the red-shifted spectra exhibited much greater stability than the blue-shifted intermediates, this property was not universal since a short-lived 428-nm intermediate was formed in the absence of substrate and pterin, which rules out that the blue species are experimental artifacts; iv) at low temperature, formation of heme-oxy I is reversible, and oxygen can be replaced by CO. This is not the case for heme-oxy II. Particularly, the different reactivity versus CO constitutes a strong argument for the existence of two different oxygen complexes. Nature of Heme-oxy I and II—All spectral species that were formed in the absence of pteridines and in the presence of BH2 must have been in the same [Fe·O2]2+ redox state since under those conditions, further reduction of the oxy-complex was impossible. In those instances, where a second electron transfer was possible (l-Arg/NHA+BH4/ABH4), a different interpretation (for heme-oxy II) would be theoretically possible but highly improbable, in view of the near identity with the spectra obtained under non-productive (BH2 or absence of pterin) conditions (Table I). Indeed, EPR spectra corresponding to the oxy-complexes observed at low temperature showed no trace of a ferrous-superoxy or ferri-peroxy complex (27Sorlie M. Gorren A.C. Marchal S. Shimizu T. Lange R. Andersson K.K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48602-48610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We conclude that all spectral species that were designated heme-oxy I and II by us in the present study were isoelectronic, formally presented by the [Fe·O2]2+ redox state. The spectral properties of heme-oxy I are reminiscent of the oxy-complexes of other hemoproteins, such as cytochrome P450 and globins (28Gunsalus I.C. Meeks J.R. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P.G. Münck E. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1974: 559-613Google Scholar). In those cases, there is spectroscopic evidence (29Sharrock M. Debrunner P.G. Schulz C. Lipscomb J.D. Marshall V. Gunsalus I.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 420: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) that the predominant electronic state is the ferric superoxide (Fe3+−O2⋅¯), suggesting a similar electronic structure for heme-oxy I. However, this species must still have a considerable contribution of the ferrous-dioxygen (Fe2+-O2) mesomer since the complex readily exchanged O2 for CO, as was also observed for cytochromes P450 and globins (30Sono"

BSP and OPN are the major non-collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) phosphoproteins of calcified tissues such as bone and cartilage. Their intimate relationship with biomineralization suggests that they play key roles during the development and maintenance of these tissues (1Glimcher M.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol.

Although some in vitro studies indicate that BSP promotes bone resorption and hence participates in bone degradation (17Ross F.P. Chappel J. Alvarez J.I. Sander D. Butler W.T. Farach-Carson M.C. Mintz K.A. Robey P.G. Teitelbaum S.L. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9901-9907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), other studies such as those using glucocorticoids, which increase expression of this protein, suggest its involvement in the anabolic phase of bone remodeling (18Oldberg A. Jirskog-Hed B. Axelsson S. Heinegard D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3183-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this laboratory, in vivo implants of BSP-collagen composites in the calvarial critical defect bone repair model (19Wang J. Kennedy J. Kasser J. Glimcher M.J. Salih E. Orthop. Trans. 1999; 22: 951-952Google Scholar) and during reparative dentinogenesis (7Six N. Decup F. Lasfargues J.J. Salih E. Goldberg M. J. Mater. Sci. 2002; 13: 225-232Google Scholar, 8Decup F. Six N.

Dent. 2003; 16: 66-76PubMed Google Scholar) highlighted the impact of BSP during biomineralization and new bone/dentin formation. As interest continues and evidence accumulates with regard to the general biological functions of bone phosphoproteins, in particular the covalently bound phosphate groups, the biochemical factors or processes that can affect the state of phosphorylation of these proteins become significant. Hence, the protein kinases that are involved in the phosphorylation of BSP/OPN prior to secretion into the ECM become important regulators of ECM phosphoprotein functions. Previous studies from this laboratory show that microsomal casein kinase II (CKII) and CKII are the predominant enzymes involved during the phosphorylation of bone ECM phosphoproteins OPN and BSP (23Mikuni-Takagaki Y. Glimcher M.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Bone Miner.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16897-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Also, the use of a panel of purified protein kinases in in vitro phosphorylation of purified bovine bone OPN and BSP demonstrated that the degree of in vivo naturally occurring phosphorylation of bovine BSP and OPN is ∼65 and ∼85%, respectively. Not all of the molecules are phosphorylated at each of the potential phosphorylation sites within a given population of molecules isolated from bone of a particular age. Such heterogeneity in phosphorylation can be attained by changes in factors such as the rate of phosphoprotein synthesis, the microsomal CKII activity, the available ATP concentrations (within the intracellular compartment where phosphorylation takes place), and some degree of dephosphorylation during the residence of OPN/BSP in the ECM. The precise sites of phosphorylation in chicken bone OPN clearly show that the extent of phosphorylation at each site varies between 30 and 100%, with an average of ∼60% total phosphorylation (27Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13966-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There were 10 phosphorylation sites identified, but the actual quantitative analysis showed 6.3 mol of phosphoamino acids/mol of chicken OPN. The phosphorylated peptide regions are predominantly recognition sequences for CKII (27Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13966-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), confirming our in vitro studies. Additional studies that utilized the in vivo repair of calvarial bone defects induced to heal by implants of demineralized bone matrix highlighted the intimate interrelationship between accumulation and the rate of accumulation of calcium phosphate, OPN, BSP, and microsomal CKII activity as a function of bone development (28Wang J. Glimcher M.J. Mah J. Zhou H.Y. Salih E. Bone (N. Y.). 1998; 22: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More recently, direct evidence was provided for the first time in support of the concept of a “natural variation” in the extent of phosphorylation of ECM phosphoproteins during mineralized tissue formation. The extent of phosphorylation of OPN and BSP in the two anatomically distinct in vivo sites (bony and soft tissues) is substantially different (between ∼1 and ∼14 mol of Ser(P)/mol of OPN or BSP) and varies as a function of time within both implant sites (29Salih E. Wang J. Mah J. Fluckiger R. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is a direct and linear relationship between the rate of calcium phosphate deposition and the ratio of Ser(P) BSP to Ser(P) OPN in calvarial implants, clearly demonstrating hidden and important facets of the factors that control mineral deposition and the intimate coupling of the state of phosphorylation of BSP and OPN in this process. Indeed, the covalently bound phosphates of BSP and OPN have been shown to also affect osteoclast cell attachment properties (15Ek-Rylander B. Flores M. Wendel M. Heinegard D. Andersson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14853-14856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Katayama Y. House C.M. Udagawa N. Kazama J.J. McFarland R.J. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). More recent conflicting studies have utilized different forms of OPN and BSP, and the results suggest that, although phosphorylation is not important for cell attachment, it is necessary for in vitro osteoclast resorption pit formation in dead bone slices (31Razzouk S. Brunn J.C. Qin C. Tye C.E. Goldberg H.A. Butler W.T. Bone (N. Y.). 2002; 30: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The differences in the results (Refs. 15Ek-Rylander B. Flores M. Wendel M. Heinegard D. Andersson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14853-14856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 30Katayama Y. House C.M. Udagawa N. Kazama J.J. McFarland R.J. Martin T.J.

Y.). 2002; 30: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were suggested to be due to differences in the protein samples and state of phosphorylation. There is no doubt that such conflicting results will probably continue to arise since these proteins are highly phosphorylated/glycosylated, and as noted above, these moieties are subject to inherent natural variation (29Salih E. Wang J. Mah J. Fluckiger R. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation does not take place to the same extent at each of the potential sites, leading to heterogeneity within a given population of the protein isolated from a natural source. In vitro phosphorylation can also produce proteins with heterogeneous phosphorylation states or fully phosphorylated forms; but in either case, these may not represent precisely the naturally occurring forms. The phosphorylation sites and regions of chicken bone OPN (27Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13966-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and bovine milk OPN (32Sorensen E.S. Hojrup P. Petersen T.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2040-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and the glycosylation sites of human BSP (33Wuttke M. Muller S. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Hanisch F.G. Maurer P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12983-12991Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have been reported. However, similar details are not available for BSP phosphorylation sites. In this study, a combination of state-of-the-art experimental approaches has been utilized to define for the first time the complete topographical distribution of both the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation sites of bovine bone BSP. These included (i) phosphorylation of native and deglycosylated BSPs by CKII and tryptic peptide mapping, followed by solid-phase N-terminal peptide sequence analyses to define in vitro phosphorylation sites; (ii) use of a novel synthesized radiolabeled thiol agent (1-S-mono[14C]carboxymethyldithiothreitol ([14C]CM-DTT)) to derivatize phosphoserine tryptic peptides of BSP, followed by normal N-terminal peptide sequence analysis to define in vivo phosphorylation sites; and (iii) use of MALDI-TOF-MS to rapidly profile BSP proteolytic peptides. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Native BSP by CKII Using [32P]ATP and Identification of the Phosphorylation Sites by Solid-phase N-terminal Peptide Sequencing—Bovine bone BSP was isolated and purified as described previously (26Salih E. Zhou H.Y. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16897-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 200 μg of native BSP was phosphorylated by [32P]ATP (diluted with unlabeled ATP to give a specific activity of 250 mCi/mmol) using 200 ng of CKII (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m KH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EGTA for 1 h at room temperature (∼22 °C). 32P-Labeled native BSP was dialyzed against 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH ∼8.0) and digested with 2% (w/w) tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine trypsin (Sigma). The sample was freeze-dried, suspended in 0.2 ml of H2O and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to RP-HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (25 × 0.46 cm). The peptides were eluted by a linear gradient from H2O and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to 60% CH3CN and 0.55% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 90 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance at 219 nm was recorded continuously, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Aliquots from each fraction were counted for 32P radioactivity, and the radioactive fractions were then separately pooled for each peak, freeze-dried, and rechromatographed. Each purified 32P-labeled peptide was sequenced by automated solid-phase amino acid sequencing both to define the sequence and to identify the precise site(s) of phosphorylation as described previously (27Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13966-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of Bovine Bone BSP, Followed by in Vitro Phosphorylation Using CKII and [32P]ATP and Identification of the Phosphorylation Sites—Native bovine bone BSP was deglycosylated by a combination of glycosidases simultaneously. 100 μg of BSP was incubated in 0.5 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) in the presence of O-glycosidase (2.5 milliunits/10 μg of protein), N-glycosidase (0.4 units/10 μg of protein), and neuraminidase (2 milliunits/10 μg of protein) (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 37 °C. Deglycosylated BSP was then isolated by RP-HPLC using a Vydac C4 column (25 × 0.46 cm), and fractions containing BSP (defined by Western blotting using anti-bovine BSP polyclonal antibody) (28Wang J. Glimcher M.J. Mah J. Zhou H.Y. Salih E. Bone (N. Y.). 1998; 22: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Salih E. Wang J. Mah J. Fluckiger R. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were pooled and freeze-dried. The sample was then phosphorylated using CKII and [32P]ATP and trypsin-digested, and peptides were separated by RP-HPLC as described above. The 32P-labeled peptides were subjected to solid-phase N-terminal sequence analyses to define simultaneously the peptide sequence identity and the location of the phosphorylated residue(s) as described previously (27Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13966-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For quantitative evaluation, analyses were performed to calculate accurately the degree of absolute phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro at each site and relative to the others within the whole molecule. Since there is an unknown amount of phosphate loss from the Ser(P) residues in Edman degradation cycles, it is not possible to quantify Ser(P) content upon release of 32P alone in that cycle. One way that this was overcome was to calculate the pmol of 32P-labeled Ser released (from 32P counts and the specific activity of [32P]ATP) plus the pmol of dehydroalanine observed in that cycle. This approximated more closely the actual original Ser(P) content of the peptide since generation of the dehydroalanine from Ser(P) is cumulative during Edman degradation. Identification of the in Vivo Phosphorylation Regions and Sites of BSP Using a Novel Synthesized Radioactive Thiol Agent, [14C]CM-DTT—To overcome the lack of an efficient and rapid determination of the precise sites of in vivo phosphorylation, a novel radioactive thiol reagent, [14C]CM-DTT, was designed and synthesized in this laboratory. The synthesis and utility of such reagent(s) have been recently described in detail for studies related to phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-containing proteins using N-terminal peptide sequencing and a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (35Salih E. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 36Salih E. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 100 μg of bovine bone BSP was deglycosylated and trypsin-digested for chemical derivatization by [14C]CM-DTT. The tryptic peptides were then incubated with 5 mm [14C]CM-DTT in 0.33 m NaOH for 1 h at 50 °C to derivatize the phosphoserine-containing peptides. The 14C-labeled peptides were isolated/purified by RP-HPLC and N-terminally sequenced under normal sequencing conditions. N-terminal sequencing was carried out by Edman degradation (37Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar) using a Model 477A automated protein sequenator (Applied Biosystems) and Biobrene-treated glass filters (27Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13966-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To define the peptide sequence and the location of the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing peptides, one-third of the anilinothiazoline products from each Edman degradation step were converted to phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives and analyzed by on-line HPLC (Model 120A, Applied Biosystems), and two-thirds were collected as anilinothiazoline derivatives for 14C counting as described recently (27Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13966-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Salih E. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Unlike the analysis and quantification of the in vitro 32P-labeled peptides by solid-phase sequencing described above, the quantification of the Ser(P) content during sequencing of the [14C]CM-DTT-derivatized peptides was less complicated. This is because the [14C]CM-DTT-Ser moieties during sequence analysis are stable and the 14C released in that cycle reflects the actual original Ser(P) content. To quantify yields of sequenced peptides, the initial yield (I0) and repetitive yield (R) were calculated by linear regression analysis of the observed yield (M) at each cycle (n): log10(M) = nlog10(R) + log10(I0). The information obtained from such analysis was used in conjunction with the release of 14C radioactivity to quantify the original phosphoserine content/mol of peptide. The expected theoretical observable yield for serine quantity in a given cycle was calculated based on the cycle number, initial yield, and repetitive yield. For example, the tryptic peptide containing residues 42–122 (FAVQSSSDSSEENGNGD...) was sequenced for 12 cycles, with release of 14C radioactivity in cycles 5 and 10 (2020 and 780 dpm, respectively). These counts were for the two-thirds of the total Edman degradation products of each cycle, whereas the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives for the amino acid analyses were for the one-third. Hence, the total expected observable 14C counts if all of the Edman degradation products were counted are 3030 dpm for cycle 5 and 1170 dpm for cycle 10. The expected observable serine content in cycles 5 and 10 if all of the Edman degradation products were converted to phenylthiohydantoin and analyzed are 222 and 132 pmol, respectively. Using the specific activity of [14C]CM-DTT (10 mCi/mmol), 3030 dpm in cycle 5 corresponds to 137 pmol of [14C]CM-DTT incorporated, reflecting 0.62 mol of 14C incorporated per mol of serine, i.e. 62% of this serine was in the form of phosphoserine. A similar calculation for Ser10 indicated 0.40 mol of 14C incorporated per mol of serine, i.e. 40% of this serine was phosphorylated. Direct Identification of in Vivo Native Phosphopeptides by MALDI-TOF-MS without 32P Labeling or Chemical Modification by [14C]CM-DTT—Native BSP (5 μg) was trypsin-digested, and the peptide mixture was subjected directly to peptide profiling by MALDI-TOF-MS. The advantages of this approach are the ability to rapidly profile peptides, to pinpoint naturally occurring phosphopeptides, and to sequence and identify each peptide within the mixture without any purification steps. In addition, due to the sensitivity of the instrument, a very small amount of the material is required. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed in this laboratory using the Voyager DE Pro™ mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Aliquots of BSP tryptic peptides (∼1 pmol) in 1 μl of H2O and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, Applied Biosystems), spotted onto a sample target (stainless steel sample plate), allowed to dry, and loaded into the mass spectrometer for analysis. Complete in Vitro Phosphorylation Sites of Purified Bovine Bone BSP Using [32P]ATP and CKII—Fig. 1A shows a tryptic peptide map of native BSP phosphorylated using [32P]ATP and CKII. The BSP used in this experiment was native, with both glycosylation and phosphorylation intact. Under these circumstances, 32P labeling occurs at residual phosphorylation sites with recognition sequences for CKII. A number of 32P-labeled peptides were observed within the RP-HPLC profile using a C18 column. Several of the peptides were subjected to rechromatography by RP-HPLC for clarification of the sequences (Fig. 1A, inset). It is worth noting that the absorbance profile of each peak was heightened, with the descending limb never declining to the base line, which is obvious in both Fig. 1A and its inset. This phenomenon is a prominent occurrence in the analysis of phosphoproteins with high levels of glycosylation, as is the case with BSP in this work and as previously reported for OPN (27Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13966-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To simplify the tryptic peptide map and to remove the uncertainty of possible 32P incorporation in glycosylated side chains, native BSP was first deglycosylated by a combination of glycosidases, followed by phosphorylation and peptide mapping (Fig. 1B). The peptide map of deglycosylated BSP clearly revealed simplification and sharpening of the absorbance peaks, including base-line approximation of the peak limbs, as observed in both Fig. 1B and its inset. Interestingly, however, neither the number of radioactive peaks nor their relative positions and intensities within each profile showed any significant change. This suggests that the peptide sequences and sites for phosphorylation and glycosylation do not overlap and was supported by the quantitative data relating mol of 32P incorporation/mol of native and deglycosylated BSPs (∼2.5 mol of phosphate/mol of protein in both cases). Sequence analysis of the phosphorylated peptide regions and sites provided direct evidence consistent with this. Each of the radiolabeled fractions in Fig. 1 (A and B) were N-terminally sequenced using the automated solid-phase sequencing approach. Three peptides were identified as in vitro 32P-labeled peptides: residues 12–22 (LEDS(P)EENGVFK), 42–122 (FAVQSSSDSS(P)EENGNGDS(P)S(P)EEEEEEEETSNEEGNNGGNEDS(P)DENEDEES(P)EA...), and 135–216 (EDES(P)DEEEEEEEE...). The length of the tryptic peptide at residues 42–122 was too long for the positions of all of the potential phosphorylated serines beyond ∼12–15 residues to be defined clearly. Hence, a portion of this peptide was N-terminally sequenced up to 12 residues to identify the phosphorylated residues within this section. The remaining peptide was further proteolytically digested by Asp-N endopeptidase, and the shorter radiolabeled peptides were isolated and sequenced. Overall, seven phosphorylation sites were defined within the three peptides. As expected, all of the phosphorylated peptides contain recognition sequences for CKII (SEE, SXE, ESDE, etc.), i.e. the phosphorylated serine residues are flanked by acidic amino acids (Glu or Asp). Fig. 4 summarizes the topographical distribution of phosphorylation sites within the primary amino acid sequence of bovine BSP, and Table I indicates the quantitative extent of phosphorylation (% phosphorylation or mol of phosphate/mol of peptide).Fig. 4Complete topographical distribution of both in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation regions/sites of bovine bone BSP.

The essential N-terminal translocation domains of colicin toxins from Escherichia coli are disordered bacterial proteins that bind at least one protein of the Tol or Ton family. The colicin N translocation domain (ColN-(1–90)), which binds to the C-terminal domain of TolA (TolA-(296–421)), shows a disordered far-UV CD spectrum, no near-UV CD signal, and non-cooperative thermal unfolding. As expected, TolA-(296–421) displays both secondary structure in far-UV CD and tertiary structure in near-UV CD. Furthermore it shows a cooperative unfolding transition at 65 °C. CD spectra of the 1:1 complex show both increased secondary structure and colicin N-specific near-UV CD signals. A new cooperative thermal transition at 35 °C is followed by the unchanged unfolding behavior of TolA-(296–421). Fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance confirm that the new unfolding transition accompanies dissociation of ColN-(1–90). Hence upon binding the disordered structure of ColN-(1–90) converts to a cooperatively folded domain without altering the TolA-(296–421) structure.

The study of natively unfolded proteins has provoked a reexamination of the structure-function paradigm and emphasized the parallels between protein folding and molecular recognition (1Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 2Dunker A.K. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Williams R.M. Romero P. Oh J.S. Oldfield C.J. Campen A.M.

The extent of unfolding varies, but in the most extreme cases the proteins exist as “natural random coils.” One protein family showing this trait is the bacteriocins, which are produced by about one-third of enteric Gram-negative bacteria (4Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Sci. 1984; 1: 168-175PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these are colicins, a group of protein toxins that are encoded on specialized plasmids in Escherichia coli and whose function is to kill competing bacteria (5James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Microbiology (Read.). 1996; 142: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 6Lakey J.H. Slatin S.L. Van Der Goot F.G. Pore-Forming Toxins. 257. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2001: 131-161Google Scholar). Other Gram-negative bacterial species have similar bacteriocins (e.g. Klebsiella have klebicins (7James R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2525-2533PubMed Google Scholar)). They are important for the colonization of new habitats (8Kerr B. Riley M.A. Feldman M.W. Bohannan B.J.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar), and in the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis, pesticins use a receptor that is also important for pathogenesis (9Rakin A. Boolgakowa E. Heesemann J. Microbiology (Read.). 1996; 142: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Successful colicin function involves a complex series of highly specific protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions that are slowly being defined in vivo and in vitro (10Kurisu G.

Pattus F. Lazdunski C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All colicins have a natively unfolded N-terminal region of 70–90 residues (the translocation or T-domain), 1The abbreviations used are: T-domain, translocation domain; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; H/S/T/R, helix/strand/turn/random; PII, polyproline II helix; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. which contains sequences that bind to periplasmic receptor proteins such as TonB, TolA, and TolB. X-ray crystallographic structure analysis of colicin N (19Vetter I.R. Parker M.W. Tucker A.D. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) failed to detect electron density for residues 1–90 of the T-domain. Similarly the N-terminal 83 residues of colicin E3 were not resolved in the x-ray-derived structure (20Soelaiman S. Jakes K. Wu N. Li C.M. Shoham M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), while in the structure of colicin Ia the first 23 residues are not resolved, and the next 44 residues have no defined secondary structure (21Wiener M. Freymann D. Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore the NMR characterization of intact colicin E9 revealed that its T-domain is in a state of dynamic disorder (22Collins E.S. Whittaker S.B.M. Tozawa K. MacDonald C. Boetzel R. Penfold C.N. Reilly A. Clayden N. Osborne M.J. Kleanthous C. James R. Moore G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 122: 145-162Google Scholar), and CD spectra of the relevant colicin A domain shows it to lack significant secondary structure (23Deprez D. Blanchard L. Guerlesquin F. Gavioli M. Simorre J.-P. Lazdunski C. Marion D. Lloubes R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2589-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This means that colicins are among a growing number of recognized natively unfolded proteins that interestingly also share a general propensity to be involved in macromolecular interactions (1Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Thus concerted folding and binding is being increasingly recognized as a fundamental molecular process occurring throughout biology (1Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 3Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). The absolute reliance of the colicin family upon this form of interaction thus gives us a powerful system to explore why this sort of molecular recognition is often used in nature. The killing by colicins always proceeds in three steps, each promoted by a different structural domain: the binding to one or more outer membrane proteins, translocation across the periplasm with the aid of Tol or Ton protein systems, and finally killing achieved by enzymatic cleavage of nucleic acids (24James R. Penfold C.N. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or pore formation (6Lakey J.H. Slatin S.L. Van Der Goot F.G. Pore-Forming Toxins. 257. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2001: 131-161Google Scholar). However, since the nuclease colicins must cross the inner membrane to reach their target and have also been shown to form ion channels (25Mosbahi K. Lemaitre C. Keeble A.H. Mobasheri H. Morel B. James R. Moore G.R. Lea E. Kleanthous C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) this is not an absolute dichotomy of function. Colicins can be divided in two groups according to the proteins involved in translocation. Ton proteins are used by B group colicins (colicins Ia, Ib, and B) (26Braun V. Patzer S.I. Hantke K. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the Tol QRAB family is used by group A colicins, which include colicins A, N, E1, and K (27Lazzaroni J.C. Dubuisson J.F. Vianney A. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Of these, colicin N is the smallest pore-forming colicin (42 kDa) (28Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the first step it binds to outer membrane receptor OmpF via receptor-binding domain (R-domain) (29El-Kouhen R. Fierobe H.P. Scianimanico S. Steiert M. Pattus F. Pages J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The next step involves interaction of the unfolded T-domain with the protein TolA in the bacterial periplasm. In the final step, the pore-forming domain binds to the inner membrane and inserts hydrophobic helices into the membrane to form an open channel (6Lakey J.H. Slatin S.L. Van Der Goot F.G. Pore-Forming Toxins. 257. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2001: 131-161Google Scholar). Pore formation by colicin N and its relatives has been extensively studied (6Lakey J.H. Slatin S.L. Van Der Goot F.G. Pore-Forming Toxins. 257. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany2001: 131-161Google Scholar, 30Wilmsen H.U. Pugsley A.P. Pattus F. Eur. Biophys.

Acta. 2002; 1565: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but less is known about the receptor binding or translocation steps. Since requirements for receptor binding and translocation of colicin N are relatively simple, it is a good model for studying mechanisms of colicin translocation, and this has permitted a particularly detailed analysis of the T-domain (32Gökçe I.

The minimum colicin N TolA-binding box was defined as residues Asn42–Gly68 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence, and pull-down methods, and a high proportion of these residues are required for binding (32Gökçe I. Raggett E.M. Hong Q. Virden R. Cooper A. Lakey J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently we showed by using steady state and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and NMR that the T-domain undergoes gross conformational changes upon binding to TolA (34Anderluh G.

This indicated that the structure of complexed T-domain is likely to be significantly different to that in solution. In this report we show by the use of CD spectroscopy, fluorescence, and SPR that the complexed T-domain has acquired cooperatively folded secondary and tertiary structure. Preparation of the Proteins—Colicin N, T-domain of colicin N, and all Tol variants were prepared using an E. coli BL21(DE3) expression system using modified pET8c vector, as described previously (39Politou A.S. Gautel M. Pfuhl M. Labeit S. Pastore A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4730-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), that adds an N-terminal purification tag with the sequence MH6S2. T-domain comprised colicin N (Swiss-Prot accession number P08083) amino acid residues 1–90, TolA-(329–421) comprised amino acids 329–421 of the TolA protein (Swiss-Prot accession number P19934), and TolA-(296–421) comprised amino acids 296–421. TolAT is a fusion partner that is used for preparation of fusion proteins by using pTol expression system (38Anderluh G. Gökçe I. Lakey J.H. Protein Expr.

This variant comprises amino acids 329–421 of the TolA protein and, in addition, contains a linker of 12 amino acids at its C terminus that includes a thrombin cleavage site (GGGSLVPRGSGT). Proteins were expressed and isolated from the bacterial cytoplasm exactly as described before (34Anderluh G. Hong Q. Boetzel R. MacDonald C. Moore G.R. Virden R. Lakey J.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13180-13185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. The purity and homogeneity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined from UV absorption at 280 nm with extinction coefficients as follows: colicin N, 49,500 m–1 cm–1; T-domain, 12,660 m–1 cm–1; TolA-(329–421), 5120 m–1 cm–1; TolA-(296–421), 5120 m–1 cm–1; and TolAT, 5120 m–1 cm–1. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was carried out on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. For far-UV CD spectra (250–190 nm) bandwidth was set to 2 nm, scanning speed was set to 50 nm/min, and either 0.2-mm-path length demountable or, for thermal denaturation, 1-mm-path length stoppered cuvettes (all cuvettes were from Hellma) were used. The concentration of the proteins was 15–30 μm in 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0. Near-UV CD spectra (320–250 nm) were measured in the same buffer in 1-cm-path length stoppered cuvette at 70 μm protein concentration. All spectra shown are averages of 10 scans with bandwidth set to 1 nm. Thermal unfolding was carried out in the range 20–90 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. A full spectrum was taken every 5 °C. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for at least 20 min at 20 °C before starting each scan. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence was measured in a 5-mm (Hellma 101.016-QS) cuvette at 20 °C using a Cary Eclipse (Varian) spectrofluorometer. Concentration of T-domain was 1 μm in 40 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and fluorescence was measured between 300 and 400 nm wavelength with a scan rate of 120 nm/min. Excitation and emission slits were set to 5 nm. TolA variants were added in aliquots and mixed, and spectra were measured again. Measured spectra were corrected for the contribution of the sample without T-domain and the dilution factor. Thermal unfolding of the T-domain·TolA-(296–421) 1:5 (mol:mol) complex was done at a rate of 1 °C/min in the range 15–90 °C. A full spectrum was taken every 5 °C. After mixing of T-domain and TolA-(296–421), the resulting complex was allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 min at 15 °C before measurement. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was performed on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. Proteins or mixtures applied contained 2 nmol of colicin N or A, 6 nmol of T-domain of colicin N, and 20 nmol of TolA-(296–421), TolA-(329–421), or TolAT. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements—SPR was performed on a BIACORE-X apparatus. TolA-(296–421) was immobilized on a CM5 chip as described before (32Gökçe I. Raggett E.M. Hong Q. Virden R. Cooper A. Lakey J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The chip was equilibrated for more than 30 min after each temperature change. Solutions of desired T-domain concentration in HBS (10 mm HEPES (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl (British Drug House), 3.4 mm EDTA (Amersham Biosciences)), 0.05% P20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, Amersham Biosciences, Biosensor AB), pH 7.4, were passed across the chip at 5 μl/min. The resulting sensorgrams were fitted separately to a 1:1 binding model to obtain ka, kd, and Kd using BIAevaluation software. The detailed data analysis that was applied can be found in Gökçe et al. (32Gökçe I. Raggett E.M. Hong Q. Virden R. Cooper A. Lakey J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TolA C Terminus Is Involved in T-domain Binding—For this study three different C-terminal variants of the TolA protein were prepared in E. coli. TolA-(296–421) is the predicted size of TolAIII from sequence analysis, and TolA-(329–421), which by removing a further 33 amino acids from the N terminus, equates to the residues that were immobile enough to be resolved in the x-ray structure of a g3p protein (N1 domain)-TolA complex (Protein Data Bank code 1TOL) (37Lubkowski J. Hennecke F. Pluckthun A. Wlodawer A. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TolAT is the only variant with an altered C terminus; this consists of a flexible linker of 12 amino acids that contains a thrombin cleavage site (GGGSLVPRGSGT). The longer construct, TolA-(296–421), was used in most studies to ensure that all the required residues were present for the interaction. The complex was formed at CD concentrations (10–70 μm) by mixing 1:1 molar ratios of free proteins, which reach equilibrium within minutes (32Gökçe I. Raggett E.M. Hong Q. Virden R. Cooper A. Lakey J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Anderluh G. Hong Q. Boetzel R. MacDonald C. Moore G.R. Virden R. Lakey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21860-21868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus with a Kd of approximately 1 μm at least 90% of protein is in the bound state. In fluorescence measurements the lower concentrations used required us to use an excess of TolA-(296–421) (1:5 T-domain:TolA ratio) to saturate the T-domain. This is possible due to the absence of interfering tryptophan fluorescence in TolA-(296–421). The CD spectra confirm the folded nature of the TolA constructs (Fig. 1A). The estimated secondary structure content for TolA-(329–421) is H38/S23/T10/R29 (percentage of helix/strand/turn/random) using the known three-dimensional structure (37Lubkowski J. Hennecke F. Pluckthun A. Wlodawer A. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It was most accurately analyzed using the CDSSTR program of the Dichroweb site 2See www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cdweb/. (41Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). There was, however, a consistent underestimation of the helix content with a fitted content of H28/S24/T20/R27. TolA-(296–421) shows a larger amount of random and β-strand (H20/S30/T22/R30) that is presumably due to the flexible extension not present in the solved structure. As expected the T-domain in solution is predicted to have more random structure (H4/S31/T23/R41), but the strand content is significant. The binding of full-length (ColN-(1–90)) T-domain to these TolA variants was measured using fluorescence spectroscopy and gel filtration chromatography. The T-domain contains two tryptophans that become buried upon TolA binding causing both an increase and a blue shift of their fluorescence emission (32Gökçe I. Raggett E.M. Hong Q. Virden R. Cooper A. Lakey J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Raggett E.M. Bainbridge G. Evans L.J.A. Cooper A. Lakey J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28 (L. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21860-21868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both TolA variants with natural C termini bound to T-domain with similar affinity. However, TolAT showed no binding (Table I) even after treatment with thrombin, which removes 4 of the additional 12 amino acids. Since this assay only detects interactions with Kd < 10 μm (32Gökçe I. Raggett E.M. Hong Q. Virden R. Cooper A. Lakey J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) we cannot eliminate a weakened interaction, but this is the first data to indicate the importance of a natural TolAIII C terminus in ColN binding. Supporting data were obtained by using gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2). Here the binding of three TolA constructs to ColN T-domain was analyzed. A decrease in elution volume (increase in size) was observed when T-domain was mixed with TolA-(296–421) and TolA-(329–421) but not in the presence of TolAT. Similar results were obtained with full-length colicins N and A (not shown) and showed that the C-terminal extension in TolAT inhibits binding of colicin A as well (see “Discussion”). The molecular masses determined from the calibration curve corresponded to 1:1 complexes. Interestingly the 98-residue His-tagged ColN-(1–90) eluted earlier and gave a larger predicted size of 15.7 kDa compared with the 100-residue His-tagged TolA-(329–421) (predicted size, 13.4 kDa). This might be expected if its unfolded state leads to a slightly larger hydrodynamic radius.Table IKd values for the binding of TolA constructs to T-domain of colicin NProteinKdkakdμm× 104 m-1 s-1s-1FluorescenceTolAII-III0.26 ± 0.014TolA-(296-421)1.25 ± 0.17TolA-(329-421)0.19 ± 0.007TolATNBaNB, no binding was observed.TolAT, thrombin-cleavedNBSPRTolA-(296-421), 20 °C0.35 ± 0.024.78 ± 0.410.016 ± 0.0002TolA-(296-421), 25 °C0.83 ± 0.185.00 ± 0.710.042 ± 0.002TolA-(296-421), 30 °C2.72 ± 1.514.25 ± 1.960.092 ± 0.006a NB, no binding was observed. Open table in a new tab Secondary Structure Increases upon Binding—By expressing the far-UV CD spectra in units of Δϵ where concentration is in moles of protein/liter rather than the more conventional moles of residues/liter we can generate the expected spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of TolA-(296–421) and T-domain (Fig. 1B). This can be compared with the measured far-UV CD spectrum of the 1:1 complex. The spectra are different, indicating that changes in secondary structure occur upon binding. The difference between TolA-(296–421) and the complex is also shown (Fig. 1A). This may correspond to the new structure of the T-domain with a reduction in the unstructured component and its replacement by a secondary structure signal (210–225 nm). A small difference was observed when T-domain was mixed with TolAT (not shown), which is in agreement with a weaker binding that is only detectable at the higher protein concentrations used in CD. Another control was performed where mutant F66C of T-domain was added to TolA-(296–421). This mutant does not bind to TolA at all (34Anderluh G. Hong Q. Boetzel R. MacDonald C. Moore G.R. Virden R. Lakey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21860-21868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and in this case the difference between predicted and experimental spectra was negligible. Tertiary Structure Increases upon Binding—The near-UV CD spectra of T-domain is virtually featureless and consistent with its mobile and exposed aromatic residues (Fig. 3A) (42Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum, New York1996Crossref Google Scholar). The spectra of TolA-(296–421) and TolAT exhibit a single minimum at ∼280 nm. This is almost certainly due to some of its 4 tyrosine residues being immobilized since it contains no tryptophan residues and phenylalanine contributions are weak (43Craig S. Pain R.H. Schmeissner U. Virden R. Wingfield P.T. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1989; 33: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The near-UV CD spectrum of the 1:1 complex between TolA-(296–421) and T-domain is, like the far-UV CD spectra, not simply a sum of the individual spectra (Fig. 3B). The complex has less intensity at 280 nm and a small shoulder visible at ∼290 nm. It is important to note that the contributions to the near-UV CD spectra of individual residues can be positive or negative, and therefore, a reduction in intensity on binding a new peptide does not necessarily mean unfolding. The difference between the predicted and experimental spectra is shown in Fig. 3C (solid line). This reveals an additional positive signal in the spectrum of the complex in the region 270–290 nm with clearly resolved peaks at 272, 279, and 290 nm. The latter is unique to tryptophan and thus can be directly linked to T-domain folding upon binding. The difference for the complex made using TolAT is much less pronounced (Fig. 3C) in agreement with its reduced affinity for T-domain. As expected experimental and predicted spectra are virtually identical when the non-binding mutant F66C and TolA-(296–421) are mixed (Fig. 3C). Thermal Dissociation of the Complex Releases a Folded TolAIII Domain—The T-domain, TolA-(296–421), and their 1:1 complex were thermally denatured to characterize the stability of the acquired structure. Thermal denaturation was followed by far-UV and near-UV CD (Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7). Upon heating T-domain to 90 °C the far-UV CD signal at 198 nm decreases (Fig. 4A) with a concomitant increase of the broad shoulder at ∼222 nm. In the temperature range of 15 to 90 °C, a noncooperative transition was observed (Figs. 4 and 6); however, an isodichroic point was observed at 209 nm indicating a two-state transition also observed in simple model peptides (44Eker F.

https://openalex.org/W1987887889,"Characterization of hematopoiesis/erythropoiesis in thalassemias from multipotent primitive cells to mature erythrocytes is of fundamental importance and clinical relevance. We investigated this process in α- and β-globin hemizygous mice, lacking the two adult tandemly organized genes from either the α- or β-globin locus. Although both mice backcrossed on a homogeneous background exhibited similar reduced red blood cell (RBC) survival, β-globin hemizygous mice had less severe reticulocyte loss and globin chain imbalance, suggesting an apparently milder thalassemia than for α-globin hemizygous mice. In contrast, however, β-globin hemizygous mice displayed a more marked perturbation of hematologic parameters. Quantification of erythroid precursor subpopulations in marrow and spleen of β-globin hemizygous mice showed more severely impaired maturation from the basophilic to orthochromatophilic erythroblasts and substantial loss of these late precursors probably as a consequence of a greater susceptibility to an excess of free α-chain than β-chain. Hence, only erythroid precursors exhibiting stochastically moderate chain imbalance would escape death and mature to reticulocyte/RBC stage, leading to survival and minimal loss of reticulocytes in the β-globin hemizygous mice. Furthermore, in response to the ineffective erythropoiesis in β-globin hemizygous mice, a dynamic compensatory hematopoiesis was observed at earlier differentiation stage as evidenced by a significant increase of erythroid progenitors (erythroid colony-forming units ∼100-fold) as well as of multipotent primitive cells (day 12 spleen colony-forming units ∼7-fold). This early compensatory mechanism was less pronounced in α-globin hemizygous mice. The expansion of multipotent primitive and potentially stem cell populations, taken together with ineffective erythropoiesis and increased reticulocyte/RBC destruction could confer major cumulative advantage for gene targeting/bone marrow transplantation. Therefore, this study not only corroborated the strong potential effectiveness of transplantation for thalassemic hematopoietic therapy but also demonstrated the existence of a differential regulatory response for α- and β-thalassemia.

Thalassemia, among the most frequent of inherited diseases, constitutes a heterogeneous disorder based on clinical severity, pathophysiology, and molecular changes. This hemoglobinopathy has been classified into two major groups, α- and β-thalassemia, reflecting impairment or absence of either α or β chain synthesis. The level of globin chain imbalance, resulting from a change in the relative ratio of α- and β-globin chains, appears directly related to the severity of thalassemia in humans. A variety of mutations including deletions, frameshifts, nonsense, and abnormal splicing lead to a thalassemic phenotype (1Coleman M.B. Lu Z.H. Smith II, C.M. Adams III, J.G. Harrell A.

Dyson J. Hemoglobin: Molecular Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W.B. Saunders, Philadelphia1986: 322-371Google Scholar). In symptomatic patients, α- and β-thalassemia display similar abnormal red blood cell (RBC) features including microcytosis, hypochromia, anisocytosis, and poikilocytosis. The excess of one normal globin chain in RBC forms aggregates, leading to premature cell destruction. Thalassemic RBC membranes are rigid, showing instability in the case of β-thalassemia and hyperstability in α-thalassemia (7Schrier S.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Bone marrow from affected individuals usually undergoes erythroid hyperplasia associated with increased production of erythroblasts and moderate to severe splenomegaly. Ineffective erythropoiesis, more prominent in β-than in α-thalassemia, is also observed (8Bothwell T.H. Charlton R.W. Cook J.D. Finch C.A. Iron Metabolism in Man.

Although chronic transfusion improves survival, it leads progressively to iron accumulation and tissue damage in several organs.Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been successfully used as a therapy for thalassemia. However, the morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure as well as the difficulty in obtaining histocompatible donors remain problematic (11Giardini C. Galimberti M. Lucarelli G. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12La Nasa G. Giardini C. Argiolu F. Locatelli F. Arras M. De Stefano P. Ledda A. Pizzati A. Sanna M.A. Vacca A. Lucarelli G. Contu L. Blood. 2002; 99: 4350-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These problems could potentially be alleviated by the use of autologous bone marrow transplantation following gene therapy correction. In both cases, a detailed characterization of the altered hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis in α- and β-thalassemia is necessary to develop an effective cure for thalassemic patients.Initial mouse models of α- and β-thalassemia were generated following radiation-induced or genetically induced mutations (13Martinell J.

Cell. 1983; 34: 1043-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). More recently, α- and β-globin hemizygous mice have been produced by targeted deletion of the adult globin genes (16Paszty C. Mohandas N. Stevens M.E. Loring J.F. Liebhaber S.A. Brion C.M. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Ciavatta D.J. Ryan T.M. Farmer S.C. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9259-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The α-globin hemizygous mice, with deletion of the two adult α-globin genes, genetically reproduce the human α-thalassemia 1. Similarly, β-globin hemizygous mice correspond genotypically to heterozygous β-thalassemia. A thorough characterization of hematopoiesis/erythropoiesis in these globin hemizygous mice is required to determine the fundamental cellular defects and whether these mice reproduce the human diseases, particularly as these globin hemizygous mice are becoming widely used as models of human thalassemia.Herein, we report such an investigation in these α- and β-globin hemizygous mice both bred and compared for the first time on an identical genetic background. These mice with half their adult α- or β-globin gene content demonstrated thalassemia. On this homogeneous background, the α-globin compared with β-globin hemizygous mice had greater globin chain imbalance in peripheral RBC, a surprising result considering that β-globin hemizygous mice had more severe anemia. However, we demonstrated that the β-globin hemizygous mice had a more severely hindered late erythroid precursor maturation attributed to an increase cell loss upon the onset of α-globin chain expression that occurred earlier than for the β-globin chain. Furthermore, consequent to the ineffective erythropoiesis, the β-globin relative to α-globin hemizygous mice underwent a more pronounced compensatory stimulation of the multipotent primitive cell populations and of early erythropoiesis. Finally, the inverse correlation between the compensatory erythropoietic/hematopoietic stimulation and the severe alterations of hematologic parameters suggested that the level of anemia might provide a reliable index for the potential effectiveness of gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation in thalassemias.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal StudiesHemizygous α-globin globin mice (Hbatm1Paz/Hbaa) and β-globin mice (Hbbtm1Tow/Hbbs) were a generous gift from Drs. C. Paszty and E. Rubin and from Dr. T. Townes, respectively (16Paszty C. Mohandas N. Stevens M.E. Loring J.F. Liebhaber S.A. Brion C.M. Rubin E.M. Nat.

Both of these lines have been backcrossed for multiple generations (>10) with C57BL/6J inbred mice to avoid the effects of various genetic backgrounds. The α-globin hemizygous mice (C57BL/6J hemi-αthal) were identified as previously described (16Paszty C. Mohandas N. Stevens M.E. Loring J.F. Liebhaber S.A. Brion C.M. Rubin E.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The β-globin hemizygous mice (C57BL/6J hemi-βthal) were also identified following PCR amplification using three primers; two were localized in the wild type β-globin gene, forward (5′-GAGCAATGTGGACAGAGAAGGAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TGATGTCTGTTTCTGGGGTTGTG-3′), producing a 450-bp amplicon and a third neomycin-specific reverse primer (5′-TGAAGAGCTTGGCGGCGAATGGG-3′) that will generate a 650-bp amplicon. The DNA was amplified in a PCR buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.9, 50 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2) containing 0.2 mm each dNTP, 0.4 μm concentration of the forward and 0.2 μm concentration of each reverse primer, and 3.0 units of Taq, in a 20-μl reaction volume. Amplification was performed for 30 cycles of 92 °C (20 s), 65 °C (35 s), and 68 °C (105 s).Globin Chain AnalysisAnalysis of globin chain synthesis was carried out on a population of reticulocyte-enriched cells (11–33.6%) including RBC that can no longer synthesize globin chains. Cells were collected in heparinized Micro-Hematocrit capillary tubes from the tail vein.

(>99.4%) were washed three times in 1× Dulbecco's PBS and incubated in 1 ml of [3H]leucine labeling mix (18Fabry M.E. Suzuka S.M. Weinberg R.S. Lawrence C. Factor S.M. Gilman J.G. Costantini F.

The RBC were then lysed, and the hemoglobin solution was quantified as previously described (19Masala B. Manca L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 21-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The hemoglobin solution (100 μg) was used to determine the globin chain content by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac large pore C4 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Grace Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Globin chains were resolved with a helium-degassed modified trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient: phase A (0.18% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v) in 36% acetonitrile) and phase B (0.18% trifluoroacetic acid (w/v) in 46% acetonitrile) (20Fabry M.E. Sengupta A. Suzuka S.M. Costantini F. Rubin E.M. Hofrichter J. Christoph G. Manci E. Culberson D. Factor S.M. Nagel R.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 2419-2428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shelton J.B. Shelton J.R. Schroeder W.A. J. Liquid Chromatogr. 1984; 7: 1969-1977Crossref Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Globin chains were eluted by increasing mobile phase B from 33 to 37% over 15 min and, subsequently, to 70% over 35 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the elution profiles were followed by UV detection at 220 nm. One-ml sample fractions were collected, counted, and corrected for background levels to evaluate α- or β-globin chain synthesis and to determine the ratio of α- or β-globin on total globin chains synthesized.To prepare RBC ghosts, 1 ml of blood obtained by cardiac puncture was washed three times in 0.9% cold saline. The packed RBCs were lysed as described previously (22Rouyer-Fessard P. Leroy-Viard K. Domenget C. Mrad A. Beuzard Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20247-20251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 8.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (7.5 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm disodium EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 0.12 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2.9 μm pepstatin A (23Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Protein biosynthesis was measured by incubating the RBCs with 3 ml of translation [3H]leucine labeling mix for 1, 1.5, and 2 h prior to lysis. Membrane proteins were separated by urea-Triton PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and quantified with ImageQuant software version 5.0 or by autoradiography on a Kodak Biomax MR film, as described previously (24Blouin M.-J. Beauchemin H. Wright A. DePaepe M. Sorette M. Bleau A.-M. Nakamoto B. Ou C.-N. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Trudel M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Hematologic ParametersBlood was analyzed using flow cytometry-based hematology with the mouse archetype of multispecies software version 2.2.06 (Bayer Advia 120, Tarrytown, NY). A Mie scatter theory was used to determine the volume and hemoglobin concentration for each cell by analysis of low and high angle light scattering as previously described (24Blouin M.-J. Beauchemin H. Wright A. DePaepe M. Sorette M. Bleau A.-M. Nakamoto B. Ou C.-N. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Trudel M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The percentage of hypochromic RBCs (mean cellular hemoglobin concentration, less than 22 g/dl) and the percentage of microcytic cells (volume less than 25 fl) were evaluated by appropriate gating of the cellular hemoglobin concentration mean and the mean cellular volume. Reticulocyte counts were obtained by specific RNA staining with the oxazine 750 dye using the reticulocyte channel of the Bayer Advia 120.RBC SurvivalRBC survival was evaluated using biotinylation of the entire RBC cohort and monitoring for RBC replacement. Biotinylation of RBCs was carried out by intravenous injection of 250 μl of 3.6 mg/ml of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (VWR; Montreal, Canada) for three consecutive days. RBCs (∼3 × 106) obtained from 1–5 μl of tail vein blood were labeled with 9.2 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (BIO/CAN; Toronto, Canada) in 1 ml of PBS. The number of biotinylated cells in circulating blood was determined at t = 0 and monitored at regular intervals by flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis and QuantitationFlow cytometry analysis was performed on bone marrow and spleen samples from C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J hemi-αthal, and C57BL/6J hemi-βthal mice. Bone marrow cells were harvested by flushing one femur with PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum. Spleen cells were suspended in 2% fetal calf serum/PBS by subsequent passage through decreasing size needles (18-, 20-, and 23-gauge). Cells (5 × 105 or 7.5 × 105) were incubated in 2% fetal calf serum/PBS with antibodies for 30 min on ice according to standard techniques. The labeling with anti-mouse TER119-phycoerythrin (0.2 ng) and biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD71 (transferrin receptor) (0.5 ng) was detected with streptavidin-allophycocyanin (0.2 ng) (BD Biosciences). Apoptosis as defined by phosphatidylserine exposure on erythroid precursors was detected with 1–1.5 μl of Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed on a flow cytometer FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) using CellQuest Pro version 4.0.2 software, and quantification was carried out with WinMDI version 2.8 software. Small cell debris was excluded by gating on a forward scatter plot, and erythroid precursors were identified as TER119+ CD71+ cells.Quantitation of cell loss at specific subpopulation stage depends on the following: 1) subpopulation between two consecutive stages: stage i ⇒ stage i + 1; 2) percentage (P) of cells at two consecutive stages for control and hemizygous (Picont⇒Pi+1cont; Pihe⇒Pi+1he; and 3) total number of cells in a subpopulation (Ns).The expected number of cells based on controls from stage i ⇒ stage i + 1 is as follows. PiheNs⇒PihePi+1contPicontNs(Eq. 1) The absolute cell loss can be defined as the difference between the expected number of cells and the observed number of cells. [PihePi+1contPicont−Pi+1he]Ns(Eq. 2) The cell loss relative to controls can be written as follows. PihePi+1contPilcont−Pi+1hePihePi+1contPicont×100(Eq. 3) The equation can be rearranged to give the following, (1−Pi+1hePicontPiheP i+1 cont)×100(Eq. 4) which equals the percentage of cell loss from the Pi subpopulation.Hematopoietic Progenitor StudiesClonogenic Assays—Clonogenic assays were performed on C57BL/6J hemi-αthal, C57BL/6J hemi-βthal, and control C57BL/6J mice. Progenitor cell analyses were carried out on three hematopoietic tissues: bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen. Peripheral blood cells were obtained from the buffy coat, washed twice in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium plus 5% fetal calf serum and once in PBS; RBC lysis was obtained following incubation in 5 ml of Gey's solution (8.3 g/liter NH4Cl, 1 g/liter KHCO3, pH 7.2) for 2 min at 37 °C, and the cells were resuspended in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. Bone marrow cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and spleen single-cell suspensions were plated, respectively, at a density of 105, 106, and 5 × 105 cells/ml in 1% methylcellulose/Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium as previously described (25Trudel M. De Paepe M.E. Chretien N. Saadane N. Jacmain J. Sorette M. Hoang T. Beuzard Y. Blood. 1994; 84: 3189-3197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in duplicate for each animal. Erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) were counted after 2 days in culture, whereas burst-forming units (BFU-E), granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), and macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-M) were counted at 7 days, and granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GEMM) was counted on day 11. Results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. from all animals analyzed. For each genotype, the percentage of spleen weight per total body weight was also determined.Day 12 Spleen Colony-forming Unit (CFU-S12) Evaluation—Peripheral blood, bone marrow, and spleen cell suspensions were used to quantify multipotent CFU-S12 (26Blouin M.-J. De Paepe M. Trudel M. Blood. 1999; 94: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The numbers of CFU-S12 were determined for C57BL/6J hemi-αthal, C57BL/6J hemi-βthal, and control C57BL/6J mice using 2 × 106 nucleated cells from peripheral blood and 5 × 104 nucleated cells from bone marrow. Similarly, splenic CFU-S12 was evaluated for C57BL/6J hemi-αthal, C57BL/6J hemi-βthal, and C57BL/6J mice using, respectively, 2 × 106, 5 × 105, and 106 nucleated spleen cells. Cells were injected into the tail vein of irradiated C57BL/6J mice (at 900 rads), and CFU-S colonies were counted on day 12.Statistical MethodsUnpaired two-sample Student's t test was used for statistical analysis; p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSImbalanced Globin Chains in Both Hemizygous MiceThe α- and β-globin hemizygous mice (C57BL/6J hemi-αthal and C57BL/6J hemi-βthal) have been generated by targeted deletion of the two adult tandem genes at the α- or β-globin locus, respectively. To characterize the α- and β-globin hemizygous mice on the same genetic background, we backcrossed these mice to the C57BL/6J strain for more than 10 generations. We then investigated whether soluble globin chain levels were imbalanced at three short time periods of de novo synthesis in reticulocytes and at steady state in peripheral blood, which consisted of more than 99.4% reticulocytes and RBC. Short biosynthesis periods in reticulocytes are necessary to detect severe chain imbalances apart from cell destruction that may occur with time. As shown in Table I, in the β-globin hemizygous mice, the biosynthesis of the β-globin chain was significantly decreased at all time points compared with controls (11–14%). For the α-globin hemizygous mice, the α-globin synthesis displayed a stronger decrease compared with controls (17–23%). Thus, both of these globin hemizygous mice have thalassemia, but comparison of relative globin chain levels revealed a more severe imbalance for the α-globin hemizygous mice. When the ratio of soluble globin chains in peripheral blood was evaluated at steady state, it appeared improved for both hemizygous mice (Table I), suggesting loss of reticulocytes. Whereas complete chain balance was attained for the β-globin hemizygous mice, imbalance was still detected in the α-globin hemizygous mice. To assess whether the differential response between the hemi-βthal and hemi-αthal mice is due to an increased tendency of the excess α-globin chains from hemi-βthal to associate with erythroid cell membranes, we have monitored the levels of globin chains in reticulocyte membranes in these mice as a function of total protein (Table II). A significant amount of the globin chain in excess was trapped in reticulocyte membranes for both the hemizygous mice as determined by biosynthetic labeling, whereas no membrane-bound globin chain was detected in controls. However, at all time points assessed, the hemi-βthal mice had lesser amounts of membrane-trapped globin chain than the hemi-αthal mice (Table II), consistent with the soluble globin chain data (Table I). Hence, this confirmed a more severe imbalance for the hemi-αthal rather than an increased tendency of α-chain to associate with membranes in hemi-βthal. In contrast to the de novo reticulocyte synthesis data, the percentage of membrane-trapped globin chain was similar in peripheral blood at steady state for both hemizygous mice (Table II), again supporting a loss of immature erythroid cells, mainly reticulocytes. Noticeably, the membrane-trapped globin chain levels were significantly higher in both hemizygous mice than in control mice in agreement with the thalassemic phenotype.Table IAnalysis of soluble globin chains in α- and β-hemizygous miceMiceTime of biosynthesisSteady state1 h2 h2.5 h%%%%Control: C57BL/6JPercentage of α chain/total chains47.1 ± 1.048.7 ± 1.750.0 ± 0.950.0 ± 0.9Percentage of β chain/total chains52.9 ± 1.0 (n = 4)51.3 ± 1.7 (n = 4)50.0 ± 0.9 (n = 3)50.0 ± 0.9 (n = 8)C57BL/6J hemi-αthalPercentage of α chain/total chains37.1 ± 1.9ap < 0.0005.37.1 ± 1.5bp < 0.0001.41.4 ± 2.0cp < 0.005.45.9 ± 0.6dp < 10-5.Percentage of β chain/total chains62.9 ± 1.9ap < 0.0005.

Open table in a new tab Hematologic ParametersMature RBCs in the globin hemizygous mice were analyzed to determine whether the hematologic parameters were compatible with those seen in human α- and β-thalassemias (Table III). Hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit were both decreased by ∼10–20% in the hemi-αthal and by ∼50% in the hemi-βthal, indicating moderate and severe anemia, respectively. The RBCs displayed a similar reduced mean cellular volume of 18 and 23% and mean cellular hemoglobin of 25 and 30% for the hemi-αthal and hemi-βthal mice, respectively. The morphology of the RBC was also altered. Notably, the red cell distribution width was significantly increased 1.8- and 2.6-fold in hemi-αthal and hemi-βthal mice relative to controls, showing heterogeneity of cell size. Consistently, the number of microcytic and of hypochromic cells was also increased in hemi-αthal and hemi-βthal mice, with the hemi-βthal being more severely affected. Furthermore, reticulocyte numbers were significantly increased in both globin hemizygous mice relative to controls, suggesting stimulation of erythropoiesis. Thus, as shown in Table III, the hematologic parameters and the anemia were exacerbated in the hemi-βthal relative to the hemi-αthal mice. This was in contrast with the more severe globin chain imbalance observed in the hemi-αthal mice (Tables I and II).Table IIIAltered hematological parameters in α- and β-globin hemizygous miceMicenHbHctMCVMCHRDWMicro (V < 25 fl)Hypo (HC < 22 g/dl)Reticg/dl%flpg%%%Control: C57BL/6J1015.4 ± 1.951.5 ± 6.249.4 ± 1.314.7 ± 1.013.7 ± 1.10.2 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.23.7 ± 0.7C57BL/6J hemi-αthal712.3 ± 0.9ap < 0.001.45.7 ± 3.2bp < 0.05.40.5 ± 0.9ap < 0.001.10.9 ± 0.2ap < 0.001.24.4 ± 2.1ap < 0.001.6.0 ± 1.9ap < 0.001.4.9 ± 1.2ap < 0.001.7.1 ± 0.8ap < 0.001.C57BL/6J hemi-βthal36.7 ± 1.1ap < 0.001.25.0 ± 3.0ap < 0.001.37.3 ± 3.4ap < 0.001.10.2 ± 0.4ap < 0.001.36.1 ± 1.3ap < 0.001.19.9 ± 4.0ap < 0.001.19.1 ± 8.2cp < 0.01.22.9 ± 6.0ap < 0.001.a p < 0.001.b p < 0.05.c p < 0.01.

To further delineate the structures that constitute the ion pore and selectivity filter of the ρ1 GABA receptor, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method with charged reagents to identify anion- and cation-accessible surfaces. Twenty-one consecutive residues were mutated to cysteine, one at a time, in the presumed intracellular end of the first transmembrane domain (TM1; Ala271-Met276), the entire linker connecting TM1 to TM2 (Leu277-Arg287), and the presumed intracellular end of TM2 (Ala288-Ala291). Positively (MTSEA+) and negatively (pCMBS–) charged sulfhydryl reagents, as well as Cd2+, were added extracellularly to test accessibility of the engineered cysteines. Four of the mutants, all at the intracellular end of TM2 (R287C, V289C, P290C, A291C), were accessible to positively charged reagents, whereas seven mutants (A271C, T272C, L277C, W279C, V280C, P290C, A291C) were functionally modified by negatively charged pCMBS–. These seven modified residues were at the intracellular end of TM2, in the TM1-TM2 linker, and at the intracellular end of TM1. In nearly all cases (excluding P290C), the rate and the degree of modification were state-dependent, with greater accessibility in the presence of agonist. Select cysteine mutants were combined with a point mutation (A291E) that converted the pore from chloride- to non-selective. In this case, positively charged reagents could modify residues in the TM1-TM2 linker (Leu277 and Val280), supporting the notion that the modifying reagents were reaching their target through the pore. Taken together, our results suggest that, up to its intracellular end, the TM2 domain is not charge selective. In addition, we propose that the TM1-TM2 linker and the intracellular end of TM1 are along the pathway of the permeating ion.

Akabas M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) along with mutations that alter the ion selectivity (13Wotring V.E. Miller T.S. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to test the potential role of the TM1-TM2 loop and adjacent regions in ion permeation through the ρ1 GABA receptor pore. Employing positively (MTSEA+, Cd2+) and negatively (pCMBS–) charged reagents that interact with these cysteine residues, we determined that the intracellular TM2 domain, all the way to its intracellular end, is non-selective in terms of charge. Interestingly, the TM1-TM2 linker and the intracellular end of TM1 are only accessible to the negatively charged reagent, pCMBS–. After converting the pore to be non-selective by incorporating the A291E mutation, we find three residues in the TM1-TM2 linker that are now accessible to positively charged reagents. The results are interpreted in terms of the pore architecture, location of the selectivity filter, and potential structural rearrangements during channel activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis of GABA ρ1 Receptor and in Vitro RNA Transcription— The human ρ1 subunit was obtained through PCR as described previously (16Amin J. Weiss D.S. Recept. Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the pGEMHE vector (17Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The single A271C, T272C, L273C, M274C, V275C, M276C, L277C, S278C, W279C, V280C, S281C, F282C, W283C, I284C, D285C, R286C, R287C, A288C, V289C, P290C, A291C and double A271C/A291E, T272C/A291E, M276C/A291E, L277C/A291E, W279C/A291E, V280C/A291E, R287C/A291E mutations were accomplished with PCR mutagenesis using an overlap extension protocol (18Kammann M. Laufs J. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 12: 4445-4452Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by cDNA sequencing.The cDNA of each clone was linearized with NheI, and run-off capped cRNA was transcribed from the linearized cDNA with standard in vitro transcription procedures (19Amin J. Dickerson I. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar). The cRNA was purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the integrity and yield were verified on a 1% agarose gel.Expression and Recording from Oocytes—Oocytes from Xenopus laevis were prepared and maintained as described previously (16Amin J. Weiss D.S. Recept. Channels. 1994; 2: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar). Individual ρ1 wild-type or mutant cRNA were injected into each oocyte (total of 0.5–5 ng). A two-electrode voltage-clamp (GeneClamp 500, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for current recording 3 or 4 days after cRNA injection at a holding potential from –70 to –50 mV. The current signal was low-pass filtered at 10 Hz and digitized at 50 Hz. Data were analyzed using Igor software (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Dose-response relations were fit with the following form of the Hill equation using a nonlinear least-squares method I=Imax1+(EC50/[A])n(Eq. 1) in which I is the peak current response at a given concentration of agonist (A), Imax is the maximum current response, EC50 is the concentration of the agonist yielding half-maximal activation, and n is the Hill coefficient. Data were compared statistically by a Student's t test. Statistical significance was determined at the 5% level. All results are presented as the mean ± S.E.The external recording solution contained 92.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances ranging from 1 to 3 mΩ. The ground electrode was connected to the recording bath by means of a 3 m KCl/agar bridge.Determination of Permeability Ratios—Details of the method for determining the relative permeability to sodium, potassium, and chloride have been provided previously (20Wotring V.E. Chang Y. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. (London). 1999; 521.2: 327-336Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In all cases, GABA (Calbiochem) was applied at the concentration required for half-maximal activation (EC50), and voltage ramps were used to determine reversal potentials under the various ionic conditions. The permeabilities (P) of ions relative to chloride were then calculated using the Goldman Hodgkin-Katz equation (21Hodgkin A.L. Katz B. J. Physiol. 1949; 108: 37-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar) with internal ion activities used previously (20Wotring V.E. Chang Y. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. (London). 1999; 521.2: 327-336Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and the known activities for external chloride and replacement ions. Permeability coefficients were determined using Eq. 2, and reversal potentials (Vrev) were measured at various activities of extracellular chloride and sodium. Vrev=−58log[(PNa[Na]i+PK[K]i+PCl[X]o)/(PNa[y]o+Pk[K]o+PCl[Cl]i)](Eq. 2) Permeability coefficients for sodium and potassium were fit simultaneously (holding PCl at 1 for normalization purposes) with reversal potentials measured in OR2, low sodium, and low chloride. Data from five individual oocytes were fitted separately and then averaged to provide a standard error.Accessibility Tests of Mutated Residues to pCMBS–, MTSEA+, and Cd2+—We tested the accessibility of cysteines to sulfhydryl reagents applied extracellularly in the presence or in the absence of GABA. For each mutant, we used a GABA concentration at least 8-fold higher than the EC50. Before sulfhydryl reagent application, each oocyte was stabilized in the recording solution for 3–10 min, at which time three GABA-evoked currents were obtained. Experiments were continued if the amplitude of the control GABA-activated current varied by less than 3%. After sulfhydryl reagent application, the oocyte was washed for 3–4 min in the recording solution, and test GABA pulses were applied. The amplitude of the current after exposure to the modifying reagent was normalized to the control amplitude. Functional modification of wild-type and mutant receptors was compared using the Student's t test (p ≤ 0.05) or the analysis of variance Dunnet test (p < 0.5).To estimate the rate of modification by sulfydryl reagents, the amplitude of the test GABA pulse was plotted as a function of the cumulative time in the reagent (applied for 15 s every 3–5 min). The relationship between current amplitude and time was fitted (and well described) by a single exponential function. Data were compared statistically by the Student's t test. Statistical significance was determined at the 5% level. All results are presented as the mean ± S.E.RESULTSGeneral Properties of the Cysteine Mutants—Twenty-one residues at the presumed intracellular ends of TM1 and TM2, as well as the linker connecting TM1 to TM2, were individually mutated to cysteine in the ρ1 GABA receptor (Fig. 1). The properties of the homomeric ρ1 mutants were probed by GABA application (from 0.1 μm to 100 mm) 2–3 days after cRNA injection into Xenopus oocytes. Nineteen mutants showed robust GABA-activated currents, whereas M274C and D285C exhibited no functional expression. We do not know whether these two mutant receptors were expressed on the cell surface and were non-functional, or whether the mutation impaired receptor assembly. Fig. 2A shows GABA-mediated responses for wild-type receptors and select mutants. L273C, M276C, L277C, W279C, S281C, I284C, R287C, A288C, V289C, P290C, and A291C exhibited minor (< 3-fold) shifts in the GABA EC50 (concentration required for half-maximal activation) compared with the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2B). The largest shift in EC50 (∼22-fold increase) was observed for V280C.Fig. 2Effects of cysteine mutations on GABA receptor function. A, examples of GABA-activated currents from the wild-type receptor and select cysteine mutants. S281C exhibited a steady-state current in the absence of GABA that was antagonized by picrotoxin, suggesting the mutant was spontaneously active. Note that Met274 and Asp285 were non-functional. B, average of the EC50 for all cysteine mutants compared with that of the wild type. Mutants that exhibited a signficant difference from the wild-type receptor are indicated by asterisk. Only V280C exhibited a dramatic change in GABA sensitivity. C, average of the relative permeabilities for potassium (□) and sodium (▪) relative to that of Cl–. All mutants retained their high selectivity for Cl– over that of sodium and potassium. For comparison, the ΔP290/A291E and A291E mutations plotted to the right of the graph show substitutions that have been shown previously to convert the receptor to cationic and non-selective (13Wotring V.E. Miller T.S. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Some of the cysteine mutations imparted other changes in receptor properties. For example, although wild-type ρ1 receptors show essentially no desensitization, M276C, F282C, I284C, R287C, V289C, and A291C exhibited a decay in the GABA-mediated current during prolonged agonist application (Fig. 2A). In addition, oocytes expressing S281C exhibited a greater than normal resting current in the absence of GABA that was blocked by the GABA receptor antagonist picrotoxin, suggesting the receptor was spontaneously active (Fig. 2A). Finally, W279C exhibited a dramatically prolonged current decay after GABA removal (τ = 200 ± 20 s, n = 6), compared with that of the wild-type ρ1 receptor (τ = 20 ± 3 s, n = 8).We also examined all the functional cysteine mutants for changes in the relative cation and anion permeability. Fig. 2C is a plot of the relative permeability of sodium (black squares) and potassium (white squares) compared with that of chloride. For comparison, the wild-type permeability ratio for Na:K:Cl was 0:0.03:1.0 (20Wotring V.E. Chang Y. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. (London). 1999; 521.2: 327-336Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The symbols to the right of the graph in Fig. 2C indicate the sodium and potassium permeability for the ΔP290/A291E mutant that has been previously shown to convert the receptor from anionto cation-selective and the A291E mutant that has been previously shown to convert the receptor to be essentially equally permeable for Na, K, and Cl (13Wotring V.E. Miller T.S. Weiss D.S. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Note that all cysteine mutations retained their high degree of selectivity for anions over cations. Overall, the cysteine mutations induced minor changes in gating and selectivity when compared with the ρ1 wild-type receptor, suggesting the general structure, as well as the activation and permeation mechanisms, were similar to that of the wild type.Accessibility of the Cysteines for Positively Charged Reagents—In an effort to identify residues that line the cation-accessible surfaces of the pore, the accessibility of the cysteines were probed with the positively charged sulfhydryl reagent MTSEA (2 mm, 1-min application) or Cd2+ (100 μm, 1 min) added extracellularly both in the absence and presence of GABA. MTSEA increased the maximum current amplitude of R287C and V289C and decreased the maximum current amplitude of P290C compared with wild-type ρ1, in which no significant changes were observed (Fig. 3). The degree of modification of R287C and P290C was significantly higher in the presence of GABA, whereas V289C was the same in the absence or presence of agonist. Although three of the cysteine mutants exhibited a significant change in the maximum current with MTSEA modification, only P290C demonstrated a significant change in the EC50 for GABA (Fig. 3B). Finally, A291C, a mutant that did not demonstrate a change in the maximum current or EC50 with MTSEA exposure, exhibited a change in the rate of desensitization (Fig. 3C). In this case, the cysteine substitution on its own imparted an enhanced desensitization rate, and MTSEA reduced this rate by a factor of 2.5 ± 0.5 (n = 5). Thus, it seems that four of the examined residues (R287C, V289C, P290C, and A291C) were modified by the positively charged reagent, MTSEA.Fig. 3Modification by MTSEA+ and Cd2+. Effects of MTSEA on the peak current amplitude (A) and EC50 (B). Mutants that exhibited a significant difference from the wild-type receptor are indicated by the asterisks at the bottom of A and B. In all cases, 2 mm MTSEA was applied for 1 min. The black symbols represent MTSEA in the absence of GABA, and the white symbols are in the presence of a saturating concentration of GABA (8-fold higher than the EC50 for that particular mutant). C, summary of the MTSEA modification results. In the case of A291C, although there was no significant change in the EC50 or maximum current, the rate of desensitization increased after MTSEA exposure, indicating modification had taken place. D, effects of Cd2+ (100 μm) on the peak current amplitude and on the EC50 of the wild type and mutants either in the absence (▪) or in the presence (□) of GABA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Two or more cysteines, if they are within 6–7 Å, can form a high affinity divalent cation-binding site. Therefore, we examined the actions of Cd2+ on select cysteine mutants. Fig. 3D is a plot of the maximum GABA-activated current for wild type and A291C, P290C, V289C, R287C mutant receptors after Cd2+ (in the presence (white symbol) and absence (black symbol) of GABA. Note, that Cd2+ significantly reduced the maximum current amplitude for P290C and A291C in the presence of GABA when compared with the wild-type receptor (no significant change, p > 0.20, n = 5). In addition, Cd2+ significantly decreased desensitization of the A291C mutant in the presence of GABA. Thus, Cd2+ significantly modified P290C and A291C mutants. That Cd2+ does not modify R287C may indicate these cysteines are not at the proper orientation to coordinate the divalent cation or, alternatively, the divalent cation cannot reach a site that deep in the pore. The observation that P290C and A291C are not blocked by Cd2+ in the absence of GABA may indicate that structural rearrangements occur in this region upon receptor activation that orient the cysteines in the proper configuration to coordinate the divalent cation.Accessibility of the Engineered Cysteines for Negatively Charged Sulfhydryl Reagents—Having evidence that positively charged reagents can modify cysteines near the intracellular end of TM2, we next tested the actions of the negatively charged reagent, pCMBS–. Fig. 4A plots the maximum GABA-activated current after pCMBS exposure (1 mm, 1 min) in the presence (white symbol) and absence (black symbol) of GABA. pCMBS– induced significant modification of the maximum current in five mutants (A271C, T272C, L277C, V280C, and P290C) when compared with the wild-type ρ1 receptor (no changes, n = 6). Fig. 4B presents the change in the EC50 after pCMBS exposure. In this case, the wild-type ρ1 receptor exhibited a small but significant decrease in the GABA EC50 (from 0.9 ± 0.1 to 0.51 ± 0.5 μm; n = 5). Three mutants (T272C, V280C, P290C) exhibited a further decrease, and one mutant (A271C) exhibited an increase in the EC50 for GABA after pCMBS modification.Fig. 4Modification by pCMBS–. Effects of MTSEA on the peak current amplitude (A) and EC50 (B). Mutants that exhibited a significant difference from the wild-type receptor are indicated by the asterisks at the bottom of A and B. In all cases, 1 mm pCMBS– was applied for 1 min. The black symbols represent pCMBS– in the absence of GABA, and the white symbols are in the presence of a saturating concentration of GABA (8-fold higher than the EC50 for that particular mutant). C, in addition to exhibiting an increase in the EC50, A271C was locked into the open state after modification. Although W279C and A291C did not show a change in the current amplitude or EC50 after pCMBS exposure, there were changes in the deactivation kinetics, confirming modification had occurred. D, summary of modification of cysteine mutants by pCMBS–.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Several mutants exhibited other changes in receptor properties after pCMBS treatment, indicating modification. For example, in addition to the increased EC50, A271C exhibited a steady current nearly equal in magnitude to the GABA-activated current before pCMBS exposure (Fig. 4C, panel 1). Picrotoxin partially antagonized this agonist-independent current. In the case of W279C, the deactivation kinetics changed from a non-exponential to a double-exponential decay (τ1 = 20 ± 5 s and τ2 = 300 ± 50 s; n = 6; Fig. 4C, panel 2). As was true for MTSEA exposure, A291C exhibited a significant decrease in the desensitization rate after modification (from τ = 3.5 ± 0.5 to 9 ± 2 s, n = 5; Fig. 4C, panel 3). Note that in all cases, the residues were modified in both the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of GABA. In sum, pCMBS induced a functional modification in seven mutants: A271C, T272C, L277C, W279C, V280C, P290C, and A291C (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that, in addition to modifying residues at the intracellular end of TM2, the negatively charged reagent pCMBS has access to residues in the TM1-TM2 linker and at the presumed intracellular end of TM1.Fig. 5 presents a summary of the residues that were modified by positively and negatively charged sulfhydryl reagents. Functional modification of A291C and P290C mutants by Cd2+ suggests that the TM2 domain is permeable for divalent cations up to P290C in the open state. Accessibility of A291C, P290C, V289C, and R287C for MTSEA+ extends the region accessible for positively charged reagents to R287C. Because V280C, W279C, L277C, T272C, and A271C were modified only by negatively charged pCMBS–, these residues may line the anion-accessible surface of the pore.Fig. 5Summary of modification by MTSEA+ and pCMBS–. M274C and D285C are blank because these two mutants were non-functional.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Rate of Modification Is State-dependent—Data presented thus far demonstrates that modifying reagents can reach their respective targets in either the absence or presence of GABA. In those experiments, however, high concentrations of reagents were used, and sufficient time was allowed for the reactions to approach completion. Therefore, these data do not allow us to discern the relative state-dependence of the accessibility (e.g. absence or presence of GABA). For such information, one must compare the rates of modification. To check whether the rate of modification was state-dependent, sulfhydryl reagents (at low concentrations) were applied for 15-s intervals (total duration of 90 s) in either the presence or in the absence of GABA between GABA test pulses without the modifying reagent present. The amplitude of the GABA-mediated test pulse was plotted as a function of cumulative time of reagent exposure, and these data were described by a single exponential function. In some experiments, the antagonist picrotoxin (from 0.1 to 1 mm) was applied along with the sulfhydryl reagent to test for the protection of cysteine modification.Fig. 6 presents examples of the time dependence of modification of P290C by MTSEA (Fig. 6A) and pCMBS (Fig. 6B) in the absence and presence of GABA as well as in the presence of GABA plus picrotoxin. In Fig. 6A, note the faster rate of modification of P290C in the presence of GABA. Also, picrotoxin slowed the modification significantly. For pCMBS, the rates were the same whether agonist was present or not (Fig. 6B). Picrotoxin (up to 0.5 mm) was unable to completely block the GABA-induced current for V289C, A271C, and A291C (not shown), so the protection from modification, although present, was likely compromised. In all other cases, picrotoxin protected the cysteine from modification. The data for the rate of modification are summarized in Fig. 6, C and D where the average time constants in the absence (black symbols) and presence (white symbols) of GABA are plotted. For MTSEA, a significantly faster rate was observed in the presence of GABA in all four mutants examined. For pCMBS, a significantly faster rate was observed in the presence of GABA in four of the five examined mutants. P290C showed a comparable rate in the absence or presence of GABA (Fig. 6B). For both MTSEA and pCMBS, there seemed to be a clear correlation between the amino acid position and the degree of modification in the absence of GABA, with the rate decreasing as one progresses from TM2 toward TM1. Regardless of the pattern, these data indicate that the accessibilities of these residues (excluding P290C) were dependent upon the receptor state. More specifically, the presence of GABA imparts structural changes in the receptor that facilitate modification.Fig. 6Relative accessibility of select residues in the absence and presence of GABA. Examples of modification of P290C by MTSEA+ (A) and pCMBS– (B). Traces are shown for MTSEA+, MTSEA+ plus GABA, and MTSEA+ plus 20 μm GABA and 50 μm picrotoxin. Sulfhydryl reagents were applied for 15-s intervals for a total duration of 90 s. Data from four cysteine mutants are summarized in C (MTSEA+) and D (pCMBS–). Note that the modification in the presence of GABA was faster compared with the modification in the absence of GABA for all mutants, excluding P290C modification by pCMBS–.View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2161078900,"In histidine biosynthesis, histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of the amino group from glutamate to imidazole acetol-phosphate producing 2-oxoglutarate and histidinol phosphate. In some organisms such as the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima, specific tyrosine and aromatic amino acid transaminases have not been identified to date, suggesting an additional role for histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase in other transamination reactions generating aromatic amino acids. To gain insight into the specific function of this transaminase, we have determined its crystal structure in the absence of any ligand except phosphate, in the presence of covalently bound pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, of the coenzyme histidinol phosphate adduct, and of pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate. The enzyme accepts histidinol phosphate, tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine, but not histidine, as substrates.

Depending on the local geometry of the active site and the orientation of the adduct, a proton, a carboxylate group, or a side chain may be eliminated, leading to racemization, transamination, decarboxylation, or to other more complex reactions (1John R.A.

PLP-containing enzymes belong to at least four independent evolutionary families. The most widely occurring α-family consists of homodimeric enzyme units with a molecular mass of about 2 × 45 kDa, which may compose larger oligomeric assemblies. Each protomer consists of a large domain, comprising a seven-stranded β-sheet core, and a small domain that includes a five-stranded β-sheet. Topologically, the small domain is formed by two sequence segments N- and C-terminal to the large domain. This family can be further subdivided in classes Ia and Ib (2Metha P.K. Christen P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 129-184PubMed Google Scholar, 4Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In aminotransferases belonging only to class Ia, large conformational shifts of the small domain are observed upon substrate binding. In class Ib aminotransferases, conformational shifts during catalysis are restricted to an N-terminal flexible segment referred to as “arm motif.” The sequence and length of this motif vary highly among different members of class I PLP enzymes. T. maritima l-histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase (tmHspAT, EC 2.6.1.9) belongs to class Ib of PLP-dependent aminotransferases. It catalyzes the seventh step in the histidine biosynthesis pathway, a transamination reaction in which the α-amino group of l-glutamate is transferred to 3-(imidazole-4-yl)-2-oxo-propyl phosphate, yielding l-histidinol phosphate (Hsp) and 2-oxoglutarate (Fig. 1). In addition, biochemical and genetic evidence supports the participation of HspAT in the final steps of tyrosine and phenylalanine biosynthesis by converting 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to tyrosine and phenylpyruvate to phenylalanine by transamination (5Nester E.W. Montoya A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 699-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Weigent D.A. Nester E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6974-6980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, these reactions may be catalyzed by three other enzymes, besides HspAT, tyrosine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.5), aromatic-amino-acid transaminase (EC 2.6.1.57), and aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1). Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed close sequence similarity of these transaminases as well as a more distant relation between these sequences and that of HspAT (2Metha P.K. Christen P. Adv.

The same analysis, however, has displayed a more closely related sequence similarity between HspAT and l-threonine-O-3-phosphate decarboxylase (CobD), despite the change in reaction specificity, than between that of HspAT and other transaminases. Indeed, current genome data bases contain sequences that are annotated as HspAT and CobD as exhibiting more than 90% identity (possibly because of annotation errors), indicating that it may be difficult to discriminate between HspAT and CobD activities based solely on sequence comparisons. Analysis of the presently available crystal structures of HspAT from Escherichia coli and of CobD from Salmonella typhimurium (sCobD) confirmed the close relation between these two enzymes (7Cheong C.G.

Biol. 2001; 311: 761-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Small structural changes in the active site of sCobD, compared with that of tmHspAT, appear to be sufficient to force the carboxylate group of the substrate l-threonine-O-3-phosphate into an orientation that is orthogonal to the coenzyme imine π-electron system, directing the overall reaction into decarboxylation rather than transamination (10Cheong C.G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9079-9089Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have determined the crystal structure of HspAT from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima (tmHspAT) that is found in marine sediments at about 80 °C (11Huber R. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 144: 324-333Crossref Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In contrast to E. coli and S. typhimurium, the T. maritima genome neither contains a gene encoding a tyrosine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.5) nor an aromatic-amino-acid transaminase (EC 2.6.1.57) (12Nelson K.E.

Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether tmHspAT exhibits a broad substrate specificity. Our kinetic data on purified tmHspAT acting on aromatic amino acid substrates support this expectation. To monitor potential structural changes during catalysis, we have solved the tmHspAT crystal structure in four different states, including the apo form, the internal aldimine form, the ketimine intermediate, and the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate form. The data demonstrate that in order for T. maritima to adapt to its specific living conditions, HspAT has retained its transamination function but has required extensive molecular alterations, in comparison to the structural requirements for changing its reaction specificity (from transamination to decarboxylation) within closely related organisms (E. coli and S. typhimurium). Protein Expression and Purification—The tmHspAT gene (TM1040) encoding full-length tmHspAT (residues 1-335) was amplified by standard PCR techniques and subcloned into the pETM11 vector, which contains an N-terminal histidine tag and a TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease cleavage site (ENLYF(Q/G)A) between the NcoI and HindIII sites. The PCR oligonucleotides are as follows: sense primer for full-length tmHspAT, 5′-CATCCCCATGGGCCGTCGATTTGATTGCAAAGAG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GACAAGCTTATGTCATTTGAACACCTCCAGTTCTC-3′ (NcoI and HindIII sites in boldface type). Clones were confirmed by sequencing. For native expression, cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing the tmHspAT construct were grown in 1 liter of LB medium at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6, induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at the same temperature, and harvested after 4-5 h. For SeMet incorporation, tmHspAT was expressed in the methionine auxotroph strain E. coli B834(DE3). Cultures of E. coli B834(DE3) were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of minimal medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml l-methionine until A600 = 0.6-0.8, starved in 1 liter of mineral medium at 4 °C for 3 h, re-equilibrated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The culture was harvested after 4-6 h. The yields of native and SeMet protein were in the range of ∼25-30 mg/liter culture. Native and SeMet tmHspAT were purified in a similar fashion. Wet cell pellets were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS) per liter of culture, and disrupted by heat shock (80 °C, 10 min). The supernatant was clarified by ultracentrifugation (Sorvall SS34 rotor, 23 krpm, 4 °C, 1 h) and filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. tmHspAT was purified by nickel-chelating metal affinity chromatography, using a column volume of 3 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Novagen) per liter of expression culture in gravity-flow mode. Impurities were washed off the column by successively applying 20 volumes of lysis buffer, 5 volumes of lysis buffer plus 15 mm imidazole, and 5 volumes of lysis buffer plus 1 m NaCl. The protein was eluted in lysis buffer plus 250 mm imidazole. The N-terminal His tag introduced by the pETM11 vector was cleaved off with 1:50 (w/w) TEV protease in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and removed by loading the protease digest over 1 ml of freshly cast resin. The eluate, containing 95% pure tmHspAT as judged by SDS-PAGE, was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a 10-ml Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences). tmHspAT eluted with a 0.1-0.5 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing tmHspAT were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA), and concentrated in Centricon 30 kDa devices (Millipore) to a final concentration of 35 mg/ml as determined by the Bradford method. Removal of PLP—tmHspAT was purified as a mixture of the PLP- and PMP-containing forms, which are spectroscopically distinct. Pure tmHspAT·PLP was obtained by dialysis against storage buffer supplemented with 1 mm α-oxoglutaric acid at 35 °C overnight. The apo form of tmHspAT was prepared by incubating purified protein with a solution containing 10 mm l-glutamic acid, 1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 50 °C overnight, followed by extensive buffer exchanges at 35 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (pH 8.0) (8Haruyama K. Nakai T. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Mizuguchi H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4633-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The proportion of tmHspAT without PLP after this treatment was assessed by the ratio of absorbance at 327 and 427 nm. X-ray Crystallography—Single crystals of tmHspAT·PLP suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis were obtained under a variety of conditions in the presence of low molecular weight polyethylene glycol and pH ranging from 5.0 to 6.0. Crystals were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C by assembling 1 μl of tmHspAT·PLP solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution, which also served as cryoprotectant. SeMet tmHspAT·PLP crystals grew optimally in 50% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 5% (w/v) PEG1000, sodium acetate (pH 5.1), developing plate-shaped crystals to a maximum size of 1.0 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3 within 2-3 weeks. Native tmHspAT·PLP crystals grew in 40% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 6.2), and exhibited a cubic shape with dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3. Crystals of the tmHspAT·PMP form were obtained under conditions identical to those for native tmHspAT·PLP crystals; their morphology and size were similar to those of native crystals. The covalent Hsp-PLP adduct was obtained by co-crystallizing native tmHspAT·PLP in the presence of 10 mm Hsp, under crystallization conditions identical to those for growing native tmHspAT·PLP crystals. Crystals of the apo form were obtained in 40% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 6.2); these adopted a prismatic morphology with approximate dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3. A three-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected from a SeMet tmHspAT·PLP crystal at beamline BW7A (EMBL Hamburg, Germany, DESY), at wavelengths of 0.9778 Å (inflection), 0.9862 Å (peak), and 0.9184 Å (high energy remote), using a 165-mm Mar CCD detector. For each image, the crystal was rotated by 0.5°, and the crystal-detector distance was set to 240 mm. Data were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The best solution comprehended 33 heavy atom positions per asymmetric unit and had a figure of merit (f.o.m.) of 0.53 prior to density modification. From the initial substructure, three sites were removed because their occupancies refined to values smaller than 0.2. The selenium positions of the N-terminal SeMet residues could not be located because of structural disorder. The map was improved by density modification (16Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W.

Open table in a new tab X-ray data of an apo tmHspAT crystal were obtained at beamline BW7B (EMBL Hamburg, DESY), using a 345-mm Mar Image plate detector to a maximum resolution of 2.85 Å (Table I). They were collected at a wavelength of 0.8416 Å, in 0.2° rotation steps, and with a crystal-detector distance of 290 mm. An unambiguous molecular replacement solution was found with AMoRe (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Further refinement was carried out with Cns_Solve version 1.1, converging to a final R-free and R-factor of 28.4 and 22.1%, respectively. Similar procedures were employed to solve the structures of the tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP and the tmHspAT-PMP complexes, using x-ray data sets that were collected at beamline X13 (EMBL Hamburg, DESY), which is equipped with a 165-mm Mar CCD detector. For these data sets, the wavelength was set to 0.8020 Å, and the crystal-detector distances were 180 and 260.6 mm, respectively. The correct molecular replacement solutions were obtained with AMoRe, yielding a CC and R-factor of 60.6 and 39.1% for tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP and 74.4 and 41.9% for tmHspAT·PMP.

Refinement statistics are summarized in Table II. An additional set of 1,183 reflections with 〈I〉/σ(〈I〉) of 1.8 was used during refinement of the tmHspATP·MP complex. Single Turnover Kinetics—Single turnover experiments were carried out by monitoring the reaction using the absorbance maximum of PMP at 327 nm in 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0). The experiments were conducted in a Kontron UVIKON 922 spectrophotometer at 20 °C using 1-cm quartz cuvettes. Protein concentration was measured by UV absorption at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 21,760 m-1 cm-1 (E280 = 0.554 mg-1 ml). Stock solutions of 60.7 mm phenylalanine, 30.0 mm tryptophan, 2.0 mm tyrosine, and 10.4 mm Hsp were used. Wavelength scans were recorded between 250 and 600 nm in duplicate. Reactions were started by adding tmHspAT to a final concentration of 6.7 μm (40 μm for phenylalanine) and increasing substrate concentrations. The rate of transamination at 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 °C was measured by mixing 32 μl of 80 μm tmHspAT·PLP in 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 0.3 μl of 60.7 mm phenylalanine, after 1-min preincubation at the corresponding temperature. Heat inactivation studies were conducted by incubating the enzyme at each temperature for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min and following the single turnover kinetics at 25 °C. The final concentrations in the reaction vessel were 21.3 μm tmHspAT·PLP and 150 μm phenylalanine. Each measurement was carried out in duplicate in a PowerWave-X Select instrument (Bio-Tek Instruments). The crystal structure of the l-histidinol-phosphate aminotransferase (tmHspAT) from T. maritima has been determined in four different states as follows: (a) the apo form in the absence of any ligand except inorganic phosphate (tmHspAT); (b) the internal aldimine form in the presence of the covalently bound cofactor pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (tmHspAT·PLP); (c) the ketimine intermediate in the presence of the l-histidinol phosphate pyridoxal 5′-phosphate adduct (tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP); and (d) the pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate form (tmHspAT·PMP) (Tables I and II, Fig. 1, 2, 3). Both tmHspAT and tmHspAT·PLP crystallized in the same orthorhombic unit cell (P21212), comprising two tmHspAT dimers per asymmetric unit. However, the unit cell of the apo form (tmHspAT) is shrunk by about 9% compared with that of the tmHspAT·PLP form. The unit cell of the tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP complex is monoclinic, again comprising two tmHspAT dimers per asymmetric unit and displaying a packing arrangement that is similar to that of the orthorhombic crystal form. The two axes (a and b) of the monoclinic crystal are similar to the two axes (b and c) of the orthorhombic crystal form, and the c axis is equivalent to one-half of the a axis of the orthorhombic crystal form. Crystals of the orthorhombic tmHspAT·PLP form dissolve upon soaking with Hsp, and the structure of the tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP complex reveals that movements in the N-terminal arm region (see below) lead to modifications in the overall packing arrangement. The tmHspAT·PMP unit cell form is also orthorhombic (P212121), but it exhibits a distinct packing arrangement from other crystal forms. This form contains only one tmHspAT dimer per asymmetric unit. The diffraction limits of the monoclinic crystal form were superior to those of the other crystal forms, allowing the tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP complex structure to be determined at 2.35-Å resolution, whereas the other tmHspAT structures were determined at 2.80-2.85 Å. Experimental phases were computed from the selenium anomalous signal from l-selenomethionine (SeMet) incorporated crystals of the tmHspAT·PLP form. The other structures were determined by the molecular replacement method.Fig. 3Structure of active site ligands bound to tmHspAT. A, tmHspAT in the apo form, displaying an inorganic phosphate ion in the active site; B, tmHspAT·PLP, showing the internal aldimine PLP in the active site; C, tmHspAT· Hsp-PLP, displaying the Hsp-PLP adduct in the ketimine form; D, the tmHspAT· PMP complex. Each panel shows the ligand and specific hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. The atom type colors are the same as those in Fig. 2. In each panel, the final σA-weighted electron density map contoured at 1.0 σ is also shown. The bond lengths quoted in A-C are averaged from four copies per asymmetric unit, and the bond lengths in D are from two copies per asymmetric unit. The average r.m.s deviations in protein-ligand bond lengths are as follows: A, tmHspAT, 0.27 Å (7 bonds); tmHspAT·PLP, 0.14 Å (13 bonds), tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP, 0.14 Å (16 bonds). Tyr-53′ originates from the other tmH-spAT subunit. tmHspAT main chain interactions are labeled by an asterisk. The figure has been produced with DINO (www.dino3d.org).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The structure of tmHspAT resembles those of the class Ib fold of PLP enzymes. Each monomeric unit consists of two domains, of which the small domain is composed of residues 21-40 and 275-335, flanking the large domain (residues 41-274) (Fig. 2). Within the N-terminal segment of the small domain, strand β1 and the loop preceding this strand (residues 23-27) are involved in shielding the tmHspAT active site. Like other members of the subclass Ib fold of PLP enzymes, tmHspAT comprises an N-terminal arm motif (residues 1-20). Only parts of this motif are visible in the apo structure as well as in the PLP and PMP complexes, whereas the complete motif is within defined electron density in the tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP complex structure. The structure reveals how the N-terminal arm motif interacts with helix α11 of the large domain of the adjacent subunit within each tmHspAT dimer. Of the four copies in the asymmetric unit, the N termini of two chains of the tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP complex form α-helices (residues 3-10), whereas no secondary structure forms within the same segment of the other two chains. However, it is not known whether the ordering transition of the N-terminal arm motif in the tmHspAT·Hsp-PLP complex originates from packing effects or whether it is triggered by conformational arrangements of the region C-terminal to the arm motif that contributes to the active site.

https://openalex.org/W2149173814,"Hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1) is a trimeric protein with high negative charges distributed asymmetrically along the faces of the molecule. Recently, we have reported that HABP1 exhibits a high degree of structural flexibility, which can be perturbed by ions under in vitro conditions near physiological pH (Jha, B. K., Salunke, D. M., and Datta, K. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 27464–27472). Here, we report the effect of ionic strength and pH on thermodynamic stability of HABP1. Trimeric HABP1 was shown to unfold reversibly upon dissociation ruling out the possibility of existence of folded monomer. An increase in ionic concentration (0.05–1 m) or decrease in pH (pH 8.0–pH 5.0) induced an unusually high thermodynamic stability of HABP1 as reflected in the gradual increase in transition midpoint temperature, enthalpy of transition, and conformational entropy. Our studies suggest that the presence of counter ions in the molecular environment of HABP1 leads to dramatic reduction of the intramolecular electrostatic repulsion either by de-ionizing the charged amino acid residues or by direct binding leading to a more stable conformation. A regulation on cellular HA-HABP1 interaction by changes in pH and ionic strength may exist, because the more stable conformation attained at higher ionic strength or at acidic pH showed maximum affinity toward HA as probed either in solid phase binding assay on HA-immobilized plates or an in-solution binding assay using intrinsic fluorescence of HABP1. Hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1) is a trimeric protein with high negative charges distributed asymmetrically along the faces of the molecule. Recently, we have reported that HABP1 exhibits a high degree of structural flexibility, which can be perturbed by ions under in vitro conditions near physiological pH (Jha, B. K., Salunke, D. M., and Datta, K. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 27464–27472). Here, we report the effect of ionic strength and pH on thermodynamic stability of HABP1. Trimeric HABP1 was shown to unfold reversibly upon dissociation ruling out the possibility of existence of folded monomer.

The diverse biological roles of hyaluronan, a complex polysaccharide in vertebrates, are now established beyond any doubt. These include acting as a vital structural component of connective tissues, the formation of loose hydrated matrices that allow cells to divide and migrate during development, and in intracellular signaling (1Lee J.Y.

Molecular cloning of human HABP1 revealed its multifunctional nature as its sequence was found to be identical with p32, a protein copurified with splicing factor SF2 and with the receptor of the globular head of complement factor C1q (gC1qR). It is represented as synonyms of p32/C1QBP (accession number NP_001203) in human chromosome 17. This molecule has generated a considerable interest in the last few years largely because of its multifarious functions as well as its localization in various subcellular compartments including cell surface in different cell types (8Gupta S.

However, only one transcript of HABP1 was detected from different types of tissues suggesting that no other isoform(s) of HABP1 exist in different cell types (16Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Kumar R. Feng X. Peerschke E.I. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Studies on the crystal structure of p32/HABP1 revealed that it exists as a homotrimer, and each protomer consists of seven consecutive twisted anti-parallel β-sheets flanked by one NH2-terminal and two COOH-terminal α-helices and that the terminal α-helices have extensive intra- as well as intermolecular contacts. It has been postulated that these terminal helices are critical for maintaining the trimeric assembly and proteinprotein interactions (18Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we have shown that HABP1 exists predominantly as a non-covalently linked trimer near physiological conditions and as a hexamer (dimer of trimers) in the oxidative environment (19Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Being acidic in nature and having highly polar amino acid residues distributed asymmetrically on the surface, the electrostatic interactions in HABP1 are expected to have a role in dictating its folding topology and tertiary interactions. However, the relative role of the contribution of electrostatic interactions to protein stability, compared with that of hydrophobic interactions, has been the subject of long standing query (20Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Part of the difficulty, in discriminating the contributions from electrostatic effect, stems from the fact that there are several different ways in which they contribute to the net stability of the native conformation. In addition, both attractive and repulsive electrostatic interactions are possible. In general, models to account for co-solute effects on protein stability may be classified in a number of ways; two major classifications are those in which the co-solute directly interacts with the protein, i.e. binding, or those involving effects on the solvent, e.g. excluded volume effects (21Saunders A.J. Davis-Searles P.R. Allen D.L. Pielak G.J. Erie D.A. Biopolymers. 2000; 53: 293-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that HABP1 exists in an expanded molten globule-like state at low ionic strength around alkaline pH because of charge-charge repulsion emanating from the presence of multiple negatively charged carboxyl groups, and that the addition of low concentrations of cations leads to a substantial compaction of HABP1 (22Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27464-27472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The effect of cation is attributed to their minimizing the charge repulsion by binding to the negatively charged groups, which in turn diminish the repulsive interaction (23Goto Y. Calciano L.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Similar effects, in cases involving the presence of anions, appear to result in the refolding of intrinsically disordered protein that have a net positive charge at neutral pH (24Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). In terms of the overall spectrum of protein stability ranging from intrinsically unstructured protein at one extreme to very stable, globular proteins at the other, HABP1 is in the middle. In other words, there are many other proteins that may have marginal or even lower stability under physiological conditions. Thus, the effects of salts and pH on HABP1 are likely to be applicable to a number of other eukaryotic proteins, and to further our understanding of the broad range of interactions of ions with proteins. Recently, we have reported the structural flexibility of HABP1 under a wide range of ionic environments. At low ionic strength HABP1 exists in highly expanded and loosely held trimeric structures, whereas, the presence of salt induces compact trimeric structure (22Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27464-27472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus the possibility of minimizing the intramolecular repulsion by counter ions leading to stable conformation needs to be examined. Also being an oligomeric protein, the studies on HABP1 can provide important insights into the relative contributions of the various forces under different conditions of pH, ion concentration, and temperature that stabilize the oligomeric structures of proteins in various stable or meta-stable conformations. EAH-Sepharose 4B, all empty XK, pre-packed Resource-Q, and Superose-6 HR10/30 columns and the gel filtration calibration kit were from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals (unless otherwise mentioned) were of the highest purity grade available and obtained from Sigma and highly purified HA-octasaccharide was a generous gift from Dr. Akira Asari of Seikagaku Corp., Japan. Milli-Q™ grade water was used for preparing all the solutions required for the study. Urea was purchased from Sigma and further purified by re-crystallization before use. Purification and Concentration Determination of HABP1—Recombinant HABP1 was produced in Escherichia coli as described earlier (7Deb T.B. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The protein was purified by a 65–90% ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by ion exchange chromatography on a Resource-Q (6 ml) column (Amersham Biosciences), interfaced with a Pharmacia FPLC™ system (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.2% 2-mercaptoehanol, pH 7.5, followed by hyaluronan-Sepharose affinity column chromatography as reported earlier (19Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27464-27472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Affinity purified HABP1 was further purified by size exclusion chromatography as described earlier (19Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For all practical purposes the concentration of a known aliquot was determined in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 6 m guanidine-HCl by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm at 25 °C on a Cary 100 Bio UV visible double beam spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Mulgrave, Australia) interfaced with a Peltier thermal controller. The molar extinction coefficient of denatured HABP1 was calculated and found to be 22,190 at 280 nm, which corresponds to A0.1%280nm = 0.932 (22Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27464-27472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Gel Permeation Chromatography—Gel permeation chromatography of HABP1 was carried out on a Pharmacia Superose-6™ HR10 × 30 analytical column interfaced with Pharmacia FPLC™ system at a constant flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The buffer concentration used was 10 mm: phosphate, pH 6.5–8; MES, pH 5.5–6.3; acetate, pH 4.0–5.4; and citrate phosphate, pH 3.0–4.4, keeping the ionic concentration constant at 150 mm using NaCl at all pH values. The standard molecular mass markers of known molecular mass and Stokes radii: alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, 46 Å): bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 35.5 Å), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 30.5 Å), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa, 20.9 Å), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa, 16.4 Å), were independently run to calibrate the column prior to sample run. Stokes radii were determined from a plot of Stokes radius versus Kav, where Kav is defined as (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo), where Ve = elution volume; Vo = void volume; Vt = total bed volume of column (25Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectral Studies—All of the far UV CD spectra of HABP1 were recorded on a JASCO 715 spectropolarimeter in the buffer of different pH values. The scans were taken between 250 and 200 nm at 10 °C. The samples were prepared 4–24 h before recording the spectra in the desired buffer and filtered through 0.22-μ Millipore membranes. A rectangular cuvette of 1-mm path length was used throughout the experiment. The concentration of protein was kept constant at 10 μm. Data were recorded at a scan speed of 50 nm/min with a response time of 1 s at a bandwidth of 1 nm and accumulated at 0.1-nm step intervals. Typically, 3–5 scans were taken for each sample. The buffer baseline was subtracted in each case. Thermal denaturation of HABP1 (5 μm) was monitored by change in molar ellipticity at 222 nm with increasing temperature on a JASCO 715 spectropolarimeter, equipped with a Peltier temperature controller (JASCO PTC-348 WI). The wavelength was decided on the basis of the minima of the difference spectra obtained by subtracting the native protein scan from the thermally denatured protein scan. The samples and buffers were prepared as described above. Samples were heated at a constant rate of 60 K h-1 and data were accumulated at 0.1-K intervals. Analyses of the data were carried out with Origin version 5.0 using a two-state transition model. Differential Scanning Calorimetric Studies—All calorimetric scans were performed on the ultrasensitive differential scanning calorimeter, VP-DSC (Microcal Inc.). The protein samples on which DSC scans were performed as a function of salt concentration were prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The ionic concentration was varied using NaCl. Samples for the pH-dependent scans were prepared in different buffers (phosphate, pH 6.5–8; MES, pH 5.5–6.3; acetate, pH 4.0–5.4) at a fixed ionic concentration of 200 mm. The protein samples were extensively dialyzed against the desired buffer, typically dialysis was done in 1:1000 samples to buffer ratio with 5 changes (1:1000 × 5) at 4 °C. The sample and the last dialysis buffer were filtered and degassed before being scanned in the calorimeter. The 0.5-ml sample was introduced into the sample cell and a similar amount of the last dialysate was introduced into the reference cell and the calorimeter was up-scanned at a constant rate. Protein concentration was determined by measuring A at 280 nm as described earlier. The calorimetric unit was interfaced to a microcomputer for automatic data collection and analysis. The best least squares fit of the two-state transition model, A3 ⇔ 3B, where A is the folded state and B is the unfolded state, to the data were determined using Origin version 5.0 software supplied with the instrument. Analyses of normalized data utilizing the progress base line connection of pre- and post-transition base line of the DSC thermogram yielded the van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHv), transition midpoint temperature (Tm, the temperature at half the peak area), and the transition peak area, which when divided by the number of moles of protein in the cell, yields the calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHc). The ratio of ΔHc/ΔHv yields the cooperativity of transition (26Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5153-5159Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All the scans at ionic concentrations of 100 mm NaCl or above were found to be reversible. Hyaluronan Binding Assays—Microtiter plate binding assays were carried out to investigate the effect of pH on the interactions of HA with HABP1. The assays, which are based on those described previously (22Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27464-27472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Parkar A. Kahmanna J.D. Howatb S.L. Baylissb M.T. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), determine colorimetrically the level of binding of HABP1 to wells coated with HA. All washes were performed in standard assay buffer (SAB: 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). Plastic Costar flat-bottomed high binding microtiter plates (EIA/RIA) were coated (in triplicates) overnight with 100 μl/well of 10 μg/ml HA in 20 mm carbonate buffer (Na2CO3/NaHCO3), pH 9.6, at 4 °C. Control wells were treated with buffer alone. The coating solution was removed and the plates were washed three times and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 1.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 90 min at 37 °C, followed by three washes. Finally, the respective wells were rinsed three times with buffers of different pH values (10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0–6.5, and sodium phosphate, pH 6.5–8.5). 100 μl of HABP1 or HABP1-biotin from a 50 μg/ml solution in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5–8.5, or acetate buffer, pH 4.0–6.5, containing 150 mm NaCl was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times and 100 μl of a 1:10,000 dilution of polyclonal anti-HABP1 antibody (in SAB containing 1% bovine serum albumin) was added and incubated for 90 min, followed by five washes. A 100 μl/well of 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in SAB containing 1% bovine serum albumin was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. For competitive inhibition assays biotinylated HABP1 at different pH values were preincubated with varying concentrations of unlabeled HABP1 and added to HA-coated plates and the bound HABP1-biotin was probed with HRP-conjugated extravidin (1:30,000). The unbound secondary antibodies/extravidin-HRP were sipped out of the wells after 1 h incubation at 37 °C and washed five times and finally rinsed with substrate buffer (100 mm phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5.0). 100 μl of 0.6 mg/ml solution of ABTS in substrate buffer containing 3 μl/ml H2O2 was added to each well and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C for color to develop. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined on a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad model 550 microplate reader). All absorbance readings were corrected against blank wells. Solution Binding Assay for HA-HABP1 Interaction—All fluorescence measurements were performed on a LS-55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) interfaced with a Multi Temp III (Amersham Biosciences) water circulator to keep the temperature constant. Binding of HA to HABP1 was monitored by adding small aliquots of HA-octa- or polysaccharide to 0.8 μm HABP1 dissolved in a similar buffer at constant temperature. In every case the total volume of aliquots added was always ≤1% of the total reaction volume. A parallel control containing similar disaccharide equivalents of chondritin sulfate A of similar aliquots was run and used as F0. The fluorescence emission intensity was measured by using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. For titration experiments, emission was monitored at 350 nm. In every case excitation and emission slit-width of 2.5 and 5 nm, respectively, were used. Fluorescence data were corrected for excitation intensity. Five successive readings with an integration time of 10 s were recorded and averaged value was subtracted from F0 to get ΔF and plotted against ligand concentration. ΔFmax calculated from the plot was further used for the estimation of dissociation constant as reported earlier (28Bagshaw C.R. Harris D.A. Harris D.A. Bashford C.L. Spectrophotometry and Spectrofluorimetry, A Practical Approach. IRL Press Oxford, United Kingdom1988: 91-113Google Scholar). Calculation of the Accessible Surface Area Changes upon Trimer Dissociation and Monomer Unfolding—The polar, apolar, and total accessible surface areas (ASA) were calculated with the program Insight, using the methods of Lee and Richards (29Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar). For the folded trimeric HABP1 the coordinates were downloaded (Protein Data Bank code 1ID p32) and analyzed for accessible surface area. The program calculates the atomic accessible surface defined by rolling a spherical probe of a given size around the van der Waals surface. A probe of 1.4-Å radius and a slice thickness of 0.05 Å were used. The output file contained summed atomic ASA over each residue. The ASA of the unfolded protein was calculated as the sum of the accessibility of the residues in an extended Ala-X-Ala tripeptide because of the primary structure of the protein. We took the Ala-X-Ala surface values from the tripeptide designed in extended conformations for each residue using Insight software. Hydrodynamic Behavior of Trimeric HABP1 as a Function of pH—To examine if electrostatic repulsion in HABP1, an acidic protein, is indeed responsible for the expanded structure around neutral and basic pH, size exclusion chromatography was carried out as a function of pH keeping the ionic concentration constant. HABP1 showed a gradual decrease in elution volume suggesting a gradual increase in the hydrodynamic volume (Vh) of the molecule with increase in pH (Fig. 1A). Therefore, size exclusion chromatographic data were further analyzed for calculating the hydrodynamic size of the molecule by comparing with the standard molecular weight markers of known Stokes radii. The pH-induced structural compaction seems to be the result of reduction in total charges because of de-ionization of various polar amino acid residues, which are asymmetrically distributed on trimeric HABP1. The total charge present on HABP1 at different pH values was calculated using ANTHEPROT and plotted against pH along with the Stokes radius at the corresponding pH (Fig. 1B). The total charge on trimeric HABP1 at pH 7.2 is -83 as compared with that of +8.0 at pH 4.0. The important observations of our study are concerned with strikingly different states of compaction of HABP1, induced by pH. For example, HABP1 trimer under alkaline pH is so expanded that it elutes much earlier than the compact trimer. There is a gradual increase in the compactness of trimer with decreasing pH. The decrease is such that the compact form of the trimer has a Stokes radius of 30.7 ± 1.4 Å (n = 3) at pH 4.5 compared with the most expanded trimer, which has a Stokes radius of 40.5 ± 1.5 Å at pH 9.0 (n = 3). All these experiments were performed at a fixed ionic concentration. Model for Fitting the Differential Scanning Calorimetric Data of HABP1 Unfolding—We have shown previously that the absence of counter ion drastically affects the structure as well as conformation of trimeric HABP1 in solution, which to a great extent seems to be responsible for the generation of binding sites for different ligands under different conditions of ionic strength (22Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27464-27472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of counter ions in its molecular environment is an absolute requirement for HABP1 to exist in any sort of functionally relevant structure/conformation, especially so for its hyaluronan binding capabilities. Consequently, we proposed that the combination of the high net charge asymmetrically distributed along the faces of the molecule and relatively low intrinsic hydrophobicity of HABP1 resulted in its expanded structure around neutral pH in low ionic environment. Addition of counter ions in the molecular environment minimizes the intra-molecular electrostatic repulsion in HABP1 leading to its stable and compact conformations, which is also reflected in its differential affinity toward different types of ligands. In this study we have, therefore, scrutinized in detail, the conformational stability and folding of HABP1 in a wide range of salt and pH values using ultrasensitive differential scanning calorimeter. A typical endotherm of HABP1 with the details of the mode of curve fitting procedure, notation, and the definition of various thermodynamic parameters determined are illustrated in Fig. 2. HABP1 (14 μm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, was filled in the sample cell and the reference cell, containing buffer alone, was up-scanned. The respective baseline-subtracted data (where the baseline was obtained with buffer in both the sample and the reference cells of the calorimeter) were used in each case for analyses (Fig. 2, a and b). HABP1 showed a perfect thermodynamic as well as biochemical reversibility from 100 mm salt onwards, as shown in Fig. 3, a and b, respectively. Therefore the data obtained from the DSC measurements were analyzed by a two-state reversible unfolding, i.e. unfolding upon dissociation, fitting model.Fig. 3Thermodynamic and biochemical reversibility. HABP1 exhibits perfect thermodynamic as well as biochemical reversibility. A, raw data obtained from DSC scans of HABP1 (open circle) and rescanning the same protein sample (closed diamond). 14 μm HABP1 in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (100 mm NaCl) was up-scanned at a heating rate of 20 K h-1 beyond its transition midpoint temperature. The same sample was then cooled to 10 °C and up-scanned again. The graph shows the plot of excess Cp versus temperature. B, microtiter plate-based HA binding assay of native (solid circle) and renatured (open circle) HABP1 shows perfect biochemical reversibility. For this binding assay 100 μl/well of native and thermally denatured HABP1, renatured by slow cooling, were coated in a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate in triplicates as described under “Materials and Methods” and incubated with biotin-labeled HA. The bound HA was detected with 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated extravidin using ABTS as substrate. Bound HA was plotted against the increasing concentration of HABP1. The S.D. (n = 3) is shown as error bars on each data point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Effect of Protein Concentration, Scan Rate, Salt, and pH on Thermodynamic Stability of HABP1—It has been demonstrated by using a number of independent techniques that HABP1 is predominantly trimeric under the experimental conditions in this study (22Jha B.K.

https://openalex.org/W2005940578,"The functional identity of an olfactory sensory neuron is defined by its expression of one odorant receptor from a large multigene family. The complexity of this process has led to speculation that DNA rearrangements are used to limit the expression of one receptor gene per cell. However, a recent report in Nature directly rules out irreversible DNA rearrangements as a mechanism for odorant receptor gene choice."
