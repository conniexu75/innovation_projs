https://openalex.org/W2897863430,"Addiction treatment has not been appreciably improved by neuroscientific research. One problem is that mechanistic studies using rodent models do not incorporate volitional social factors, which play a critical role in human addiction. Here, using rats, we introduce an operant model of choice between drugs and social interaction. Independent of sex, drug class, drug dose, training conditions, abstinence duration, social housing, or addiction score in Diagnostic & Statistical Manual IV-based and intermittent access models, operant social reward prevented drug self-administration. This protection was lessened by delay or punishment of the social reward but neither measure was correlated with the addiction score. Social-choice-induced abstinence also prevented incubation of methamphetamine craving. This protective effect was associated with activation of central amygdala PKCÎ´-expressing inhibitory neurons and inhibition of anterior insular cortex activity. These findings highlight the need for incorporating social factors into neuroscience-based addiction research and support the wider implantation of socially based addiction treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2897079052,"Mechanisms that integrate the metabolic state of a cell with regulatory pathways are necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis. Endogenous, intrinsically reactive metabolites can form functional, covalent modifications on proteins without the aid of enzymes1,2, and regulate cellular functions such as metabolism3-5 and transcription6. An important 'sensor' protein that captures specific metabolic information and transforms it into an appropriate response is KEAP1, which contains reactive cysteine residues that collectively act as an electrophile sensor tuned to respond to reactive species resulting from endogenous and xenobiotic molecules. Covalent modification of KEAP1 results in reduced ubiquitination and the accumulation of NRF27,8, which then initiates the transcription of cytoprotective genes at antioxidant-response element loci. Here we identify a small-molecule inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme PGK1, and reveal a direct link between glycolysis and NRF2 signalling. Inhibition of PGK1 results in accumulation of the reactive metabolite methylglyoxal, which selectively modifies KEAP1 to form a methylimidazole crosslink between proximal cysteine and arginine residues (MICA). This posttranslational modification results in the dimerization of KEAP1, the accumulation of NRF2 and activation of the NRF2 transcriptional program. These results demonstrate the existence of direct inter-pathway communication between glycolysis and the KEAP1-NRF2 transcriptional axis, provide insight into the metabolic regulation of the cellular stress response, and suggest a therapeutic strategy for controlling the cytoprotective antioxidant response in several human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2896521341,"Nature has a remarkable ability to carry out site-selective post-translational modification of proteins, therefore enabling a marked increase in their functional diversity1. Inspired by this, chemical tools have been developed for the synthetic manipulation of protein structure and function, and have become essential to the continued advancement of chemical biology, molecular biology and medicine. However, the number of chemical transformations that are suitable for effective protein functionalization is limited, because the stringent demands inherent to biological systems preclude the applicability of many potential processes2. These chemical transformations often need to be selective at a single site on a protein, proceed with very fast reaction rates, operate under biologically ambient conditions and should provide homogeneous products with near-perfect conversion2-7. Although many bioconjugation methods exist at cysteine, lysine and tyrosine, a method targeting a less-explored amino acid would considerably expand the protein functionalization toolbox. Here we report the development of a multifaceted approach to protein functionalization based on chemoselective labelling at methionine residues. By exploiting the electrophilic reactivity of a bespoke hypervalent iodine reagent, the S-Me group in the side chain of methionine can be targeted. The bioconjugation reaction is fast, selective, operates at low-micromolar concentrations and is complementary to existing bioconjugation strategies. Moreover, it produces a protein conjugate that is itself a high-energy intermediate with reactive properties and can serve as a platform for the development of secondary, visible-light-mediated bioorthogonal protein functionalization processes. The merger of these approaches provides a versatile platform for the development of distinct transformations that deliver information-rich protein conjugates directly from the native biomacromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W2897319759,"Animals adapt their behavior in response to informative sensory cues using multiple brain circuits. The activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons is thought to convey a critical teaching signal: reward-prediction error. Although reward-prediction error signals are thought to be essential to learning, little is known about the dynamic changes in the activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons as animals learn about novel sensory cues and appetitive rewards. Here we describe a large dataset of cell-attached recordings of identified dopaminergic neurons as naive mice learned a novel cue-reward association. During learning midbrain dopaminergic neuron activity results from the summation of sensory cue-related and movement initiation-related response components. These components are both a function of reward expectation yet they are dissociable. Learning produces an increasingly precise coordination of action initiation following sensory cues that results in apparent reward-prediction error correlates. Our data thus provide new insights into the circuit mechanisms that underlie a critical computation in a highly conserved learning circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2952018421,"A comprehensive evaluation of every patient with a bloodstream infection includes an attempt to identify the infectious source. Pathogens can originate from various places, such as the gut microbiota, skin and the external environment. Identifying the definitive origin of an infection would enable precise interventions focused on management of the source1,2. Unfortunately, hospital infection control practices are often informed by assumptions about the source of various specific pathogens; if these assumptions are incorrect, they lead to interventions that do not decrease pathogen exposure3. Here, we develop and apply a streamlined bioinformatic tool, named StrainSifter, to match bloodstream pathogens precisely to a candidate source. We then leverage this approach to interrogate the gut microbiota as a potential reservoir of bloodstream pathogens in a cohort of hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients. We find that patients with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections have concomitant gut colonization with these organisms, suggesting that the gut may be a source of these infections. We also find cases where typically nonenteric pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, are found in the gut microbiota, thereby challenging the existing informal dogma of these infections originating from environmental or skin sources. Thus, we present an approach to distinguish the source of various bloodstream infections, which may facilitate more accurate tracking and prevention of hospital-acquired infections."
https://openalex.org/W2896573442,"Mammalian cell culture is foundational to biomedical research, and the reproducibility of research findings across the sciences is drawing increasing attention. While many components contribute to reproducibility, the reporting of factors that impact oxygen delivery in the general biomedical literature has the potential for both significant impact, and immediate improvement. The relationship between the oxygen consumption rate of cells and the diffusive delivery of oxygen through the overlying medium layer means parameters such as medium depth and cell type can cause significant differences in oxygenation for cultures nominally maintained under the same conditions. While oxygenation levels are widely understood to significantly impact the phenotype of cultured cells in the abstract, in practise the importance of the above parameters does not appear to be well recognized in the non-specialist research community. On analyzing two hundred articles from high-impact journals we find a large majority missing at least one key piece of information necessary to ensure consistency in replication. We propose that explicitly reporting these values should be a requirement for publication."
https://openalex.org/W2896026219,"The transcriptional co-activator p300 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that is typically recruited to transcriptional enhancers and regulates gene expression by acetylating chromatin. Here we show that the activation of p300 directly depends on the activation and oligomerization status of transcription factor ligands. Using two model transcription factors, IRF3 and STAT1, we demonstrate that transcription factor dimerization enables the trans-autoacetylation of p300 in a highly conserved and intrinsically disordered autoinhibitory lysine-rich loop, resulting in p300 activation. We describe a crystal structure of p300 in which the autoinhibitory loop invades the active site of a neighbouring HAT domain, revealing a snapshot of a trans-autoacetylation reaction intermediate. Substrate access to the active site involves the rearrangement of an autoinhibitory RING domain. Our data explain how cellular signalling and the activation and dimerization of transcription factors control the activation of p300, and therefore explain why gene transcription is associated with chromatin acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2897190201,"Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) bear the brunt of the HIV epidemic in South Africa. 'DREAMS' aims to reduce HIV incidence through multi-level combination prevention. We describe HIV incidence and uptake of HIV and sexual reproductive health (SRH) by AGYW in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), prior to DREAMS.Longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of women (15-24 year old) in a population-based HIV incidence cohort within a demographic surveillance site in KZN. Observation time for HIV incidence was person-years at risk while resident. ""Current use of contraceptives"" and ""having an HIV test in the past 12 months"" was compared between 2011 and 2015.In 2015, HIV prevalence was 11.0% and 34.1% and HIV incidence (2011-2015) was 4.54% (95%CI:3.89-5.30) and 7.45% (95%CI:6.51-8.51) per year in 15-19 and 20-24 year olds respectively, with no significant decline compared to 2006-2010. In 2015, 90.7% of 20-24-year-olds were unemployed, 36.4% and 51.7% of 15-19 and 20-24 year olds reported recent migration; 20.9% and 72.6% of 15-19 and 20-24 year olds had ever been pregnant. In 2015, less than 50% reported condom-use at last sex, 15.0% of 15-19 year olds and 48.9% of 20-24 year olds were currently using contraception and 32.0% and 66.7% of 15-19 and 20-24 year olds had tested for HIV in the past 12 months. There had been no improvement compared to 2011. Factors associated with AGYW testing for HIV in the past 12 months were, survey year-2011 more likely than 2015 (aOR = 0.50), number of partners (aOR = 3.25), ever been pregnant (aOR = 2.47) and knowing where to find ART (aOR = 1.54). Factors associated with contraception use were being older (aOR = 4.83); ever been pregnant (aOR = 12.62); knowing where to get ART (aOR = 1.79) and having had an HIV test in past 12 months (aOR = 1.74).Prior to DREAMS, HIV incidence in AGYW was high. HIV and SRH service uptake did not improve and was suboptimal. Findings highlight the need for combination HIV prevention programmes for AGYW in this economically vulnerable area."
https://openalex.org/W2895994095,"Specific RNA structures control numerous metabolic processes that impact human health, and yet efforts to target RNA structures de novo have been limited. In eukaryotes, the self-splicing group II intron is a mitochondrial RNA tertiary structure that is absent in vertebrates but essential for respiration in plants, fungi and yeast. Here we show that this RNA can be targeted through a process of high-throughput in vitro screening, SAR and lead optimization, resulting in high-affinity compounds that specifically inhibit group IIB intron splicing in vitro and in vivo and lack toxicity in human cells. The compounds are potent growth inhibitors of the pathogen Candida parapsilosis, displaying antifungal activity comparable to that of amphotericin B. These studies demonstrate that RNA tertiary structures can be successfully targeted de novo, resulting in pharmacologically valuable compounds. High-throughput screening followed by an examination of structureâactivity relationship-based optimization resulted in the identification of potent small-molecule inhibitors of group IIB intron splicing in fungal organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2896672523,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 contains gshA and gshB genes, which encode enzymes involved in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. Challenging P. aeruginosa with hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and t-butyl hydroperoxide increased the expression of gshA and gshB. The physiological roles of these genes in P. aeruginosa oxidative stress, bacterial virulence, and biofilm formation were examined using P. aeruginosa ÎgshA, ÎgshB, and double ÎgshAÎgshB mutant strains. These mutants exhibited significantly increased susceptibility to methyl viologen, thiol-depleting agent, and methylglyoxal compared to PAO1. Expression of functional gshA, gshB or exogenous supplementation with GSH complemented these phenotypes, which indicates that the observed mutant phenotypes arose from their inability to produce GSH. Virulence assays using a Drosophila melanogaster model revealed that the ÎgshA, ÎgshB and double ÎgshAÎgshB mutants exhibited attenuated virulence phenotypes. An analysis of virulence factors, including pyocyanin, pyoverdine, and cell motility (swimming and twitching), showed that these levels were reduced in these gsh mutants compared to PAO1. In contrast, biofilm formation increased in mutants. These data indicate that the GSH product and the genes responsible for GSH synthesis play multiple crucial roles in oxidative stress protection, bacterial virulence and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa."

We aim to describe overnight smartphone activity among young adults and to characterize those with smartphone interrupted sleep in terms of sleep impairment and mental and physical health indicators.We use unique objective high-resolution information on timing of smartphone activity (based on >250,000 phone actions) continuously monitored over a four-week period among 815 young adults combined with indicators of mental and physical health.We find substantial overnight smartphone activity. More than 12% had smartphone activity in the middle of the night (3 to 5 hours after self-reported bedtime) and 41% had smartphone interrupted sleep on at least one weekday during a 4-week period. Those with frequent smartphone interrupted sleep had on average 48 minutes shorter self-reported sleep duration and higher body mass index, whereas there were no differences in physical or mental health symptoms.The substantial smartphone activity during bed hours among young adults may pose a public health challenge and especially the relation to overweight warrants close attention."
https://openalex.org/W2895895081,"The aim of this study was to describe the changes in body composition, strength and sprint performance in response to an entire competitive season of football training supplemented with 2 inertial eccentric-overload training sessions a week in young male professional soccer players. Whole body and regional composition (assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), power output in half-squat and 40-m sprinting performance were evaluated in fourteen players. The eccentric-overload training consisted of training sessions a week of 1-2 sets of 10 exercises of upper-body and core (Day 1) and lower-body (Day 2), during the entire competitive season (27 weeks). Whole body fat mass decreased (-6.3 Â± 3.6%, ES = -0.99 Â± 0.54) substantially while lean mass increased (2.5 Â± 0.8%, ES = 0.25 Â± 0.09), with some regional differences. There was a substantial increase in half-squat power output (from 3% to 14%, ES from 0.45 to 1.73) and sprint performance (from 1.1% to 1.8%, ES from -0.33 to -0.44), however performance changes were not correlated with changes in body composition. A combined soccer and eccentric-overload training program was able to promote positive changes in body composition and physical factors relevant to both on-field performance and injury prevention in elite soccer players."
https://openalex.org/W2949600927,"How do migration and acculturation (i.e. psychological or behavioral change resulting from migration) affect within- and between-group cultural variation? Here I address this question by drawing analogies between genetic and cultural evolution. Population genetic models show that migration rapidly breaks down between-group genetic structure. In cultural evolution, however, migrants or their descendants can acculturate to local behaviors via social learning processes such as conformity, potentially preventing migration from eliminating between-group cultural variation. An analysis of the empirical literature on migration suggests that acculturation is common, with second and subsequent migrant generations shifting, sometimes substantially, towards the cultural values of the adopted society. Yet there is little understanding of the individual-level dynamics that underlie these population-level shifts. To explore this formally, I present models quantifying the effect of migration and acculturation on between-group cultural variation, for both neutral and costly cooperative traits. In the models, between-group cultural variation, measured using F statistics, is eliminated by migration and maintained by conformist acculturation. The extent of acculturation is determined by the strength of conformist bias and the number of demonstrators from whom individuals learn. Acculturation is countered by assortation, the tendency for individuals to preferentially interact with culturally-similar others. Unlike neutral traits, cooperative traits can additionally be maintained by payoff-biased social learning, but only in the presence of strong sanctioning mechanisms (e.g. institutions). Overall, the models show that surprisingly little conformist acculturation is required to maintain realistic amounts of between-group cultural diversity. While these models provide insight into the potential dynamics of acculturation and migration in cultural evolution, they also highlight the need for more empirical research into the individual-level learning biases that underlie migrant acculturation."
https://openalex.org/W2895964279,"The morphogenetic remodelling of embryo architecture after implantation culminates in pro-amniotic cavity formation. Despite its key importance, how this transformation occurs remains unknown. Here, we apply high-resolution imaging of embryos developing in vivo and in vitro, spatial RNA sequencing and 3D trophoblast stem cell models to determine the sequence and mechanisms of these remodelling events. We show that cavitation of the embryonic tissue is followed by folding of extra-embryonic tissue to mediate the formation of a second extra-embryonic cavity. Concomitantly, at the boundary between embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues, a hybrid 3D rosette forms. Resolution of this rosette enables the embryonic cavity to invade the extra-embryonic tissue. Subsequently, Î²1-integrin signalling mediates the formation of multiple extra-embryonic 3D rosettes. Podocalyxin exocytosis leads to their polarized resolution, permitting the extension of embryonic and extra-embryonic cavities and their fusion into a unified pro-amniotic cavity. These morphogenetic transformations of embryogenesis reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism for lumen expansion and fusion. Using time-lapse microscopy and transcriptome analysis of the post-implantation mouse embryo, Christodoulou et al. show that cavity fusion occurs through the formation and polarized resolution of multiple, multicellular three-dimensional rosettes."
https://openalex.org/W2896800354,"Objectives This study aimed to examine the prevalence and risk factors of dyslipidemia in different diabetic progression stages among middle-aged and elderly Chinese populations. Methods The 2010â2012 China National Nutrition and Health Survey (CNNHS) is a nationally representative cross-sectional study. In the present study, a total of 69,974 participants aged â¥ 45 years were included. Dyslipidemia was defined based on the Chinese adult dyslipidemia prevention guide. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to examine the associations between risk factors and dyslipidemia. Results The prevalence of dyslipidemia was 39.9%, 46.8%, and 59.3% in participants with normal glucose, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Women had a lower dyslipidemia prevalence than men (38.7% vs. 43.3%). Dyslipidemia prevalence was positively associated with the education level and inversely correlated with the physical activity level, and negatively related to age only among prediabetes and T2DM groups (P for trend < 0.05). Obesity, abdominal obesity, and hypertension were associated with dyslipidemia. Conclusions The prevalence of dyslipidemia was relatively high among middle-aged and elderly T2DM person. There are different associations between multiple risk factors and dyslipidemia in different diabetic progression stages."
https://openalex.org/W2896418674,"Background Despite the urgent need for new, effective antibiotics, few antibiotics of value have entered the market during the past decades. Therefore, incentives have been developed to stimulate antibiotic R&D. For these incentives to be effective, geographic availability for recently approved antibiotics needs to be better understood. In this study, we analyze geographic availability and market introduction of antibiotics approved between 1999 and 2014. Material and method We identified antibiotics, considered new chemical entities (NCEs) for systemic use approved globally between 1999 and 2014, from national medicine agenciesâ lists of approved drugs, and data from the WHO Collaborating Center for Drug Statistics. Geographic availability was mapped using sales data from IQVIA, and analyzed with regards to class, indication, safety, and origin. Results Of the 25 identified NCEs, only 12 had registered sales in more than 10 countries. NCEs with the widest geographic availability had registered sales in more than 70 countries within a ten-year timeframe and 30 countries within a three-year timeframe, spreading across five different geographic regions and three country income classes. Half (52%) of the NCEs had an indication for infections caused by antibiotic- resistant bacteria, little diversity was seen regarding target pathogen and indication. Antibiotics originated from and/or marketed by companies from the US or Europe had greater geographic availability compared to Japanese antibiotics, which seldom reached outside of Asia. For 20 NCEs developers chose to fully or partially sublicense marketing rights to a number of companies of different sizes. Conclusion Our findings show great variation in geographic availability of antibiotics, indicating that availability in multiple regions and country income classes is possible, but rarely seen within a few years of market authorization. Sublicensing agreements between multiple companies was common practice. Moreover, differences were seen between countries regarding benefit/risk evaluations and company behavior. These findings could be a potential source of uncertainties, and create barriers to assure that working antibiotics are developed and made available according to public health needs."
https://openalex.org/W2896852011,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a stimulator of the innate immune system and is routinely used in animal models to study blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction under inflammatory conditions. It is appreciated that both humans and mice have sexually dimorphic immune responses, which could influence the brainâs response to a systemic inflammatory insult. Mouse strain is also an important factor that can contribute to pathophysiological responses to inflammatory stimuli. Therefore, we aimed to test whether BBB disruption and the associated cytokine profiles in response to LPS differed in male and female mice from two mouse strains most commonly used in blood-brain barrier studies: CD-1 and C57BL6/J (C57). Mice were treated with saline, a single injection of 0.3, or 3mg/kg LPS, or three injections of 3mg/kg LPS, and studied 28 hours after the first LPS injection. To assay BBB disruption, we utilized the tracer 99mTc-DTPA. A 23-plex panel of cytokines was assayed in brain and blood of the same cohort of mice, which allowed us to compare differences in the levels of individual cytokines as well as correlations among cytokines and 99mTc-DTPA uptake. We found that only the three-injection dose of LPS induced significant BBB disruption in all sexes and strains. The treatment, strain, and sex, as well as treatment-by- strain and treatment-by-sex interactions significantly contributed to the variance. The mean brain/serum ratios of 99mTc-DTPA in the three-injection LPS group were ranked CD-1 male < CD-1 female < C57 male < C57 female. There were significant sex and strain differences in cytokine profiles in brain and blood, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in brain were most strongly correlated with 99mTc-DTPA brain/serum ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2896450745,"Participatory planning networks made of government agencies, stakeholders, citizens and scientists are receiving attention as a potential pathway to build resilient landscapes in the face of increased wildfire impacts due to suppression policies and land-use and climate changes. A key challenge for these networks lies in incorporating local knowledge and social values about landscape into operational wildfire management strategies. As large wildfires overcome the suppression capacity of the fire departments, such strategies entail difficult decisions about intervention priorities among different regions, values and socioeconomic interests. Therefore there is increasing interest in developing tools that facilitate decision-making during emergencies. In this paper we present a method to democratize wildfire strategies by incorporating social values about landscape in both suppression and prevention planning. We do so by reporting and critically reflecting on the experience from a pilot participatory process conducted in a region of Catalonia (Spain). There, we built a network of researchers, practitioners and citizens across spatial and governance scales. We combined knowledge on expected wildfires, landscape co-valuation by relevant actors, and citizen participation sessions to design a wildfire strategy that minimized the loss of social values. Drawing on insights from political ecology and transformation science, we discuss what the attempt to democratize wildfire strategies entails in terms of power relationships and potential for social-ecological transformation. Based on our experience, we suggest a trade-off between current wildfire risk levels and democratic management in the fire-prone regions of many western countries. In turn, the political negotiation about the landscape effects of wildfire expert knowledge is shown as a potential transformation pathway towards lower risk landscapes that can re-define agency over landscape and foster community re-learning on fire. We conclude that democratizing wildfire strategies ultimately entails co-shaping the landscapes and societies of the future."
https://openalex.org/W2897186310,"The trophic link between cod (Gadus sp.) and capelin (Mallotus sp.) is important in many panarctic ecosystems. Since the early 2000s, the Northeast Arctic cod stock (G. morhua) in the Barents Sea has increased greatly, and the sea has been exceptionally warm. Such changes have potentially large effects on species distributions and overlap, which in turn could affect the strength of species interactions. Due to its high latitude location, the Barents Sea has strong seasonal variation in physical conditions and interactions. To study drivers of variation in cod-capelin overlap, we use data from two annual surveys run in winter and in autumn of 2004â2015. We first model winter and autumn spatial distributions of mature and immature cod and capelin. We then calculate overlap from model predictions on a grid with similar spatial resolution as the survey data. Our approach allowed us to interpret changes in overlap as species-specific effects of stock size and temperature, while accounting for sampling variation due to sampling time and depth. We found that during winter both species expanded their distribution in response to increased stock sizes, but how strongly and where the expansion occurred varied. The effect of temperature on distributions varied in space, and differed for cod and capelin and for different components of the two species. The results for autumn were clearer and more consistent. Both species expanded their distribution areas as their stock sizes increased. A positive effect of temperature was found in the north-eastern Barents Sea, where temperatures were lowest at the start of the study. Overlap increased and shifted north-eastwards during the study period and remained high despite a decline in the capelin stock. The increased overlap during autumn could mainly be attributed to the shift in cod distribution with increased cod stock biomass."
https://openalex.org/W2897409201,"Background Climate change is affecting food systems globally, with implications for food security, nutrition, and the health of human populations. There are limited data characterizing the current and future consequences of climate change on local food security for populations already experiencing poor nutritional indicators. Indigenous Amazonian populations have a high reported prevalence of nutritional deficiencies. This paper characterizes the food system of the Shawi of the Peruvian Amazon, climatic and non-climatic drivers of their food security vulnerability to climate change, and identifies potential maladaptation trajectories. Methods and findings Semi-structured interviews with key informants (n = 24), three photovoice workshops (n = 17 individuals), transect walks (n = 2), a food calendar exercise, and two community dissemination meetings (n = 30 individuals), were conducted within two Shawi communities in Balsapuerto District in the Peruvian Loreto region between June and September of 2014. The Shawi food system was based on three main food sub-systems (forest, farming and externally-sourced). Shawi reported collective, gendered, and emotional notions related to their food system activities. Climatic and non-climatic drivers of food security vulnerability among Shawi participants acted at proximal and distal levels, and mutually reinforced key maladaptation trajectories, including: 1) a growing population and natural resource degradation coupled with limited opportunities to increase incomes, and 2) a desire for education and deforestation reinforced by governmental social and food interventions. Conclusion A series of maladaptive trajectories have the potential to increase social and nutritional inequities for the Shawi. Transformational food security adaptation should include consideration of Indigenous perceptions and priorities, and should be part of Peruvian food and socioeconomic development policies."
https://openalex.org/W2897923194,"Precise, objective data on brood and honey levels in honey bee colonies can be obtained through the analysis of hive frame photographs. However, accurate analysis of all the frame photographs from medium- to large-scale experiments is time-consuming. This limits the number of hives than can be practically included in honeybee studies. Faster estimation methods exist but they significantly decrease precision and their use requires a larger sample size to maintain statistical power. To resolve this issue, we created âCombCountâ a python program that automatically detects uncapped cells to speed up measurements of capped brood and capped honey on photos of frames. CombCount does not require programming skills, it was designed to facilitate colony-level research in honeybees and to provide a fast, free, and accurate alternative to older methods based on visual estimations. Six observers measured the same photos of thirty different frames both with CombCount and by manually outlining the entire capped areas with ImageJ. The results obtained were highly similar between both the observers and the two methods, but measurements with CombCount were 3.2 times faster than with ImageJ (4 and 13 min per side of the frame, respectively) and all observers were faster when using CombCount rather than ImageJ. CombCount was used to measure the proportions of capped brood and capped honey on each frame of 16 hives over a year as they developed from packages to full-size colonies over about 60 days. Our data describe the formation of brood and honey stores during the establishment of a new colony."

https://openalex.org/W2896709706,"Mutations leading to constitutive RAS activation contribute in myeloid leukemogenesis. RAS mutations in myeloid cells are accompanied by excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the source of ROS and their role for the initiation and progression of leukemia have not been clearly defined. To determine the role of NOX2-derived ROS in RAS-driven leukemia, double transgenic LSL-KrasG12D Ã Mx1-Cre mice expressing oncogenic KRAS in hematopoietic cells (M-KrasG12D) were treated with NÎ±-methyl-histamine (NMH) that targeted the production of NOX2-derived ROS in leukemic cells by agonist activity at histamine H2 receptors. M-KrasG12D mice developed myeloid leukemia comprising mature CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells that produced NOX2-derived ROS. Treatment of M-KrasG12D mice with NMH delayed the development of myeloproliferative disease and prolonged survival. In addition, NMH-treated M-KrasG12D mice showed reduction of intracellular ROS along with reduced DNA oxidation and reduced occurence of double-stranded DNA breaks in myeloid cells. The in vivo expansion of leukemia was markedly reduced in triple transgenic mice where KRAS was expressed in hematopoietic cells of animals with genetic NOX2 deficiency (Nox2-/- Ã LSL-KrasG12D Ã Mx1-Cre). Treatment with NMH did not alter in vivo expansion of leukemia in these NOX2-deficient transgenic mice. We propose that NOX2-derived ROS may contribute to the progression of KRAS-induced leukemia and that strategies to target NOX2 merit further evaluation in RAS-mutated hematopoietic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2897697431,"The adhesion of tendon and surrounding tissue is the most common complication after repairing an injured tendon. The injured flexor tendons in zone II are frequently accompanied by tendon sheath defects, which lead to poor recovery. A variety of biological and non-biological materials have been recently used for repair or as substitute for tendon sheaths to prevent tendon adhesion. However, non-biological materials, such as polyethylene films, have been used to prevent tendon adhesions by mechanical isolation. The possibility of tendon necrosis and permanent foreign body remains due to the lack of permeability and the obstruction of nutrient infiltration. The natural macromolecule amniotic membrane derived from organisms is a semi-permeable membrane with the following characteristics: smooth; without vascular, nerve, and lymphatic; and rich in matrix, cytokines, enzymes, and other active ingredients. The unique structure of this membrane makes it an ideal biomaterial. In the experiment in Henry chicken, the model of tendon sheath defect and the flexor digitorum tendon in zone II was established and randomly divided into control group, medical membrane group, and decellularized amniotic membrane group. Samples were obtained at the 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 12th week after operation. General, histological, and biomechanical tests were performed to investigate the preventive effect of repaired tendon sheath by decallularized amniotic membrane. Experimental results showed the following: the amniotic membrane group and the medical membrane group had mild inflammatory reaction and tissue edema, and nearly no adhesion was observed in the surrounding tissue; the fibroblast-like cells were distributed in layers under the light microscope; the amniotic membrane group was denser than the medical membrane group cells, and numerous fibroblasts were disorganized in the control group. Biomechanical measurements showed that the sliding distance of tendon, the total flexion angle of the toes, and the tendon maximum tensile breaking strength at the early postoperative were significantly better than in the control group. Through this experiment, the amniotic membrane, as a natural biological substitute material in the construction of tendon sheath, can effectively inhibit exogenous healing and promote endogenous healing to prevent tendon adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2896966224,"Aims This research aimed to assess the application to the gambling industry, of Corporate Political Activity (CPA) analysis previously developed from public health research on tobacco industry interactions with political institutions and previously applied to the alcohol industry, but not the gambling industry. Background A growing body of literature has confirmed how public interest outcomes are frequently opposed by vested interests. This research focused on gambling industry submissions to a 2013 Australian Parliamentary inquiry into sports betting advertising. Gambling advertising became highly controversial following deregulation of sports betting advertising in Australia subsequent to the 2008 Australian High Court Betfair challenge. The dramatic increase in gambling advertising during sporting event broadcasts at childrenâs viewing times and on new interactive technology, sparked public concerns. A series of national regulatory reviews followed and the gambling industry was actively involved in opposing further regulation. Method The research used a corporate political activity (CPA) framework of analysis developed by UK tobacco public health researchers, which identified strategies and tactics used internationally by the tobacco industry, to broker pro-tobacco public policy outcomes. Testing the application of this CPA framework to gambling pro-industry strategies/tactics, this research focused on gambling industry submissions to the 2013 Australian Parliamentary Committee Inquiry. Results Like the tobacco industry, the research found the gambling industry used identified strategies and tactics, some new tactics and a new strategy of âCorporate Social Responsibilityâ, promoting âresponsibleâ industry practices and pre-emptive establishment of internal âresponsibilityâ units/practices. Despite public concerns regarding sports betting advertising, the gambling industry reinforced individual choice/blame for harms and claimed it acted responsibly. It did this using strategies identified in the tobacco industry CPA framework: information strategy (and shaping the evidence base); financial incentive strategy; constituency building strategy; policy substitution strategy; legal strategy; and constituency fragmentation and destabilization strategy. Conclusion Similar to the CPA analysis applied to tobacco and alcohol industries, the research demonstrated the usefulness of the CPA taxonomy for analyzing and documenting pre-emptive industry policy strategies and tactics, exposing gambling industry efforts to maintain industry self-regulation via voluntary codes and avoid more government regulation. Cross-sectoral application of the framework signals great potential for use of CPA by policymakers and public health advocates as a tool in the analysis of corporate industry arguments/discourses."
https://openalex.org/W2951574116,"Functional impairment after brain ischemia results in part from loss of neuronal spines and dendrites, independent of neuronal death. Cofilin-actin rods are covalently linked aggregates of cofilin-1 and actin that form in neuronal processes (neurites) under conditions of ATP depletion and oxidative stress, and which cause neurite degeneration if not disassembled. ATP depletion and oxidative stress occur with differing severity, duration, and time course in different ischemic conditions. Here we evaluated four mouse models of brain ischemia to define the conditions that drive formation of cofilin-actin rods. Three of the models provide early reperfusion: transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (CCAo), and cardiac arrest / cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Early reperfusion restores ATP generating capacity, but also induces oxidative stress. The fourth model, photothrombotic cortical infarction, does not provide reperfusion. Cofilin-actin rods were formed in each of these models, but with differing patterns. Where acute reperfusion occurred, rod formation was maximal within 4 hours after reperfusion. Where infarction occurred, rods continued to form for at least 24 hours after ischemic onset, and extended into the adjacent non-ischemic tissue. Interventions that limit cofilin-actin rod formation may help to preserve integrity of neuronal processes in permanent ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2896390220,"Adverse weather related to reduced visibility caused by fog and rain can seriously affect the mobility and safety of drivers. It is meaningful to develop effective intelligent transportation system (ITS) strategies to mitigate the negative effects of these different types of adverse weather related to reduced visibility by investigating the effect of rain and fog on traffic parameters. A number of previous researches focused on analyzing the effect of adverse weather related to reduced visibility by using simulated traffic and weather data. There are few researchers that addressed the impact of adverse weather instances using real-time data. Moreover, this paper conducts comprehensive investigation to clearly compare the changes of driving behavior and traffic parameters in adverse weather including fog and rain using real-time traffic and weather data collected by advanced vehicle-based traffic sensors and weather sensors. After some preliminary analysis, the analysis of variance method (ANOVA) was applied to further compare the significance of effects of these two kinds of adverse weather on traffic parameters. The conditional regression models were employed finally to explore the relationship between these two types of adverse weather and traffic parameters. The results would be beneficial to develop effective intelligent traffic control countermeasures under these different types of adverse weather conditions related to reduced visibility."
https://openalex.org/W2897009603,"To successfully colonize the intestine, bacteria must survive passage through the stomach. The permeability of the outer membrane renders the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria vulnerable to stomach acid, which inactivates proteins. Here we report that the semipermeable nature of the outer membrane allows the development of a strong Donnan equilibrium across this barrier at low pH. As a result, when bacteria are exposed to conditions that mimic gastric juice, periplasmic chloride concentrations rise to levels that exceed 0.6 M. At these chloride concentrations, proteins readily aggregate in vitro. The acid sensitivity of strains lacking acid-protective chaperones is enhanced by chloride, suggesting that these chaperones protect periplasmic proteins both from acidification and from the accompanying accumulation of chloride. These results illustrate how organisms have evolved chaperones to respond to the substantial chemical threat imposed by otherwise innocuous chloride concentrations that are amplified to proteotoxic levels by low-pH-induced Donnan equilibrium effects."
https://openalex.org/W2897093526,"Straw return (SR) and rice water-saving irrigation (WSI) affect the greenhouse gas emission of paddy fields. However, studies on CO2 exchange between paddy fields and the atmosphere with joint regulation of SR and WSI are few. We conducted a two-year field experiment to investigate the effects of SR on soil respiration and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) in paddy fields under controlled irrigation (CI), which is a typical WSI technique. The rice yields, irrigation water use efficiency, seasonal variations in soil respiration, NEE, and soil organic carbon content were measured. Compared with the control (flooding irrigation and traditional chemical fertilizer), a significant increase in rice yield and irrigation water use efficiency in the paddy fields under CI and SR joint management (CS) was observed. CS increased the soil respiration rate during most of the rice growth stage and increased the net CO2 absorption rate before approximately 80 days after transplanting; afterward, the pattern reversed. Total CO2 emissions through soil respiration in CS paddy fields increased by 43.7% and 182% compared with the control in 2014 and 2015, respectively. However, CS also caused an increase in the total net CO2 absorption by 18.1% and 30.1% in these two years, respectively. The acceleration in the consumption and decomposition of soil organic carbon induced by frequent alternate wetâdry cycles of the CI paddy fields increased the soil respiration and decreased the net CO2 absorption. SR promoted soil respiration but also improved rice growth, increasing the net CO2 absorption. The soil organic carbon content of the CS paddy fields after harvesting increased by 23.2% compared with that before transplanting. The present study concluded that joint regulation of WSI and SR is an effective measure for maintaining yield, increasing irrigation water use efficiency, mitigating CO2 emission, and promoting paddy soil fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2896500243,"Extracellular vesicles (ECVs) are heterogeneous membrane-enclosed structures containing proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids that participate in intercellular communication by transferring their contents to recipient cells. Although most of the attention has been directed at the biologic effect of proteins and microRNA, the contribution of phospholipids present in ECVs on cellular activation has not been extensively addressed. We investigated the biologic effect of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), 2 phospholipids highly abundant in ECVs. A transcriptomic analysis revealed that â¼4700 genes were specifically modified by exposing peritoneal macrophages to PS or PC liposomes in vivo. Among them, the expression of several chemokines and cytokines was highly upregulated by PS liposome treatment, translating into a massive neutrophil infiltration of the peritoneum capable of neutralizing a septic polymicrobial insult. Both the l and d stereoisomers of PS induced the same response, suggesting that the effect was related to the negative charge of the phospholipid head. We concluded that an increase in the internal negative charge of the cell triggers a signaling cascade activating an innate immune response capable of controlling infection.-Cauvi, D. M., Hawisher, D., Dores-Silva, P. R., Lizardo, R. E., De Maio, A. Macrophage reprogramming by negatively charged membrane phospholipids controls infection."
https://openalex.org/W2896892430,"Background Inhalation errors frequently occur in patients receiving inhalation treatment, which can significantly impair treatment success. While this underscores the importance of inhalation training, the role of modern web-based instructional videos has not yet been investigated. Methods A randomized controlled trial using standardized checklists (10 items: preparation, N = 3, inhalation routine, N = 6, and closure of inhalation, N = 1) was carried out to determine the relative effects of web-based, device-specific videos versus standard personal instruction on reducing multiple (â¥2) inhalation errors in severe COPD patients requiring hospitalisation. Investigators assessing inhalation errors were blinded to the intervention. Results Multiple handling errors were recorded at baseline in 152 out of 159 patients (95.6%). Each teaching method led to a similar reduction in errors (videos: from 4.2Â±1.6 to 1.5Â±1.5 errors; personal instruction: from 3.8Â±1.5 to 1.3Â±1.6; p<0.0001), although non-inferiority of web-based video teaching could not be confirmed statistically due to an unpredictably high number of patients in both groups still making multiple handling errors (44.0% versus 40.3%, mean difference 3.7%; 95%CI [-12.0â19.4%]). Conclusion Multiple inhalation errors regularly occur in severe COPD patients requiring hospitalisation. Web-based video teaching is capable of reducing inhalation errors. However, compared to personal instruction non-inferiority could not be established. This was due to an unexpectedly high number of patients with persisting inhalation errors despite training.

https://openalex.org/W2897442894,"Theorists have proposed that heightened anxiety vulnerability is characterised by reduced attentional control performance and have made the prediction in turn that elevating cognitive load will adversely impact attentional control performance for high anxious individuals to a greater degree than low anxious individuals. Critically however, existing attempts to test this prediction have been limited in their methodology and have presented inconsistent findings. Using a methodology capable of overcoming the limitations of previous research, the present study sought to investigate the effect of manipulating cognitive load on inhibitory attentional control performance of high anxious and low anxious individuals. High and low trait anxious participants completed an antisaccade task, requiring the execution of prosaccades towards, or antisaccades away from, emotionally toned stimuli while eye movements were recorded. Participants completed the antisaccade task under conditions that concurrently imposed a lesser cognitive load, or greater cognitive load. Analysis of participantsâ saccade latencies revealed high trait anxious participants demonstrated generally poorer inhibitory attentional control performance as compared to low trait anxious participants. Furthermore, conditions imposing greater cognitive load, as compared to lesser cognitive load, resulted in enhanced inhibitory attentional control performance across participants generally. Crucially however, analyses did not reveal an effect of cognitive load condition on anxiety-linked differences in inhibitory attentional control performance, indicating that elevating cognitive load did not adversely impact attentional control performance for high anxious individuals to a greater degree than low anxious individuals. Hence, the present findings are inconsistent with predictions made by some theorists and are in contrast to the findings of earlier investigations. These findings further highlight the need for research into the relationship between anxiety, attentional control, and cognitive load."
https://openalex.org/W2897877260,"The current study quantified the influence of cartilage defect location on the tibiofemoral load distribution during gait. Furthermore, changes in local mechanical stiffness representative for matrix damage or bone ingrowth were investigated. This may provide insights in the mechanical factors contributing to cartilage degeneration in the presence of an articular cartilage defect.The load distribution following cartilage defects was calculated using a musculoskeletal model that included tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints with 6 degrees-of-freedom. Circular cartilage defects of 100 mm2 were created at different locations in the tibiofemoral contact geometry. By assigning different mechanical properties to these defect locations, softening and hardening of the tissue were evaluated.Results indicate that cartilage defects located at the load-bearing area only affect the load distribution of the involved compartment. Cartilage defects in the central part of the tibia plateau and anterior-central part of the medial femoral condyle present the largest influence on load distribution. Softening at the defect location results in overloading, i.e., increased contact pressure and compressive strains, of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, inside the defect, the contact pressure decreases and the compressive strain increases. Hardening at the defect location presents the opposite results in load distribution compared to softening. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the surrounding contact pressure, contact force and compressive strain alter significantly when the elastic modulus is below 7 MPa or above 18 MPa.Alterations in local mechanical behavior within the high load bearing area resulted in aberrant loading conditions, thereby potentially affecting the homeostatic balance not only at the defect but also at the tissue surrounding and opposing the defect. Especially, cartilage softening predisposes the tissue to loads that may contribute to accelerated risk of cartilage degeneration and the initiation or progression towards osteoarthritis of the whole compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2897884237,"Objective The proportion of elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is continuously growing as a result of the increasing aging population. We compared disease activity between different age groups, and evaluated the clinical factors associated with high disease activity. Methods This cross-sectional study analyzed the data of RA patients enrolled in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics registry (KOBIO-RA) between 2012 and 2014. Disease activity between elderly (age â¥ 65 years) and non-elderly patients (age < 65 years) was compared, and the association of clinical factors with high disease activity was assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results Of 1,227 patients in KOBIO-RA, 244 patients with RA were aged 65 years or over. In elderly patients, the proportion of men was higher (P = 0.012), and the duration of disease was longer (P < 0.001) compared with non-elderly patients. The elderly group showed a higher incidence of comorbidity (P < 0.001), and less use of methotrexate (P = 0.004). Assessment of disease activity using various composite measures showed a higher proportion of high disease activity in elderly patients than non-elderly patients. Longer disease duration, presence of comorbidity, and non-use of methotrexate were independently associated with high disease activity (P = 0.002, P < 0.001, and P = 0.029, respectively). Conclusions At enrollment of KOBIO-RA, elderly patients showed higher disease activity compared with non-elderly patients. Disease duration, use of methotrexate, and comorbidity are associated with disease activity control in Korean patients with RA."
https://openalex.org/W2897034560,"Objective Peri- and postoperative time course of meningioma patients who had undergone surgical treatment was evaluated to determine prognostic factors of neurological outcome by focusing on preoperative parameters. Material and methods A retrospective monocenter analysis was performed including patients who were operated in the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Leipzig, from 2009 to 2015. Data from all patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of intracranial meningioma treated microsurgically were included in the study. The individual characteristics of the patients, meningiomas and Karnofsky Performance scores (KPS) were analyzed by multivariate tests. Results Two hundred ninety-four patients with a median age of 61 years (range: 17â89) were included. Preoperative KPS (p < 0.001), skull base as tumor origin and tumor size (p < 0.05) proved to be significantly strong prognostic factors of KPS deterioration one year postoperative by multivariate analysis. According to uni- and bivariate analysis, the following prognostic factors could also be found: preoperative mass displacement, preexisting recurrence and presence of preoperative symptoms. In this study, age had no significant influence on deterioration in patient health state, measured by KPS, one year postoperative. Conclusion Patients generally obtained an improvement in KPS score after microsurgical treatment. The knowledge of prognostic factors can be very helpful in the decision-making process for meningioma treatment of the elderly, particularly to estimate the postoperative outcome and quality of life."

Healthy volunteers (HVs) received single doses of AL-335 (100-1,200 mg) or placebo in a fasted or fed (400 mg) state. Non-cirrhotic subjects (HCV genotype [GT]1-4) and GT1-infected subjects with Child Pugh A cirrhosis received multiple doses of AL-335 (400, 800, 1,200 mg) or placebo once daily (QD) for 7 days.Forty-eight HVs and 64 subjects with HCV GT1-4 were randomized and received treatment. AL-335 was well tolerated in HVs and HCV-infected subjects with/without cirrhosis. AL-335 was rapidly absorbed and converted to the metabolites ALS-022399 and ALS-022227. ALS-022227 exposure increased less than dose-proportionally and was unaffected by food, while AL-335 and ALS-022399 exposure increased with food by 85% and 50%, respectively, in HVs. Rapid and dose-dependent reductions in HCV-RNA were observed in GT1-infected subjects. In non-cirrhotic, GT1-4-infected subjects receiving AL-335 800 mg QD, potent antiviral activity was observed, regardless of genotype (mean maximum reductions in HCV-RNA of 4.0-4.8 log10 IU/mL). The same dose in GT1-infected cirrhotic subjects resulted in a 3.5 log10 IU/mL mean maximum reduction in HCV-RNA.AL-335 was well tolerated when administered as single and multiple doses, with an acceptable pharmacokinetic profile. The drug also demonstrated potent antiviral activity in HCV GT1-4-infected subjects, including GT1-infected subjects with cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W2898058382,"Usually, the launch of the diffusion process is triggered by a few early adoptersâi.e., seeds of diffusion. Many studies have assumed that all seeds are activated once to initiate the diffusion process in social networks and therefore are focused on finding optimal ways of choosing these nodes according to a limited budget. Despite the advances in identifying influencing spreaders, the strategy of activating all seeds at the beginning might not be sufficient in accelerating and maximising the coverage of diffusion. Also, it does not capture real scenarios in which marketing campaigns continuously monitor and support the diffusion process by seeding more nodes. More recent studies investigate the possibility of activating additional seeds as the diffusion process goes forward. In this work, we further examine this approach and search for optimal ways of distributing seeds during the diffusion process according to a pre-allocated seeding budget. Theoretically, we show that a universally best solution does not exist, and we prove that finding an optimal distribution of supporting seeds over time for a particular network is an NP-hard problem. Numerically, we evaluate several seeding strategies on different networks regarding maximising the coverage and minimising the spreading time. We find that each network topology has a best strategy given some spreading parameters. Our findings can be crucial in identifying the best strategies for budget allocation in different scenarios such as marketing or political campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W2897554520,"Background Relevant seroprevalence data for endemic pathogens in a given region provide insight not only into a populationâs susceptibility to acute infection or risk for reactivation disease but also into the potential need for policy initiatives aimed at reducing these risks. Data from sub-Saharan Africa are sparse and since Aga Khan University Hospital Nairobi is an internationally accredited hospital equipped with a laboratory electronic medical record system, analysis of pertinent local seroprevalence data has been made possible. Methods We have analyzed serology data from laboratory electronic records at a 300 bed tertiary private teaching hospital in Kenya for the dates, 2008 to 2017 for Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus, and rubella, which were used primarily for antenatal screening. We also analyzed the data from hepatitis A and amebiasis serologies, which were used primarily for diagnostic purposes. Results For T. gondii, cytomegalovirus, and rubella, we used IgG serology to determine seroprevalence, finding rates of 32%, 86%, and 89%, respectively. There was no significant age-related difference in the 20 to 49 year old age range for any of these three pathogens. Of the Hepatitis A IgM tests that were ordered, 33% were positive with a peak positive rate of 70% in the five to nine year old age range. The seroprevalence of amebiasis was 4% and all cases of seropositivity were accompanied by compatible clinical illness (hepatic abscess). Conclusions These data provide insight into seroprevalence rates of selected pathogens that can be used to guide screening and diagnostic laboratory testing as well as private and public immunization practices."
https://openalex.org/W2896514666,"The occurrence of nosocomial infections has been on the rise for the past twenty years. Notably, infections caused by the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus represent a major clinical problem, as an increase in antibiotic multi-resistant strains has accompanied this rise. There is thus a crucial need to find and characterize new antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria, and against antibiotic-resistant strains in general. We identified a new dermaseptin, DMS-DA6, produced by the skin of the Mexican frog Pachymedusa dacnicolor, with specific antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. This peptide is particularly effective against two multiple drug-resistant strains Enterococcus faecium BM4147 and Staphylococcus aureus DAR5829, and has no hemolytic activity. DMS-DA6 is naturally produced with the C-terminal carboxyl group in either the free or amide forms. By using Gram-positive model membranes and different experimental approaches, we showed that both forms of the peptide adopt an Î±-helical fold and have the same ability to insert into, and to disorganize a membrane composed of anionic lipids. However, the bactericidal capacity of DMS-DA6-NH2 was consistently more potent than that of DMS-DA6-OH. Remarkably, rather than resulting from the interaction with the negatively charged lipids of the membrane, or from a more stable conformation towards proteolysis, the increased capacity to permeabilize the membrane of Gram-positive bacteria of the carboxyamidated form of DMS-DA6 was found to result from its enhanced ability to interact with peptidoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2896756633,"Cancers induce gene expression alterations in stroma surrounding tumors that supports cancer progression. However, it is actually not at all known the extent of altered stromal gene expression enacted by tumors nor the extent to which altered stromal gene expression penetrates the stromal tissue. Presently, post-surgical ""tumor-free"" stromal tissue is determined to be cancer-free based on solely on morphological normality-a criteria that has not changed in more than 100 years despite the existence of sophisticated gene expression data to the contrary. We therefore investigated the extent to which breast tumors alter stromal gene expression in three dimensions in women undergoing mastectomy with the intent of providing a genomic determination for development of future risk of recurrence criteria, and to inform the need for adjuvant full-breast irradiation.Genome-wide gene expression changes were determined in histopathologically normal breast tissue in 33 women undergoing mastectomy for stage II and III primary invasive ductal carcinoma at serial distances in three dimensions from the tumor. Gene expression was determined by genome-wide mRNA analysis and subjected to metagene mRNA characterization. Tumor-like gene expression signatures in stroma were identified that surprisingly transitioned to a plastic, normalizing homeostatic signature with distance from tumor. Stroma closest to tumor displayed a pronounced tumor-like signature enriched in cancer-promoting pathways involved in disruption of basement membrane, cell migration and invasion, WNT signaling and angiogenesis. By 2 cm from tumor in all dimensions, stromal tissues were in transition, displaying homeostatic and tumor suppressing gene activity, while also expressing cancer supporting pathways.The dynamics of gene expression in the post-tumor breast stroma likely co-determines disease outcome: reversion to normality or transition to transformation in morphologically normal tissue. Our stromal genomic signature may be important for personalizing surgical and adjuvant therapeutic decisions and risk of recurrence."

A gradient echo sequence, capable of real-time position updates by the MPT system, was modified to enable needle guidance based on four rigidly attached MPT markers at the back of a needle. Two perpendicular imaging planes were automatically aligned along the calibrated needle and centered at its tip. For user guidance, additional information about the needle trajectory and the tip to target distance were added as image overlay. Both, images and guiding information were displayed on the in-room monitor to facilitate MR guided interventions. The guidance support was evaluated by four experienced interventional radiologists and four novices targeting rubber O-rings embedded in a custom-made phantom on a 3T wide-bore MRI system (80 punctures). The skin to target time, user error, system error and total error were analyzed. The mean skin to target time was 146sÂ±68s with no statistically significant difference between experts and novices. A low mean user error (0.91mmÂ±0.43mm), system error (0.53mmÂ±0.27mm) and total error (0.99mmÂ±0.47mm) was reached in all directions. No statistically significant difference in user error, system error and total error could be found between experts and novices. The presented tracking and image guidance system combined with the user interface offers continuous and interactive control of the imaging plane while puncturing in the magnet enabling accurate real-time feedback for both, experienced and non-experienced users."
https://openalex.org/W2897931125,"Diabetes is a complex metabolic disease characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation in which genetic and environmental factors are involved. Growing evidence implicates that alterations of the gut microbiota potentially contribute to the emergence of metabolic diseases. The human appendix has more recently been recognized as a microbial reservoir for repopulating the gastrointestinal tract and an important part of the immune system. Thus, appendectomy may influence microbial ecology and immune function. This study investigated the association between appendectomy and type 2 diabetes risk.We analyzed a cohort of 10954 patients who underwent appendectomy between 1998 and 2013 based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program database. A comparison cohort of 43815 persons without appendectomy was selected randomly and matched by sex, age, comorbidities, and index year. To ensure reliability of the results, a sensitivity analysis using a propensity score-matched study was performed. We observed the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes in both cohorts.Although the overall incidence of type 2 diabetes in the appendectomy patients was 7.9% higher than that in the non-appendectomy patients, it was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.997-1.168) after the adjustment of confounding factors. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of type 2 diabetes was 1.347 for appendectomy patients < 30 years of age (95% CI, 1.009-1.798) compared to non-appendectomy patients. The incidence of type 2 diabetes was higher within 3 years of post-appendectomy follow-up than for non-appendectomy patients (HR, 2.017; 95% CI, 1.07-3.802). Age impacted the association between appendectomy and type 2 diabetes risk (Pinteraction = 0.002); in contrast, sex did not affect the association between appendectomy and type 2 diabetes risk (Pinteraction = 0.88).Our study results suggest that appendectomy increases type 2 diabetes risk, particularly when performed prior to middle age."
https://openalex.org/W2897637678,"Spindly Leg Syndrome (SLS) is a persistent animal welfare issue associated with the rearing of amphibians in captivity. We conducted two experiments to investigate the effects of diet, water composition and overfeeding on prevalence of SLS in newly metamorphosed harlequin frogs (Atelopus spp.). In our first experiment, we offered 400 full-sibling tadpoles of Atelopus certus isocaloric diets in treatments of 31%, 37%, 42% and 48% crude protein respectively. Tadpoles fed higher protein diets metamorphosed faster, but the incidence of SLS exceeded 80% in all treatments leading to the conclusion that variation in dietary protein was not responsible for causing SLS. We used 720 full-sibling Atelopus glyphus tadpoles in a second experiment to examine the effects of diet type, water composition and diet ration on SLS. We found that an overall incidence of 58% spindly leg in tadpoles reared in tap water, but reduced to about 10% in water treated by reverse osmosis and then reconstituted. It is possible that the reverse osmosis treatment removed some factor that caused the SLS, or that the reconstitution may have added a mineral lacking in the original tap water. Within tap water treatments, overfeeding tadpoles in tanks increased the incidence of SLS. We recommend further experimental research into this condition to identify the causative factors in the water. Additional research into the nutritional composition of food available to wild tadpoles would be useful in formulating captive diets, that have to date been solely based on surrogate species."
https://openalex.org/W2897242353,"Background Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) remains a frequent problem especially after distal pancreatectomy. The application of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate showed promising results in the reduction of POPF after pancreatoduodenectomy prompting an expansion of this technique to distal pancreatectomy. Thus, the objective of the current study was to assess safety, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an intraoperative 2-octyl cyanoacrylate application after distal pancreatectomy. Methods Between April 2015 and June 2016 adult patients scheduled for elective distal pancreatectomy were considered eligible for the study. It was planned to include a total of 35 patients. After distal pancreatectomy with hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant, a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate surgical glue was applied to the cut surface of the pancreas. Patients were followed up for three months with main focus on safety in terms of (serious) adverse events. Further endpoints included POPF, other pancreas-specific and surgical complications. Results 15 patients were included in the study because the manufacturer stopped production and distribution of the investigational device thereafter. There was a total of ten serious adverse events but no device-related events and no mortality. The serious adverse events depicted a typical safety profile after distal pancreatectomy. POPF occurred in five cases (33.3%), delayed gastric emptying and post-pancreatectomy haemorrhage in two cases respectively (13.3%). Conclusions Application of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate to the pancreatic remnant after distal pancreatectomy seems feasible and safe. The planned evaluation of preliminary efficacy was not possible due to the inadvertent early termination and subsequent small sample size of the study. Novel techniques for prevention and therapy of POPF should be evaluated in future trials."
https://openalex.org/W2952487388,"Many trematode parasites cause infection in humans and are thought to be a major public health problem. Their ecological diversity in different regions provides challenging questions on evolution of these organisms. In this report, we perform transcriptome analysis of the giant intestinal fluke, Fasciolopsis buski, using next generation sequencing technology. Short read sequences derived from polyA containing RNA of this organism were assembled into 30,677 unigenes that led to the annotation of 12,380 genes. Annotation of the assembled transcripts enabled insight into processes and pathways in the intestinal fluke, such as RNAi pathway and energy metabolism. The expressed kinome of the organism was characterized by identifying all protein kinases. A rough draft genome assembly for Fasciolopsis buski is also reported herewith with SRA accessions for crosschecking the findings in the analyzed transcriptome data. Transcriptome data also helped us to identify some of the expressed transposable elements. Though many Long Interspersed elements (LINEs) were identified, only two Short Interspersed Elements (SINEs) were visible. Overall transcriptome and draft genome analysis of F. buski helped us to characterize some of its important biological characteristics and provided enormous resources for development of a suitable diagnostic system and anti-parasitic therapeutic molecules."

The growing complexity of cardiac models, together with the increasing use of large ensembles of models (known as populations of models), make extensive simulation studies unfeasible for regular stand-alone computers. To address this problem, we developed DENIS, a cardiac electrophysiology simulator based on the volunteer computing paradigm. We evaluated the performance of DENIS by testing the effect of simulation length, task deadline, and batch size, on the time to complete a batch of simulations. In the experiments, the time to complete a batch of simulations did not increase with simulation length, and had little dependence on batch size. In a test case involving the generation of a population of models, DENIS was able to reduce the simulation time from years to a few days when compared to a stand-alone computer. Such capacity makes it possible to undertake large cardiac simulation projects without the need for high performance computing infrastructure."

The combination of low pH and high anion concentration drives proteins to aggregate, a potentially lethal event unless prevented by specific chaperones."

In this study, we sequenced the complete genome of OMC-P162 and compared it with other serovar 3 strains isolated from patients with different clinical conditions. Ten unique genes in OMC-P162, five of which encoded for hypothetical proteins, were identified. Of these, genes UPV_229 and UPV_230 formed an operon whose open reading frames were predicted to code for a DNA methyltransferase and a hypothetical protein, respectively. DNA modification analysis of the OMC-P162 genome identified N4-methylcytosine (m4C) and N6-methyladenine (m6A), but not 5-methylocytosine (m5C). UPV230 recombinant protein displayed endonuclease activity and recognized the CATG sequence, resulting in a blunt cut between A and T. This restriction enzyme activity was identical to that of the cultivated OMC-P162 strain, suggesting that this restriction enzyme was naturally expressed in OMC-P162. We designated this enzyme as UpaP162. Treatment of pT7Blue plasmid with recombinant protein UPV229 completely blocked UpaP162 restriction enzyme activity. These results suggest that the UPV_229 and UPV_230 genes act as a type II restriction-modification system in Ureaplasma OMC-P162."
https://openalex.org/W2897185883,"Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes are often used to make inferences of past environments and social patterns. We analyze Î´ 13C and Î´ 15N values in contemporary kukui (Aleurites moluccanus) endocarp to examine the effects of site environment. Results from across environmental transects on Hawai'i Island show strong patterns for both stable isotopes. For Î´ 13C a robust linear relationship with elevation is exhibited, strengthened by the inclusion of rainfall. This relationship breaks down at a minimum threshold of annual rainfall, possible relating to physiological responses to drought. For Î´ 15N, the only significant relationship observed pertains to substrate age. The endocarp from kukui is one of the most readily identified plant remains in the Pacific archaeological records and is often targeted for radiocarbon dating. We discuss the potential implications of our results regarding ancient climate, inferred diets, and habitat composition."
