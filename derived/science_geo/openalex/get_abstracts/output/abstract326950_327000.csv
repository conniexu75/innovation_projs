https://openalex.org/W2060416568,The ratios of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 (18O/16O) of cellulose purified from two sets of wheat plants grown under conditions similar in all respects except for a large difference in the 18O/16O ratios of the carbon dioxide supplied to them differ by only a small amount. The difference in the 18O/16O ratios of the cellulose is similar to that observed for the 18O/16O ratios of the water present in the plants. These results indicate that the oxygen derived from carbon dioxide undergoes complete exchange with the oxygen of the water in the plant during the synthesis of cellulose and that the 18O/16O ratio of the water inside the plant is the primary influence on the 18O/16O ratio of cellulose in terrestrial plants.
https://openalex.org/W2141740064,"Fluidization of magnetizable particles by a gas stream in the presence of a uniform applied magnetic field oriented parallel to the flow prevents the hydrodynamic instability that otherwise leads to bubbles and turbulent motion within the medium. The fluidized emulsion expands uniformly in response to gas flow speeds in excess of that at the incipient fluidization point, with transition from the quiescent stable state to bubbling occurring suddenly at a characteristic increased rate of flow. Experimental data demonstrate the dependence of this transition velocity on the intensity of the applied magnetic field, length of the bed, and type of magnetic solids. Data illustrate the pressure distribution through the bed medium, the bedflow characteristics, and other phenomena."

Spectral analysis methods were applied to the data. The ""patchiness"" of the plankton was distributed over all the length scales resolved with no indication of a characteristic patch size. The relative intensity of the zooplankton patchiness was greater than that of the phytoplankton at all spatial scales, with this difference becoming progressively greater for finer-scale features. In the North Sea data, the concentrations of phytoplankton and zooplankton consistently showed negative spatial correlations."

Here a form of nonflying aerodynamic locomotion used by aquatic insects is described, called surface skimming, in which thrust is provided by wing flapping while continuous contact with the water removes the need for total aerodynamic weight support. Stoneflies surface skim with wing areas and muscle power output severely reduced, which indicates that surface skimming could have been an effective form of locomotion for ancestral aquatic insects with small protowings and low muscle power output."
https://openalex.org/W2064851776,"As wind energy receives increasing attention it is important to understand the noneconomic factors limiting the total power that can be extracted from the wind. These factors are examined here with a macroscopic approach. An upper global limit of 1.3 x 10(14) watts is arrived at with a sublimit of 2 x 10(12) watts for the continental United States. Some general conclusions are also reached regarding the sites that would have to be utilized to achieve these levels. Even within these limits, wind energy is seen to offer a potential far larger than many other self-renewing energy sources."

Medium-amplitude magnetic anomalies exist over the Fra Mauro and Cayley Formations (primary and secondary basin ejecta emplaced 3.8 to 4.0 billion years ago) but are nearly absent over the maria and over the craters Copernicus, Kepler, and Reiner and their encircling ejecta mantles. The largest observed anomaly (radial component ∼21 gammas at an altitude of 20 kilometers) is exactly correlated with a conspicuous light-colored deposit on western Oceanus Procellarum known as Reiner γ. Assuming that the Reiner γ deposit is the source body and estimating its maximum average thickness as 10 meters, a minimum mean magnetization level of 5.2 ± 2.4 × 10–2 electromagnetic units per gram, or ∼500 times the stable magnetization component of the most magnetic returned sample, is calculated. An age for its emplacement of ≲ 2.9 billion years is inferred from photogeologic evidence, implying that magnetization of lunar crustal materials must have continued for a period exceeding 1 billion years."
https://openalex.org/W2064470995,The low-temperature relaxation dynamics of supercooled liquids are a long-standing theoretical problem of considerable interest. The vast amount of experimental data on such liquids indicates that viscosity and diffusion in supercooled liquids are non-Arrhenius over a wide range of temperatures. The non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the relaxation time of the slow modes in glass-forming liquids is investigated in connection with the topology of the potential energy landscape in configuration space. An analogy is made between the derived dynamical equations and Cooper's formulation of the pair equation in superconductivity.
https://openalex.org/W2085969070,"The chemoautotrophic fixation of carbon dioxide by bacteria is responsible for an appreciable component of the organic carbon in a sulfide-rich marine mud. A peak of carbon dioxide fixation (at 40 centimeters subbottom) coincides with peaks in the organic carbon content, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen, and bacterial cell counts. Stimulation of fixation by thiosulfate and inhibition by anaerobic conditions implicate the chemoautotrophic sulfur bacteria as primary producers in this environment."

https://openalex.org/W1968220192,"Measurements of reactive mercury in ocean water in the Gulf Stream at depths from 250 to 4460 meters revealed lower and more consistent concentrations than have been reported in the western Atlantic. The mean and standard deviation of 24 values in a vertical profile were 4.1 +/- 1.0 nanograms per liter. A correlation was found between variations in mercury and silicate, suggesting a common link in their marine geochemistry."

This relation persists during most of the winters of 1951 to 1973."

The identity of the crystalline material with fraction I protein was shown by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and immunological properties. The carboxylase and oxygenase activities copurify during crystallization, and the crystalline enzyme lacks copper and iron."
