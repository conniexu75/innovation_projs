We mapped a locus for infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) to chromosome 22q12-q13 and identified mutations in PLA2G6, encoding a calcium-independent group VI phospholipase A2, in NBIA, INAD and the related Karak syndrome. This discovery implicates phospholipases in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders with iron dyshomeostasis."

Limited information is available concerning its function in mammalian hematopoiesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that homozygosity for a targeted null mutation in the Hif1α gene, which encodes the hypoxia-responsive α subunit of HIF-1, causes cardiac, vascular, and neural malformations resulting in lethality by embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). This study revealed reduced myeloid multilineage and committed erythroid progenitors in HIF-1α-deficient embryos, as well as decreased hemoglobin content in erythroid colonies from HIF-1α-deficient yolk sacs at E9.5. Dysregulation of erythropoietin (Epo) signaling was evident from a significant decrease in mRNA levels of Epo receptor (EpoR) in Hif1α-/- yolk sac as well as Epo and EpoR mRNA in Hif1α-/- embryos. The erythropoietic defects in HIF-1α-deficient erythroid colonies could not be corrected by cytokines, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and Epo, but were ameliorated by Fe-SIH, a compound delivering iron into cells independently of iron transport proteins. Consistent with profound defects in iron homeostasis, Hif1α-/- yolk sac and/or embryos demonstrated aberrant mRNA levels of hepcidin, Fpn1, Irp1, and frascati. We conclude that dysregulated expression of genes encoding Epo, EpoR, and iron regulatory proteins contributes to defective erythropoiesis in Hif1α-/- yolk sacs. These results identify a novel role for HIF-1 in the regulation of iron homeostasis and reveal unexpected regulatory differences in Epo/EpoR signaling in yolk sac and embryonic erythropoiesis.

At the molecular level, HIF-1 activates the transcription of numerous genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter-1 (Glut1), Epo, transferrin (Tf), and transferrin receptor (TfR). HIF-1 represents a dimeric protein consisting of HIF-1α and HIF-1β (also known as the arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt)) subunits (2Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

A Hif1β-deficient embryonic stem cell model revealed abnormal hematopoiesis, which could be partially rescued by VEGF (9Adelman D.M. Maltepe E. Simon M.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2478-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). HIF-1β can dimerize with proteins other than HIF-1α, and thus the phenotype of Hif1β-/- in vitro differentiated embryoid bodies suggests, but does not prove, a role for HIF-1 in hematopoiesis (10Ramirez-Bergeron D.L. Runge A. Dahl K.D. Fehling H.J. Keller G. Simon M.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 4623-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).In contrast to the constitutive expression of HIF-1β, HIF-1α protein levels are regulated in response to the cellular oxygen concentration. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α binds to the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (Vhl), which targets HIF-1α for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation (11Maxwell P.H.

In contrast, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α is not degraded, increasing HIF-1α protein levels. In response to anemia and other causes of systemic hypoxia, HIF-1 transactivates Epo, Tf, and Tfr gene expression. In patients with Chuvash polycythemia, increased HIF-1α expression leads to increased sensitivity of erythroid progenitors to Epo (14Ang S.O. Chen H. Hirota K. Gordeuk V.R. Jelinek J. Guan Y. Liu E.

Genet. 2002; 32: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).HIF-1α-deficient embryos manifested disorganized vascularization of the yolk sac, although fully formed vessels containing red blood cells were present (7Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nucleated red blood cells were detected in the dorsal aorta of the embryo proper at E9.75 (15Kotch L.E. Iyer N.V. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the absence of HIF-1α does not completely abrogate erythropoiesis.In this study, we demonstrate that HIF-1α-deficient embryos have reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors and impaired terminal erythroid differentiation in the yolk sac, which differ from the defects described in HIF-1β-deficient embryonic stem cells. We show that these defects associate with dysregulated expression of genes encoding Epo, EpoR, VEGFR1, and iron regulatory proteins. The results establish a pivotal role for HIF-1 in the regulation of yolk sac erythropoiesis and iron metabolism in mouse development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice and Genotyping—Hif1α+/- mice were previously generated by gene targeting and have been maintained on a mixed background (C57BL/6 × 129 genetic background) by brother-sister mating as described (5Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M. Yu A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). DNA isolated from embryos or neonatal tail biopsies was used for genotyping by multiplex PCR. The PCR was performed using HotstarTaq master mix kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) in a 12-μl reaction mixture (3.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 2.4 pm of each primer, 100 ng of genomic DNA, and 0.6 units of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase). A PCR condition included an initial heat activation step at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s annealing at 58 °C, 60 s extension at 72 °C, and a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. The multiplex PCR was used with the following primers: HIF-1α37, 5′-TTT CCA GTA CTG CCC CAA; HIF-1αREV, 5′-GCA AAC AAG CAA ATC ACC AAG G; PGK Pro-REV, 5′-GGG GCT GCT AAA GCG CAT GC, which generated 380- and 600-bp bands for the null and wild type alleles, respectively.Yolk Sac Isolation—Hif1α+/- mice, aged 8 weeks or older, were used for timed mating. Noon of the day when the vaginal plug was detected was considered E0.5. The pregnant females were sacrificed at E9.5. Following embryo dissection, the yolk sac and embryo were washed separately three times in PBS and then digested in 0.25% collagenase in PBS with 20% FBS (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells from the yolk sac were either directly used for in vitro hematopoietic culture assays or suspended in Tri-reagent solution (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) for RNA extraction. RNA, protein and genomic DNA were extracted in Tri-reagent from digested embryos.Assays for Erythroid, CFU-Mix, and Mast Cell and GM Progenitors—Yolk sac cells were plated in duplicate at 2-2.4 × 104 cells/ml/dish in 0.9% methylcellulose-based media (Stemcell Technologies) and incubated under the following conditions for definitive progenitor colony assay (conditions 1 to 3) or primitive erythroid colony assay (condition 4). Condition 1 is complete methylcellulose medium with pokeweed mitogen-stimulated murine spleen conditioned medium PWM-SCCM (MethoCult M3430). Condition 2 is “basic” methylcellulose medium with 15% FBS (MethoCult M3234) and a mixture of recombinant cytokines added to the media to obtain the following final concentrations: 10 ng/ml murine IL3 (Stemcell Technologies); 10 ng/ml human IL6 (Stemcell Technologies); 3 ng/ml murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); 50 ng/ml murine SCF (Stemcell Technologies); and 3 units/ml human Epo (Epogen, Amgen, CA). For VEGF testing, basic methylcellulose medium with 30% FBS and the same combination of cytokines but with 2 units/ml Epo and, in addition, 5 ng/ml murine VEGF120 (R&D Systems) were added to the cultures. Condition 3 is FBS-free methylcellulose medium (M3236, MethoCult) supplemented with 30% FBS (HCC-6900, Stemcell Technologies), 10 ng/ml murine IL3, 10 ng/ml human IL6, 150 ng/ml murine SCF, 1 unit/ml human Epo, 100 ng/ml murine thrombopoietin (Tpo) (Stemcell Technologies). Condition 4 is FBS-free methylcellulose medium (M3236, MethoCult) supplemented with 10% fetal platelet derived serum (Animal Technologies, Tyler, TX), 5% protein-free hybridoma medium (PFHM-II, Invitrogen), 3 units/ml Epo, 10 ng/ml murine IL3, 10 ng/ml murine IL6, 50 ng/ml murine SCF, 3 ng/ml murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), as described previously (16Palis J. Robertson S. Kennedy M. Wall C. Keller G. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 100 μl of a 1 mm solution of salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone saturated with iron (Fe-SIH) (17Ponka P. Schulman H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an iron chelate that delivers iron for heme synthesis without involving the TfR/DMT1 pathway (17Ponka P. Schulman H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 mm Fe-SIH was prepared as follows: 4.7 mg of synthesized SIH (18Ponka P. Borova J. Neuwirt J. Fuchs O. Necas E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 586: 278-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) was dissolved in 150 μl of 1 n NaOH and then diluted with 14.5 ml of PBS; the SIH solution was then saturated with iron by adding 7 ml of 5 mm ferric citrate solution. Colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-E) were counted at day 2 or 3; burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) were counted at day 7 or 8, and mast cell and granulocyte/macrophage colonies were counted at days 7-10 and multipotential progenitor colonies (CFU-Mix) at days 10-12 of culture.Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—The mRNA levels of selected genes in the yolk sac and embryo were measured by one- or two-step real time RT-PCR on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The primers and TaqMan MGB probes for each gene were either designed by using Primer Express software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems), or obtained as a 20× Assays-on-Demand Gene Expression Assay mix commercially from Applied Biosystems. The sequences of primers/probes and commercial assay identifications are described in Table 1. The one-step real time RT-PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture using TaqMan one-step RT-PCR master mix reagents kit (Applied Biosystems), 900 nm of each primer, and 100 nm of the TaqMan probe. We used 5-500 ng of RNA/reaction giving the linear range of response for selected genes, and 100-fold diluted RNA for 18 S. The universal temperature cycling consisted of 30 min for reverse transcription at 48 °C, denaturation and polymerase activation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 92 °C for 15 s and annealing/extension/plate reading at 60 °C for 1 min. For two-step, initial total RNA (5-500 ng) was used for first strand synthesis using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer. The first strand synthesis followed the manufacturer's protocol. One μl of cDNA was used in a 20-μl reaction mixture using the TaqMan Universal PCR master mix, No AmpErase® UNG reagent kit (Applied Biosystem), 900 nm of each primer, and 100 nm of the TaqMan probe using FAM and VIC fluorescence dyes (Applied Biosystems). The universal temperature cycling consisted of polymerase activation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 92 °C for 15 s and annealing/extension/plate reading at 60 °C for 1 min. VEGFR1 and HIF2α were analyzed using Cyber Green dye. All samples were analyzed in duplicate wells. RT-PCR in the absence of reverse transcriptase was performed for each sample to rule out genomic DNA contamination. The relative quantitative expression of each gene in each sample was normalized to 18 S rRNA level. The cycle threshold (CT) value for each of eight selected mRNAs and 18 S rRNA was determined, and RNA levels were calculated as ΔCT = CT of target mRNA - CT of 18 S. A lower value of ΔCT indicates a higher selected gene expression.TABLE 1Sequences of primers and probes, and the commercial assay identifications used for assay of expression of selected genesGenesSequences of primers and probes (5′ → 3′) or ABI commercial assay identificationsEpoMm00433126_m1EpoRMm00833882_m1eALASF: TTC AAG AGG ATG TCA AGA CTT TCA AGR: GGC TTC GGG TGG TTG AAT CP: 6—FAM—AGA CCT GCT GAG CAC CA—MGBNFQmHbB1F: AGC CTC AAG GGC ACC TTT GR: CCA CAT GCA GCT TGT CAC AGTP: 6—FAM—AGC CTC AGT GAG CTC—MGBNFQmHbYF: CTT GTC CTC TGC TTC TGC CAT AR: CCT TCT TGC CAT GGG CTT TP: 6—FAM—TGG GCA ACC CAA GGG—MGBNFQtransferrinMm00446708_m1mTfRF: GGA AGA CTC TGC TTT GCA GCT ATR: GCC CAG GTA GCC ACT CAT GAP: 6—FAM—CTA GTC ATT TTC TTC TTG ATT GG—MGBNFQferroportinMm00489837_m1Dmt1F: GAC ACT GGC TGT GGA CAT CTA CR: CAG CAG GCC CAA AGT AAC ATCP: 6—FAM—CAG CAC AAC ACC CCC TTT—MGBNFQ (3′—5′)IRP1Mm00801417_m1IRP2Hs00386293_m1RgmcMm00510148_s1FrascatiMm00471134_g1HepcidinMm00519025_m118 S RNA4319413EVEGFRF: ACA TTG GTG GTG GCT GAC TCT CR: CCT CTC CTT CGG CTG GCA TCHIF2aF: CTT GTA CCT GAA AGC CTT GGR: GTC CCA TGA ACT TGC TGA TG Open table in a new tab Immunohistochemistry—Dissected E9.5 embryos along with the attached yolk sac were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections from wild type and HIF-1α-/- embryos were mounted side by side on the same slide to allow for comparison of expression levels. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (19Mok H. Mendoza M. Prchal J.T. Balogh P. Schumacher A. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 4871-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were treated with 3% H2O2 in methanol for Fpn1 antigen retrieval. For Dmt1 and TfR detection, sections were boiled in 0.01 m citric acid, pH 6.0. Blocking was achieved with goat (Fpn1 and Dmt1) or horse serum (TfR). Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C using rabbit anti-Fpn1 at 1:200 (20Mok H. Mlodnicka A.E.

Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated with the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories), followed by signal detection with Vector NovaRED substrate (Vector Laboratories).Western Blot Analysis—E9.5 embryos and yolk sacs were dissected from timed pregnant females, and a small portion of the embryo tail was recovered for genotyping. Embryos and yolk sacs were processed individually for Western blot analysis as described (21Mok H. Jelinek J. Pai S. Cattanach B.M. Prchal J.T. Youssoufian H. Schumacher A. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1859-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos and yolk sacs were homogenized and lysed in RIPA buffer plus Complete®, EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Extract supernatant was collected and protein was quantified using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Seven and five μg of total protein from embryo and yolk sac, respectively, were mixed with an equal volume sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol, boiled, separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blocking was achieved by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C using the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-TfR at 1:2000 (Invitrogen) and goat anti-actin at 1:5000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution), and the signal was developed using ECL reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Statistical Analysis—Student's t test and analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis. Significant differences were considered when p < 0.05. The software Vassarstats was used for calculation.RESULTSHif1α-deficient Yolk Sacs Contain Blood Islands—Hif1α-deficient embryos die between E10 and E10.5 (5Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W.

We dissected yolk sacs at E9.5 for analysis of primitive erythroid progenitors or for analyses of definitive erythroid and CFU-Mix progenitors, respectively. At E9.5, somite counts ranged from 11 to 17 for HIF-1α-/- embryos to 21-25 in wild type littermates. This indicated a moderate developmental delay. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the experiments described below assess intrinsic properties of erythropoietic cells in yolk sac, which are less likely to be affected by a developmental delay of the embryo.The yolk sacs of Hif1α-deficient embryos at E9.5 were smaller (Fig. 1A) and had a significantly lower number of cells recovered after collagenase digestion compared with the wild type yolk sacs (3.6 × 104 cells versus 6.1 × 104 cells, respectively, n = 16, p = 0.002) but had unambiguous blood islands (Fig. 1), whereas Hif1α+/- embryos were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type embryos (data not shown).Erythropoietic Defects in Hif1α-/- Yolk Sac—To directly examine the role of HIF-1 in erythropoietic development, we studied the growth of yolk sac erythroid progenitors in vitro. First, we analyzed definitive erythropoiesis in the yolk sacs of Hif1α-/- and wild type mouse embryos dissected from the uterus at E9.5. Yolk sac erythroid progenitor cells were analyzed by in vitro hematopoietic colony assays using various conditions.Using methylcellulose media with PWM-SCCM (see condition 1 under “Experimental Procedures”), the numbers of erythroid and CFU-Mix colonies derived from the mutant yolk sac were significantly reduced (Table 2). We considered two possible explanations for these results as follows: 1) the culture condition for progenitors from Hif1α-/- yolk sacs could not support colony growth or 2) erythropoiesis in Hif1α-/- yolk sac was severely impaired. To test these hypotheses, we cultured the yolk sac cells under condition 2, which favors BFU-E and CFU-Mix. Under this condition, the number of CFU-Mix from Hif1α-/- yolk sacs was improved, but not the number of BFU-E and CFU-E (Table 2). However, the size (cellularity) of the Hif1α-/- CFU-Mix colonies were 2-5 times smaller than the colonies derived from the wild type embryos (Fig. 2, C and D), and erythroid cells (BFU-E colonies and erythroid component of CFU-Mix) were not fully hemoglobinized (Fig. 2, A-D). These results indicate impaired erythropoiesis in Hif1α-/- yolk sacs.TABLE 2Hematopoietic progenitors evaluation Colony counts derived from wild type (Hif1α+/+) and HIF1α-deficient (Hif1α-/-) yolk sacs are shown as mean number of colonies based on two dishes. All cells derived from one Hif1α/ yolk sac (E9.7, 4.6-4.8 × 104 cells) were plated on two dishes; thus, the numbers represent all colony-forming cells in the mutant yolk sacs. In the case of wild type yolk sacs, the total number of colony-forming cells per yolk sac was determined by multiplying by an appropriate factor (e.g. factor of 1.7 after plating 4.8 × 104 out of 8.1 × 104 cells derived from one wild type yolk sac). In condition 1, the data are based on results from two Hif1α-/- and two wild type yolk sacs. In condition 2 and condition 3, single Hif1α-/- and wild type yolk sacs were used in each experiment. Mast+GM combined counts of two types of colonies including mast cells and granulocytes and/or macrophages.Hif1α genotype+/+—/—% controlCondition 1CFU-E271141BFU-E19316CFU-Mix391436Mast+GM562545Condition 2CFU-E311239BFU-E32920CFU-Mix503052Mast+GM955356Condition 3CFU-E461737BFU-E1516744CFU-Mix14310674 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2In vitro culture of definitive erythroid and myeloid multilineage progenitors from wild type (upper panels) and Hif1α-/- (lower panels) yolk sacs.

Because Tpo was shown to promote mixed lineage colony-forming cell growth in yolk sac cultures (22Xie X. Chan R.J. Johnson S.A. Starr M. McCarthy J. Kapur R. Yoder M.C.

Again, the numbers of BFU-E and CFU-E derived from Hif1α-/- yolk sacs were lower than wild type. However, the numbers of CFU-Mix from wild type and Hif1α-/- yolk sacs were comparable (Table 2). Furthermore, the hemoglobinization of erythroid cells was slightly improved (Fig. 2, E and F). These data confirmed the presence of multipotential progenitors in the Hif1α-/- yolk sacs and indicated that HIF-1α is essential for erythroid progenitor survival/growth/differentiation and for colony-forming capacity of multilineage myeloid progenitors. Analysis of primitive erythroid progenitors in the Hif1α-/- and WT yolk sacs (E9.5) by using condition 4 revealed a significantly lower number and impaired hemoglobinization of Hif1α-/- erythroid colonies (Fig. 3, A and B).FIGURE 3Effect of Fe-SIH on erythroid colonies. A, erythroid colonies were counted at day 8 of culture. The number of erythroid colonies derived from Hif1α-/- yolk sacs was significantly lower than one from wild type yolk sac. By adding Fe-SIH, the number of erythroid colonies was significantly increased in wild type yolk sac, although one from Hif1α-/- yolk sac shows only a modest increase.

Panels c and d, erythroid colonies from Hif1α-/- yolk sac treated with PBS or Fe-SIH, respectively. Compared with wild type control (panel a), the erythroid colonies from Hif1α-/- yolk sac were smaller and poorly hemoglobinized (panel c).

Axelrad A.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2823-2833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing FBS supplementation up to 30% resulted in partial rescue of hemoglobinization of Hif1α-/- CFU-Mix (Fig. 2F) in the presence or absence of Tpo in the media (data not shown). We hypothesized that this effect may be promoted by serum factors involved either in iron delivery (e.g. transferrin) or in survival/differentiation. High dose cytokine supplementation (150 ng/ml SCF and 3 units/ml Epo) to the standard culture media (condition 3) did not rescue the defect in terminal differentiation of Hif1α-/- erythroid cells (data not shown). Similarly, the addition of 5 ng/ml VEGF to the standard culture media (condition 2) failed to improve either hemoglobinization or plating efficiency of erythroid colonies (data not shown), although it did improve the non-erythroid component of the CFU-Mix colonies (Fig. 2, G and H) and also increased plating efficiency of the non-erythroid CFU-GM colonies (data not shown).Because supplementation with a high concentration of growth factors failed to improve erythropoiesis, we cultured the yolk sacs cells in the presence of Fe-SIH (17Ponka P.

https://openalex.org/W2059200921,"p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancer. Although the loss of tumor suppressor functions for p53 in tumorigenesis is well characterized, gain-of-function p53 mutations observed in most cancers are not as widely appreciated. The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, which has high levels of a mutant p53, has high levels of phospholipase D (PLD) activity, which provides a survival signal in these cells when deprived of serum growth factors. We report here that the mutant p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells is stabilized by the elevated PLD activity in these cells. Surprisingly, the survival of MDA-MB-231 cells deprived of serum was dependent on the mutant p53. These data indicate that a mutant p53, stabilized by elevated PLD activity, can contribute to the suppression of apoptosis in a human breast cancer cell line and suggest a rationale for the selection of p53 mutations early in tumorigenesis to suppress apoptosis in an emerging tumor."

ABCG2 was shown to be expressed at high levels in stem cells and variably regulated during cell differentiation. Here we demonstrate that functional ABCG2 is expressed in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells by the activation of a nuclear hormone receptor, PPARγ. We identified and characterized a 150-base pair long conserved enhancer region, containing three functional PPAR response elements (PPARE), upstream of the human ABCG2 gene. We confirmed the binding of the PPARγ·RXR heterodimer to this enhancer region, suggesting that PPARγ directly regulates the transcription of ABCG2. Consistent with these results, elevated expression of ABCG2 mRNA was coupled to enhanced protein production, resulting in increased xenobiotic extrusion capacity via ABCG2 in PPARγ-activated cells. Furthermore PPARγ instructed dendritic cells showed increased Hoechst dye extrusion and resistance to mitoxantrone. Collectively, these results uncovered a mechanism by which up-regulation of functional ABCG2 expression can be achieved via exogenous or endogenous activation of the lipid-activated transcription factor, PPARγ.

During hematopoietic differentiation, ABCG2 level is initially down-regulated, but the protein is expressed again in some mature cell types e.g. of the erythroid lineage (9Zhou S. Zong Y. Ney P.A. Nair G. Stewart C.F. Sorrentino B.P. Blood. 2004; Google Scholar). ABCG2 was shown to reduce the accumulation of toxic heme metabolites, thus the pump expression is part of cell survival strategy under hypoxic conditions (10Krishnamurthy P. Ross D.D. Nakanishi T.

Here we report that PPARγ directly and transcriptionally induces ABCG2 expression in a cell type of the human myeloid lineage, monocyte-derived dendritic cells. We have identified and characterized the regions of the gene involved in this transcriptional activation. We also document that dendritic cells activated by PPARγ express high levels of functional ABCG2 protein, and gain an enhanced capacity to extrude xenobiotics. These features may have important consequences to the survival and drug resistance of human dendritic cells during immune regulation and also have therapeutic ramifications.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLigands—Rosiglitazone, troglitazone, and T0901317 were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals, GW9662 and GW347845X were provided by T.

In brief, full-length, RXRα and PPARγ receptors were produced by using the T7 Quick TnT in vitro transcription-translation kit (Promega). For supershift experiments, the receptors were preincubated with the indicated monoclonal antibodies: anti-RXRα (2ZK8508H), anti-PPARγ (2ZK8713). The sequences of oligonucleotides that were used are presented in the supplemental Table S1.Cell Culture and Ligand Treatment—Monocytes (98% CD14+) were obtained from buffy coats by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and immunomagnetic cell separation using anti-CD14-conjugated microbeads (VarioMACS, Miltenyi Biotec). DCs were prepared as described previously (19Szatmari I. Gogolak P. Im J.S. Dezso B. Rajnavolgyi E. Nagy L. Immunity. 2004; 21: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In brief, monocytes were resuspended into 6-well culture dishes at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), containing 800 units/ml GM-CSF (Leucomax) and 500 units/ml IL-4 (Peprotech). Cells were cultured for 5 or 6 days (unless otherwise indicated), and the IL-4 and GM-CSF addition was repeated at day 3. Ligands or vehicle control (50% Me2SO/ethanol) were added to the cell culture from the first day on. MonoMac-6 (MM6) cells were a kind gift of E. Duda (Biological Research Center, Szeged, Hungary). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Western Blot Analysis—50 μg of protein from whole cell extract were separated by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with anti-ABCG2 (BXP-21) antibody (Alexis Biochemicals), then stripped and reprobed with anti-GAPDH antibody (ab8245-100, Abcam).FACS Analysis—Cell staining was performed using FITC- or PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies: Labeled antibodies for flow cytometry included anti-CD1a-PE, CD1d-PE, CD80-PE, CD86-PE, and isotype-matched controls (BD PharMingen). For the ABCG2 detection cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, then incubated with unlabeled anti-ABCG2 (5D3) or isotype-matched control (R and D system) antibody for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by staining with FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibody (BD PharMingen). The fluorescence of labeled cells was measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson).Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 1 h and 72 °C for 5 min from 100-200 ng of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using real-time PCR (ABI PRISM 7900, Applied Biosystems): 40 cycles at 95 °C for 12 s and 60 °C for 30 s using Taqman assays. All PCR reactions were done in triplicate with one control reaction containing cDNA that was reverse transcribed without RT enzyme. The comparative Ct method was used to quantify transcripts, and the expression level was normalized to 36B4 or cyclophilin A. The sequences of the primers and probes are presented in supplemental Table S1.Measurement of Hoechst Retention by Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy and FACS— DCs were plated on Lab-Tek coverslip chambers. Cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 1 h at 37 °C with or without KO143 (1 μm), then subjected to microscopic analysis. Hoechst fluorescence was measured on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat ×60 (NA 1.4) oil immersion objective using maximal detection pinhole diameter (1 mm) to get signal from the whole depth of the nucleus. Hoechst was excited by the 351 and 364 nm lines of an Argon ion laser, emission was measured through a 385-470-nm bandpass filter.Hoechst content was also measured on a Becton Dickinson FACSVantage flow cytometer. Hoechst fluorescence was excited by 351- and 364-nm lines, and the blue and red Hoechst signals were detected through 402-446-nm and >650-nm filters, respectively.Measurement of Mitoxantrone Uptake by FACS Analyses— Cells were resuspended in phenol red-free HPMI medium containing the desired fluorescent compound (5 μm mitoxantrone) with or without KO143 (1 μm) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, Thereafter, the cells were washed with cold HPMI and subjected to flow cytometric analyses. The cells were assessed for fluorescence intensity with a FACSCalibur cytometer (Beckton Dickinson).Cytotoxicity Assay—Cytotoxicity assays were carried out using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 105 cells per well. Mitoxantrone at various concentrations with or without KO143 was added to DCs, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After incubation, cytotoxicity was assessed by using the MTT assay. The MTT assay was performed as described previously (20Gerlier D. Thomasset N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 94: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) and as specified by ATCC.Statistical Analyses—Values are expressed as mean ± S.D. of the mean. Significant differences between mean values were evaluated using two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test.RESULTSABCG2 Is Highly and Selectively Induced by PPARγ Agonists in Human Dendritic Cells—Previously we have characterized the role of PPARγ nuclear receptor in monocyte-derived dendritic cell (DC) differentiation (19Szatmari I. Gogolak P. Im J.S. Dezso B. Rajnavolgyi E. Nagy L. Immunity. 2004; 21: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We observed that PPARγ was acutely and rapidly up-regulated during DC differentiation and acted as a modifier of DC gene expression and function. This cellular system is particularly suitable to identify PPARγ responsive genes because the bona fide PPARγ target, the fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4 also known as aP2) was highly induced (50-100-fold) upon PPARγ agonist treatment. We sought to identify direct targets of PPARγ with expression pattern similar to that of FABP4 using global gene expression analysis (Affymetrix Microarrays). One of the candidate genes matching these criteria was an ABC half-transporter, ABCG2. To validate the microarray data, the transcript level of ABCG2 was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-Q-PCR) from RNAs obtained from monocytes and monocyte-derived human DCs. When compared the expression of FABP4 to ABCG2 a similar pattern of mRNA levels was observed (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the microarray data, PPARγ agonist (rosiglitazone, abbreviated as RSG) treatment highly enhanced the expression of both genes. Although rosiglitazone is a specific PPARγ agonist, its ability to induce ABCG2 in developing DCs still may be related to other pharmacologic activities. To address this issue a PPARγ antagonist (GW9662) was simultaneously added to the cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, administration of the antagonist (ANT) abolished the induction of ABCG2 suggesting that this regulation is indeed PPARγ receptor-dependent. We used other chemically distinct synthetic PPARγ agonists to further establish the receptor specificity of ABCG2 induction. Cells were treated with troglitazone (TRO) or with GW347845X (abbreviated as GW7845). As shown in Fig. 1B, all of these PPARγ activators induced FABP4 and ABCG2 expression.Up-regulation of ABCG2 was also detected in a monocytic/macrophage leukemia cell line (Monomac 6, abbreviated as MM6) by the activation of the PPARγ·RXR heterodimer (Fig. 1C). PPARγ forms a heterodimer with the RXR receptor. Interestingly, in MM6 cells both components of the heterodimer had to be activated to elicit a profound ABCG2 expression induction (MM6 cells were simultaneous treated with 2.5 μm RSG and 100 nm LG268, an RXR agonist). To further establish the role of PPARγ in ABCG2 regulation, we used RNA interference to suppress the expression of PPARγ in MM6 cells. We used a previously described (16Kelly D. Campbell J.I. King T.P. Grant G. Jansson E.A. Coutts A.G. Pettersson S. Conway S. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) PPARγ-specific siRNA that effectively inhibited the expression of endogenous PPARγ but it did not interfere with expression of PPARδ (Fig. 1C). Significantly, PPARγ-specific siRNA-treated cells showed impaired induction of FABP4 and ABCG2, indicating that the transcriptional induction of these genes are receptor-dependent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that activation of PPARγ induces elevated ABCG2 mRNA expression both in DCs and in the myeloid leukemia cell line MM6. Moreover, this regulation appears to be selectively PPARγ receptor dependent in both cell types.ABCG2 Is Regulated by PPARγ via a Mechanism Independent of LXR—It has been documented that, under certain conditions, PPARγ can indirectly activate gene expression by the induction of its direct target receptor, LXRα. For example, ABCA1 expression is regulated via such a mechanism (12Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 13Chawla A. Boisvert W.A. Lee C.H. Laffitte B.A. Barak Y. Joseph S.B. Liao D. Nagy L. Edwards P.A. Curtiss L.K. Evans R.M. Tontonoz P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). A previous study has also established that ABCA1 and ABCG1 are direct target genes of LXRs (11Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). We also observed that a PPARγ ligand enhances the expression of LXRα in DCs (data not shown) suggesting that an LXR-dependent pathway may be responsible for the up-regulation of certain ABC transporters.To examine if the activation of PPARγ enhances ABCG2 transcription via the induction of LXRα, we compared the effects of PPARγ and LXR agonists on the mRNA levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, and ABCG2 by RT-Q-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, we found that in this cell type the activation of PPARγ failed to induce ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression, whereas we detected a profound up-regulation of these transporter mRNAs if cells were treated with an LXR-specific agonist (T0901317). In contrast to ABCA1 and ABCG1, T0901317 did not affect the expression of ABCG2. These data indicate that in human DCs ABCG2 regulation is independent from LXRα induction/activation, and in these cells the selective activation of nuclear hormone receptors results in a non-overlapping ABCA1-ABCG1 versus ABCG2 expression pattern.FIGURE 2ABCG2 is regulated by PPARγ via a mechanism independent of LXR. A, mRNA levels of ABCA1, ABCG1, and ABCG2 were determined with RT-Q-PCR. Cells were cultured for 24 h and treated with 1 μm RSG or with an LXR-specific ligand: 1 μm T0901317 (T09). B, dose-dependent induction of FABP4 and ABCG2. Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of RSG; the mRNA expression was determined by RT-Q-PCR. C, kinetics of FABP4 and ABCG2 induction. Cells were cultured for 12 h; thereafter cells were treated with 1 μm RSG and harvested at the indicated time points and the mRNA expression was determined by RT-Q-PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PPARγ Directly Regulates the Transcription of the ABCG2 Gene—Our results demonstrated that the mRNA expression of ABCG2 is positively regulated by PPARγ-specific ligands in a receptor-dependent manner. Next, we have examined the dose and time dependence of ABCG2 induction. PPARγ activators (for example rosiglitazone) belong to a class of antidiabetic compounds (thiazolidinediones), that are used in the clinic to treat type II diabetes (21Willson T.M. Lambert M.H. Kliewer S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The plasma concentration of RSG in patients treated with 4 mg of RSG is between 50-350 ng/ml (100-1000 nm) (22Niemi M. Backman J.T. Neuvonen P.J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 76: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To examine whether ABCG2 can be activated ex vivo in this concentration range, we performed dose response experiments. As shown in Fig. 2B, 100 nm RSG readily induced the expression of ABCG2, suggesting that this gene is likely to be induced in DCs in vivo upon RSG treatment.Next we asked whether the activation of PPARγ directly elicits the accumulation of ABCG2 transcripts. Time course experiments (Fig. 2C) revealed that ABCG2 similarly to FABP4 were rapidly up-regulated upon PPARγ ligand administration. Although this finding is not a proof in itself, it strongly suggests that PPARγ directly regulates the expression of ABCG2.To further test this possibility, we analyzed the promoter sequence of the ABCG2 gene to find putative PPAR responsive elements. The sequence analysis of the previously reported promoter region (-1285/+362) of the human ABCG2 gene (10Krishnamurthy P. Ross D.D. Nakanishi T. Bailey-Dell K. Zhou S. Mercer K.E. Sarkadi B. Sorrentino B.P. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24218-24225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) did not reveal any canonical PPAR response elements. Furthermore transient transfection assays carried out to assess the activity of this promoter region (-1285/+362) failed to indicate any PPARγ-dependent transcriptional response (data not shown). Therefore we decided to use a bioinformatics approach for the identification of conserved promoter regions and putative PPAREs. The ABCG2 protein is relatively well conserved in evolutionary distant animals. However the completely untranslated first exon shows very little similarity between species, thus the identification of the promoter region is rather difficult. In addition several species such as the mouse and rat contain paralogous ABCG2 genes with alternatively spliced 5′-untranslated region (UTR) exon(s). Using cDNA sequences to identify the first UTR exons we have succeeded in finding putative promoter regions of bovine and dog ABCG2 genes beside the almost identical primate sequences. Comparison of 5000 base pairs of human, dog, and bovine ABCG2 promoter regions (counting from the position of the beginning of the 5′ longest cDNA sequence) revealed a well conserved region (supplemental Fig. S1). We have identified a 150-bp portion (-3946/-3796) of this conserved region, which contains three potential PPAR response elements in the human and one in bovine and dog (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S1). To test the ability of these elements for binding PPARγ·RXR in vitro, we carried out EMSA. The EMSA analysis revealed that all three putative elements, containing direct repeat 1 (DR1, AGGTCANAGGTCA) motifs, were able to specifically bind PPARγ·RXR heterodimers (Fig. 3B). In these experiments we also found that if the two receptors were added together, a stronger, specific binding was observed. This binding was effectively competed by either unlabeled (cold) oligos, or a canonical DR1 oligonucleotide, but not with oligonucleotides containing mutations. The specificity of the binding was further demonstrated by the use of antibodies against RXRα and PPARγ, which induced marked supershifts (Fig. 3B). Next an enhancer trap method was employed to assess the binding and transcription activation capacity of these elements. We introduced the identified element (-3946/-3796) into a reporter plasmid upstream of the minimal TK-luciferase promoter, generating the heterologous promoter construct termed ABCG2enhancer-TK-Luc (TK-Luc ENH). To determine the receptor binding capacity of the enhancer region in a cellular system, we co-transfected the ABCG2enhancer-TK-Luc reporter construct with the expression vector, containing constitutively active PPARγ (VP16-PPARγ) alone or VP16-PPARγ along with RXRα. We obtained a robust induction of reporter gene activity when the cells were cotransfected with VP16-PPARγ, and, as anticipated, the induction was further increased in the presence of RXRα (Fig. 4A). We obtained similar results in two independent cell lines (COS1 and 293T). In a specificity control experiment, the TK-Luc dependent transcription was not modified by receptor expression in the absence of the enhancer region. These data provided evidence for a possible in vivo binding of the receptor heterodimer to the identified enhancer elements in the ABCG2 gene.FIGURE 3Identification of PPAR·RXR binding sites in the human ABCG2 gene. A, sequence of a portion of the human ABCG2 upstream region (-3946/-3796 bp), highlighting the three putative PPAR responsive elements (A, B, and C elements). B, EMSA was carried out by using in vitro-translated receptors of PPARγ, RXRα, and α-32P-labeled oligonucleotides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For competition experiments, cold (Cold WT), mutated (Cold MUT) or consensus DR1 oligonucleotides were used at ×10 and ×20 concentrations. For supershift experiments, the receptors were preincubated with the indicated antibodies prior to the binding reaction.View Large Imag"

We have previously identified the L. donovani miltefosine transporter (LdMT) as a P-type ATPase involved in phospholipid translocation at the plasma membrane of Leishmania parasites. Here we show that this protein is essential but not sufficient for the phospholipid translocation activity and, thus, for the potency of the drug. Based on recent findings in yeast, we have identified the putative β subunit of LdMT, named LdRos3, as another protein factor required for the translocation activity. LdRos3 belongs to the CDC50/Lem3 family, proposed as likely β subunits for P4-ATPases. The phenotype of LdRos3-defective parasites was identical to that of the LdMT-/-, including a defect in the uptake of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl-amino)-phosphatidylserine, generally considered as not affected in Lem3p-deficient yeast. Both LdMT and LdRos3 normally localized to the plasma membrane but were retained inside the endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of the other protein or when inactivating point mutations were introduced in LdMT. Modulating the expression levels of either protein independently, we show that any one of them could behave as the protein limiting the level of flippase activity. Thus, LdMT and LdRos3 seem to form part of the same translocation machinery that determines flippase activity and miltefosine sensitivity in Leishmania, further supporting the consideration of CDC50/Lem3 proteins as β subunits required for the normal functioning of P4-ATPases.

Different Leishmania spp. constitute the etiological agents of leishmaniasis, a tropical disease with different clinical manifestations varying from cutaneous self-healing lesions to visceral disease, fatal if left untreated (1Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). From the estimated 500,000 new cases per year of visceral leishmaniasis or kala azar, more than 90% occur in endemic areas of India, Bangladesh, Brazil, and Sudan due to the Leishmania donovani species complex (2WHO (2001) The World Health Report 2001, WHO, GeneveGoogle Scholar). These endemic areas constitute foci of anthroponotic transmission of the parasite, which increases the chances for the fast spreading of drug-resistant parasites once these have been generated (3Sundar S. J. Postgrad. Med. 2003; 49: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Indeed, the classical leishmanicidal treatment, based on pentavalent antimonials, is no longer active for more than 60% of the clinical cases in the Bihar area (4Sundar S. More D.K. Singh M.K. Singh V.P. Sharma S. Makharia A. Kumar P.C. Murray H.W. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 31: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). This dramatic situation has called for the urgent development of new therapeutic agents against leishmaniasis (5Singh S. Sivakumar R. J. Infect.

Phase IV clinical trials are about to finish in India, and depending on the outcome, the Indian government may consider MLF as the first-line drug to treat kala azar (8Ganguly N.K. TDR News. 2002; 68: 2Google Scholar, 9Sundar S. Murray H.W. Bull. W. H. O. 2005; 83: 394-395PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, studies on the mechanisms of MLF resistance and their generation are deeply important for the appropriate long-term use of this drug.Chemically, MLF as well as the related ether-lipids edelfosine and perifosine is a short-chain phospholipid derivative that resembles lysophosphatidylcholine. We and others have clearly demonstrated that all these analogs are primarily taken up by a specific protein-dependent translocation step across the plasma membrane (PM) in both Leishmania parasites (10Perez-Victoria F.J. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and yeast (11Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Hanson P.K. Malone L. Birchmore J.L. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36041-36050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This uptake activity occurs not only for MLF but also for fluorescent analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS) as well and receives different names such as flippase activity, translocase activity, or more accurately, inward-directed translocation activity across the PM. Inactivation of this activity causes MLF resistance in both organisms (12Hanson P.K. Malone L. Birchmore J.L. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36041-36050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Perez-Victoria F.J. Gamarro F. Ouellette M. Castanys S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49965-49971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, MLF uptake serves as an easy method for determining the flippase activity across the PM. Even though the identity of this activity remains to be established, strong candidates such as the leishmanial LdMT and yeast Dnf1 and Dnf2 are members of the P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases (here referred to as P4-ATPases) (13Perez-Victoria F.J.

Devaux P.F. van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Interestingly, P4-ATPases are also involved in vesicle-mediated protein sorting (for a review, see Ref. 15Graham T.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 670-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and mutations in some human P4-ATPases are known to produce inherited diseases (16Bull L.N. van Eijk M.J. Pawlikowska L. DeYoung J.A. Juijn J.A. Liao M. Klomp L.W. Lomri N. Berger R. Scharschmidt B.F. Knisely A.S. Houwen R.H. Freimer N.B. Nat.

Genet. 2001; 28: 19-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How these processes and diseases are related to the likely phospholipid translocation activity of P4-ATPases is still unknown.Of the more than 200 identified members of the P-type ATPase family (18Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), only animal Na,K- and H,K-ATPase isozymes and the bacterial Kdp-ATPase are known to contain, in addition to the catalytic α subunit, one or two subunits, respectively, which are obligatory for the enzymes function (19Geering K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, certain yeast P-type ATPases phospholipid translocases seem to depend on proteins of the Lem3/CDC50 family (20Saito K. Fujimura-Kamada K. Furuta N. Kato U. Umeda M. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3418-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Lem3p-Dnf1p colocalizes to the PM, and CDC50p-Drs2p colocalizes to the trans-Golgi network; both pairs can co-immunoprecipitate, and the phenotypes, when either the ATPase or the Lem3/CDC50 protein are absent, are strikingly similar (20Saito K. Fujimura-Kamada K. Furuta N. Kato U. Umeda M. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3418-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but not absolutely identical (12Hanson P.K. Malone L.

It has been suggested that Lem3p and CDC50p may constitute specific β subunits for P4-ATPases (15Graham T.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 670-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 20Saito K. Fujimura-Kamada K. Furuta N. Kato U. Umeda M. Tanaka K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3418-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Further data supporting these observations in a different system is needed.In this report we identify and characterize the L. donovani LdRos3 protein as the functional homolog of Lem3p/Ros3p. Similarly to LdMT, LdRos3 is required for the translocation of phospholipids from the PM, including MLF and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl-amino (NBD)-PS. Thus, LdRos3 defective parasites are highly resistant to MLF. Both proteins depend on each other for their proper localization at the PM. We propose that Lem3/CDC50 protein family should be considered as the specific β subunits for P4-ATPases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemical Compounds—MLF (hexadecylphosphocholine) was from Zentaris (Frankfurt, Germany). Hexadecylphospho[1,2-ethylene-14C]choline ([14C]MLF) (1,33 MBq/mmol) was synthesized by Amersham Biosciences. NBD-hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, -phosphoethanolamine, -phosphoserine (NBD-PC, -PE, and -PS, respectively) and 6-[NBD-hexanoyl]sphingosylphosphocholine were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality available.Strains and Culture Conditions—Promastigote forms of wild-type L. donovani (MHOM/ET/67/HU3), the MLF-resistant line (M-40 R) described previously (22Seifert K. Matu S. Javier Perez-Victoria F. Castanys S. Gamarro F. Croft S.L. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2003; 22: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and another MLF-resistant line (M-1M), which was created by treating 4 × 107 wild-type parasites with 50 μm MLF in 5 ml until growth was seen in the culture (at around day 35), were maintained at 28 °C in the M-199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 40 mm HEPES (Sigma), 100 μm adenosine (Sigma), hemin (0.2% of a 2 μg/ml stock solution; Sigma), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). For determination of parasite sensitivity to MLF, 1 × 106 cells were incubated for 72 h at different drug concentrations before determining cell proliferation by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay (13Perez-Victoria F.J. Gamarro F. Ouellette M. Castanys S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49965-49971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Isolation of LdRos3, DNA-sequencing Analysis, and Construction of Plasmids—Putative members of the Lem3/CDC50 gene family were searched in the different Leishmania genome network gene data bases using the GeneDB ominiBLAST server against the yeast Lem3 gene. We found three different genes in the Leishmania infantum genome (systematic GeneDB sequences LinJ35.3500, LinJ09.1080, and LinJ32.1040, respectively). For cloning and sequencing of the different L. donovani orthologue alleles of LinJ32.1040 (LdRos3) from the wild-type and M-1M lines, PCR amplification was accomplished with two different sets of primers using the high fidelity Triple Master polymerase from Eppendorf. P1 (5′-GCCCCGGGTCATGGCGCCTCTACCCCCT) and P2 (5′GCGGATCCCTACTCTGTATAGACTGGCATGATCA) amplified only the coding region, whereas P3 (5′-AACGCAGACGCTTCGTGATGG) and P4 (5′-TAAGGCTGTCATCAACGTATG) amplified the entire ORF flanked by 1314 and 1119 bp of the untranslated 5′ and 3′ regions, respectively. XmaI and BamHI restriction sites were added (underlined in the sequence) for further cloning. PCR amplified bands were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced on an ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer. The selected alleles were also subcloned into the XmaI-BamHI sites of the pXGHYG and pXG expression vectors (23Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).To generate green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions at the carboxyl terminus of LdRos3 (LdRos3-GFP), the wild-type LdRos3 ORF without the STOP codon was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers containing XmaI and EcoRV sites, respectively. After restriction digestion, the ORF was subcloned in frame into the XmaI-EcoRV sites of the Leishmania expression vector pXG-′GFP+ (23Ha D.S. Schwarz J.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Generation of LdMT and LdRos3 Null Mutants—For targeted gene replacement of the L. donovani LdMT gene, a targeting DNA fragment was constructed in which the hyg gene, conferring resistance to hygromycin B, was flanked at the 5′ end by a 1.3-kilobase LdMT region containing the initiation codon and at the 3′ end by a 1.4-kilobase LdMT region containing the stop codon (Fig. 1A). To ensure high level expression in promastigotes, the 5′-untranslated region (400 bp) of the L. major dhfr-ts gene was inserted directly before the initiation codon of the hyg gene. The different fragments were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (primers KO1 GTGGTACCGACTCCTCAACTCCTTATATTG, and KO2 GTAAGCTTATTAGATCTCTCGCCCGTCCAGGTTA for the 5′ region; KO3 CACCCGGGAAGAGGTTCTTCTGGAAC and KO4 GTAAGCTTAAGATGATGAGCATCATCGTCG for the 3′ region) or the cLHYG vector (KO5 GTAGATCTACCACTTTCTGCCTTCTG and KO6 GGAAGCTTCTATTCCTTTGCCCTCGGACG) for the resistance cassette), subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and assembled in this vector. As for the LdRos3 replacement, a similar strategy was used (Fig. 4B). Primers KO7 (AACGCAGACGCTTCGTGATGG) and KO8 (GCATTTAAATTTCGAGTGTGGCTTAGGGGGT) amplified a 5′-untranslated region of 1.2 kilobases. Primers KO9 (GCATTTAAATTCTAGATCATGGCAGTGACACTTCT) and KO10 (TAAGGCTGTCATCAACGTATG) amplified a3′-untranslated region of 1.4 kilobases. Both fragments were cloned adjacent to the hyg cassette using SwaI and XbaI restriction sites.FIGURE 4Genetic characterization of LdRos3 loci in M-1M parasites and deletion mutants.

Gamarro F. Ouellette M. Castanys S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49965-49971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the first round of LdMT and LdRos3 targeting, electroporated promastigotes were incubated in 5 ml of drug-free culture medium for 1 day, after which the parasites were centrifuged (1500 × g, 5 min), resuspended in 900 μl of media, and plated onto 3 plates of semi-solid culture medium containing 30 μg/ml hygromycin B. In the second round of gene targeting, loss of heterozygosity was promoted by increasing hygromycin B concentration up to 400 μg/ml in 96-well plates. Wells grown at such concentrations were tested against MLF sensitivity, and those resistant to 40 μm MLF were expanded and further analyzed by Southern blot.Southern Analysis—Genomic DNA was purified from wildtype, M-1M, LdMT-/+, LdMT-/-, LdRos3-/+, and LdRos3-/- lines with the DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen). Restriction enzyme-digested DNA was hybridized to either LdMT and LdRos3 ORFs or the 5′-untranslated region of LdRos3 following standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Cell Transfection—L. donovani parasites were transfected and selected for G418 or hygromycin B resistance as previously described (13Perez-Victoria F.J. Gamarro F. Ouellette M. Castanys S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49965-49971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For double transfection experiments, parasites were first transfected with a single plasmid and selected at a concentration of 100 μg/ml concentrations of either G418 or hygromycin B. Then a second transfection was set, selecting with the minimum concentration of the new selective drug and maintaining the drug pressure for the previous plasmid. Increasing expression levels of the protein driven by the second plasmid were achieved by increasing the concentration of the selective drug in a stepwise manner, as stated in text.Functional Experiments—The internalization of [14C]MLF (1.33 MBq/mmol) or fluorescent-labeled phospholipid analogs was measured as described previously (10Perez-Victoria F.J.

Images were captured with a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Inc.) and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software. To differentiate the PM from intracellular organelles, parasites were incubated in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice and directly mounted on coverslips. Leishmania parasites possess a subpellicular microtubule cytoskeleton attached to the cytoplasmic face of their PM, which allows the generation of ghost cells maintaining the normal cellular morphology. Surface membranes possessing such subpellicular microtubules were obtained from hypotonic-treated parasites by Dounce homogenization for 5 min on ice (25Dwyer D.M. Gottlieb M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 23: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).For immunofluorescence studies, parasites were fixed in suspension with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), attached to poly-l-lysine-coated slides, permeabilized with methanol, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and incubated with an anti-BiP polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits (kindly provided by Jay Bangs (26Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) at a 1:300 dilution. Antibody binding was visualized by treatment with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies diluted at 1:1000 (Sigma). Cells were mounted on 90% glycerol and observed microscopically using either a Texas Red or a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set.Immunoblots of comparable amounts of proteins were performed with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:5000) (Molecular Probes) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit (1:5000) IgG (Dako), as described previously (13Perez-Victoria F.J.

Gamarro F. Ouellette M. Castanys S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49965-49971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), similarly to what happens in yeast with Dnf1p and Dnf2p (14Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To answer whether LdMT is the only flippase expressed at the PM of Leishmania parasites or whether there is any other protein with similar functions, we have obtained L. donovani parasites in which both alleles of the LdMT gene have been sequentially deleted (Fig. 1A). Proper targeting of the constructions was tested by a Southern blot of genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). Heterozygous parasites for LdMT showed levels of MLF internalization that were half those for the wild-type line (Fig. 1C). Their sensitivity to MLF were decreased 2-fold with respect to wild-type parasites (Table 1), demonstrating a direct correlation between drug uptake and cellular sensitivity, as previously suggested (13Perez-Victoria F.J. Gamarro F. Ouellette M. Castanys S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49965-49971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). LdMT null mutant (LdMT-/-) parasites were defective in the uptake of MLF, with internalization values 50-fold lower than wild-type parasites (Fig. 1C). Similarly, LdMT-/- parasites were deficient in the internalization of fluorescent NBD-PC, -PE, and -PS (Table 2). Transfection of Leishmania LdMT-/- with episomal plasmids bearing LdMT (translating either LdMT or the LdMT-GFP chimera) completely recovered MLF uptake (Fig. 1C) and sensitivity as well as NBD-PC, -PE, and -PS internalization (Table 2). Thus, it can be concluded that LdMT is the only flippase expressed at the PM of promastigotes, being essential for the uptake and potency of MLF.TABLE 1MLF sensitivity and resistance indexes (RI) in different Leishmania strainsStrainsIC50RIμMWild type6.2 ± 3.51LdMT+/-12.1 ± 4.41.9 ± 0.3LdMT-/-81.0 ± 25.713.7 ± 2.6M-1M77.2 ± 15.313.1 ± 2.2LdRos3+/-10.3 ± 5.01.7 ± 0.3LdRos3-/-84.2 ± 17.514.2 ± 2.7 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Percentage of accumulation of NBD-labeled phospholipids of different Leishmania strains relative to wild-type cellsNBD fluorescenceStrainsNBD-PCNBD-PENBD-PSNBD-SM% of Wild-typeWild type100 (127)100 (115)100 (20)100 (12)LdMT−/−12.0 ± 4.418.5 ± 2.330.2 ± 14.898.2 ± 10.4LdMT−/− + LdMT147.1 ± 25.7124.4 ± 12.4210.2 ± 64.4104.6 ± 22.4M-1M9.8 ± 6.314.8 ± 6.433.2 ± 12.4105.2 ± 32.4M-1M + LdMT9.4 ± 3.716.3 ± 5.038.4 ± 5.691.6 ± 26.6M-1M + LdRos332.2 ± 6.541.1 ± 10.952.0 ± 41.4102.5 ± 23.4M-1M + LdMT + LdRos3-GFP95.5 ± 36.0113.0 ± 33.5148.2 ± 48.195.3 ± 30.8 Open table in a new tab We have previously described the generation of experimental MLF-resistant parasites by either drug pressure selection (22Seifert K.

Agents. 2003; 22: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) or by mutagenesis followed by selection against high drug concentrations (13Perez-Victoria F.J. Gamarro F. Ouellette M. Castanys S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49965-49971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In both cases the generation of inactivating point mutations inside LdMT was responsible for the resistance phenotype, and thus, this phenotype could be rescued by transfection with a wild-type LdMT gene (13Perez-Victoria F.J. Gamarro F. Ouellette M. Castanys S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49965-49971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Following a different approach, we have created a new experimental resistant line, named M-1M (see “Experimental Procedures”). Its resistance phenotype was strikingly similar to those previously described (Table 1), including a defective internalization of MLF (Fig. 1C) and NBD-PC, -PE, and -PS (Table 2). Nevertheless, transfection with the LdMT gene was unable to rescue the defective phenotype (Fig. 1C and Table 2), indicating that different mutations in another gene(s) may be present in this strain. To answer whether LdMT is expressed and targeted to its proper cellular localization, we transfected M-1M and LdMT-/- parasites with the pXG′-LdMTGFP plasmid. This construction was able to rescue the knock-out parasites but not the M-1M line (Fig. 1C). Western blots of total cell lysates showed similar profiles between both parasite lines, suggesting that the protein is produced normally (data not shown). LdMT-GFP has to reach the PM to account for its flippase activity. Nevertheless, clear labeling of PM in intact parasites is hampered by the overexpression of the protein and/or its intracellular routing. Incubation of promastigotes in hypotonic buffer permitted the easy discrimination between the LdMT-GFP pool expressed at the PM and the intracellular one, as seen in LdMT-/- parasites expressing LdMT-GFP (Fig. 2A). M-1M parasites were found defective in the proper targeting of LdMT-GFP to the PM, as observed in parasites under hypotonic shock or in PM fragments prepared from these hypotonic buffer-treated parasites (Fig. 2B). The big intracellular structures positive for LdMT-GFP after hypotonic shock most likely represent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived structures. Indeed, LdMT-GFP colocalized with the ER resident protein BiP, suggesting that the ATPase is unable to exit the ER in M-1M parasites (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that even though LdMT is likely to be the MLF and phospholipid transporter of Leishmania parasites present at the PM, it is not sufficient to promote lipid transport by itself, i.e. it requires another cellular factor(s) to exit the ER, reach the PM, and be able to exert its function.FIGURE 2The localization of LdMT-GFP at the parasite PM depends on the presence of LdRos3.

The biological targets of arsenic are largely unknown at present. We analyzed the signaling pathway for induction of detoxification gene NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqo1) by arsenic. Genetic and biochemical evidence revealed that induction required cap `n' collar basic leucine zipper transcription factor Nrf2 and the antioxidant response element (ARE) of Nqo1. Arsenic stabilized Nrf2 protein, extending the t½ of Nrf2 from 21 to 200 min by inhibiting the Keap1·Cul3-dependent ubiquitination and proteasomal turnover of Nrf2. Arsenic markedly inhibited the ubiquitination of Nrf2 but did not disrupt the Nrf2·Keap1·Cul3 association in the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, arsenic, but not phenolic antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone, dissociated Nrf2 from Keap1 and Cul3 followed by dimerization of Nrf2 with a Maf protein (Maf G/Maf K). Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Nrf2 and Maf associated with the endogenous Nqo1 ARE enhancer constitutively. Arsenic substantially increased the ARE occupancy by Nrf2 and Maf. In addition, Keap1 was shown to be ubiquitinated in the cytoplasm and deubiquitinated in the nucleus in the presence of arsenic without changing the protein level, implicating nuclear-cytoplasmic recycling of Keap1. Our data reveal that arsenic activates the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway through a distinct mechanism from that by antioxidants and suggest an “on-switch” model of Nqo1 transcription in which the binding of Nrf2·Maf to ARE controls both the basal and inducible expression of Nqo1.

Environmental toxic metal arsenic, which originates from both geochemical and anthropogenic activities, is a ubiquitous contaminant and an established human carcinogen (1Gomez-Caminero A. Howe P.

The anthropogenic sources of arsenic contaminating soil and water include mining, metallurgical activities, and manufacture and agricultural use of pesticides and herbicides. Arsenic causes a spectrum of adverse responses in many species. Whereas acute exposure to inorganic arsenic in humans results in cardiac failure, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, leucopenia, and death, chronic arsenic exposure can cause a range of cancers (particularly of the skin, lung, bladder, and liver) as well as liver injury, neuropathy, cardiovascular lesions, ovarian dysfunction, aberrant embryo development, and postnatal growth retardation (4Tseng C.H.

Interestingly, arsenic-containing compounds have proven to be effective as therapeutic agents in treating cancer such as leukemia (11Evens A.M. Tallman M.S. Gartenhaus R.B. Leuk. Res. 2004; 28: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), chronic inflammatory disease such as psoriasis (12Farber E.M. J. Am. Acad.

Although chemical interaction with protein thiol groups and generation of reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the actions of arsenic, the exact molecular targets and signaling pathways that account for most of the biological effects of arsenic remain unknown.The ubiquity in the environment and the pleiotropy of toxicity of arsenic have provided selective pressure for evolution of various strategies across species that are utilized to defend against the toxic metal. For instance, high level resistance to arsenite in Escherichia coli is conferred by the arsRDABC operon of plasmid R773, which controls the efflux of the metal through a tightly regulated, arsenic sensing/transcription repression mechanism (15Shi W. Dong J. Scott R.A. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9291-9297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In mammals, arsenic can be methylated by arsenic methyltransferase (16Wood T.C. Salavagionne O.E. Mukherjee B. Wang L. Klumpp A.F. Thomae B.A. Eckloff B.W. Schaid D.J. Wieben E.D. Weinshilboum R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7364-7373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Methylated arsenics have a shorter half-life in vivo than inorganic arsenic. However, As(III)-containing methylated metabolites have been shown to be more cyto- and genotoxic than either arsenate or arsenite (17Mass M.J. Tennant A. Roop B.C. Cullen W.R. Styblo M. Thomas D.J. Kligerman A.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Given the high potency and wide range of biological effects of arsenic, it is perceivable that complex regulatory mechanisms other than methylation exist to control cellular homeostasis in mammalian cells exposed to the soft metal.Certain detoxification enzymes metabolize chemicals through reduction and conjugation reactions to less toxic and more water-soluble metabolites. In addition, the enzymes such as NQO1 2The abbreviations used are: NQO1, NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; ARE, antioxidant response element; tBHQ, tert-butylhydroquinone; CHX, cycloheximide; IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Cul3, Cullin 3; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinedi-ethanesulfonic acid; Ub, ubiquitin. 2The abbreviations used are: NQO1, NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; ARE, antioxidant response element; tBHQ, tert-butylhydroquinone; CHX, cycloheximide; IP, immunoprecipitation; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Cul3, Cullin 3; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinedi-ethanesulfonic acid; Ub, ubiquitin. directly or indirectly participate in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (18Ernster L. Estabrook R.W. Hochstein P. Orrenius S. Chem. Scr. 1987; 27: 1-207Google Scholar). Many of the genes, exemplified by Nqo1, are induced by a wide range of oxidative and electrophilic chemicals through the antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the enhancers of the genes (19Ma Q. Kinneer K. Bi Y. Chan J.Y. Kan Y.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). This ARE paradigm of gene regulation is shared by a second set of enzymes/proteins, including heme oxygenase 1, glutathione synthetase, and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase that combat against reactive oxygen species and other stress signals (21Chan K. Han X.D. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4611-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar).The cap `n' collar basic leucine zipper protein Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a member of the leucine zipper family of transcription factors. Genetic and biochemical studies have uncovered an essential function of Nrf2 in the regulation of ARE-controlled gene transcription (19Ma Q. Kinneer K. Bi Y. Chan J.Y. Kan Y.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.

Med. 2004; 37: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is required for both the basal and inducible expression of a number of ARE-controlled genes. Dormant Nrf2 resides in the cytoplasm and is rapidly turned over through the ubiquitin-26 S proteasome pathway. The cytoplasmic Nrf2-binding protein Keap1 controls the ubiquitination of Nrf2 through the Cullin 3 (Cul3)-dependent ubiquitin ligase (E3) (24Kobayashi A. Kang M.I. Okawa H. Ohtsuji M. Zenke Y.

Biol. 2004; 24: 10941-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Moreover, Keap1 interacts with oxidative or electrophilic chemicals through its thiol groups in the linker region between the BTB (BR-C, ttk and bab) and Kelch domains for activation of Nrf2 by inducers (27Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Activated Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus, binds to ARE of target genes, and commences transcription of the genes. Together with the ARE-regulated target genes, the Nrf2·Keap1 regulatory system constitutes a complex and tightly regulated chemical sensing/transcriptional gene regulation mechanism critical in defense against both endogenous and environmental toxic insults. Consistent with this notion, loss of Nrf2 function is associated with increased sensitivity to a number of toxicants, carcinogens, and certain disease processes (21Chan K. Han X.D. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4611-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 28Hu X. Roberts J.R. Apopa P.L. Kan Y.W. Ma Q. Mol. Cell.

Pathol. 2006; 168: 1960-1974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Conversely, activation of Nrf2 has been implicated in chemoprotection against cancer, chemical toxicity, and chronic diseases by natural and synthetic chemoprotective agents (31Gao X. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10446-10451Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The role and mechanism of action of the Nrf2·Keap1·ARE gene system in the transcriptional response to toxic metals has not been well understood.In an attempt to identify the molecular targets and pathways of protective responses to arsenic, we found that arsenic potently induced detoxification gene Nqo1 through the Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene transcription. Induction involved a sequential and dynamic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Arsenic stabilized the Nrf2 protein by inhibiting the E1-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal turnover of Nrf2, extending the t½ of Nrf2 from 21 to 200 min. Nrf2 was associated with Keap1 and Cul3 in the cytoplasm. Although both the cytoplasmic Nrf2 and Keap1 were ubiquitinated, arsenic potently inhibited the ubiquitination of Nrf2 but not of Keap1. In the nucleus, treatment with arsenic but not phenolic antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) dissociated Nrf2 from Keap1·Cul3. Keap1 was ubiquitinated in the cytoplasm and deubiquitinated in the nucleus. Arsenic induced the dimerization of nuclear Nrf2 and Maf (Maf G/Maf K). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that both Nrf2 and Maf are present at the ARE enhancer of Nqo1 at a low level to mediate the basal transcription. Arsenic treatment substantially increased the occupancy of both Nrf2 and Maf at ARE to control the induction of the gene. On the contrary, AP-1 proteins c-Jun and c-Fos or Nrf2-binding proteins Keap1 and Cul3 were not associated with ARE. The findings revealed differential mechanisms of Nrf2 action by arsenic and antioxidants and provided a mechanistic framework of induction of ARE-driven genes by toxic metals through the Nrf2·Keap1 pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatment—Mouse hepa1c1c7 cells were provided by Dr. J. P. Whitlock, Jr. (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). The cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2. Mouse Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2–/– embryonic fibroblast cells were derived from wild type and Nrf2 null mice as described previously (19Ma Q. Kinneer K. Bi Y. Chan J.Y. Kan Y.W. Biochem.

The E36 and ts20 cells (kindly provided by Dr. R. R. Kopito, Stanford University) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 31 °C as described (32Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol.

Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) were added to the media to prevent contamination. Cells at confluency were treated with reagents as specified in figure legends. Sodium arsenite (NaAsO2), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), tBHQ, and cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Me2SO was used as the solvent control. MG132 was from BioMol (Plymouth, PA).RNA Preparation and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the Qiagen total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA of 3 μg each was fractionated in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to a supercharged nylon membrane, and blotted with a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled riboprobe prepared with the DIG-labeling reagents (Roche Applied Science). Template cDNAs for generating riboprobes of mouse Nqo1, Nrf2, and actin were verified by sequencing. Northern signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using a digoxigenin RNA detection kit with CDP Star as a substrate (Roche Applied Science). Actin was probed to control loading variations among samples. Results shown were repeated in two to three separate experiments with consistent observations.Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The full-length coding cDNA of mouse Nrf2 and Keap1 were obtained by reverse transcription and PCR from total RNA of hepa1c1c7 cells and was verified by sequencing. Nrf2 cDNA was subcloned into pCMV-HA (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at the SfiI and SalI sites to generate pCMV-HA-Nrf2. Keap1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen) at the XhoI and ApaI sites to give rise to pKeap1/pcDNA3-V5. The Nqo1 ARE reporter construct was kindly provided by Drs. K. Itoh and M. Yamamoto (University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan). The chimeric reporter contains the ARE enhancer from –865 to –897 base pairs upstream of the transcription start of the mouse Nqo1 gene fused to a β-globin promoter and luciferase cDNA. The reporter plasmid and pCMV-HA-Nrf2 were transfected into hepa1c1c7 cells using the Lipofectamine Plus reagents from Invitrogen per the manufacturer's instructions.

Briefly, cells at 90% confluency in 10-cm dishes were washed with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with ice-cold Nuclei EZ PREP lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1 μg/ml concentrations each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, all added immediately before use). For detection of ubiquitinated proteins, N-ethylmaleimide (Pierce) was added to the cell lysis buffer to inhibit ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to give rise to nuclei (pellet fraction) and cytosol (supernatant fraction). The nuclei pellets were washed once with the lysis buffer and resuspended in a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA; protease and phosphatase inhibitors were added as described above).

https://openalex.org/W2093545874,"Human DNA polymerase N (POLN or pol ν) is the most recently discovered nuclear DNA polymerase in the human genome. It is an A-family DNA polymerase related to Escherichia coli pol I, human POLQ, and Drosophila Mus308. We report the first purification of the recombinant enzyme and examination of its biochemical properties, as a step toward understanding the functions of POLN. Unusual for an A-family DNA polymerase, POLN is a low fidelity enzyme incorporating T opposite template G with a frequency of 0.45 and G opposite template T with a frequency of 0.021. The frequency of misincorporation of T opposite template G is higher than any other known DNA polymerase. POLN has a processivity of DNA synthesis (1–100 nucleotides) similar to the exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of E. coli pol I, is inhibited by dideoxynucleotides, and resistant to aphidicolin. The strand displacement activity of POLN was higher than exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment. Furthermore, POLN can perform translesion synthesis past thymine glycol, a common endogenous and radiation-induced product of reactive oxygen species damage to DNA. Thymine glycol blocks DNA synthesis by most DNA polymerases, but POLN was particularly adept at efficient and accurate translesion synthesis past a 5S-thymine glycol.

Thymine glycol blocks DNA synthesis by most DNA polymerases, but POLN was particularly adept at efficient and accurate translesion synthesis past a 5S-thymine glycol. The human genome contains 15 distinct known DNA polymerase genes, and these are classified into four families A, B, X, and Y based on their amino acid sequences (1Hübscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Human DNA polymerase N (POLN), 2The abbreviations used are: POLN, human DNA polymerase N; pol, polymerase; BER, base excision repair; NER, nucleotide excision repair; Tg, thymine glycol; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; 6-4 PP, (6-4) photoproduct; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; Kf (exo-), exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 2The abbreviations used are: POLN, human DNA polymerase N; pol, polymerase; BER, base excision repair; NER, nucleotide excision repair; Tg, thymine glycol; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; 6-4 PP, (6-4) photoproduct; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; Kf (exo-), exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. the most recently discovered nuclear DNA polymerase, is an A-family enzyme with unknown function. The gene on chromosome 4p16.2 encodes a protein of 900 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 100 kDa (2Marini F. Kim N. Schuffert A. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32014-32019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The prototypical A-family DNA polymerase, Escherichia coli pol I is a high fidelity DNA polymerase that contributes to the maturation of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and in gap-filling during base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and repair of DNA interstrand cross-links. Human POLQ, another A-family DNA polymerase, is similar to the Drosophila nuclear DNA polymerase Mus308 (3Pang M. McConnell M. Fisher P.A. DNA Repair (Amst). 2005; 4: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in that it encodes both a DNA/RNA helicase domain and an A-family DNA polymerase domain (4Seki M. Marini F. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6117-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Seki M. Masutani C. Yang L.W. Schuffert A. Iwai S. Bahar I. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4484-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). By contrast, POLN has only the DNA polymerase domain. The POLN gene is encoded only in vertebrate genomes, but not in invertebrates or any lower eukaryotes. Possibly POLN has a role related to organ systems that are especially developed in vertebrates, such as the adaptive immune system or the brain. Expression studies of POLN are limited, but expression of the gene has been detected by Northern blotting in testes, heart and skeletal muscle tissue (2Marini F. Kim N. Schuffert A. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32014-32019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and by expression sequence tagging in prostate, muscle, brain, and other organs.

It is possible that POLN might serve as a tumor suppressor in some cell types and that loss of its function could accelerate genome instability. To understand the functions of human POLN, we examined the fidelity and the activity of DNA damage bypass. We find that POLN has very low fidelity and a remarkable insertion preference different from any other known human DNA polymerase. Further, POLN can perform accurate translesion synthesis past a common product of reactive oxygen species damage to DNA, the thymine glycol. The properties of POLN indicate a function distinct from that of POLQ. Enzyme Purification—To construct a human POLN sequence construct for expression in E. coli, POLN with a short truncation of the C-terminal proline-rich tail was purified. This enzyme, previously referred to as POLN ΔP (2Marini F. Kim N. Schuffert A. Wood R.D. J. Biol.

This POLN and the corresponding D623A mutant were amplified by PCR from the plasmid pEGFP-C1 containing full-length wild type or D623A mutant POLN (2Marini F. Kim N. Schuffert A. Wood R.D. J. Biol.

After DNA sequencing, the cDNA was transferred into plasmid pDEST17 (Invitrogen) resulting in a protein tagged with six His residues at the N terminus (contributed by the pDEST17 vector), and a FLAG tag at the C terminus. The plasmid was transformed into an E. coli strain BL21 star (DE3), mutated for RNaseE (Invitrogen) and containing a plasmid (pRARE, Novagen) encoding 7 tRNAs for rare codons and the lysS+ gene. A single colony was incubated in 25 ml of Luria-Bertani medium (LB) containing 40 mm glucose, 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. The culture was grown overnight and transferred into 500 ml of fresh LB containing 40 mm glucose, 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The culture was grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 and cooled down on ice for 30 min. The culture was incubated with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 16 °C for 16 h. Incubation at 16 °C improved soluble protein expression relative to incubation at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 min) and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 min), 10 volumes of FLAG binding buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 100 nm desferrioxamine, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science was added to the pellet. The resuspended mixture was sonicated on ice (20 cycles of 10 s with a 20 s pause), and 0.25% polyethyleneimine was added and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. DNA and debris were removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 15 min) and the supernatant incubated overnight at 4 °C with 200 μl of FLAG resin (Sigma). The resin was washed five times with 10 volumes of FLAG washing buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture) and then three times with 10 volumes of TALON binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture). The protein was eluted by incubating with 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide in 500 μl of TALON binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The elution was incubated with 500 μl of TALON resin (BD Biosciences Clontech) for 1 h at 4 °C.

Oligonucleotide Substrates—Primer oligonucleotides were purchased from Bio-Synthesis or Sigma GenoSys, purified by HPLC or gel extraction, and 5′-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP. For 3′-labeling, the oligonucleotides were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and [α-32P]ddATP. Oligonucleotides containing a single thymine-thymine CPD, thymine-thymine 6–4 photoproduct, or 5S-thymine glycol were synthesized as detailed earlier (8Murata T. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E.

The oligonucleotide containing an AP site or 5R-thymine glycol were purchased from Glen Research. 5′-32P-Labeled primers were annealed to these oligonucleotides to create substrates for bypass assays (lesions highlighted by bold letters) as follows: Non-damaged substrate: CACTGACTGTATGATGGTGACTGACATACTACTTCTACGACTGCTC-5′. This substrate was also used for the 3′-5′ exonuclease assay. 5′-AAGATGCTGACGAG or 5′-AGATGCTGACGAG were annealed to the non-damaged substrate to create the nicked substrate or single-gapped substrates, respectively. CPD- and (6–4)PP substrate: CACTGACTGTATGATGGTGACTGACATACTACTTCTACGACTGCTC-5′. AP site-substrate (site of the AP-analog denoted by X): CACTGACTGTATGATGGTGACTGACATACTACXTCTACGACTGCTC-5′.

For processivity assays, the 24-mer primer oligonucleotide 5′-[32P]TCTTCTTCTGTGCACTCTTCTTCT was annealed to M13mp18GTGx single-stranded DNA (12Moggs J.G. Yarema K.J. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For strand displacement assays, A 60-mer oligonucleotide with either a 5′-phosphoryl or 5′-hydroxyl, 5′-CCCCAGGAATTCGGTCATAGCTGTTTCCTGCTCGAGGGCGCCAGGGTGGTTTTTCTTTTC was annealed together with the 24-mer oligomer to M13mp18GTGx ssDNA. For assay of TdT activity, the 14-mer oligomer 5′-[32P]AAGATGCTGACGAG was tested as a single strand or annealed to 5′-CTCGTCAGCATCTT as a blunt end duplex. DNA Polymerase Assays—A 5′-labeled 16-mer primer and a 30-mer template (sequences given above) were annealed at a molar ratio of 1:1 to detect DNA polymerase activity. The oligonucleotides were heated for 5 min at 65 °C and cooled down slowly for self-annealing. Standard reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 4% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 80 μg/ml BSA, 8 mm Mg(C2H3O2)2, 300 fmol of the primer template (30 nm), 100 μm each dNTP, and the indicated amount of POLN. dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP (100 μm) each were also present unless otherwise indicated. Before the addition of POLN, the reaction mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 min. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min (unless otherwise indicated), reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of gel loading buffer (98% deionized formamide, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 20 mm EDTA) and boiling at 95 °C for 3 min. Products were electrophoresed on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gel and exposed to BioMax MS film or analyzed with a Fuji FLA3000 Phosphor Imager. For translesion synthesis, the same amounts of templates containing specific lesions were used. For steady-state kinetics, 1 pmol of primer template (100 nm) was used, and the procedure was as previously described (13Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 14Kusumoto R. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6090-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This procedure utilizes extensive titration of nucleotide concentration (1.0–1000 μm) and three appropriate time points (1–10 min), and produces results valid for a considerable range of enzyme concentration. The velocity (v) was determined by dividing the amount of reaction product by the reaction time. Vmax and Km were determined from a Hanes-Woolf plot of [dNTP]/v versus [dNTP]. The nucleotide misincorporation ratio, finc was determined by dividing (Vmax/Km)incorrect by (Vmax/Km)correct. To optimize conditions and assay sensitivity to aphidicolin (Fisher), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Sigma) or ddTTP (2′,3′-dideoxythymidine-5′-triphosphate, Amersham Biosciences), a poly(dA)-oligo(dT)10:1 template was used instead of the 5′-labeled 16-mer primer annealed to the 30-mer template. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.8 (unless otherwise indicated), 4% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 80 μg/ml BSA, 8 mm Mg(C2H3O2)2 (unless otherwise indicated), 8 μg/ml of poly(dA)-oligo(dT)10:1, 10 μm dTTP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP, 23 nm POLN (unless otherwise indicated), and NaCl, aphidicolin, NEM or ddTTP as specified. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, reactions were stopped by adding 25 μl of 40 mm EDTA and placed on ice. A 10-μl aliquot of each mixture was spotted onto DE81 paper (Whatman), and washed three times with 0.5 m Na2HPO4 for 5 min and twice with ethanol. The paper was dried, and radioactivity was quantified with a Fuji Phosphor Imager. One unit of DNA polymerase activity was defined as the amount catalyzing the incorporation of 10 nmol of dTTP into poly(dA)/oligo(dT)10:1 template at 37 °C for 30 min. Processivity Assay—Single-primed phagemid DNA templates were prepared by annealing the 5′-32P-labeled 24-mer primer to single-stranded M13mp18GTGx at a molar ratio of 2:1. POLN or Kf (exo-) was incubated with 500 fmol of the singly primed template at 37 °C in 10μl of polymerase buffer. For Kf (exo-) the buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 100 μm DTT, 10 mm MgSO4, and 100 μm each dNTP. Reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of gel loading buffer and boiling at 95 °C for 3 min. Products were electrophoresed on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gel and exposed to BioMax MS film. Translesion Synthesis Assays—The 5′-32P-labeled 16-mer primer annealed to the 30-mer template at a molar ratio of 1:1 was used as primer template. POLN, RB69 (gp43), POLB, pol I, Kf (exo-), POLH, or POLQ was incubated with 300 fmol of the primer template at 37 °C in 10 μl reactions. The buffer for POLN or Kf (exo-) was the same as given above. The buffer for RB69 (gp43) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 200 μg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm each dNTP. The buffer for POLB contained 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 200 μm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm each dNTP. The buffer for E. coli pol I contained 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 100 μm DTT, 10 mm MgSO4, and 100 μm each dNTP. The buffer for POLH contained 40 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2.5% glycerol, 45 mm KCl, 10 mm DTT, 250 μg/ml BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm each dNTP. The buffer for POLQ contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 4% glycerol, 80 μg/ml BSA, 100 μm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm each dNTP. Reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of the gel loading buffer and boiling at 95 °C for 3 min. Products were electrophoresed on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide-7 m urea gel and exposed to BioMax MS film. Strand Displacement Assay—Substrates were prepared by mixing 5′-32P-labeled 16-mer primer, a downstream oligomer (5′-AAGATGCTGACGAG or 5′-AGATGCTGACGAG), and the 30-mer template at a molar ratio of 1:5:2 for use as a nicked substrate or 1-nt gap substrate, respectively. Reactions were performed under the same conditions as translesion synthesis assays. To measure the processivity of strand displacement, substrates were prepared by mixing the 5′-32P-labeled 24-mer primer, the downstream 60-mer oligomer with a 5′-phosphoryl or 5′-hydroxyl group (blocked at the 3′-end from priming using TdT and ddATP), and the single-stranded M13mp18GTGx at a molar ratio of 1:5:2. Purification and Biochemical Properties of Human DNA Polymerase N—The human POLN cDNA was expressed in E. coli and tagged with six His residues at the N terminus and a FLAG epitope at the C terminus. Protein sequentially purified on FLAG antibody beads and TALON resin migrated near the expected Mr of 102,000 (Fig. 1, A and B). POLN could extend DNA on a primed template whereas the active site mutant (D623A) showed no DNA polymerase activity (Fig. 1C). This residue is highly conserved in motif 3 of A-family DNA polymerases and is important in coordinating bivalent metal ions to interact with an incoming nucleotide (15Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of POLN was not influenced by this substitution (data not shown). POLN lacks sequences corresponding to a 3′-5′ exonuclease domain, and no exonuclease activity was detected when enzyme and substrate were incubated without dNTPs (Fig. 1D). POLN showed limited TdT activity and was able to add one nucleotide, particularly dAMP, to the 3′-end of a double-stranded template, but not on a single-stranded template (Fig. 1E). Non-templated addition at a blunt end is a common feature of A-family DNA polymerases (16Clark J.M. Joyce C.M. Beardsley G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Clark J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9677-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The optimal reaction conditions for human POLN were determined using a poly(dA)/oligo(dT)10:1 substrate. The optimal pH was 8.8, the same as POLQ (5Seki M. Masutani C. Yang L.W. Schuffert A. Iwai S. Bahar I. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4484-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Like POLQ (4Seki M. Marini F. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6117-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the DNA polymerase activity of POLN was highest in reaction mixtures that contained no salt, and increasing concentrations of NaCl inhibited the activity with 50% inhibition at 200 mm. POLN required a bivalent cation, and the optimal concentration was 8 mm Mg2+. Mn2+ at 4 mm provided 29% of the optimal activity. There was no difference between Mg(C2H3O2)2 and MgCl2 (not shown). Aphidicolin, which is an inhibitor of B-family DNA polymerases such as T4 DNA polymerase, had no inhibitory effect on POLN or Kf (exo-), respectively (Fig. 2A). Like Kf (exo-), POLN was relatively insensitive to NEM, whereas T4 DNA polymerase was sensitive (Fig. 2B). The specific activity of POLN with these optimal conditions was 125 units/mg. A single aromatic residue in motif 4 of A-family DNA polymerases, either Phe or Tyr, is highly conserved and critical for ddNTPs selectivity (Fig. 2D). Replacing Tyr526 of T7 DNA polymerase with Phe increases discrimination against ddNTPs, whereas replacing Phe667 of Taq pol I or Phe762 of E. coli pol I with Tyr decreases discrimination against ddNTPs (18Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6339-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). POLN has a Tyr682 at the homologous position, and the DNA polymerase activity of POLN was inhibited by ddTTP on the poly(dA)-oligo(dT) template (Fig. 2C). Human POLQ with Tyr2389 (4Seki M. Marini F. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6117-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or Drosophila Mus308 with Tyr1882 (19Harris P.V. Mazina O.M. Leonhardt E.A. Case R.B. Boyd J.B. Burtis K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is also inhibited by ddNTP. Processivity of Human DNA Polymerase N—To examine the processivity of POLN, a 5′-labeled 24-mer oligonucleotide was annealed to single-stranded circular M13 phage DNA and extension analyzed. The assay was performed in several ways to favor products resulting from a single binding event of POLN to the primer template. In an enzyme titration, POLN could elongate DNA chains as much as ∼100–150 nt (Fig. 3A). The product distribution was retained in the presence of an excess amount of poly(dA)/oligo(dT)10:1 as a trapping agent (Fig. 3B), and products of >100 nt were observed after only 5 min (Fig. 3C). The pattern was similar to that produced by Kf (exo-) (Fig. 5, A–C), which also gives products of 1–100 nt (20Eckert K.A. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13462-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the processsivity of human POLN is considerably greater than the processivity of 1–10 nt typically observed for X and Y family DNA polymerases.FIGURE 5Translesion synthesis by human POLN.

The human A-family DNA polymerase POLQ has low fidelity, however (5Seki M. Masutani C. Yang L.W. Schuffert A. Iwai S. Bahar I. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4484-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We analyzed the fidelity of POLN using a 30-mer template with a 16-mer primer (Fig. 4). When the first template base was G, POLN frequently incorporated the incorrect nucleotide T when dTTP was the only deoxynucleotide present, (Fig. 4, lane 4). Incorporation of G across from template G and further extension past a noncomplementary G-T base pair was also observed (Fig. 4, lane 3). With template T, POLN usually incorporated A but also frequently incorporated the incorrect base G (Fig. 4, lane 7). When the first template base was A, POLN usually incorporated the correct base T but also incorporated an extra incorrect T opposite the following template T (Fig. 4, lane 12). With template C, POLN frequently incorporated the correct choice G opposite the first template C, and extended further by incorporating G opposite the following template T (Fig. 4, lane 15). These experiments indicated that POLN catalyzes considerable misincorporation, particularly by incorporating T opposite G and G opposite T. To examine the fidelity of POLN, kinetic parameters were determined. We examined the template (first template base G) on which POLN appeared to incorporate incorrect bases most frequently (Fig. 4). Measurements were obtained with other incoming nucleotides, and from the ratio Vmax/Km (13Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), a misincorporation frequency (finc) was calculated. Compared with a value of 1.0 for correct utilization of dCTP opposite template G, these were 8.2 × 10–3 for dATP, 3.6 × 10–2 for dGTP and 4.5 × 10–1 for dTTP (Table 1). These values are about 100 times higher than the misincorporation frequency of ∼10–5 to 10–4 found for Kf (exo-) or Taq pol I (21Bebenek K. Joyce C.M. Fitzgerald M.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Recent studies suggest that hormones and growth factors play physiological roles in regulating telomerase activity. In this report we show a rapid repression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene by transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in normal and neoplastic cells by a mechanism depending on the intracellular signaling protein Smad3. In human breast cancer cells TGF-β induces rapid entry of Smad3 into the nucleus where it binds to the TERT gene promoter and represses TERT gene transcription. Silencing Smad3 gene expression or genetically deleting the Smad3 gene disrupts TGF-β repression of TERT gene expression. Expression of the Smad3 antagonist, Smad7, also interrupts TGF-β-mediated Smad3-induced repression of the TERT gene. Mutational analysis identified the Smad3 site on the TERT gene promoter, mediating TERT repression. In response to TGF-β, Smad3 binds to c-Myc; knocking down c-Myc, Smad3 does not bind to the TERT gene, suggesting that c-Myc recruits Smad3 to the TERT promoter. Thus, TGF-β negatively regulates telomerase activity via Smad3 interactions with c-Myc and the TERT gene promoter. Modifying the interaction between Smad3 and TERT gene may, thus, lead to novel strategies to regulate telomerase.

In the absence of TERT, telomeres undergo shortening for about 150 base pairs and rearrangement of telomere structure in each cell cycle. Short telomeres or uncapped telomere ends subsequently trigger cell senescence or apoptosis. Although TERT is expressed and telomerase is active during embryo development, TERT is down-regulated, and telomerase activity becomes suppressed during cell differentiation to mature somatic cells. This occurs in association with a gradual loss of cell proliferative potential. Although the role(s) of TERT repression in cell differentiation remains to be established (7Armstrong L. Saretzki G.

Transcriptional activation of the TERT gene is, thus, a critical, initial rate-limiting step in TERT function and telomerase activity. Reflecting its multifactorial regulation, the TERT gene promoter in man has multiple sites for transcriptional regulation. There are two typical E-boxes and several GC-boxes for the transcription factors c-Myc/max and Sp1, respectively (17Cong Y.S. Wen J. Bacchetti S. Hum. Mol.

Another E box-binding protein (upstream stimulatory factor) also up-regulates TERT promoter activity, with binding negatively regulated by the N-terminal-truncated form upstream stimulatory factor 2, as an inhibitory competitor whose levels are increased in telomerase negative cells (24Yago M.

Little is known of the mechanisms whereby the TERT gene is repressed during cell development and differentiation. Recent studies show that transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) is involved in repressing TERT gene transcription; combinations of c-Fos and c-Jun or c-Fos and JunD suppress TERT gene activation by binding to two AP-1 sites in the TERT gene promoter, suggesting a broad involvement of AP-1 in the regulation of telomerase in cell proliferation, differentiation, carcinogenesis, and apoptosis (25Takakura M.

TGF-β exerts its biological effects through specific intracellular effector molecules called Smads that are phosphorylated by type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors; phosphorylated Smad proteins such as Smad3 enter the cell nucleus to positively or negatively regulate gene expression by binding to DNA and interacting with DNA sequence-specific transcription factors (30Massague J.

Elledge S.J. Cell. 2003; 113: 881-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to characterize the actions of TGF-β in the regulation of telomerase in human breast cancer cells. We show that TGF-β induces a rapid repression of TERT gene transcription in various cell lines and normal vascular smooth muscle cells. We show that repression requires the TGF-β signaling transducer protein Smad3, as demonstrated by overexpression of antagonistic Smad7, by silencing Smad3 gene expression and by genetic deletion of the Smad3 gene. In response to TGF-β, Smad3 directly binds to the TERT gene, as demonstrated by in vitro gel shift assay and intact cell chromatin immunoprecipitation. Mutation of the TERT promoter Smad3 binding site abrogates the binding of Smad3 and inhibits TGF-β-induced repression of TERT gene promoter activity. Furthermore, Smad3 interacts with c-Myc in response to TGF-β, and silencing c-Myc gene expression abrogates the binding of Smad3 to the TERT gene. These findings suggest a novel mode of rapid inhibition of TERT and telomerase activity in both normal and neoplastic cells. They show for the first time that Smad3 directly represses TERT gene expression in human cells and that this repression involves Smad3 interactions with c-Myc and TERT gene promoter DNA. Cytokines, siRNA, Expression Plasmids, and Antibodies—Human TGF-β1 was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Smad3, c-Myc, and relevant control siRNAs were from Cellogenetics.

Recombinant human TGF-β1 at concentrations of 0, 0.25, 1, or 4 ng/ml was added into the cell culture for 15 min and 1, 2, 6, 15, and 24 h or as indicated in individual experiments. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 120 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate). Clarified cell lysates were normalized for total protein concentration by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). To determine the effect of Smad3 on TGF-β-mediated TERT gene suppression, Myc-tagged Smad3 was overexpressed by transfecting cultured cells with pcDNA3-Myc-Smad3 with empty plasmids as controls. To block TGF-β activity, a FLAG M2-tagged Smad7-expressing vector (pcDNA3 m2Smad7) and a control plasmid pcDNA3 were used. The transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After a 24-h transfection, cells were rested with serum-free medium for 24 h and then were stimulated with TGF-β1 for different times for Western blotting and semiquantitative RT-PCR to detect gene expressions as indicated in individual experiments. RNA Interference—MCF-7 cells were cultured to 30% confluence. For each well in a 24-well transfection, 1 μl of a 40 μm stock of Smad3 siRNA, c-Myc siRNA, or appropriate negative controls siRNAs (Cellogenetics) was diluted into 41.5 μl of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium, and 2 μl of Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted into Opti-MEM® I reduced serum medium to a final volume of 7.5 μl. The diluted Oligofectamine™ reagent was added to the diluted siRNA, mixed gently, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min; 200 μl medium was then added to each well containing cells. Fifty μl of the above complex was overlaid onto the cells and mixed gently. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator, and after incubation, 125 μl of 30% serum growth medium was added to the transfection mixture. Cell extracts were assayed by Western blot for Smad3 at 72 h post-transfection. RNA Isolation and Gene Expression Analyses—Total RNA was isolated with oligo-dT primers and the High Pure RNA Isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Total RNA (2 μg) was used to synthesize cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions; contaminating DNA was removed by treating the samples with RNase-free DNase. The PCR mix was then set up in an enclosed environment distant from the one in which RNA extraction was carried out. Linear amplification for semiquantitative PCR was performed using a ThermoScript RT-PCR kit following the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen) for 25-40 cycles of 30 s at 90 °C as the optimized annealing temperature and 72 °C extension. Primers specific for different gene were: human TERT (5′-CCACCTTGACAAAGTACAG-3′ and 5′-CGTCCAGACTCCGCTTCAT-3′), human GAPDH (5′-GAGAGACCCTCACTGCTG-3′ and 5′-GATGGTATATGACAAGGTG-3′), rat TERT (5′-GTGCGCTCTCTACTGCGCAGCCGATATC-3′ and 5′-CACGCTGGTCGTGAAGGCCATG-3′), mouse TERT (5′-CTCTCTGCTGCGCAGCCGATAC-3′ and 5′-CCTCGTTAAGCAGCTCAAAG-3′), rat and mouse GAPDH (5′-CATGACAACTTTGGCATTGTGG-3′ and 5′-CAGATCCACAACGGATACATTGGG-3′). All samples were subjected to PCR for the housekeeping gene GAPDH as a positive control and as the internal standard. PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gels in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, visualized by ethidium bromide, photographed in a gel 1000 ultraviolet documentation system (BioRad), and analyzed by densitometry. TERT gene expression in Smad3 KO fibroblasts was also measured using real-time PCR (ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system, Foster City, CA) as previously described (48Chiang Y.J. Hemann M.T.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—MCF-7 cells were rested with serum-free DMEM medium for 24 h and then stimulated with TGF-β1 for 0, 15, 45, and 120 min. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were lysed in 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, containing a 1:50 dilution of a protease inhibitor mixture (P2714; Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to pellet cell debris and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C with rotation followed by the addition of protein A-agarose (60 μlof50% slurry) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation to capture antibody-antigen complex. The antibody-antigen complex was washed, and samples (20 μg) were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electroblotted onto a Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 5% skimmed milk powder and 0.02% Tween 20 and then probed with antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the membrane was incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or porcine anti-rabbit IgG in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum and 1% fetal calf serum. The blot was then developed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) to produce a chemiluminescence signal, which was captured on x-ray film. For TERT, proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-FL membranes (Millipore), and probed with specific antibodies raised in rabbits (49Li H. Zhao L. Yang Z. Funder J.W. Liu J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33436-33442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Western blots were probed with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) or IRdye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals). Blotted proteins were detected and quantified by the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—MCF-7 cells seeded in chamber slides (Lab-Tek II, Nalge Nunc International) at 60-80% confluence were treated with TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) for different periods of time, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with CAS blocking solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with Smad3 or TERT primary antibodies at RT for 1 h and washed 3 times with PBS, 0.01% Triton for 5 min each. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. For staining cell nuclei, cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml Hoechst (Sigma) for 10 min at RT. Slides were then washed with PBS-Triton, mounted in anti-fade medium (Bio-Rad), and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica Instruments). For immunocytochemical analysis, cells were cultured on 8-chamber glass slides in the presence or absence of TGF-β1, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and preincubated with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% normal sheep serum to block nonspecific binding. Cells were incubated with the anti-p-Smad2/3 Ab or an irrelevant isotype control rabbit IgG at 4 °C overnight. After inactivation of endogenous peroxidase, cells were incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and then peroxidase conjugated streptavidin complex (ABC kit) followed by washing. Slides were developed with diaminobenzidine to produce a brown color, and the cell nucleus was counterstained with hematoxylin. Sections were cover-slipped in aqueous mounting medium. Luciferase Reporter Assay—The p(CAGA)13 Luc TGF-β-inducible luciferase reporter construct (0.5 μg) was transfected into MCF-7 cells or human colon cancer HCT116 cells to determine TGF-β and Smad3 signaling. To determine the regulation of human TERT promoter activity by TGF-β-induced Smad3 signaling, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of hTERT promoter p330-Luc (wild type), p330-mutated -281-284, p330-mutated -259-262 (GenBank™ accession AB018788), and 0.125 μg of co-transfected Renilla luciferase control reporter (pRL-TK). All transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE2000 (DNA:LipofectAMINE2000 = 1:3) as described in the user manual. Different doses of TGF-β1 were added 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured 15 h after TGF-β1 treatment. The dual luciferase assay (ML 3000 Microtiter Plate Luminometer) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Four μg of MCF-7 cell nuclear extract was incubated with 10,000 cpm of double-stranded Smad3 wild type oligonucleotide probe (WT 5′CGCGGGCACAGACGCCCAGGAC 3′ (the AGAC box is underlined)), its mutant oligonucleotide (mutant, 5′-CGCGGGCATATACGCCCAGGAC 3′), Smad3 wild type 2 oligonucleotide (WT2, 5′-GCGCGGCCCAGACCCCCGGGT-3′), or Myc wild type oligonucleotide probe (Myc WT, 5′-CGCGCTTCCCACGTGGCGGAGGGA-3′). Probes were labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences). Incubations were performed for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 2 μg of poly-(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. For competition studies, unlabeled wild-type Smad3 (wild type 1) oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction 30 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Specific Smad3 antibody (0.5 μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min on ice before the binding reaction. All incubation mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on native 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, which were subsequently dried and subjected to autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—The ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were fixed with formaldehyde (final concentration 1% v/v) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 10 min after TGF-β1 stimulation for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), pelleted for 4 min at 2000 rpm at 4 °C, resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1), and incubated for 10 min on ice. After sonication, lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. The sonicated cell supernatants were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), the rabbit anti-Smad3 antibodies were added to the 2-ml supernatant fraction, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation followed by the addition of 60 μl of protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (50% slurry) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The protein-DNA complex on protein A-agarose was pelleted at 1000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 min and washed for 3-5 min on a rotating platform with 1 ml of each buffer listed in order (a) low salt immune complex wash buffer (SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), (b) high salt immune complex wash buffer (SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and (c) LiCl immune complex wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% deoxycholic acid (sodium salt), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The protein-DNA complex was eluted by adding 250 μlof elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) to the pelleted protein A-agarose-antibody-DNA complex. 5 m NaCl (20 μl) was added to the eluate follo"

To isolate the effects of these forces, we subjected intact cartilage explants to 1–24 h of continuous dynamic compression or dynamic shear loading at 0.1 Hz. We then measured the transcription levels of 25 genes known to be involved in cartilage homeostasis using real-time PCR and compared the gene expression profiles obtained from dynamic compression, dynamic shear, and our recent results on static compression amplitude and duration. Using clustering analysis, we determined that transcripts for proteins with similar function had correlated responses to loading. However, the temporal expression patterns were strongly dependent on the type of loading applied. Most matrix proteins were up-regulated by 24 h of dynamic compression or dynamic shear, but down-regulated by 24 h of 50% static compression, suggesting that cyclic matrix deformation is a key stimulator of matrix protein expression. Most matrix proteases were up-regulated by 24 h under all loading types. Transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun maximally responded within 1 h to all loading types.

In contrast, dynamic compression leads to cyclic changes in pressure, deformation, and fluid flow within the tissue (Fig. 1B). For the case of unconfined dynamic compression of cylindrical cartilage explant disks using impermeable compression platens, theoretical models have predicted frequency-dependent increases in the dynamic amplitude of the hydrostatic pressure and radial strain at the explant center, with radially directed fluid flow velocities greatest at the explant periphery (10Buschmann M.D. Kim Y.J.

Biomech. 1995; 28: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Dynamic tissue shear in the “simple shear” configuration of Fig. 1C induces the cyclic matrix strain in a nearly uniform manner throughout the explant disk with minimal fluid flow or increased hydrostatic pressure (12Jin M. Frank E.H. Quinn T.M. Hunziker E.B. Grodzinsky A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Normal joint motion in vivo produces a superposition of all these components of cartilage loading. In vitro loading regimes modulate matrix biosynthesis in a loading-type dependent manner, mimicking in vivo responses. Static compression of cartilage explants up to 50% strain inhibited chondrocyte biosynthesis within 1 h, with sustained inhibition for over 24 h (8Sah R.L.Y. Kim Y.J. Doong J.Y.H. Grodzinsky A.J.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, quantitative autoradiography showed that dynamic compression increased proteoglycan synthesis by chondrocytes located mainly near the explant periphery (10Buschmann M.D. Kim Y.J. Wong M. Frank E. Hunziker E.B. Grodzinsky A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) in the region of maximal fluid flow, whereas the stimulatory effects of dynamic shear were observed throughout the explant (12Jin M.

Biophys. 2001; 395: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), consistent with the more spatially uniform cyclic shear strain. Studies applying hydrostatic pressure to isolated bovine articular chondrocytes showed that moderate cyclic hydrostatic pressurization (0.5–5 megapascal, 0.1–1 Hz) increased biosynthesis (14Jortikka M.O.

Recent studies have focused on intracellular signaling and gene expression pathways that may be linked to the observed changes in biosynthesis caused by mechanical loading of cartilage tissue. Ramp and hold (transient to static) compression of cartilage explants (Fig. 1A) up to 50% strain and for durations of 1–24 h induced time-dependent gene expression patterns that involved intracellular calcium and cyclic AMP (16Fitzgerald J.B.

Expression of matrix proteins such as aggrecan (17Valhmu W.B. Stazzone E.J. Bachrach N.M. Saed-Nejad F. Fischer S.G. Mow V.C. Ratcliffe A. Arch. Biochem.

Cyclic hydrostatic pressurization of bovine articular chondrocyte monolayers for 2–24 h, or intermittently for 4 days, increased type II collagen and aggrecan transcription by 3-fold (18Ikenoue T.

Twenty minutes of cyclic stretching of human chondrocytes cultured on plastic dishes up-regulated aggrecan transcription within 1 h of loading; however, no effect was observed 24 h after loading (20Millward-Sadler S.J. Wright M.O. Davies L.W. Nuki G. Salter D.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2091-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cell stretching was also found to induce inositol triphosphate-mediated calcium release in human chondrocytes (21Millward-Sadler S.J. Wright M.O. Lee H. Nishida K. Caldwell H. Nuki G. Salter D.M. J.

Res. 2001; : S49-S60Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Constant and cyclic fluid shear flow over bovine articular chondrocyte monolayers cultured on glass slides increased the frequency of intracellular calcium oscillations (23Yellowley C.E. Jacobs C.R.

Biomech. 2001; 34: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In cartilage explants, chelating intracellular calcium inhibited the up-regulation of gene transcription induced by static compression in a majority of matrix proteases and proteins (16Fitzgerald J.B.

Although cyclic loading has been shown to affect chondrocyte metabolic activities in cell culture, little is known about the intracellular effects of dynamic loading on intact cartilage explants. Motivated by the widespread induction of gene transcription by static compression (16Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19502-19511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we applied loads of varying duration, rate, and magnitude to cartilage explants and measured the response of 25 genes involved in cartilage extracellular matrix homeostasis. To distinguish the effects of matrix deformation from pressure gradients, fluid flow, and streaming potentials, we separately applied dynamic compression and dynamic tissue shear. To identify if certain intracellular signaling pathways were modulated by particular mechanical forces, we used inhibitors of intracellular calciumand cAMP-mediated signaling during loading. Clustering analysis (16Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol.

We found that dynamic compression and dynamic tissue shear induced similar expression patterns for anabolic and catabolic genes that were distinct from those induced by static compression. Furthermore, both dynamic loading regimes required intracellular calcium-dependent signaling to induce gene transcription. Cylindrical cartilage explant disks (3 mm diameter, 1 mm thick) were obtained from the middle zone of the patella-femoral groove of 1–2-week-old calves as described previously (8Sah R.L.Y. Kim Y.J. Doong J.Y.H. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H.K. Sandy J.D. J. Orthop. Res. 1989; 7: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Explants were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to equilibrate for 2 to 5 days in low glucose Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes buffer, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 20 μg/ml ascorbate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin, with medium exchanged every second day. To avoid pH or temperature changes at the onset of loading, medium was changed 16 h before loading. Anatomically matched explants were distributed among the loading conditions. In selected experiments, 10 μm BAPTA-AM, 4The abbreviations used are: BAPTA-AM, bis-(aminophenoxy)ethanetetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl; PCA, principal component analysis; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of matrix protease; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; TGF, transforming growth factor; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; NFκB, nuclear factor κB. a chelator of intracellular calcium (A.G. Scientific), or 50 μm Rp-cAMP, a competitive inhibitor of cAMP activation of protein kinase A (Sigma), were added to medium 1 h before loading, at concentrations previously shown to suppress compression-induced aggrecan gene transcription (16Fitzgerald J.B.

J. 2002; 361: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Dynamic Compression—For each time point, 12 explants (4 inhibitor-free, 4 BAPTA-AM treated, 4 Rp-cAMP treated) were placed in a polysulphone loading chamber that was mounted into an incubator-housed loading apparatus (30Frank E.H. Jin M. Loening A.M. Levenston M.E. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biomech. 2000; 33: 1523-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These explants were dynamically compressed at 0.1 Hz for 1, 4, 8, or 24 h using a 3% strain amplitude superimposed on a 5% static offset strain, loading conditions shown previously to stimulate proteoglycan and protein biosynthesis (8Sah R.L.Y. Kim Y.J. Doong J.Y.H. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H.K. Sandy J.D. J. Orthop. Res. 1989; 7: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 13Kim Y.J. Sah R.L. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H. Sandy J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Minimal liftoff was observed and total harmonic distortion was less than 10% (8Sah R.L.Y. Kim Y.J. Doong J.Y.H. Grodzinsky A.J. Plaas A.H.K. Sandy J.D. J. Orthop. Res. 1989; 7: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Control explants were statically compressed to 5% strain, based on the initial thickness measurement, for 4 or 24 h. Dynamic Shear—For each time point, 12 explants (6 inhibitor-free, 6 BAPTA-AM treated) were placed in a polysulphone shear chamber that was mounted into the loading apparatus (30Frank E.H. Jin M. Loening A.M. Levenston M.E. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biomech. 2000; 33: 1523-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These explants were maintained at 1-mm cut thickness and dynamically sheared at 0.1 Hz for 1, 4, or 24 h using a 3% engineering shear strain amplitude. This resulted in an application of cyclic shear deformation with less than 10% total harmonic distortion (12Jin M. Frank E.H. Quinn T.M. Hunziker E.B. Grodzinsky A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These tissue shear loading conditions were shown previously to produce minimal fluid flow and to stimulate proteoglycan and protein biosynthesis (12Jin M. Frank E.H. Quinn T.M. Hunziker E.B. Grodzinsky A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Over the course of 5 days, explants swell up to 20%. Therefore, to minimize unwanted compressive loading, all dynamic shear experiments were performed on day 2, where swelling of only 0–10% had occurred. Control explants were maintained at cut thickness for 4 or 24 h within similar chambers but not dynamically loaded. Immediately upon loading completion, cartilage explants subjected to identical mechanical loading and inhibitor treatment were pooled, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Pooled cartilage explants were disrupted with a liquid nitrogen-cooled tissue pulverizer, placed in a TRIzol lysis buffer (Invitrogen) and lysed using a tissue homogenizer (BioSpec Products Inc). The lysate was separated using phase-gel spin columns (Eppendorf) spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to Qiagen RNeasy Mini columns. Total RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol with the on-column DNA digest. Approximately 1–2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed (Applied Biosystems) on an Eppendorf Mastercycler. Real-time PCR was performed on an MJ Research Opticon 2 machine using Applied Biosystems SYBR Green master mixture. Primers were designed for the genes listed in supplemental Table A1, tested, and calibrated as previously described (16Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19502-19511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Mechanically loaded samples were always run on the same PCR plate as unloaded controls and housekeeping genes 18S and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were run on every plate. Cycle threshold values were converted to relative copy numbers using primer-specific standard curves. To normalize for starting cDNA content, copy numbers were divided by the average of the mean-centered housekeeping genes for each sample on a plate. Relative gene expression levels were calculated by dividing dynamically loaded sample expression levels by control expression levels. To elucidate the main expression patterns induced by dynamic loading, and to determine subsets of genes responding to the same signaling events during loading, the following gene clustering procedure was performed. For each gene the expression levels from the inhibitor free, BAPTA-AM, and Rp-cAMP treatments were combined into a single gene expression vector time course (Rp-cAMP for dynamic compression only). To emphasize expression vector shape rather than amplitude, each vector was standardized by the vector standard deviation as described previously (16Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19502-19511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and clustered using two different clustering techniques. First, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the data matrix that contained all standardized gene vectors from either dynamic compression or shear to determine the main principal components (similar to eigenvectors). The projection of the standardized vectors along the three main principal components was used to create a three-dimensional representation of the data that enabled the number of groups to be determined graphically (see Ref. 16Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19502-19511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar for more detail). Euclidean distance k means clustering of the three-dimensional gene projection coordinates was then performed to group the genes. A second technique applying correlation-based k means clustering to the full-length standardized expression vectors was also used to ensure reliable clustering. Centroids were calculated as the average of the standardized gene expression vectors within a group. To determine whether distinct expression patterns had been found, Student's t test between group centroid vectors was performed using the Euclidean distance between the centroid vectors and the variance of each centroid (calculated as the average gene-to-centroid norm for all genes within a group). To confirm the gene groups were robust, the top five ranked groupings were examined, as well as varying the number of total groups. A complete mathematical description of the clustering and statistical approaches is in supplemental Appendix A. In an effort to further elucidate the effects of mechanical forces on gene transcription, expression vectors containing the inhibitor-free 1-, 4-, and 24-h time points of previously published 50% static compression expression levels (16Fitzgerald J.B. Jin M. Dean D. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Grodzinsky A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19502-19511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) were combined with dynamic compression and dynamic shear inhibitor-free time courses. Clustering analysis was performed as described above. Group and gene expression levels were compared with the normalized control level of 1 using Student's t tests; a p value <0.05 was considered significant. Effects of Dynamic Compression—Dynamic compression of cartilage explants generally up-regulated many genes in a time-dependent manner (expression levels for all genes are shown in supplemental Appendix A and Figs. A1 and A2). Transcription of matrix proteins aggrecan and type II collagen (Fig. 2) was affected by long term dynamic compression with increases of 30–100% after 24 h. Link protein, type I collagen, fibromodulin, and fibronectin mRNA levels responded in a similar way (supplemental Fig. A1). The expression of COX-2 and most matrix proteases increased by 100–200% by 24 h, although MMP3, MMP9, MMP13, and COX-2 were mainly suppressed during earlier time points (Figs. 2 and supplemental A1 and A2). Of the TIMPs, only TIMP1 was up-regulated by dynamic compression (Fig. A1). Immediate early genes c-Fos and c-Jun and signaling genes mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK1), and TNFα were transiently up-regulated by 100–200% after 1 h, returning to control levels after 8 h of loading (Figs. 2 and supplemental A2). TGFβ and ribosomal 6-phosphate were unaffected by dynamic compression (supplemental Fig. A2). Sox9, interleukin 1β, and HSP70 were mildly up-regulated only at the 4-h time point (Figs. 2 and supplemental A2), although HSP70 was scarcely detected even during loading and, hence, was not included in the clustering analysis. When the inhibitor-free, BAPTA-AM treated, and Rp-cAMP-treated gene expression levels were combined, PCA identified three major principal components that account for over 75% of the variance in the data set. Identical gene groupings were found using either PCA or correlation based clustering techniques producing three statistically distinct (p values < 0.02) and robustly conserved groups (Fig. 3 and Table 1). (Prior to clustering HSP70 and MMP9 were removed as PCA analysis identified their gene expression profiles as very different from all other genes.) Group C1 contained a number of matrix proteins and was characterized by up-regulation after 24 h of dynamic compression. The presence of BAPTA-AM suppressed the long term up-regulation of Group C1 genes, but enhanced expression only at earlier time points (1 and 4 h). Similarly Rp-cAMP treatment suppressed long term up-regulation of Group C1 but enhanced short-term expression. Group C2 was mainly composed of proteases that were suppressed during early time points, up-regulated by 24 h of loading, and generally restrained to controls levels when BAPTA-AM was present (Fig. 3). Rp-cAMP treatment generally up-regulated Group C2 expression, especially COX-2. Group C3 contained transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun and other signaling molecules that exhibited transient up-regulation by dynamic compression, which was partially suppressed by BAPTA-AM and unaffected by Rp-cAMP treatment during loading (Fig. 3).TABLE 1Main groups found by clustering gene expression profilesLoading conditionsGroupsaGroupings for each set of experiments were found by iteratively clustering gene expression profiles based on correlation and Euclidean distance metrics. Final groups were compared with the top five suboptimal groupings to ensure trends were robust. All groups within each set of experiments were found to be statistically significantly separated according to Student's t tests performed on group centroid-to-centroid distances.

https://openalex.org/W1989671723,"Although indirubin is known to exhibit anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities, very little is known about its mechanism of action. In this study, we investigated whether indirubin mediates its effects through interference with the NF-κB pathway. As examined by the DNA binding of NF-κB, we found that indirubin suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-κB activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Indirubin also suppressed the NF-κB activation induced by various inflammatory agents and carcinogens. Further studies showed that indirubin blocked the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα through the inhibition of activation of IκBα kinase and phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65. NF-κB reporter activity induced by TNFR1, TNF receptor-associated death domain, TRAF2, TAK1, NF-κB-inducing kinase, and IKKβ was inhibited by indirubin but not that induced by p65 transfection. We also found that indirubin inhibited the expression of NF-κB-regulated gene products involved in antiapoptosis (IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and TRAF1), proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-Myc), and invasion (COX-2 and MMP-9). This correlated with enhancement of the apoptosis induced by TNF and the chemotherapeutic agent taxol in human leukemic KBM-5 cells. Indirubin also suppressed cytokine-induced cellular invasion. Overall, our results indicate that anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities previously assigned to indirubin may be mediated in part through the suppression of the NF-κB activation pathway.

More recently indirubin was shown to inhibit c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (20Xie Y. Liu Y. Ma C. Yuan Z. Wang W. Zhu Z. Gao G. Liu X. Yuan H. Chen R. Huang S. Wang X. Zhu X. Mao Z. Li M. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 367: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The molecule has anti-inflammatory effects as indicated by its ability to inhibit 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene-induced inflammatory reaction in mice (21Kunikata T. Tatefuji T. Aga H. Iwaki K. Ikeda M. Kurimoto M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 410: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and suppresses the expression of the influenza virus-induced chemokine RANTES in human bronchial epithelial cells (22Mak N.K. Leung C.Y. Wei X.Y. Shen X.L. Wong R.N. Leung K.N. Fung M.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may suppress the NF-κB activation pathway. NF-κB is a family of Rel domain-containing proteins present in the cytoplasm of all cells, where they are kept in an inactive state by a family of ankyrin domain-containing proteins, which includes IκBα,IκBβ,IκBγ,IκBϵ, Bcl-3, p105, and p100. Under resting conditions, NF-κB consists of a heterotrimer of p50, p65, and IκB in the cytoplasm; only when activated and translocated to the nucleus is the sequence of events leading to activation initiated. Most carcinogens, inflammatory agents, and tumor promoters, including cigarette smoke, phorbol ester, okadaic acid, H2O2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), have been shown to activate NF-κB. The activation of NF-κB involves the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBα and phosphorylation of p65, which in turn leads to the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus where it binds to specific response elements in the DNA. The phosphorylation of IκBα is catalyzed by IκBα kinase (IKK), which is essential for NF-κB activation by most agents. NF-κB has been shown to regulate the expression of several genes whose products are involved in tumorigenesis (23Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). These include antiapoptotic genes (e.g. cIAP1/2, SURVIVIN, TRAF, BCL2, and BCLxL); COX-2, (MMP-9); genes encoding adhesion molecules, chemokines, and inflammatory cytokines; and cell cycle regulatory genes (e.g. cyclin D1 and c-MYC). Whether indirubin exerts its anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects through suppression of the NF-κB pathway was investigated. We found that indirubin inhibited the activation of NF-κB through inhibition of IκBα kinase, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression. The suppression of NF-κB by indirubin inhibited TNF-induced cell invasion and led to the down-regulation of gene products that prevent apoptosis and promote inflammation and tumor metastasis. Reagents—Indirubin derivative, indirubin-3′-monoxime with chemical structure as shown in Fig. 1A, was obtained from Calbiochem. A 10 mm solution of indirubin was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, stored as small aliquots at –20 °C, and then diluted as needed in cell culture medium. Bacteria-derived human recombinant human TNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA,). Cigarette smoke condensate, prepared as described previously (24Anto R.J. Mukhopadhyay A. Shishodia S. Gairola C.G. Aggarwal B.B. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly supplied by Dr. C. Gary Gairola (University of Kentucky, Lexington). Penicillin, streptomycin, RPMI 1640 medium, and FBS were obtained from Invitrogen. PMA, okadaic acid, H2O2, taxol, and anti-β-actin antibody were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against p65, p50, IκBα, cyclin D1, MMP-9, c-Myc, IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, TRAF1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and annexin V staining kit were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-COX-2 antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences. Phospho-specific anti-IκBα (Ser-32), phospho-specific IKKα/β (Ser-180/181), and phospho-specific anti-p65 (Ser-536) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-IKK-α, and anti-IKK-β antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Expression vector plasmids for transforming growth factor-β activated kinase (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein (TAB1) have been described previously (25Blonska M. Shambharkar P.B. Kobayashi M. Zhang D. Sakurai H. Su B. Lin X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43056-43063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cell Lines—Cell lines H1299 (lung adenocarcinoma), KBM-5 (human myeloid), and A293 (human embryonic kidney) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The H1299 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, and the KBM-5 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 15% FBS, and the A293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. All culture media were also supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—To determine NF-κB activation, we prepared nuclear extracts and performed EMSA as described previously (26Takada Y. Khuri F.R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26287-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For super-shift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against either p50 or p65 of NF-κB for 15 min at 37 °C before the complex was analyzed by EMSA. Preimmune serum was included as the negative control. The dried gels were visualized, and the radioactive bands quantitated with a Storm 820 and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of protein expression in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, we prepared extracts (27Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3278-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and fractionated them by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransfered onto nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and detected by an ECL regent (Amersham Biosciences). The bands obtained were quantitated using NIH image software (National Institutes of Health). IKK Assay—To determine the effect of indirubin on TNF-induced IKK activation, an IKK assay was performed by a method described previously (28Takada Y. Mukhopadhyay A. Kundu G.C. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24233-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IKK complex from whole cell extracts was precipitated with antibody against IKK-α and then treated with protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce). After 2 h, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then resuspended in a kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [γ–32P]ATP, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized with a Storm820. To determine the total amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β in each sample, 50 μg of whole cell proteins was resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electrotransfered to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with either anti-IKK-α or anti-IKK-β antibody. NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression Assay—To determine the effect of indirubin on TNF-, TNFR-, TRADD-, TRAF2-, NIK-, IKK-, and p65-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription, we performed the secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay as described previously (29Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4750-4759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), with the following exceptions. Briefly, A293 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method with pNF-κB-SEAP (0.5 μg). To examine TNF-induced reporter gene expression, we transfected the cells with 0.5 μg of the SEAP expression plasmid and 2 μg of the control plasmid pCMV-FLAG1 DNA for 24 h. We then treated the cells for 18 h with indirubin and then stimulated them with 1 nm TNF. The cell culture medium was harvested after 24 h of TNF treatment. To examine reporter gene expression induced by various genes, A293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pNF-κB-SEAP plasmid with 1 μg of an expressing plasmid and 0.5 μg of the control plasmid pCMV-FLAG1 for 24 h, treated with indirubin, and then harvested from culture medium after an additional 24 h of incubation. Culture medium was analyzed for SEAP activity according to the protocol essentially as described by the manufacturer (Clontech) using a Victor 3 microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the TAK1/TAB1 experiment, A293 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were transiently transfected with the expression vectors for TAK1/TAB1 and pNF-κB-SEAP (0.5 μg) plasmids by the FuGENE 6 method (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, cells were treated with indicated concentrations of indirubin, and conditioned medium was harvested after 24 h for SEAP activity as described above. Immunocytochemistry for NF-κB p65 Localization—Immunocytochemistry was used to examine the effect of indirubin on the nuclear translocation of p65 as described previously (29Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4750-4759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, treated cells were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide by centrifugation (Cytospin 4; Thermoshendon), air-dried, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100. After being washed in PBS, the slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human p65 antibody at a 1/200 dilution. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the slides were washed, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) at a 1/200 dilution for 1 h, and counterstained for nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (50 ng/ml) for 5 min. Stained slides were mounted with mounting medium purchased from Sigma and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2; Nikon). Pictures were captured using a Photometrics Coolsnap CF color camera (Nikon) and MetaMorph version 4.6.5 software (Universal Imaging). Live/Dead Assay—To measure apoptosis, we also used the Live/Dead assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which determines intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity (30Shishodia S. Gutierrez A.M. Lotan R. Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9555-9565Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity Assay—The effects of indirubin on the cytotoxic effects of TNF and the chemotherapeutic agent taxol were determined by the MTT uptake method as described previously (31Shishodia S. Majumdar S. Banerjee S. Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4375-4383PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10,000 cells were incubated with indirubin in triplicate on a 96-well plate and then treated with the indicated concentrations of TNF or taxol for 24 h at 37 °C. An MTT solution was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. An extraction buffer (20% SDS, 50% dimethylformamide) was added, and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Then the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a 96-well multiscanner (Dynex Technologies, MRX Revelation; Chantilly, VA). Annexin V Assay—An early indicator of apoptosis is the rapid translocation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the cytoplasmic interface of membrane to the extracellular surface. This loss of membrane asymmetry can be detected by using the binding properties of annexin V. To identify apoptosis, we used an annexin V antibody, which was conjugated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence dye. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were pretreated with indirubin, treated with TNF for 16 h at 37 °C, and subjected to annexin V staining. The cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody, and then analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Invasion Assay—Because invasion through the extracellular matrix is a crucial step in tumor metastasis, a membrane invasion culture system was used to assess cell invasion The Bio-Coat tumor invasion system is a chamber that has a light-tight polyethylene terephthalate membrane with 8-μm diameter pores and is coated with a reconstituted basement membrane gel (BD Biosciences). A total of 2.5 × 104 H1299 cells were suspended in serum-free medium and seeded into the upper wells. After incubation overnight, cells were treated with indirubin and then stimulated with TNF in the presence of 1% FBS and indirubin. The cells that invaded through the Matrigel (i.e. those that migrated to the lower chamber during incubation) were stained with 4 μg/ml calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and scanned for fluorescence with a Victor 3 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); the fluorescent cells were counted. Cyclooxygenase-2 Promoter-dependent Reporter Luciferase Gene Expression—COX-2 promoter activity was examined as described elsewhere (30Shishodia S. Gutierrez A.M. Lotan R. Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9555-9565Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine further the effect of indirubin on the COX-2 promoter, A293 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. After overnight culture, the cells in each well were transfected with 2 μg of DNA consisting of COX-2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid along with 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The COX-2 promoter (–375 to +59), which was amplified from human genomic DNA by using the primers 5′-GAGTCTCTTATTTATTTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTGCTGAGGAGTTCCTGGACGTGC-3′ (antisense), was kindly provided by Dr. Xiao-Chun Xu (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). After a 6-h exposure to the transfection mixture, the cells were incubated in medium containing indirubin. The cells were exposed to TNF and then harvested. Luciferase activity was measured by using the Luclite (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol and detected by luminometer (Victor 3, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least twice to prove their reproducibility. We investigated the effects of indirubin on the NF-κB activation pathway induced by various carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli on NF-κB-regulated gene expression and on apoptosis induced by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents. The concentration of indirubin used and the duration of exposure had minimal effect on the viability of different cell lines studied as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion test (data not shown). We focused on TNF-induced NF-κB activation because the role of TNF in the NF-κB activation pathway had already been well characterized (32Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Indirubin Suppresses NF-κB Activation in a Dose- and Time-dependent Manner—We first determined the dose and time of exposure to indirubin required to suppress NF-κB activation. EMSA showed that indirubin alone had no effect on NF-κB activation, but it inhibited TNF-mediated NF-κB activation in a dose- (Fig. 1B) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). When nuclear extracts from TNF-activated cells were incubated with antibodies to the p50 (NF-κB) and the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB, the resulting bands were shifted to higher molecular masses (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the TNF-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65. Preimmune serum had no effect on DNA binding. Addition of excess unlabeled NF-κB (cold oligonucleotide; 100-fold) caused complete disappearance of the band, whereas mutated oligonucleotide had no effect on the DNA binding. Indirubin Does Not Directly Affect Binding of NF-κB to the DNA—Some NF-κB inhibitors, including N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (a serine protease inhibitor), herbimycin A (a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor), and caffeic acid phenethyl ester, directly modify NF-κB to suppress its DNA binding (33Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 34Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28557-28564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 35Natarajan K. Singh S. Burke Jr., T.R. Grunberger D. Aggarwal B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9090-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). By using EMSA, we found that indirubin did not modify the DNA-binding ability of NF-κB proteins prepared from TNF-treated cells (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that indirubin inhibits NF-κB activation by a mechanism different from that of N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, herbimycin A, or caffeic acid phenethyl ester. Inhibition of NF-κB Activation by Indirubin Is Not Cell Type-specific—Distinct signal transduction pathways can mediate NF-κB induction in different cell types (36Bonizzi G. Piette J. Merville M.P. Bours V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5264-5272PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar), so we investigated whether indirubin could block TNF-induced NF-κB activation in two other cell lines, human small cell lung carcinoma H1299 (Fig. 1F) and human embryonic kidney A293 cells (Fig. 1G). Indirubin completely inhibited the TNF-induced activation of NF-κB in both cell types. These results indicated that there was a lack of cell type specificity. Indirubin Inhibits NF-κB Activation Induced by Carcinogens and Inflammatory Stimuli—As NF-κB plays an important role in apoptosis and in cell invasion, we examined the effect of indirubin on the activation of this transcription factor. Because cigarette smoke condensate, H2O2, TNF, okadaic acid, and PMA are potent activators of NF-κB but by different mechanisms (24Anto R.J. Mukhopadhyay A. Shishodia S. Gairola C.G. Aggarwal B.B. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Takada Y. Mukhopadhyay A. Kundu G.C. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24233-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 32Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 38Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of indirubin on the activation of NF-κB by these agents by DNA binding assays. All five agents activated NF-κB in human myeloid leukemia KBM-5 cells, and indirubin suppressed this activation (Fig. 1H). These results suggest that indirubin acts at a step in the NF-κB activation pathway that is common to all five agents. Indirubin Inhibits TNF-induced Phosphorylation of p65—We also investigated the effect of indirubin on TNF-induced phosphorylation of p65, because phosphorylation is also required for its transcriptional activity (39Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). In the nuclear fraction from the TNF-treated cells, there was a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylated form of p65, and indirubin suppressed it (Fig. 2A, upper panel). We also determined the effect of indirubin on TNF-induced nuclear translocation of p65. TNF induced the translocation in a time-dependent manner, and indirubin suppressed it (Fig. 2A, middle panel). An immunocytochemistry assay confirmed that indirubin suppressed translocation of p65 to the nucleus (Fig. 2B). Indirubin Inhibits TNF-induced IκBα Degradation—Because IκBα degradation is required for activation of NF-κB (23Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar), we determined whether inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB activation by indirubin was because of inhibition of IκBα degradation. We found that TNF-induced IκBα degradation in control cells as early as 10 min, but in indirubin-pretreated cells TNF had no effect on IκBα degradation (Fig. 2C). Indirubin Inhibits TNF-dependent IκBα Phosphorylation—To determine whether the inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα degradation was because of an inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation, we used the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal to block degradation of IκBα. Western blot using an antibody that recognizes the serine-phosphorylated form of IκBα showed that TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation was strongly suppressed by indirubin (Fig. 2D). Indirubin Inhibits TNF-induced IκBα Kinase Activation—Because indirubin inhibits the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, we tested the effect of indirubin on TNF-induced IKK activation, which is required for TNF-induced phosphorylation of IκBα. As shown in Fig. 2E (upper panel), indirubin completely suppressed TNF-induced activation of IKK. Neither TNF nor indirubin had any effect on the expression of IKK-α or IKK-β proteins (Fig. 2E, bottom panels). To evaluate whether indirubin suppresses IKK activity directly by binding IKK or indirectly by suppressing its activation, we incubated whole cell extracts from untreated cells and TNF-stimulated cells with anti-IKK-α antibody.

Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of the correlation between NLS receptor affinity and the steady-state distribution of NLS-bearing cargo proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus of live yeast, which reflects the relative import rates of various NLS sequences. We find that there is a complicated, but monotonic quantitative relationship between the affinity of an NLS for the import receptor, importin α, and the steady-state accumulation of the cargo in the nucleus. This analysis takes into consideration the impact of protein size. In addition, the hypothetical upper limit to an NLS affinity for the receptors is explored through genetic approaches. Overall, our results indicate that there is a correlation between the binding affinity of an NLS cargo for the NLS receptor, importin α, and the import rate for this cargo.

The segregation of the nuclear genetic material from the cytoplasmic machinery that translates it into proteins provides the eukaryotic cell with intricate mechanisms for controlling gene expression. This segregation, however, also presents the cell with a mechanistic problem. Because most intra- and extracellular signaling pathways culminate with changes in gene expression within the nucleus, signals must cross the nuclear envelope to gain access to the genetic material. This signal is almost invariably a protein, such as a transcription factor, that enters the nucleus. In addition, once a gene is transcribed, the messenger RNA must then be exported across the nuclear envelope into the cytoplasm where it is translated into protein. In fact, the nuclear envelope is a critical information barrier across which both RNA and proteins are selectively transported in a highly regulated manner to establish orderly communication and behavior within the cell (1Suntharalingam M. Wente S.R. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 775-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The best characterized mechanism for translocation across the nuclear envelope is protein import, which depends on the “classical” nuclear localization signal or NLS 2The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; IBB, importin β binding domain; NES, nuclear export signal; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIC, differential interference contrast; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 2The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; IBB, importin β binding domain; NES, nuclear export signal; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIC, differential interference contrast; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. (2Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). A classical NLS consists of a cluster of basic residues (monopartite) or two clusters of basic residues separated by 10–12 residues (bipartite) (3Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E.

NLS-containing cargoes are imported by a heterodimeric import receptor complex composed of importin α and importin β (5Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Importin α, which recognizes and binds to the NLS sequence, is an adapter protein (6Goldfarb D.S. Corbett A.H. Mason D.A. Harreman M.T. Adam S.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) that consists of a small N-terminal importin β-binding domain (IBB) and a larger C-terminal NLS-binding domain (7Weis K.

Importin β does not directly interact with the NLS cargo but instead targets importin α to the nuclear pore (12Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 13Moroianu J. Hijikata M. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the absence of importin β, “NLS-like” sequences within the N-terminal IBB domain of importin α form an intra-molecular bond with the NLS-binding site, which inhibits the interaction between importin α and the NLS cargo (13Moroianu J.

In an analogous manner, the interaction between importin α and importin β is regulated by the small GTPase, Ran. Both structural and biochemical evidence indicates that, in the GTP-bound state, Ran binds tightly to importin β resulting in a conformational change that triggers the release of importin α (18Lee S.J.

This cascade of regulated interactions provides a molecular model for unidirectional import of proteins into the nucleus (5Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 22Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The small GTPase Ran distinguishes the nucleus from the cytoplasm due to the compartmentalization of its regulatory proteins (21Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Ran is found primarily in a GTP-bound form, whereas in the cytoplasm, the GDP-bound form is dominant (5Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Thus, in the cytoplasm, importin β can bind to importin α removing the inhibition of NLS binding by the IBB domain. The importin β-bound importin α can bind to the NLS cargo with high affinity (15Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The receptor-cargo complex is translocated through the nuclear pore via interactions between importin β and the nucleoporins (12Radu A. Blobel G. Moore M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 13Moroianu J. Hijikata M. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the ternary complex encounters Ran in the GTP-bound state. Ran-GTP binds to importin β releasing the importin α-NLS complex (17Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The IBB domain of importin α then competes with the NLS cargo for the NLS-binding site facilitating the release of the NLS cargo into the nucleus (15Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Kobe B. Nat. Struct.

This model for protein import requires precise tuning of the thermodynamic interactions between the various species in order for the reaction to proceed efficiently in a single direction. A complete understanding of nuclear import signals requires a quantitative model for the import reaction that correlates NLS amino acid sequence, in vitro interaction energies, and in vivo functionality. We have previously attempted to decipher the energetic details of NLS recognition by importin α through quantitative analysis of variant NLSs. The relative importance of each residue in two monopartite NLS sequences was determined using an alanine-scanning approach (26Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This analysis was performed using the ΔIBB-importin α variant, which lacks the N-terminal autoinhibitory domain, as a model for the high affinity importin α-importin β complex. Variants of NLS sequences were generated with affinities for ΔIBB-importin α that ranged between a KD of a few micromolar to a KD of a few picomolar (Table 1). In addition, the energy of inhibition of the importin α IBB domain was measured and found to be ∼3 kcal/mol regardless of the sequence of the NLS. These data allow the generation of an energetic scale of nuclear localization sequences where a signal has a high affinity for the cytoplasmic importin α-importin β complex and an affinity 3 kcal/mol weaker for the autoinhibited importin α in the nucleus (26Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab One goal of this quantitative analysis is to provide a thermodynamic foundation for a numerical model of the process of nuclear transport (for examples see Refs. 27Smith A.E. Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 28Görlich D. Seewald M.J. Ribbeck K.

One would expect that the in vivo process of nuclear import would correlate in some manner with the energetics of the individual protein-protein interactions that drive the process. One finding from a recent modeling study is that the rates of nuclear protein import are largely governed by the level of the NLS receptor, importin α (29Riddick G. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One implication of this finding is that the binding affinity of the NLS receptor for its cargo should be an important determinant of how efficiently that cargo is transported into the nucleus. Indeed, there is empirical evidence to indicate that there is some sort of functional threshold of affinity that an NLS must possess for importin α in order for the cargo to be imported into the nucleus (3Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). When the SV40 NLS (PKKKRKVE) is mutated to the SV40T3 sequence (PKTKRKVE), its affinity for ΔIBB-importin α decreases by ∼3 kcal/mol (from KD = 9 nm to KD = 3 μm), and it loses its ability to function as a nuclear localization signal in vivo (3Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). Thus the energetic threshold dividing a functional NLS from a nonfunctional NLS exists somewhere between the binding affinity of the SV40T3 variant NLS (KD = 3 μm) and the SV40 wild-type NLS (KD = 9 nm). There have been a handful of reports comparing the measured binding affinity between an NLS and its receptors with the rate of import of a cargo fused to that NLS in vivo. Work by Jans et al. (30Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 31Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hubner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) involved the measurement of the binding constant between several NLSs and full-length importin α through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay followed by measurement of the import rate of these NLSs microinjected into rat hepatoma cells. They reported that the initial rate of protein import is linearly correlated with the equilibrium constant for the interaction between the NLS cargo and importin α. This is an interesting result, because this relationship would hold true in a simple model where the rate of protein import would depend on the equilibrium concentration of the importin α-importin β-cargo-NLS ternary complex. Although provocative, the dynamic range of the measurements used in this study was limited: the range of KD measurements used in this report varied only by a factor of four. Thus it would be interesting to see if this correlation suggested in these studies is general to a wider range of NLS affinities. The quantitative data generated by our examination of the energy landscape of importin α yields a numerical skeleton on which to build a comprehensive model for the complicated process of protein import. A given NLS can be situated on a linear scale that describes its affinity for the importin α-importin β complex (using ΔIBB importin α as a model) as well as its affinity for importin α alone (26Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). For an NLS to function in nuclear import, one might hypothesize that it must have an affinity for the importin α-β complex that is tight enough to stimulate the uptake of the NLS cargo in the cytoplasm, but it must also have an affinity for lone importin α that is weak enough to allow efficient release of the cargo into the nucleus. Thus, we might hypothesize that there are both upper and lower limits to the affinity of an NLS for its receptors that define a functional localization signal. Here, we report the results of our initial experiments designed to address the correlation between in vitro binding energies and in vivo import function. We quantify the relative import rates of various NLSs in live yeast cells by measuring the steady-state distribution of the NLS-bearing cargo protein. These measurements are used to estimate the rate of nuclear import for transport cargoes containing various NLS sequences. Our results indicate that there is a complicated but monotonic quantitative relationship between the affinity of an NLS for the import receptors and the steady-state accumulation of the cargo in the nucleus. Construction of Plasmids—All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2. NLS-GFP fusion proteins were expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the MET25 promoter using the plasmid pGFP-C-FUS (33Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The NLS-GFP fusion proteins expressed in yeast were identical to the proteins expressed in Escherichia coli for in vitro binding studies (26Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) except that the first 17 residues of the N terminus were removed, including the N-terminal His6 tag, to facilitate expression in yeast. The DNA sequences encoding the SV40-GFP fusion were amplified from the bacterial expression vector (26Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) using the DNA oligonucleotide GCTCTAGATGGGCAGCCATATGGCTAG as a 5′-primer and the oligonucleotide ACTCATCTCGACGGTATCG as the 3′-primer. The DNA encoding the SV40-GFP fusion protein was then ligated into the yeast expression vector pGFP-C-Fus (33Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) using XbaI and ClaI restriction sites, placing the gene as an in-frame 5′ fusion with a second GFP molecule encoded in the vector DNA (pAC1065). The fidelity of the resulting vector was confirmed by sequencing and by appropriate expression of the target protein in yeast. Other NLS sequences were placed in this vector by PCR amplification and then ligated into the SV40-GFP-GFP vector using XbaI and HindIII. Removal of the His6 tag, and the addition of a second GFP created a molecule that could not be directly analyzed in vitro by quantitative fluorescence anisotropy to assure that neither modification altered the binding affinity for the NLS receptor. This is due to the fact that the modified protein could no longer be easily purified (due to the removal of the His6 tag) and was too large for anisotropy measurements (due to the addition of a second GFP). However, the sequences surrounding the NLS and linking the NLS to GFP were identical to those in the comparable molecules analyzed in vitro (26Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Even if there is any minor change in the binding constants, we assume that all variants would be affected in the same manner and thus all our measurements, which are relevant to one another, would still provide significant insight into how binding to the NLS receptor correlates with import. NLS-reporters carrying a single copy of the GFP protein were constructed from the NLS-GFP-GFP reporter plasmids by digesting with SalI, then performing an intramolecular ligation with the resulting large fragment, which excises the second GFP open reading frame.TABLE 2Yeast strains and plasmids used in studyStrain/plasmidDescriptionReferencesACY192 (wild-type)MATa ura3-52 leu2Δ1 trp153Winston F.

After verification by sequencing, this new vector, GFP-Not, was then amplified with primers GTCCGGCGTAGAGGATCGAG at the 5′-end and GCGCCTCGAGTTAGGACCCGGACCCTATGTCCAAGCCTGCGAGTTTCAGTGCCAGGGCGGCCGCGGAGGAGCCGG, which added the NES sequence to the 3′-end of the GFP gene after the NotI site. This PCR fragment was again cut with HindIII and XhoI and ligated into pET28a. After verification by sequencing, the DNA fragment encoding GFP-NES was then excised using HindIII and XhoI. This fragment was then ligated into each yeast NLS reporter expression plasmid cut with the same enzymes creating NLS-GFP-NES reporters with unique NLS sequences that could be expressed in yeast. Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described elsewhere (34Koepp D.M. Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1163-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To detect Myc-tagged importin α or the NLS-GFP reporter, Myc (EMD Bioscience) and GFP antibodies (35Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were diluted 1:3000 and incubated with fixed cells overnight at 4 °C. The Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:1000) were incubated with cells for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were also labeled with DAPI (1 μg/ml) to mark the position of the nucleus. Samples were viewed through a Texas Red-optimized filter and a GFP-optimized filter (Chroma Technology) using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. Direct fluorescence microscopy was used to localize GFP fusion proteins in live cells. For all experiments, cells were incubated with DAPI to visualize the DNA and confirm the location of the nucleus. The localization of the fusion protein was monitored by directly viewing the GFP signal in living cells through a GFP-optimized filter as described for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Imaging—For imaging, yeast cells (ACY192) transformed with the NLS-GFP vectors were grown to mid-log phase in media lacking methionine (for a list of yeast strains used, see Table 2). Standard fluorescence and DIC images were collected using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. Quantitative interpretation of the wide field fluorescence images were not accurate due to out of focus light and the lack of calibrated excitation sources. Thus, for quantitative analysis cells were imaged using a customized two-photon microscope with calibrated excitation and photon-counting emission detectors. The inherent three-dimensional resolution of two-photon microscopy provides an important advantage for resolving the fluorescence signal in the nucleus or the cytoplasm (36So P.T. Dong C.Y. Masters B.R. Berland K.M. Annu. Rev Biomed Eng. 2000; 2: 399-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 37Denk W. Strickler J.H. Webb W.W. Science. 1990; 248: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8079) Google Scholar). For two-photon microscopy yeast cells were harvested by gentle centrifugation and then resuspended in a small volume of media. The cells were transferred to a 35-μl plastic depression dish (Sitting Drop Bridges from Hampton Research). Vacuum grease was applied to the edges surrounding the depression, and then a glass slide was applied over the depression, sealing it through the grease. The slide assembly was then inverted, and the yeast were allowed to gently settle against the glass coverslip. The slide was then placed on the two-photon microscope for imaging. Image Analysis—Two-photon images were sectored into nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments through a semi-automated procedure using the programs Mathematica (Wolfram Research) and Corel Photopaint (Corel). For each image, the average fluorescence per pixel was calculated for the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Multiple three-dimension-resolved axial sections were imaged for each cell, and the automated sorting procedures were developed to avoid vacuolar regions as well as to ensure that compartment edges were avoided and did not play a role in the measured average signal levels. NLS-GFP Import Assay—The NLS-GFP import assay was performed as described previously (38Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to early mid-log phase in synthetic media containing 2% glucose (w/v) at 30 °C, pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of glucose-free synthetic media containing 10 mm sodium azide, 10 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. The cells were then pelleted, washed with 1 ml of ice-cold ddH2O, repelleted, resuspended in 100 μl of glucose-containing synthetic media pre-warmed to 30 °C, and incubated at 30 °C. For scoring, 2-μl samples were removed every 2.5 min following resuspension in pre-warmed glucose-containing synthetic media. Individual cells were analyzed and counted using a GFP-optimized filter (Chroma Technology) using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope. Cells w"

TGFβ1 caused recruitment of ALK1 into a complex with endoglin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Therefore, we examined TGFβ receptor-dependent phosphorylation of endoglin by the constitutively active forms of the TGFβ type I receptors ALK1, ALK5, and the TGFβ type II receptor, TβRII. Of these receptors, TβRII preferentially phosphorylated endoglin on cytosolic domain serine residues Ser634 and Ser635. Removal of the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide of endoglin, which comprises a putative PDZ-liganding motif, dramatically increased endoglin serine phosphorylation by all three receptors, suggesting that the PDZ-liganding motif is important for the regulation of endoglin phosphorylation.

Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar). TGFβ type I/II receptors are serine and threonine (S/T) kinases, although the significance of the serine-versus threonine-phosphorylating activities of the TGFβ receptors is not clear. The TGFβ type I receptors include activin-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and TβRI, also known as ALK5. ALK1 and ALK5 associate with the type II TGFβ receptor, TβRII (2Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S.

The binding of TGFβ ligands by TβRII induces the type I receptor to associate with TβRII, allowing the latter to phosphorylate the type I receptor and activate its kinase domain (3Vivien D. Wrana J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The activated type I receptor propagates signaling by phosphorylating the Smad family of transcription corepressors and coactivators (4ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem.

Phosphorylation of human endoglin occurs in endothelial cells and mouse fibroblasts (8Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Grimsby S. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. J. Biol.

These studies demonstrate that endoglin is phosphorylated on serine (9Lastres P. Martin Perez J. Langa C. Bernabeu C. Biochem.

Immunol. 2005; 17: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TβRII and ALK5 interact with endoglin, and, as a result of these associations, endoglin is phosphorylated on its cytosolic domain (CD) (7Guerrero-Esteo M. Sánchez-Elsner T. Bernabeu C. J. Biol.

No previous studies have identified the specific endoglin residues that were phosphorylated, examined the kinase specificities of different TGFβ receptors toward endoglin, or addressed the physiological consequences of endoglin phosphorylation.

Constitutively active (ca) forms of the TGFβ type I receptors (13Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) have been widely used to examine TGFβ receptor signaling (14Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S.

Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we analyzed endoglin phosphorylation by TβRII and the constitutively active forms of ALK1 (Q201D) (caALK1) and ALK5 (T204D) (caALK5). Our data indicated that threonine phosphorylation of endoglin was a distinguishing consequence of its interaction with caALK1 versus caALK5. We provide evidence that endoglin is a direct kinase substrate for caALK1, which preferentially phosphorylated mature endoglin on threonine residues, as compared with caALK5. Examination of endoglin cytosolic domain deletion mutations indicated that phosphorylation of endoglin is tightly regulated by the putative carboxyl-terminal PDZ-liganding tripeptidyl motif. Site-specific mutagenesis studies revealed that serine phosphorylation is required for threonine phosphorylation and that phosphorylation occurred preferentially on endoglin residues Thr640 and Thr654. TGFβ1 treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced formation of a complex containing endogenous endoglin and ALK1, with attendant incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP and threonine phosphorylation of endoglin. Finally, in HUVECs, wild-type (Wt) endoglin, but not a threonine phosphorylation-defective mutant, rescued cell detachment and the anti-proliferative effects of caALK1 and exhibited caALK1-dependent exit from a focal adhesion (FA)-associated pool of proteins. Mutations in endoglin (18McAllister K.A. Grogg K.M. Johnson D.W. Gallione C.J. Baldwin M.A. Jackson C.E. Helmbold E.A. Markel D.S. McKinnon W.C. Murrell J. McCormick M.K.

The data presented suggest the hypothesis that ALK1-dependent threonine phosphorylation of endoglin comprises a shared molecular signature of HHT1 and HHT2. Antibodies and Cytokines—TGFβ1 was obtained from R&D Systems. Anti-endoglin antibody P4A4 (20Pichuantes S. Vera S. Bourdeau A. Pece N. Kumar S. Wayner E.A. Letarte M. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 50: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (NICHD, National Institutes of Health), University of Iowa. Anti-endoglin clone 35 was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-human ALK1 was kindly provided by A. Lux (Mannheim, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoserine (α-pSer) and anti-phosphothreonine (α-pThr) antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories. Goat anti-TGFβ type III receptor antibody (sc-6199), and rabbit and mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA, Y-11 clone) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Covance (Mono HA 11 and MMS-101P). Expression Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human HA-tagged ALK1 constructs (Q201D and K229R), HA-caALK5 (T204D), and HA-TβRII originated in the Massague laboratory (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, NY). Human endoglin in the pcDNA3.1 vector was subjected to site-specific mutagenesis using the QuikChange (Stratagene) system, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of all mutated constructs were confirmed. Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—HEK293T cells (ATCC) and GM7372 bovine endothelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or α minimal essential medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HUVECs were cultured in EBM-2 medium containing EGM-2 complete supplement (Cambrex). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using the GeneJuice® transfection reagent (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and were lysed, ∼48 h after transfection, in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate), and were supplemented with protease (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase (Calbiochem) inhibitor cocktails. All lysates were normalized for total protein by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) prior to immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4°C using the P4A4 anti-endoglin antibody. The resulting immune complexes were isolated with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Purification of focal adhesion-associated protein was conducted using RGD-labeled paramagnetic microspheres according to a modification (21Conley B.A. Koleva R.I. Smith J.D. Kacer D. Zhang D.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Protein isolations were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and Western blotted using the indicated antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Protein Isolation, Digestion, and Mass Spectrometry—Immunoprecipitated endoglin expressed in HEK293T cells (8 × 107 cells) was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (BDH Chemicals), and the band corresponding to endoglin was excised and immediately processed. All solvents used for mass spectrometry were high-performance liquid chromatography grade (Sigma). Excised gel slices were digested sequentially by trypsin, followed by Glu-C protease, and the resulting peptides were isolated using the Montage In-Gel Digest Kit (Millipore), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After digestion, the peptides were pooled and dried under vacuum in a SpeedVac. The peptide mixtures were desalted using a Poros R2 micro column as described (23Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and eluted directly into a nanospray needle (New Objective). HUVECs (5 × 107 cells) were transduced with endoglin and caALK1 adenoviruses (below). After 48 h, endoglin was immunoprecipitated as described above. Protein elution was performed in 50 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NH4HCO3, and 1% SDS at 100 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted 5× with 50 mm NH4HCO3, and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in the dark with 100 mm iodoacetamide. Buffer exchange was performed against 50 mm NH4HCO3 on 5-kDa cut-off spin filters (Ultrafree-MC, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Proteins were digested with 10 μg of Glu-C (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) for 18 h at room temperature in 50 μl of NH4HCO3 on top of the spin filter. The resulting peptides were eluted through the filter membrane in three steps, 30 μl each, using 20%, 50%, and 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid. After lyophilization peptide acidic groups were converted to their corresponding methyl esters, followed by enrichment of phosphorylated peptides via immobilized metal affinity chromatography as previously described (24Ficarro S. Chertihin O. Westbrook V.A. White F. Jayes F. Kalab P. Marto J.A. Shabanowitz J. Herr J.C. Hunt D.F. Visconti P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11579-11589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were directly eluted onto a reversed-phase microcapillary high-performance liquid chromatography pre-column (360-μm outer diameter × 100-μm inner diameter, fused silica, 8-cm bed length, 10- to 25-μm irregular-shaped C18 particles) and rinsed with 50 μl of 0.1% acetic acid. Next, the precolumn was connected directly to a reversed-phase microcapillary high-performance liquid chromatography analytical column (360-μm outer diameter × 50-μm inner diameter, fused silica, 8-cm bed length, 5-μm spherical-shaped C18 particles) and integrated with a 1-μm diameter electrospray emitter tip. Peptides were eluted online with a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QSTAR, MDS-SCIEX, Toronto, Canada) using a solvent gradient of 0–50%B in 30 min and then 50–90%B in 10 min, where solvent A was 0.2 m acetic acid and solvent B was 70% acetonitrile with 0.2 m acetic acid. Data acquisition on the mass spectrometer was performed in information-dependent mode, whereby precursor peptides were automatically selected based on an MS-only scan and subjected to collision-activated dissociation (MS/MS) in subsequent scans. These data were searched against a protein data base using the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Science, London, UK), with manual verification of high scoring endoglin peptides. In Vitro Kinase Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and, 48 h later, extracted with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 300 mm sucrose, 1% Triton X-100), which was supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. The cell lysates were incubated with P4A4 anti-endoglin antibody for 3 h. The protein complexes were subsequently isolated using protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In vitro kinase assays were conducted in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na2VO4) in the presence of 100 μm cold ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at room temperature (25Huse M. Muir T.W. Xu L. Chen Y.G. Kuriyan J. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by washing with kinase buffer, followed by addition of SDS sample buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried. In vitro kinase assay of endogenous endoglin and ALK1 isolated from HUVECs was conducted as described above with or without prior TGFβ1 treatment. Incorporation of 32P-phosphate was visualized by autoradiography or quantitated using a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant Adenoviral Vectors—The adenoviral vectors expressing caALK1, kinase-dead (kd)ALK1, Wt endoglin, and ΔThr5 endoglin were prepared from the respective cDNA clones. The coding sequences for caALK1 and kdALK1 were excised from the parental pCMV5 vector by sequential BamH1/HindIII cleavage and ligated to BamH1/HindIII-cut pAdLox (26Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Anton M. Graham F.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4600-4606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wt and ΔThr5 endoglin were excised from parental pcDNA3.1 vector with EcoRI. The ends were blunted with the Klenow large fragment of DNA polymerase and subsequently cloned into BamH1/HindIII-cut and blunt-ended pAdLox. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing caALK1, kdALK1, Wt endoglin, and ΔThr5 endoglin were generated as previously described (26Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For an infectious control, we used an analogous adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase. Cell Proliferation Analysis—HUVEC (passage 10 or less) proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay (28Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The assays were performed by seeding 7.5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates in triplicate in HUVEC medium, described above. Preliminary HUVEC caALK1 adenovirus infection experiments were conducted to establish the minimum plaque forming units (pfu) required to achieve 80–90% loss of HUVEC viability in the absence of other adenovirus-transduced genes. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were infected with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (based on pfu determination) of 60–300, and incubated for an additional 24 h. The cells were then given culture medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine, and incubated an additional 24 h. The cells were lysed, and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckmann). Endoglin Is Constitutively Serine-phosphorylated on Residues Ser634 or Ser635—The 48-amino acid l-isoform (29Bellon T. Corbi A. Lastres P. Cales C. Cebrian M. Vera S. Cheifetz S. Massague J.

Therefore, we initially used a mass spectrometric approach to facilitate identification of sites of endoglin phosphorylation. Wt endoglin was expressed in HEK293T cells, immunoprecipitated, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The band corresponding to endoglin was excised and subjected to sequential trypsin and Glu-C proteolytic digestion (30Steen H. Kuster B. Mann M. J. Mass. Spectrom. 2001; 36: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Initial mass spectrometric analysis of endoglin tryptic/Glu-C phosphopeptides obtained from transfected HEK293T cells revealed an ion potentially matching the singly phosphorylated peptide EPVVAVAAPASSE. This result was consistent with data suggesting that the central serine-rich ASSESSS motif of the endoglin is serine-phosphorylated (Ref. 31Tang H. Low B. Rutherford S.A. Hao Q. Blood. 2005; 105: 1977-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and data not shown). Next, a Glu-C digest of immunoprecipitated transduced endoglin in HUVECs, which were also transduced with caALK1, was used to further study the phosphorylation of endoglin. Mass spectra of putatively singly (Fig. 1A) and doubly (Fig. 1B) phosphorylated peptides were obtained. Expanded regions of the time-of-flight mass spectrum showed the triply charged ions of singly and doubly phosphorylated species of 637SSSTNHSIGSTQSTPCSTSSMA658. Analysis with mass spectrometry suggested at least double phosphorylation between serines 639 and 656, but spectra from tandem mass spectrometry were ambiguous as to the exact sites. The lack of basic residues within the sequence resulted in an incomplete fragmentation pattern. We cannot discount the presence of multiply phosphorylated isoforms, because collectively these peptides may nearly co-elute, making it difficult to resolve distinct phosphorylated species. However, these results suggested the presence of basal phosphorylation sites within the 634SS635 motif, and additional sites were phosphorylated by transduced caALK1 in the 637SSSTNHSIGSTQSTPCSTSSMA658 region. Based on these data, we under-took site-directed mutagenesis of the endoglin CD. Serine Phosphorylation by TβRII: Regulation by the PDZ-liganding Motif of Endoglin—We employed an α-pSer antibody Western blotting strategy to independently monitor changes in endoglin phosphorylation by the TGFβ receptors. First, a diseryl-to-alanyl (634AA635) mutation was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of endoglin residues Ser634 and Ser635. Because preliminary studies indicated that an endoglin deletion mutation lacking the carboxyl-terminal PDZ liganding motif (ΔPDZ (21Conley B.A. Koleva R.I. Smith J.D. Kacer D. Zhang D. Bernabeu C.

Western blotting using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2, fourth panel) demonstrated that the type I/II receptors were associated with endoglin and equivalently co-immunoprecipitated, indicating that the ability of endoglin to interact individually with TβRII, caALK1, and caALK5 was independent of the endoglin cytosolic domain mutation tested. Western blot analysis demonstrated serine phosphorylation of Wt endoglin only by TβRII (Fig. 2, panel 1, lane 3). Basal and TβRII-dependent phosphorylation were restricted to the mature glycosylated extracellular form of Wt endoglin (32Lux A. Gallione C.J. Marchuk D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Paquet M.E. Pece-Barbara N. Vera S. Cymerman U. Karabegovic A. Shovlin C. Letarte M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1347-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), because no serine phosphorylation was detected on the endoglin precursor (panel 1, lanes 2 and 3). Both basal (Fig. 2, panel 1, lane 2 versus 6) and TβRII-dependent serine phosphorylation of endoglin were nearly eliminated in the 634AA635 endoglin protein (lane 3 versus 7), confirming the mass spectrometry data and demonstrating that these residues were the predominant sites phosphorylated by TβRII. Under the conditions employed, neither caALK1 nor caALK5 resulted in endoglin serine phosphorylation above basal levels, indicating that over-expression of these receptors did not force the phosphorylation of endoglin. A striking increase in serine phosphorylation of endoglin was detected for all three kinases as a result of removal of the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide in the ΔPDZ construct (Fig. 2, panel 1, lanes 11–13). In contrast to Wt endoglin, phosphorylation of ΔPDZ endoglin occurred on both the low and high mobility endoglin polypeptides. Basal serine phosphorylation of ΔPDZ endoglin in the absence of added receptors was also increased. Receptor-dependent serine phosphorylation of ΔPDZ endoglin was not affected by the introduction of the 634AA635 mutation in the ΔPDZ construct (lanes 15–17), although a reduction in the basal level of phosphorylation of the 634AA635-ΔPDZ construct was evident (lanes 10 versus 14). To obtain independent structural confirmation that the anti-pSer antibody detected phosphorylation of endoglin by the co-expressed receptors, Western blots were reprobed using an anti-TβRIII antibody (α-TβRIII). This antibody was raised following immunization with a non-phosphorylated synthetic peptide that encompasses a conserved β-glycan carboxyl-terminal epitope, and is highly cross-reactive with the homologous non-phosphorylated endoglin CD epitope (see legend, Fig. 3A) (34Meurer S.K. Tihaa L. Lahme B. Gressner A.M. Weiskirchen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Western blotting showed roughly equivalent α-TβRIII antibody reactivity for low and high mobility forms of endoglin expressed in the absence of exogenous receptor as compared with the α-endoglin antibody (Fig. 2, panel 2, lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14). The partially glycosylated form of Wt endoglin (32Lux A. Gallione C.J. Marchuk D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed little or no difference in reactivity to the α-TβRIII antibody, regardless of the presence of co-expressed exogenous caALK1, caALK5, or TβRII, consistent with the lack of α-pSer antibody reactivity of the high mobility form of Wt endoglin. In contrast, the mature form of Wt endoglin demonstrated nearly complete loss of reactivity with the α-TβRIII antibody in the presence of caALK1 and TβRII (panel 2, lanes 3 and 4, respectively), although caALK5 caused incomplete loss of α-TβRIII antibody reactivity (panel 2, lane 5). This result suggested that caALK1 phosphorylated endoglin, although not necessarily on serine residues. The antibody reactivity for Wt versus ΔPDZ endoglin, probed with the α-TβRIII antibody, was indist"

To identify chromosomal alterations associated with hepatocarcinogenesis, we performed allelic gene dosage analysis on 36 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Data from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays were analysed using the Genome Imbalance Map (GIM) algorithm, which simultaneously detects DNA copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events. Genome Imbalance Map analysis identified allelic imbalance regions, including uniparental disomy, and predicted the coexistence of a heterozygous population of cancer cells. We observed that gains of 1q, 5p, 5q, 6p, 7q, 8q, 17q and 20q, and LOH of 1p, 4q, 6q, 8p, 10q, 13q, 16p, 16q and 17p were significantly associated with HCC. On 6q24–25, which contains imprinting gene clusters, we observed reduced levels of PLAGL1 expression owing to loss of the unmethylated allele. Finally, we integrated the copy number data with gene expression intensity, and found that genome dosage is correlated with alteration in gene expression. These observations indicated that high-resolution GIM analysis can accurately determine the localizations of genomic regions with allelic imbalance, and when integrated with epigenetic information, a mechanistic basis for inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene in HCC was elucidated."

In the present study, we have investigated if the antiapoptotic function of PKCϵ is mediated via Akt and the mechanism by which PKCϵ regulates Akt activity. TNF caused a transient increase in Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in MCF-7 cells. Overexpression of PKCϵ in MCF-7 cells increased TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 resulting in its activation.

The presence of antiapoptotic proteins can counteract TNF-induced apoptosis. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases that consist of at least 10 isozymes (7Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). PKC isozymes have distinct and in some cases opposing roles in cell growth and apoptosis (8Brodie C. Blumberg P.M.

In addition, breast cancer cells containing a high level of PKCϵ were sensitized to TNF by PKC inhibitor (14Basu A. Mohanty S. Sun B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the level of PKCϵ was not sufficient to explain breast cancer cell sensitivity to TNF (14Basu A. Mohanty S. Sun B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Akt, also known as PKB, the cellular homologue of oncogene v-Akt, is a family of serine/threonine kinases (15Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Akt is activated in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner and inhibited by phosphatase and tensin homologue tumor suppressor PTEN. Phosphorylation at both Thr308 in the activation loop and Ser473 in the C-terminal domain of Akt is necessary for its complete activation (16Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) phosphorylates Akt at Thr308 (17Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P.

The kinase that phosphorylates Ser473 of Akt has been tentatively designated PDK2. It has also been reported that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 may be mediated by PDK1, autophosphorylation, intergrin-linked kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (15Andjelkovic M.

Recent evidence suggests that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 may be mediated by the rictor-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex or DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (20Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5334) Google Scholar, 21Feng J. Park J. Cron P. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

DNA-PK, a member of the PI3K-related kinase subfamily of protein kinases, is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated upon DNA damage (22Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). It is a three-protein complex consisting of a 470-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the regulatory DNA binding subunits, Ku heterodimer (Ku70 and Ku80) (22Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). The C terminus of DNA-PKcs is similar to PI3K family members, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene, ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene-related, and p110 PI3K (23Hartley K.O. Gell D.

However, DNA-PKcs acts as a protein kinase not a lipid kinase (23Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). DNA-PK plays an important role in DNA repair and protects cells from apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation, UV radiation, and etoposide (24Cowell I.G. Durkacz B.W. Tilby M.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 71: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Hennequin C. Giocanti N. Averbeck D. Favaudon V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32520-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A recent report suggests that DNA-PKcs can also colocalize with Akt on the cell membrane and phosphorylate Akt at Ser473 in a PI3K-dependent manner (21Feng J. Park J. Cron P. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41189-41196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Although Akt plays a critical role in cell survival, the involvement of DNA-PK in the antiapoptotic function of Akt has not been investigated. Akt is constitutively active in many types of human cancers, including breast cancer (27Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). TNF has been shown to cause activation of Akt through phosphorylation at Ser473 in murine fibrosarcoma WEHI-164 cells (28O'Toole A. Moule S.K. Lockyer P.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There have been several reports that suggest that PKCϵ may regulate Akt activity (29Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Furukawa K. Ono Y. Takahashi M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14400-14406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKCϵ by dominant-negative PKCϵ was associated with inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by insulin, demonstrating that PKCϵ activity was required for Akt phosphorylation. However, wild-type PKCϵ had no effect on insulin-induced Akt activation (29Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Furukawa K. Ono Y. Takahashi M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14400-14406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Akt has been reported to be a downstream effector of PKCϵ for ethanol-induced cardioprotection because ethanol consumption caused an increase in expression and activity of PKCϵ and Akt, and inhibition of PKCϵ prevented the increase in Akt activity (30Zhou H.-Z. Karliner J.S. Gray M.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H165-H174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It is not known how PKCϵ activates Akt. Furthermore, it remains to be established whether the antiapoptotic function of PKCϵ is mediated by Akt. We made a novel observation that PKCϵ activates Akt by enhancing interaction between DNA-PK and Akt, resulting in phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. Thus, PKCϵ acts upstream of Akt to regulate antiapoptotic signaling in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we report for the first time that DNA-PK can regulate the extrinsic or receptor-initiated cell death pathway via activation of Akt.

Activation of Akt Protects Breast Cancer MCF-7 Cells against TNF-induced Cell Death—We have previously shown that PKCϵ acts as an antiapoptotic protein, but the level of PKCϵ alone was not sufficient to explain its antiapoptotic function (9Basu A. Lu D. Sun B. Moor A.N. Akkaraju G.R. Huang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41850-41856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since Akt/PKB is an important antiapoptotic protein, we first wantedtodeterminewhetherthestatusofAktinfluencesantiapoptotic function of TNF. MCF-7 cells overexpress Akt, but they contain low levels of constitutively active phospho-Akt, presumably because these cells express PTEN. Therefore, we introduced hemagglutinin-tagged constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt) in MCF-7 cells using adenoviral vector. Fig. 1A shows that transduction of adenovirus containing CA-Akt resulted in an increase in Akt in MCF-7 cells as detected by Akt and hemagglutinin antibody. Overexpression of CA-Akt decreased TNF-induced apoptosis as evident by the cleavage of 116-kDa full-length PARP to an 85-kDa form. We quantified TNF-induced apoptosis using Annexin V/PI dye binding assay. We have calculated the total percentage of cell death that included both Annexin V-positive cells as well as PI- and Annexin V-positive cells since we cannot distinguish late apoptotic cells from necrotic cells (Fig. 1B). Treatment with TNF resulted in 45% cell death in MCF-7 cells infected with control vector compared with 13% cell death in MCF-7 cells overexpressing CA-Akt (Fig. 1B). Thus, the ability of TNF to induce cell death was compromised in CA-Akt overexpressing cells compared with vector-infected MCF-7 cells. PKCϵ Acts Upstream of Akt to Regulate TNF-induced Akt Activation—We have previously shown that overexpression of PKCϵ protects breast cancer MCF-7 cells from TNF-induced apoptosis (9Basu A. Lu D. Sun B. Moor A.N. Akkaraju G.R. Huang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41850-41856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCϵ has any effect on TNF-induced Akt activation, we compared the ability of TNF to induce Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells transfected with either an empty vector (MCF-7/Neo) or vector containing wild-type PKCϵ (MCF-7/PKCϵ). As indicated in Fig. 2, TNF induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in both MCF-7/Neo and MCF-7/PKCϵ cells in a time-dependent manner. The maximum increase in Akt phosphorylation was evident following treatment with TNF for 30 min. In contrast, TNF had little effect on the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 site. The extent of Akt phosphorylation was greater in MCF-7/PKCϵ cells compared with MCF-7/Neo cells during the entire time course. To further evaluate the effect of TNF on Akt kinase activity, we immunoprecipitated Akt from MCF-7/Neo and MCF-7/PKCϵ cells with immobilized antibody against Akt and performed in vitro kinase assay using GSK3α/β fusion protein as the substrate (Fig. 3A). The extent of GSK3α/β phosphorylation was determined by densitometric scanning of immunoblots. Fig. 3B shows that TNF induced 1.7-fold stimulation in Akt activity in MCF-7/Neo cells by 30 min. Overexpression of PKCϵ increased basal Akt activity and TNF caused a time-dependent increase in Akt activity; the maximum Akt activation (3-fold) was achieved following treatment with TNF for 30 min. These results indicate that PKCϵ may act upstream of Akt to enhance Akt activation by TNF. To further examine whether PKCϵ is required for Akt phosphorylation/activation by TNF, we depleted endogenous PKCϵ using PKCϵ-specific siRNA from Dharmacon (PKCϵ1) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (PKCϵ2). Fig. 4 shows that both siRNAs against PKCϵ caused substantial decrease in PKCϵ content but had no effect on the levels of other PKC isozymes, such as PKCδ or PKCα. Knockdown of PKCϵ decreased TNF-induced Akt activation but did not affect Akt protein content (Fig. 4). These results suggest that PKCϵ activity was required for TNF-induced Akt activation. Expression of Constitutively Active Akt Restores Cell Survival in PKCϵ-depleted Cells—To examine whether Akt functions downstream of PKCϵ to mediate antiapoptotic signaling, we depleted PKCϵ by siRNA and monitored TNF-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Fig. 5A shows that knockdown of PKCϵ alone caused an increase in cell death from 12% to 21%, and it enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis from 45 to 54%. We then examined whether overexpression of CA-Akt prevents TNF-induced apoptosis in PKCϵ-depleted cells. CA-Akt attenuated TNF-induced apoptosis to 24% in control siRNA transfected cells and to 35% in PKCϵ-depleted cells (Fig. 5B). The average of several independent experiments is shown in Fig. 5B. Thus, CA-Akt partially restored cell survival in PKCϵ-depleted cells. Knockdown of Akt Inhibits the Antiapoptotic Effect of PKCϵ—To further examine if Akt functions downstream of PKCϵ, we depleted Akt using Akt-specific siRNA in both MCF-7/Neo and MCF-7/PKCϵ cells. We have used either Dharmacon SMARTpool, which is a combination of four siRNAs (Fig. 6A) or individual siRNA from Dharmacon siRNA1(Akt1) or siRNA2(Akt2) (Fig. 6B). Fig. 6, A and B, show that depletion of Akt enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis as evident by the increase in PARP cleavage. While overexpression of PKCϵ inhibited TNF-induced PARP cleavage, knockdown of Akt restored sensitivity of MCF-7/PKCϵ cells to TNF. Dharmacon SMARTpool is a mixture of four different siRNAs targeted at distinct sites and has minimum off-target effect that may be associated with targeting of high concentrations of single siRNA to a specific site. Therefore, unless otherwise mentioned, we primarily used Dharmacon SMARTpool in our experiments. We also quantified cell death by Annexin V/PI dye binding assay. Fig. 6C shows that knockdown of Akt alone caused appearance of apoptotic cells in both MCF-7/Neo and MCF-7/PKCϵ cells. When cells were transfected with control siRNA, TNF caused 55% cell death in MCF-7/Neo cells, and overexpression of PKCϵ attenuated TNF-induced apoptosis to 12.6%. However, TNF-induced apoptosis was equivalent in both MCF-7/Neo and MCF-7/PKCϵ cells when Akt was depleted with siRNA (Fig. 6C). Thus, depletion of Akt abrogated the antiapoptotic effect of PKCϵ, suggesting that Akt acts downstream of PKCϵ. Akt Associates with PKCϵ and DNA-PK—To examine whether PKCϵ directly interacts with Akt, we performed coimmunoprecipitation. MCF-7/Neo and MCF-7/PKCϵ cells treated with 1 nm TNF were immunoprecipitated with either Akt or PKCϵ antibody, and then Western blot analyses were performed using PKCϵ or Akt antibody, respectively. Fig. 7 shows that PKCϵ was constitutively associated with Akt in PKCϵ-overexpressing cells, and TNF enhanced association of Akt with PKCϵ. We also examined whether DNA-PK, a recently identified PDK2, was involved in PKCϵ-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. Association of Akt with DNA-PK was detected in both control and PKCϵ-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7). PKCϵ did not directly interact with DNA-PK but it increased the association between Akt and DNA-PK modestly. These results suggest that PKCϵ may activate Akt by enhancing the interaction between DNA-PK and Akt. Depletion of DNA-PKcs Inhibits Akt Phosphorylation and Antiapoptotic Function of Akt and PKCϵ—To determine whether PKCϵ phosphorylates Akt via DNA-PK, we depleted DNA-PKcs using siRNA from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (DNA-PK1) or Dharmacon (DNA-PK2). Fig. 8A shows that knockdown of DNA-PKcs depleted DNA-PKcs but did not affect the expression of another member of the PI3K family, PI3K110β in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 8A). Depletion of DNA-PK inhibited TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7 (Fig. 8A) and MCF-7/Neo and MCF-7/PKCϵ cells (Fig. 8B). To determine the functional significance of DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of Akt on its antiapoptotic function, we compared TNF-induced apoptosis in cells transfected with either control siRNA or siRNA targeted against DNA-PKcs. Fig. 9A shows that knockdown of DNA-PKcs enhanced TNF-induced PARP cleavage in MCF-7/Neo cells. While overexpression of PKCϵ inhibited TNF-induced PARP cleavage, depletion of DNA-PKcs partially restored TNF sensitivity in PKCϵ-overexpressing cells. Similar results were obtained when we monitored apoptosis using Annexin V/PI dye binding assay (Fig. 9B). These results suggest that PKCϵ may mediate its antiapoptotic function by regulating TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation via DNA-PK. The ability of apoptotic stimuli to induce cell death is counteracted by the presence of antiapoptotic proteins. The PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in cell survival. We have shown before that a member of the novel PKC family, namely PKCϵ, acts as an antiapoptotic protein during TNF-induced cell death (9Basu A. Lu D. Sun B. Moor A.N. Akkaraju G.R. Huang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41850-41856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated whether there is any cross-talk between these two important signaling molecules. We have made several important and novel observations. We have demonstrated that PKCϵ acts upstream of Akt/PKB to exert its antiapoptotic function. First, overexpression of PKCϵ increased Akt phosphorylation and activity in response to TNF. Second, depletion of PKCϵ abrogated TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation and activation. Third, knockdown of Akt abolished the antiapoptotic effect of PKCϵ. We also demonstrated that the activation of Akt by PKCϵ is mediated by DNA-PK, and depletion of DNA-PKcs reversed the antiapoptotic function of PKCϵ during TNF-induced apoptosis. The observation that inhibition of DNA-PK can reverse antiapoptotic signaling by Akt and PKCϵ establishes a new role for DNA-PK in the extrinsic cell death pathway. Several studies have reported that PKC acts upstream of Akt (16Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 29Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Furukawa K.

J. 2002; 363: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but there are controversies as to whether PKC is a positive or negative regulator of Akt. For example, Doornbos et al. (32Doornbos R.P. Theelen M. van der Hoeven P.C.J. van Blitterswijk W.J. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8589-8596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have shown that Akt and PKC did not influence the activity of respective kinases, but growth factor-induced activation of Akt was abolished by PKCζ. In contrast, PKCα and -ζ were shown to negatively regulate Akt phosphorylation/activity even though these isozymes are considered prosurvival proteins (33Mao M. Fang X. Lu Y. Lapushin R. BAST R.C.J. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 43Li L. Sampat K. Hu N. Zakari J. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3237-3243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). nPKCθ has also been shown to interact with Akt but this interaction had no effect on the phosphorylation of PKC or Akt (34Bauer B. Krumbock N. Fresser F. Hochholdinger F. Spitaler M. Simm A. Uberall F. Schraven B. Baier G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31627-31634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 44Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKCϵ by dominant-negative PKCϵ was associated with inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by three different stimuli, whereas other PKC isozymes had no effect, demonstrating that PKCϵ activity was required for Akt phosphorylation (29Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Furukawa K. Ono Y. Takahashi M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14400-14406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, how Akt and PKC cooperate with each other depends on the extracellular stimulus as well as on the cell type. We have previously shown that overexpression of PKCϵ attenuated TNF-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (9Basu A. Lu D. Sun B. Moor A.N. Akkaraju G.R. Huang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41850-41856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the status of PKCϵ alone could not explain TNF sensitivity/resistance (14Basu A. Mohanty S. Sun B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For example, although SKBR-3 and CAMA-1 breast cancer cells contained low levels of PKCϵ, they were highly resistant to TNF (14Basu A. Mohanty S. Sun B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We reasoned that multiple signaling pathways that exist in a cell type might decide the final outcome of cell death or survival. Cells that were resistant to TNF contained constitutively active Akt (45Lu D. Huang J. Basu A. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 671-676PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether PKCϵ and Akt trigger parallel survival pathways or if PKCϵ acts upstream of Akt or vice versa. It was difficult to genetically manipulate SKBR-3 and CAMA-1 cells. Since MCF-7 cells express both Akt and PKCϵ, we manipulated these kinases at the molecular level to directly demonstrate how these two signaling pathways interact with each other. We have shown that activation of Akt is an early event following binding of TNF to its cell surface receptors. Complete activation of Akt requires phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 and PDK2, respectively. We have shown that TNF specifically increases phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 site as has been reported earlier (28O'Toole A. Moule S.K. Lockyer P.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of PKCϵ increased both basal and TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation. We also directly determined Akt activity using GSK3α/β as the substrate. Akt activity measured in response to TNF was also increased by PKCϵ overexpression. Furthermore, knockdown of PKCϵ by siRNA abolished TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation/activation. These results provide direct evidence that PKCϵ acts upstream of Akt to regulate its activity. Although there have been several studies that reported Akt may be regulated by PKCϵ, it is not clear how it regulates Akt activity. It has been reported that PKCϵ may serve as a substrate for PDK1, and the mechanism by which kinase-dead PKCϵ inhibited insulin-induced Akt activation was via PDK1 (29Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Furukawa K. Ono Y. Takahashi M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14400-14406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). TNF had no effect on Thr308 phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, presumably because PDK1 was constitutively active in these cells as has been reported earlier (17Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 19: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 46VanHaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Functional proteomics analysis demonstrated that PKCϵ directly interacts with Akt in cardiomyocytes (47Ping P. Zhang J. Pierce Jr., W.M. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We also found that PKCϵ interacts with Akt in MCF-7 cells. Since phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 is mediated by PDK2 and DNA-PK has been recently identified as PDK2 (21Feng J. Park J. Cron P. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41189-41196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we examined the association of Akt and PKCϵ with DNA-PKcs. Although we were unable to detect any direct interaction between PKCϵ and DNA-PKcs, overexpression of PKCϵ caused a modest increase in basal and TNF-induced association between Akt and DNA-PKcs. At present, it is not clear how PKCϵ enhances interaction between DNA-PKcs and Akt. However, increased association of DNA-PKcs with Akt could explain how PKCϵ enhanced Akt activity following treatment of breast cancer cells with TNF. The involvement of DNA-PK during DNA damage-induced apoptosis is well established. DNA-PK is activated in response to DNA damage (22Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) and autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs has been shown to inhibit DNA-PK activity (48Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A link between novel PKCδ and DNA-PK during DNA damage-induced apoptosis has also been demonstrated (49Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PKCδ associates with DNA-PKcs and phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs by PKCδ catalytic fragment inhibits the function of DNA-PKcs to form complexes with DNA (49Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Chen L.B. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We have now shown that PKCϵ can activate Akt/PKB via DNA-PK. Furthermore, depletion of DNA-PKcs by siRNA not only inhibited the ability of PKCϵ to enhance TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation at Ser473, it also reversed the antiapoptotic function of PKCϵ. These results suggest that DNA-PK may also play a critical role in receptor-initiated apoptosis via activation of Akt/PKB. We also determined whether PKCϵ mediates its antiapoptotic function via Akt. Introduction of CA-Akt in MCF-7 cells conferred resistance to TNF. In addition, while knockdown of PKCϵ decreased Akt phosphorylation and enhanced TNF sensitivity, introduction of CA-Akt into PKCϵ-depleted MCF-7 cells partially restored cell survival, indicating that CA-Akt can counteract the effect of PKCϵ depletion. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Akt may function through a PKCϵ-independent pathway. It has been reported recently that these two kinases may function independently on downstream targets (38Venkatesan B.A. Mahimainathan L. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Gorin Y. Bhandari B. Valente A.J. Abboud H.E. Choudhury G.G. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, knockdown of Akt in PKCϵ-overexpressing MCF-7 cells completely abrogated the antiapoptotic activity of PKCϵ, suggesting that the antiapoptotic function PKCϵ is dependent on the presence of Akt. These results provide strong evidence that PKCϵ activates Akt via DNA-PK to inhibit TNF-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Thus, a cross-talk between multiple signaling pathways is an important determinant of cell survival and cell death. Furthermore, although the involvement of DNA-PK during DNA damage-induced apoptosis is well known, we have established a new role for DNA-PK during receptor-initiated apoptosis.

Mutations in the tau gene itself cause frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism, demonstrating the critical role of tau in pathogenesis. Many of these mutations in tau are silent, are found at the 5′-splice site of exon 10, and lead to increased inclusion of exon 10. These silent mutations are predicted to destabilize a stem loop structure at the exon 10 5′-splice site; however, the existence of this stem loop under physiological conditions and its role in splice regulation are controversial. Here we show that base changes that stabilize this stem loop in vitro substantially decrease exon 10 inclusion in a wild type tau minigene and rescue the increase in exon 10 splicing caused by a dementia-causing point mutation. Moreover, we probed the intracellular structure of the tau stem loop with antisense RNA and demonstrate that the stability of the stem loop dictates antisense effectiveness. Together these results validate the stem loop as a bona fide structure regulating tau exon 10 splicing.

Alternative splicing of exon 10 produces tau isoforms with either three (exon 10 missing) or four (exon 10 present) repeat domains, known as 3R and 4R tau, respectively. In the adult human brain, the overall ratio of 4R to 3R tau is generally ∼1.The critical role of tau in neurodegenerative diseases became clear with the discovery that mutations in tau could cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTD-17) (8Hutton M.

Acta. 2005; 1739: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Among these, three are silent mutations in exon 10 (synonymous changes in the nucleotide sequence that do not change the coding of the protein and therefore have no effect on protein function), and seven are found in the intron following exon 10. All these mutations alter the 4R-to-3R ratio, implicating impaired splicing as the mechanism of pathogenesis.The exon-intron interface at the 3′ end of exon 10 displays a high degree of self-complementarity, suggesting the presence of a stem loop (8Hutton M.

Seven of the silent mutations are clustered in this stem loop region, and all result in the disruption of complementarity and predicted destabilization of the stem loop structure. It has been proposed that, as a consequence of destabilization, this region of the mRNA becomes more available for association with the U1snRNP, resulting in increased splicing of exon 10 (8Hutton M.

While these mutations have a profound effect on the ratio of 4R to 3R tau splice isoforms and are at the root of pathogenesis in FTD-17, the exact nature of the stem loop is still unclear.

If the stem loop exists under physiological conditions in vivo as a regulatory element, then stabilizing the stem loop should lead to a decrease in exon 10 splicing. We have made several stem loop variants that increase the thermal stability of the stem loop in vitro and lead to a decrease in exon 10 splicing in vivo. More importantly, we probe the nature of these stem loop variants in cells with an antisense RNA directed against the junction of exon 10 to show that the effectiveness of antisense treatment depends on the stability of the tau stem loop.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Minigenes harboring the tau stem loop variants were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. RNA was isolated 24 h after transfection.Vectors—The coding region for the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene, minus the initiating ATG, with XhoI restriction sites on both the 5′ and 3′ ends, was amplified using the following primers: LucF, 5′-GCCCTCGAGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAGAAA-3′ and LucR, 5′-CGACACTCGAGCACGGCGATCTTTCC-3′. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and ligated in to the Tau-4R vector (17Jiang Z. Tang H. Havlioglu N. Zhang X. Stamm S. Yan R. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The pTK-RL (Promega) vector expresses the Renilla luciferase gene from Renilla reniformis. All mutations in the tau stem loop were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers (nucleotide changes are italicized): DDPAC, 5′-GTGTGAGTACCTTCATACGTCCCATGCGCC-3′, WT-10C, 5′-GCAGTGTGAGTACCCTCACACGTCCCATGC-3′, DDPAC-10C, 5′-GCAGTGTGAGTACCCTCATACGTCCCATG-3′, WT-I-17T, 5′-TGAGTACCTTCACACTGTCCCATGCGCCG-3′, DDPAC-I17T, 5′-TGAGTACCTTCATACTGTCCCATGCGCCG-3′.UV Melting—The six stem loop variant RNAs used in the UV melting experiments had the following sequences: wild type (WT), 2The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcription; TBE, Tris borate-EDTA. 5′-GGCAGUGUGAGUACCUUCACACGUC-3′; DDPAC, 5′-GGCAGUGUGAGUACCUUCAUACGUC-3′; WT-10C, 5′-GGCAGUGUGAGUACCCUCACACGUC-3′; DD-10C, 5′-GGCAGUGUGAGUACCCUCAUACGUC-3′; WT-I-17T, 5′-GGCAGUGUGAGUACCUUCACACUGUC-3′; and DD-I17T, 5′-GGCAGUGUGAGUACCUUCAUACUGUC-3′. These were synthesized by Dharmacon. UV melting experiments were performed as described previously (18Varani L. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Varani G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 710-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA oligonucleotides at a concentration of 1 μm in 150 NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA in 10 mm NaPO4, pH 6.7, were heated at 0.5 °C/min. The absorbance at 260 nm was collected using a Cary UV/VIS spectrophotometer with a temperature controlled heating block. Melting temperatures were calculated as described previously (19Puglisi J.D. Tinoco Jr., I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar).RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells using RNAqueous (Ambion). cDNA synthesis and real time PCR with SYBR Green using the ABI 7700 from Applied Biosystems was performed as described previously (20Donahue C.P. Jensen R.V. Ochiishi T. Eisenstein I. Zhao M. Shors T. Kosik K. Hippocampus. 2002; : 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR to quantify 4R tau mRNA was done using primers directed against exon 10, (5′-GTCCAAGTGTGGCTCAAAG-3′) and luciferase (5′-GCCTTATGCAGTTGCTCTCC-3′) in tau minigene-transfected cell lines. PCR reactions were performed at 60 °C for a combined annealing and extension. Real-time PCR to quantify tau 3R expression was done using primers specific to the exon 9-exon 11 junction (5′-GAGGCGGGAAGGTGCAA-3′) and luciferase. PCR reactions were performed at 64 °C for this set of primers to distinguish between the exon 9-exon 10 junction and the exon 9-exon 11 junction. Non-quantitative PCR was also done with primers specific to exon 9 (5′-GCTCCACTGAGAACCTGAA-3′) and the luciferase primer to visualize both 3R and 4R splice products by PAGE. Samples were run on a 10% TBE-acrylamide gel and visualized by post staining with 0.005% ethidium bromide in 1× TBE buffer.Antisense RNA Treatment of Cells—Twenty-four hours after transfection, HeLa cells expressing the various tau minigene constructs were trypsinized and plated into either 96-well plates for luciferase measurements or 12-well plates for RNA isolation. These cells were then transfected with a 50 nm concentration of either a 2′-O-methyl antisense RNA with a phosphorothioate backbone (5′-UGAAGGUACUCACACUGCCGC-3′) or a randomized 2′-O-methyl RNA with a phosphorothioate backbone (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).Luciferase Measurements—Luciferase and Renilla activity levels were measured using the Dual Glo™ Luciferase Assay System from Promega.RESULTSStabilizing Base Changes Decrease 4R Tau mRNA—In the stem loop-regulated model of tau mRNA splicing, destabilizing FTD-17 mutations lead to an increase in 4R mRNA. Likewise, stabilizing mutations should lead to an increase in 3R mRNA. We tested this supposition with exon trapping experiments based on minigenes previously described that express exons 9–11 and intronic sequences (21Jiang Z. Cote J. Kwon J.M. Goate A.M. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4036-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with either a WT stem loop or one with the FTD-17 DDPAC mutation. This mutation is a C to T change in the +14 position relative to the exon 10 splice donor site (Fig. 1A) and results in nearly exclusive expression of 4R tau mRNA. Base changes that were predicted to increase the stability of the stem loop were made in minigenes containing both the WT and DDPAC mutated stem loops to address the effect of stabilizing the stem loop on tau splicing in vivo.The predicted structure of the tau stem loop has a G:U base pair at the top of the stem (Fig. 1A). To enhance the stability of the loop, this U at position +10 in the intron was changed to a C to generate a G:C pair (WT-10C). This change results in a predicted –1.2 kcal/mol increase in stability. Additionally, the predicted structure of the stem loop has a bulging A in the –3 position in the stem. One nucleotide, T, was inserted into the intron at position +17 (WT-I17T) to create an additional A:U pair in the stem. This additional base pair is predicted to increase stability by –5.3 kcal/mol (Table 1). We also generated these base changes in combination with the DDPAC mutation (DD-10C and DD-I17T) to determine whether the increase in stability conferred by these changes could mitigate the destabilizing effects of the DDPAC +14 mutation and reduce the expression of 4R tau. In addition to the predicted increase in stability the changes at these positions confer, they were selected because they are not located in the splice donor site or in the U1 snRNP binding site and should not interfere with the splicing machinery.TABLE 1Relative stabilities of stem loop variantsStem loop variantPredicted ΔGaPredicted stabilities were calculated with MFOLD (22, 23) for each of the stem loop variants on the identical sequences used in the in vitro melting experiments.Measured Tmkcal/mol°CDDPAC-6.153.9 ± 0.6DD-10C-7.356.2 ± 1.3DD-I17T-11.459.6 ± 0.6WT-8.268.0 ± 1.1WT-10C-9.471.7 ± 1.5WT-I17T-13.573.0 ± 2.2a Predicted stabilities were calculated with MFOLD (22Zuker M.

Open table in a new tab Stem loop RNAs (Fig. 1A) with the sequence changes described above were synthesized, and their melting temperatures, Tm, were determined by UV melting curves (Fig. 1, B and C). The stabilizing base changes increased the melting temperature of the WT stem loop by 3.7 and 5.0 °C for WT-10C and WT-I17T, respectively. Additionally, the DD-10C and DD-I17T sequence changes increased the stability of the DD-Tau stem loop by 2.3 and 5.7 °C, respectively. However, neither of these variants was as stabilizing as predicted by the RNA folding algorithm MFOLD (22Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10094) Google Scholar, 23Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar) (Table 1). For instance, the DD-I17T change is predicted to be more stabilizing than the WT or WT-10C variants, but this is clearly not the case.To test the effects of these base changes on splicing in vivo, we generated tau minigene constructs with the various stem loops described above. These constructs are based on the previously described tau minigene, TauEx9–11wt (21Jiang Z. Cote J. Kwon J.M. Goate A.M. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4036-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The minigenes were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and total RNA was isolated from transfected cells. Relative 3R and 4R mRNA levels were measured using real-time PCR with primers specific to the 3R and 4R splice isoforms, and the ratio of 4R to 3R was calculated (Fig. 2B). The relative ratio of 4R to 3R tau mRNA can be seen in Fig. 2C where semi-quantitative RT-PCR products were separated on a 10% TBE-acrylamide gel.FIGURE 2Stabilization of the stem loop reduces the 4R to 3R ratio. HeLa cells were transfected with minigenes (A) that expressed each of six tau stem loops. Quantitative RT-PCR (B) revealed that the ratio of 4R to 3R tau was reduced to the extent that the mutations stabilized the stem loop. C, relative amounts of 4R and 3R PCR products reflect the ratio of tau 4R and 3R isoforms quantitated by RT-PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The linear model of tau splicing regulation proposes that the +14 DDPAC mutation leads to an increase in 4R due to disruption of a binding site for an intronic splicing silencer (10D'Souza I.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26587-26599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here the effect of the +14 mutation on splicing is suppressed in the same rank order as the Tm of the stem loop variants. Additionally, the ratio of 4R to 3R directly correlates (r2 = 0.75, p < 0.05) with the predicted stabilities of the stem loop variants, with the 10C and I17T mutations having the strongest suppressive effects on exon 10 splicing.Antisense Inhibition of Splicing Depends on the Stability of the Stem Loop—It has been previously reported that an antisense RNA directed against the splice donor site of exon 10 inhibits exon 10 splicing and leads to an increase in 3R tau mRNA (24Kalbfuss B. Mabon S.A. Misteli T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42986-42993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We used this antisense RNA to probe the stability of the stem loop in vivo. The antisense RNA binding site is from –8 to +13 relative to the splice site. The stem loop sequences as defined here span from positions –6 to +19. If the stem loop folds in vivo then the antisense RNA will need to compete with the RNA structure for binding (25Toulme J.J. Tinevez R.L. Brossalina E. Biochimie. (Paris). 1996; 78: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26Toulme J.J. Di Primo C. Moreau S. Sczakiel G. Tinevez R.L. Brossalina E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The more stable the structure, the less accessible the splice site is to binding by the antisense RNA, resulting in reduced antisense effectiveness in preventing splicing.To quantitate the effects of antisense treatment on tau mRNA splicing, we constructed a splicing reporter based on the minigenes previously described above. In our modified construct, the P. pyralis luciferase cDNA is ligated to the 3′ end of exon 11. This construct has been designed to act as a reporter for 4R tau mRNA; the luciferase is only in frame when exon 10 is present. Additionally, the luciferase cDNA cloned into the minigene lacks it own translation initiating ATG and depends on an initiating ATG in exon 9 for expression. Therefore, luciferase acts as a reporter only when splicing has occurred. When transiently transfected into HeLa cells, this construct produces 4R and 3R in a ratio similar to what is observed in the adult brain (data not shown).HeLa cells were transiently transfected with each of the six stem loop variants for 24 h. Transfected cells were then trypsinized, replated, and transfected with 50 nm of a 2′-O-methyl antisense RNA with a phosphorothioate backbone, which had been previously shown to inhibit the inclusion of exon 10 in tau mRNA (24Kalbfuss B. Mabon S.A. Misteli T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42986-42993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Transfection of the antisense RNA resulted in a decrease in luciferase expression relative to cells transfected with a 50 nm concentration of a randomized control oligoribonucleotide (Fig. 3A). All cells were replated to the same density and transfected from the same batch of antisense RNA-Lipofectamine complex to ensure that all cell lines were treated the same. The degree to which luciferase levels were decreased correlated (r2 = 0.78, p < 0.05) with increasing stability of the tau stem loop. The more stable the stem loop is, the less effective is the antisense treatment.FIGURE 3Antisense RNA inhibition of exon 10 splicing correlates with stem loop stability. Antisense RNA directed against the intron-exon junction of exon 10 inhibits the inclusion of exon 10 in the mRNA. A, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for 4R tau expression for each of the 6 variants and then treated with antisense RNA. Luciferase levels decrease in cells treated with antisense RNA (filled columns) relative to cells treated with a randomized RNA (open columns). The degree to which luciferase levels decrease correlates with stem loop stability. B, this result is more evident when the ratio of 3R to 4R mRNA is measured using quantitative PCR on RNA collected from antisense treated cells (filled columns) relative to cells treated with a randomized RNA (open columns). C, PCR products of untreated (UT), antisense (AS), and random RNA (RN) treated cells are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the resulting increase in luciferase was in fact due to the conversion of 4R mRNA to 3R mRNA, real-time RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from the transfected cells. The resulting PCR products confirmed that the increase in luciferase is due to a dramatic increase in the 3R to 4R ratio of splice isoforms relative to cells transfected with the randomized oligoribonucleotide (Fig. 3, B and C). These results revealed a strong correlation between the antisense-induced changes in the 3R to 4R ratio and stem loop stability (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.01). Antisense inhibition of exon 10 inclusion is most effective against the least stable stem loop (the DDPAC minigene).DISCUSSIONSynonymous and intronic mutations found in and around exon 10 that cause FTD-17 clearly increase the inclusion of exon 10 in tau mRNA in vivo. However, uncertainty remains regarding the stem loop regulation model of tau mRNA alternative splicing. We provide here strong evidence that exon 10 splicing is substantially regulated by a stem loop structure that forms from sequences at the end of exon 10 and the beginning of the following intron. The ratio of 4R to 3R mRNA levels in cells strongly correlates with the measured melting temperatures of these stem loop variants in vitro. If this region of the pre-mRNA were strictly an unstructured protein binding site, this correlation would not be expected. In fact, the putative stabilizing mutations would be expected to have the same effect as putative destabilizing mutations, altering the sequence of the binding element. In particular, the I17T base insertion is within the defined intronic splicing silencer where most of the FTD stem loop mutations are found (10D'Souza I. Poorkaj P. Hong M. Nochlin D. Lee V.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26587-26599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results, however, do not exclude the possibility that the stem loop structure itself is a protein binding site.Interestingly, previous attempts to correlate stability with 3R expression have not been conclusive (13Grover A.

In this report, the stabilities of the stem loops were not measured experimentally. We show here that measuring the actual Tm values of the stem loop variants is critical to evaluating the relative effectiveness of the stabilizing changes. In designing the stem loop variants studied here, we used the program MFOLD (22Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10094) Google Scholar, 23Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar) to predict the free energy of each of the structures. We found that the predicted free energies of the structures differed substantially from the relative experimentally measured melting temperatures of the stem loops. The predicted free energies of both the DD-10C and the DD-I17T structures suggested they would be nearly as stable and substantially more stable, respectively, than the WT stem loop. However, measured melting temperatures for these structures revealed that they were both less stable than the WT RNA. The in vivo ratio of 4R to 3R reflected these measured Tm values rather than the predicted free energies of these structures.We provide further evidence that the stem loop structure exists in vivo by demonstrating that the effectiveness of antisense RNA inhibition of exon 10 splicing is dependent on the stability of the stem loop structure. It has long been recognized that the structural nature of the target mRNA can have a dramatic effect of the efficacy of antisense RNA, and this effect is predictable (27Sczakiel G. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Vickers T.A. Wyatt J.R. Freier S.M.

https://openalex.org/W1983973807,"Mammalian Aurora-A is related to a serine/threonine protein kinase that was originally identified by its close homology with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ipl1p and Drosophila melanogaster aurora that are key regulators in the orchestration of mitotic events. The protein level of Aurora-A, its peak kinase activity during mitosis, and its activation have been attributed to phosphorylation. Here we show that this enzyme is an arginine-directed kinase and define its substrate specificity. We also found that Thr288 within the activation loop is a critical residue for activating phosphorylation events in vitro and that it is spatiotemporally restricted to a brief window at mitosis on duplicated centrosomes and on spindle microtubules proximal to the poles in vivo. Immunodepletion assays indicated that an upstream kinase(s) of Aurora-A might exist in mammalian cells in addition to autophosphorylation. Furthermore, human activated Aurora-A forms complexes with the negative regulator protein serine/threonine phosphatase type 1 (PP1) that was negatively phosphorylated on Thr320.

https://openalex.org/W1970330258,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, APO-2L) is a mediator of cell death that preferentially targets cancer cells. The potential of TRAIL as a chemotherapeutic agent is limited, however, because of the emergence of TRAIL resistance. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that alternative TRAIL signaling is unmasked in TRAIL resistant cells. In these cells, the predominant effect of TRAIL receptor activation is the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which promotes tumor metastases and invasion. TRAIL resistance can occur at the level of the death inducing signaling complex via upregulation of cFLIP or via an increase in antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. A paradigm emerges from this information, that chemotherapy, targeting NF-κB, cFLIP, or antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, in combination with TRAIL maybe more rational than TRAIL therapy alone."
https://openalex.org/W2127057890,"Ras oncogenes are frequently mutated in thyroid carcinomas. To verify the role played by N-ras in thyroid carcinogenesis, we generated transgenic mice in which a human N-ras(Gln61Lys) oncogene (Tg-N-ras) was expressed in the thyroid follicular cells. Tg-N-ras mice developed thyroid follicular neoplasms; 11% developed follicular adenomas and ∼40% developed invasive follicular carcinomas, in some cases with a mixed papillary/follicular morphology. About 25% of the Tg-N-ras carcinomas displayed large, poorly differentiated areas, featuring vascular invasion and forming lung, bone or liver distant metastases. N-ras(Gln61Lys) expression in cultured PC Cl 3 thyrocytes induced thyroid-stimulating hormone-independent proliferation and genomic instability with micronuclei formation and centrosome amplification. These findings support the notion that mutated ras oncogenes could be able to drive the formation of thyroid tumors that can progress to poorly differentiated, metastatic carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2068522128,"Osteoclasts differentiate from hematopoietic mononuclear precursor cells under the control of both colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1, or M-CSF) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL, or TRANCE, TNFSF11) to carry out bone resorption. Using high density gene microarrays, we followed gene expression changes in long bone RNA when CSF-1 injections were used to restore osteoclast populations in the CSF-1-null toothless (csf1tl/csf1tl) osteopetrotic rat. We found that ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1, or GPR68) was strongly up-regulated, rising >6-fold in vivo after 2 days of CSF-1 treatments. OGR1 is a dual membrane receptor for both protons (extracellular pH) and lysolipids. Strong induction of OGR1 mRNA was also observed by microarray, real-time RT-PCR, and immunoblotting when mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells and RAW 264.7 pre-osteoclast-like cells were treated with RANKL to induce osteoclast differentiation. Anti-OGR1 immunofluorescence showed intense labeling of RANKL-treated RAW cells. The time course of OGR1 mRNA expression suggests that OGR1 induction is early but not immediate, peaking 2 days after inducing osteoclast differentiation both in vivo and in vitro. Specific inhibition of OGR1 by anti-OGR1 antibody and by small inhibitory RNA inhibited RANKL-induced differentiation of both mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells and RAW cells in vitro, as evidenced by a decrease in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts. Taken together, these data indicate that OGR1 is expressed early during osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in vitro and plays a role in osteoclast differentiation.

The catabolic removal of bone during skeletal formation and remodeling requires the specialized activity of multinucleated osteoclasts. Osteoclasts differentiate by fusion of hematopoietic mononuclear precursors in response to systemic and local signals, in particular colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1, 2The abbreviations used are: CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor 1; OGR1, ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor 1; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; BMC, bone marrow mononuclear cells; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand; siRNA, small inhibitory RNA; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; SPC, sphingophosphorylcholine; NFATc1, nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBSA, PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin; tl, toothless; CCL5, CC chemokine ligand 5. or M-CSF) and the tumor necrosis factor family member receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL, or TRANCE, TNFSF11) (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). Excessive osteoclast activity systemically leads to osteopenias such as osteoporosis, whereas local hyperactivity can lead to osteolysis as seen in tumor metastases to bone or in prosthesis loosening. Hypoactivity of osteoclasts can lead to sclerosing bone disorders, for example in genetic conditions such as osteopetrosis. Osteoclast differentiation is a complex process that requires the coordinated action of many gene products, including not only extrinsic factors such as CSF-1 and RANKL, which are supplied by osteoblasts locally in bone tissue, but also intrinsic factors required for osteoclast function. Mononuclear precursors must migrate to sites where resorption is needed, fuse to form multinucleated pre-osteoclasts, and attach firmly to bone. They develop highly specialized cellular structures, including an actin ring that forms a tight seal with the bone surface, and a highly convoluted plasma membrane domain called the ruffled border, which is the site of extremely active transport of ions, proteins, and membrane-bounded vesicles. The resorption lacuna underlies the osteoclast and is the site of bone removal. Mineral is dissolved by the low pH achieved by ATPase proton pumps, and the proteinaceous extracellular matrix is degraded by proteases. The digested bone is taken up by the osteoclast by endocytosis and exits the opposite side of the cell via transcytosis (2Salo J. Lehenkari P. Mulari M. Metsikko K. Vaananen H.K. Science. 1997; 276: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Differentiation of osteoclasts from precursors takes roughly 4 days in vivo (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Many of the genes needed for this complex process have been identified through studies of osteopetrotic animal models and human osteopetrotic patients (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar, 4Balemans W. Van Wesenbeeck L. Van Hul W. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2005; 77: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One such model is the toothless (tl) rat, in which a frameshift mutation in the csf1 gene results in severe osteopetrosis in homozygous mutants due to a nearly complete lack of osteoclasts (5Dobbins D.E.

Injections of recombinant CSF-1 restore osteoclast populations within several days in this animal model (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We studied gene expression changes by high density microarray in the long bones of CSF-1-treated csf1tl/csf1tl rats over a time course. We previously reported on chemokine and chemokine receptor expression in this model (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report on expression of ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor-1 (OGR1) (GenBank™ accession XP_234483), which underwent rapid response to CSF-1 injections in the tl rat. OGR1 is a member of a family of four known G-protein-coupled receptors with wide expression that selectively bind both protons and bioactive lipids and act through Gi and Gq proteins (7Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 8Tomura H. Mogi C. Sato K. Okajima F. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1466-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). OGR1 was initially cloned from an ovarian cancer cell line (9Xu Y. Casey G. Genomics. 1996; 35: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and its ability to bind the bioactive lipid sphingophosphorylcholine (SPC) was shown in transfection studies (10Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Those authors showed that SPC binding to OGR1 resulted in increased intracellular Ca2+ and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and the internalization of OGR1. Although that report was recently withdrawn over concerns of falsified data by one of the authors (11Xu Y. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 299PubMed Google Scholar), others have gone on to show that SPC is a legitimate OGR1 ligand (12Mogi C. Tomura H. Tobo M. Wang J.Q. Damirin A. Kon J. Komachi M. Hashimoto K. Sato K. Okajima F. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 99: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A proton binding, pH-sensing activity of OGR1 was subsequently demonstrated and shown to depend on several His residues that reside in the extracellular domains of this seven-pass transmembrane protein (7Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). OGR1 expression was identified in human osteosarcoma cells and osteoblast precursor cells as well as in rat osteoblasts and osteocytes in situ, leading those authors to propose a role for the receptor in pH homeostasis via skeletal metabolism. Despite these efforts, a clear biological function of OGR1 has yet to emerge. Recent work found that SPC antagonized the pH response of stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and, further, that low extracellular pH caused an increase not only in phospholipase C (measured as inositol phosphate production) but also in cAMP, presumably via adenylyl cyclase acting through Gs proteins (12Mogi C. Tomura H. Tobo M. Wang J.Q. Damirin A. Kon J. Komachi M. Hashimoto K. Sato K. Okajima F. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 99: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a recent report (13Komarova S.V. Pereverzev A. Shum J.W. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2643-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), OGR1 was found to be up-regulated in RAW264.7 pre-osteoclast-like cells in response to RANKL. That report also showed that reduction of extracellular pH in osteoclasts resulted in nuclear translocation of NFATc1, a downstream mediator of RANKL differentiation effects, although no specific physiological role for OGR1 in that process was demonstrated. Thus, although much remains to be learned about the actions of OGR1 in vivo, there is very suggestive evidence that it may mediate, at least in part, the role of the skeleton in pH homeostasis. In our screens of gene expression changes during osteoclastogenesis in long bones of CSF-1-treated toothless osteopetrotic rats, we noted that OGR1 mRNA increased sharply during the early phase of osteoclast differentiation, i.e. during the first 48 h. This is prior to the appearance of significant numbers of mature, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts in long bones and coincides with early events in osteoclastogenesis such as the production of the chemokine CCL9 by committed mononuclear precursors (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have investigated the expression of OGR1 during osteoclast differentiation, and we report that interference with OGR1 by antibody or siRNA causes significant decreases in osteoclast differentiation. This represents the first demonstration of biological activity for OGR1 in such a complex cellular process. Animals and Tissue Samples—Procedures involving animals were carried out under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Restoration of osteoclasts in tl/tl rats was done by CSF-1 injections as described (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3-week-old csf1tl/csf1tl rats were obtained from the inbred colony maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Mutants were genotyped by neonatal x-ray and by PCR (6Van Wesenbeeck L. Odgren P.R. MacKay C.A. D'Angelo M. Safadi F.F. Popoff S.N. Van Hul W. Marks Jr., S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14303-14308Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Beginning at 21 days after birth, animals received daily injections of 106 units of recombinant human CSF-1 (generously provided by Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA). At appropriate time points, tibiae and femora were harvested. For RNA extraction, bones were carefully dissected to remove extraneous connective tissue and muscle; joint cartilage and epiphyseal growth plates were also removed, leaving the metaphysis and diaphysis. Bones were split longitudinally and flushed with cold PBS to remove as much marrow as possible, although in untreated and 2-day-treated mutants, no discernible marrow spaces had formed. Dissected bones were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for later RNA extraction (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Mouse mononuclear bone marrow cells (BMC) were isolated and cultured as described (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Yang M. Odgren P.R. Cytokine. 2005; 31: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, marrow cell suspensions were centrifugally fractionated on Histopaque 1077 (Sigma) and plated in low CSF-1 (10 ng/ml, human recombinant CSF-1; Chiron) in α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). After allowing stromal cells to adhere overnight, non-attached cells were collected and plated in high CSF-1 (75 ng/ml). After 3 days, the medium was removed along with non-attached cells, and new medium containing CSF-1 (75 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added. Differentiation into osteoclasts was scored 3 days later by counting multinucleated (three or more nuclei) TRAP-positive cells. TRAP staining was done as described (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 pre-osteoclast-like cells were obtained from ATCC and plated at a density of 0.5–0.6 × 104 cells/well on 96-well polystyrene plates (Corning, Corning, NY) grown in the same medium as BMC but lacking CSF-1. Differentiation was induced by adding RANKL (100 ng/ml) and allowing 2–4 days to differentiate. In some experiments, osteoclast differentiation was modulated by addition of rabbit polyclonal anti-OGR1 antibody. Two different antibodies were tested, with essentially identical results (affinity purified, LifeSpan Biosciences, Seattle, WA; ammonium sulfate fraction, ExAlpha Biologicals, Watertown, MA) at concentrations of 1 and 2 μg/ml at the same time as RANKL was added. Negative controls consisted of an irrelevant antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-CCL5 (affinity purified; Peprotech), and an ammonium sulfate fraction of non-immune rabbit serum (ExAlpha). At least six replicate wells were counted in at least two independent experiments by two different people for each experimental condition. In these experiments, greater sensitivity and reproducibility of the antibody effect was obtained with a lower concentration of RANKL, 33 ng/ml. Immunofluorescence—RAW 274.7 cells were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates with or without RANKL; after 60 h, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min followed by two rinses in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 2 min and rinsed twice with PBS followed by a 10-min incubation in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (PBSA; Sigma). Rabbit polyclonal anti-OGR1 (Lifespan) was diluted 1:20 in PBSA and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with fixed cells (or with just PBSA for negative controls). Following four rinses in PBSA, coverslips were incubated with secondary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 fluorochrome (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were rinsed twice with PBSA, once with PBS + 5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole + 0.1% Triton X-100, and once with PBS. Cells were mounted on Antifade Gold (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained with a Zeiss Axiophot with a ×100 objective, equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam HR camera and Zeiss Axiovision software. Exposures times were 400 μs for the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole wavelength and 800 μs for Alexa 488. Immunoblots—CytoBuster reagent (Novagen, La Jolla, CA) was used to extract proteins from RAW 264.7 and BMC with and without RANKL treatment for 48 h. Protein was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts per lane were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE minigels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore, Billerica, MA) using a semidry transfer device (Owl Scientific, Cambridge, MA). After blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, rabbit polyclonal anti-OGR1 antibody (X1600P; ExAlpha) diluted 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% milk was added, and the blot was incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Following washes in Tris-buffered saline, goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad) was added, followed by more Tris-buffered saline washes. The blots were developed with Attoglow chemiluminescent substrate (Michigan Diagnostics, Troy, MI). RNA Extraction and Microarray Analysis—Each time point was measured in each of four animals using RNA from cleaned limb bones (one tibia and one femur) as described (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen bones were pulverized in a Bessler mortar and pestle cooled with dry ice, and RNA was extracted from the bone powder using TRIzol (Invitrogen). After extraction, RNA was processed for microarray analysis according to Affymetrix instructions. RNA was cleaned using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), reverse transcribed (Superscript; Invitrogen), and transcribed in vitro to make cRNA with biotin incorporated (ENZO RNA in vitro transcript kit, Farmingdale, NY). The cRNA was then subjected to limited alkaline hydrolysis before hybridization with the DNA microarrays. High density microarray analysis was done using the RAE230 rat chipset (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This set represents some 30,200 different cDNA sequences on two chips. For each chipset, we tested RNA from a single animal. Chip image files were obtained through Affymetrix GeneChip software (MAS5). Subsequently D-Chip (www.biostat.harvard.edu/complab/dchip/) analysis was performed to analyze differentially expressed genes, and further analyses were done using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Expression levels are means for four individual animals, given in relative units. Microarray screens were also done on differentiating mouse BMC and RAW 264.7 cells following essentially the same procedures but using the mouse chipset MOE 430. In those screens, only a single chipset was used for each experimental condition. siRNA Transfection Experiments—Proliferating RAW 264.7 cells were plated as above. The next day, cells were transfected with siRNA using siIMPORTER (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's specifications and treated with 100 ng/ml RANKL. The control (siRNA Silencer Negative Control 1 siRNA) was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). The two siRNAs targeted for OGR1 were obtained from Invitrogen: Gpr68-MSS215573, 5′-UAACAAUUCAGGUUCCUCGCCCUGG-3′ (“si 73”), and Gpr68-MSS215574, 5′-UAGAAAGCAAGCCAGGAAGAUGACC-3′ (“si 74”). Forty-eight hours after transfection, total RNA was extracted from some wells and analyzed for OGR1 mRNA using real-time RT-PCR. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, other wells were stained for TRAP activity (Sigma) and assayed microscopically for the total number of TRAP-positive cells/well with three or more nuclei. The counts were done by two individuals, and the results were pooled. Each experimental condition was tested in six replicate wells for each siRNA, and experiments were carried out three separate times. Results for each well were expressed as “percent siRNA control,” and the data from the three experiments were pooled. Real-time PCR—RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed, and real-time RT-PCR was carried out as described (14Yang M. Odgren P.R. Cytokine. 2005; 31: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To assess any effects of transfection, etc., on cell viability or vigor, we compared total RNA yield/well. Cell counts are problematic due to the fact that cells were fusing, so counts do not reflect the health of the culture. In all experimental conditions compared in this report, the total RNA yield/well was ±10% control values. Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissue using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The cDNA was used as template for real-time PCR analysis. Reactions were set up in microcapillary tubes using 1 μl of cDNA with 9 μl of a Light-Cycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I mix (Roche Diagnostics) to which gene-specific upstream and downstream PCR primers had been added. The final concentrations of the reaction components were 1.0 μm of each primer. Analysis was performed in a LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers for OGR1, obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), were 5′-AAAGCCAATCAGTGTGGGTATGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGATCTAGGCATCACTGGTGGTA-3′ (reverse). Values were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-GACCCCTTCATTGACCTCAAC (forward) and 5′-TACTCAGCACCGGCCTCACC-3′ (reverse). Statistical Tests—Data were analyzed using statistical functions in Microsoft Excel and are shown as mean ± 1 S.D. F-tests were done to determine whether variances were equal using a p < 0.05 cutoff for significance. Following that, t-tests were performed for significance of differences in sample means, again with a cutoff of p < 0.05. OGR1 mRNA in tl/tl Osteopetrotic Rat Long Bones following CSF-1 Treatments—Toothless (csf1tl/csf1tl) osteopetrotic rats lack osteoclasts due to an inactivating frameshift mutation in the csf1 gene (5Dobbins D.E. Sood R. Hashiramoto A. Hansen C.T. Wilder R.L. Remmers E.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1114-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Van Wesenbeeck L. Odgren P.R. MacKay C.A. D'Angelo M. Safadi F.F. Popoff S.N. Van Hul W. Marks Jr., S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14303-14308Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Injections of CSF-1 restore osteoclast populations, with a few TRAP-positive cells first appearing in long bones 2 days after initiation of CSF-1 treatments and reaching a peak at 4 days (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We analyzed RNA isolated from tibiae and femora of CSF-1-treated tl/tl rats by high density microarray analysis to identify genes differentially regulated during this rapid burst of osteoclast differentiation in vivo. One of the genes that showed a striking and rapid response to CSF-1 was OGR1. On the rat arrays, OGR1 was represented by an expressed sequence tag from the 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA, GenBank™ accession BM389005. As shown in Fig. 1, OGR1 mRNA in long bone RNA increased rapidly, reaching a peak nearly 7-fold higher than in untreated csf1tl/csf1tl mutants. Starting at a baseline level of 256 ± 20 relative units (mean ± S.D.), it rose to 1717 ± 748 relative units following 2 days of CSF-1 injections. This dropped slightly to 1273 ± 410 relative units on day 4 and to 782 ± 197 relative units on day 6. All these differences were highly significant compared with the baseline value (p < 0.01) and were verified by real-time RT-PCR (not shown). We showed previously that osteoclast counts in long bones followed a later time course, peaking on day 4 (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the peak in OGR1 precedes the peak in osteoclast counts by 2 days. OGR1 Expression during Osteoclast Differentiation in Vitro—Because long bones are complex tissues, we sought to identify the cellular source of the large increase in OGR1 mRNA. We found only low levels of OGR1 mRNA in cultured calvarial osteoblasts (data not shown). The timing of the rise paralleled that seen for other molecules that act early in osteoclast differentiation, such as the chemokine CCL9 and its receptor CCR1 (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated increases seen in vivo in differentiating cultures of osteoclasts, both in mouse primary bone marrow mononuclear cells and in the pre-osteoclast-like mouse cell line RAW 264.7. Microarray analysis was performed on RNA isolated from differentiating cultures after 2 and 4 days of exposure to RANKL, and the results are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. In this screen a single chipset was used per condition, so no statistics are given. The mRNA increases were confirmed at the protein level by Western blots (Fig. 2C) of BMC and RAW cell protein extracts without (–) and with (+) 48 h of RANKL exposure. The specificity of the antibody is shown in the left panel of Fig. 2C, which gave a single band in all extracts tested (RAW cells shown); the increases in OGR1 protein in both cell types is shown in the right panel. RANKL induced a 6-fold rise in OGR1 mRNA in BMC by 2 days and dropped to roughly 5-fold by 4 days of RANKL treatment. In RAW 264.7 cells, OGR1 mRNA increased ∼2-fold in response to RANKL and remained elevated through day 4. Thus, the rise in OGR1 mRNA seen in total long bone RNA could be reproduced using isolated osteoclast lineage cells. Subsequent real-time RT-PCR confirmed the results for RAW 264.7 cells (see time course in Fig. 3) and for BMC (data not shown).FIGURE 3Time course of OGR1 induction by RANKL. RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to RANKL for the number of hours shown, and OGR1 mRNA levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Differences were statistically significant at 2, 24, 48, and 96 h (p < 0.05, *; p < 0.005, **; p < 0.01, ***; p < 0.05, *; respectively). Mean + 1 S.D. is shown, n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A next question was whether the rise in OGR1 mRNA was an immediate response to RANKL signaling or required other downstream events before its expression increased. We therefore measured OGR1 mRNA in RAW 264.7 cells by real-time RT-PCR in response to RANKL over a 96-h time course, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The increase in OGR1 mRNA at 2 h was statistically significant (p < 0.05), but slight. At 24 h, it was roughly 2-fold above baseline (p < 0.005), at 48 h, ∼4-fold above baseline (p < 0.01), and at 96 h, ∼2.5-fold greater than baseline (p < 0.05). This is consistent with OGR1 not being an immediate target of RANKL signaling. OGR1 Protein in Differentiating RAW Cells—We performed indirect immunofluorescence on differentiating RAW 264.7 cells to examine the induction and distribution of OGR1 protein; the results are shown in Fig. 4. Cells incubated with RANKL for 60 h were strongly labeled by anti-OGR1 antibody, whereas in cells not treated with RANKL the signal was consistently weaker (compare panels C and D), consistent with the Western blots. In Fig. 4D, a large, multinucleated osteoclast can be seen with high OGR1 in the cytoplasm and in the lamellipodial extensions (open arrows). Negative controls without anti-OGR1 gave no signal whether RANKL was added or not (Fig. 4, A and B). Also, we routinely observed mononuclear cells in RANKL-treated wells with very high levels of OGR1 (Fig. 4D, solid arrows), consistent with OGR1 being an early event not dependent upon mononuclear cell fusion or later maturation events. A Role for OGR1 in Osteoclast Differentiation—The peak in OGR1 mRNA in long bones preceded that for the osteoclast marker TRAP mRNA and the appearance of mature, TRAP-positive osteoclasts by a full 2 days (3Yang M. MacKay C.A. Mason-Savas A. Aubin J. Odgren P.R. Blood. 2006; 107: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We also saw strong expression in mononuclear RAW cells after RANKL treatment (Fig. 4). This suggested a role in early steps of osteoclast differentiation and not simply in late stage function required for actual bone resorption. We therefore undertook inhibition studies in differentiating cultures of murine BMC and RAW 264.7 c"

Current antiresorptive therapies can reduce osteoclastic activity but have only limited capacity to stimulate osteoblastic bone formation and restore lost skeletal mass. Likewise, the availability of effective pharmacological weight loss treatments is currently limited. Here we demonstrate that conditional deletion of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y2 receptors can prevent ongoing bone loss in sex hormone-deficient adult male and female mice. This benefit is attributable solely to activation of an anabolic osteoblastic bone formation response that counterbalances persistent elevation of bone resorption, suggesting the Y2-mediated anabolic pathway to be independent of sex hormones. Furthermore, the increase in fat mass that typically occurs after ovariectomy is prevented by germ line deletion of Y2 receptors, whereas in male mice body weight and fat mass were consistently lower than wild-type regardless of sex hormone status. Therefore, this study indicates a role for Y2 receptors in the accumulation of adipose tissue in the hypogonadal state and demonstrates that hypothalamic Y2 receptors constitutively restrain osteoblastic activity even in the absence of sex hormones. The increase in bone formation after release of this tonic inhibition suggests a promising new avenue for osteoporosis treatment.

The increase in bone formation after release of this tonic inhibition suggests a promising new avenue for osteoporosis treatment. With age, changes in endocrine function can significantly affect physiological processes often with detrimental effects on health. One of the most substantial changes occurs with menopause in women, with cessation of estrogen production by the ovaries. This abrupt and dramatic decrease in estrogen production results in a number of acute and long term physiological effects, among the most notable of these being the loss of bone leading to the development of osteoporosis and increased deposition of white adipose tissue, contributing to an increased risk of heart disease and associated complications. In the adult skeleton, bone mass and strength are determined by the multicellular process of bone remodeling, in which osteoclastic bone resorption is followed by osteoblastic bone formation. This turnover process is normally tightly coupled, such that the amount of bone resorbed equals the amount of bone formed, maintaining a constant bone mass. Multiple endocrine factors regulate turnover, in particular the sex hormones estrogen and testosterone, which protect bone by exerting anti-apoptotic effects on osteoblasts and pro-apoptotic effects on osteoclasts, in addition to suppressing osteoclast activity through both direct and indirect mechanisms (1Manolagas S.C. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar, 2Manolagas S.C. Kousteni S. Jilka R.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2002; 57: 385-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Loss of sex hormones following menopause in women or in hypogonadal males results in increased osteoclast activity and loss of bone mass. Most current osteoporosis treatments inhibit bone resorption; however, although these treatments reduce further deterioration, they are unable to stimulate bone formation to replace bone that has already been lost, leaving osteoporotic patients with significantly weakened bones and at risk of further fragility fractures. Hence, there is a clear need to develop anabolic therapies, which can reverse bone loss by stimulating osteoblastic bone formation. Recent work demonstrated that disruption of a central regulatory circuit in skeletally mature mice by conditional deletion of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y2 receptors produced a rapid bone gain, associated with increased osteoblast activity and bone formation (3Baldock P.A. Sainsbury A. Couzens M. Enriquez R.F. Thomas G.P. Gardiner E.M. Herzog H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), identifying a novel central regulator of bone metabolism while providing persuasive evidence of the potential utility of this anabolic pathway for osteoporosis treatment. The Y2 receptor also has an important role in the regulation of body weight, with Y2 receptor knock-out attenuating the obesity syndrome of hypogonadal, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (4Sainsbury A. Schwarzer C. Couzens M. Herzog H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3420-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 5Naveilhan P. Svensson L. Nystrom S. Ekstrand A.J. Ernfors P. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1087-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The increase in body fat mass following menopause contributes to an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (6Poehlman E.T. Toth M.J. Gardner A.W. Ann. Intern.

This increase in adipose tissue is associated with a corresponding increase in levels of the Y2 receptor ligand neuropeptide Y (NPY) 3The abbreviations used are: NPY, neuropeptide Y; WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; MS, mineralizing surface; BFR, bone formation rate; MAR, mineral apposition rate; AAV, adeno-associated virus.

Thus Y2 receptors may play an important role in two of the major endocrine consequences of sex hormone deficiency, bone loss and adipose accumulation. As there are no oral selective Y2 receptor antagonists available, the therapeutic potential of Y2 receptor ablation on body weight and bone cell function was investigated by using surgical gonadectomy to induce sex steroid-deficient bone loss in male and female mice in combination with germ line or hypothalamic deletion of Y2 receptors. Our results clearly demonstrate a protection against gonadectomy-induced changes in adipose mass and a significant protection against further bone loss induced by activation of the Y2-mediated central anabolic response. Generation of Germ Line and Conditional Y2 Receptor Knockout Mice—Animal experiments were approved by the Garvan Institute of Medical Research Animal Research Authority and were conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Germ line and conditional knock-out mice were generated and genotyped as described previously (3Baldock P.A. Sainsbury A. Couzens M. Enriquez R.F. Thomas G.P. Gardiner E.M. Herzog H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 10Sainsbury A. Schwarzer C. Couzens M. Fetissov S. Furtinger S. Jenkins A. Cox H.M. Sperk G. Hokfelt T. Herzog H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8938-8943Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Gonadectomies—All mice were either sham-operated or gonadectomized at 8 weeks of age. To determine the effect of pre-existing Y2 receptor deletion on gonadectomy-induced bone loss, wild-type and germ line Y2 receptor knock-out (Y2–/–) mice were collected 8 weeks after gonadectomy, at 16 weeks of age. To investigate the response to activation of the anabolic pathway following the development of bone loss, Y2lox/lox mice were injected with adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV-cre or AAV-empty) 8 weeks after gonadectomy, at 16 weeks of age. These mice were left for 6 weeks to allow the effect of Y2 deletion to develop and were collected at 22 weeks of age, a total of 14 weeks after gonadectomy. Adeno-associated Virus Injection—16-Week-old Y2lox/lox mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine (Mavlab, Slacks Creek, Queensland, Australia) and 20 mg/kg xylazine (Ilium Veterinary Products, Smithfield, New South Wales, Australia) and injected with recombinant AAV vectors containing either the crerecombinase gene or an empty cassette using a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Brain coordinates relative to bregma were posterior 2.3 mm, lateral ±0.4 mm, ventral 5.6 mm, corresponding to the arcuate nucleus. One microliter of virus (1 × 1014 genomic copies/ml) was injected bilaterally over 10 min using a 26-gauge guide cannula and a 33-gauge injector (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) connected to a Hamilton syringe and a syringe infusion pump (World Precision Instruments, Waltham, MA). Mice were housed individually to monitor daily food intake and body weight. Tissue Collection and Analysis—Mice were injected with 15 mg/kg of the fluorescent tetracycline compound calcein (Sigma) 10 days and 3 days prior to collection. At either 16 (germ line Y2 receptor knock-outs) or 22 weeks of age (conditional Y2 receptor knock-outs), mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and trunk blood was collected for serum hormone analysis. White adipose tissue (WAT) depots (right inguinal, right retroperitoneal, and mesenteric) were collected and weighed. The weight of these tissues was summed and expressed as total white adipose tissue mass. Interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) was also excised and weighed. Both femora were excised and bisected transversely at the shaft midpoint. The distal halves of the right femora together with lumbar vertebrae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded, undecalcified in methyl methacrylate (Medim-Medizinische Diagnostik, Giessen, Germany) (3Baldock P.A. Sainsbury A. Couzens M. Enriquez R.F. Thomas G.P. Gardiner E.M. Herzog H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). 5-μm sagittal sections were used to analyze and calculate mineralized trabecular bone volume, number, and thickness, osteoclast surface, and mineral apposition rate as described previously (3Baldock P.A. Sainsbury A. Couzens M. Enriquez R.F. Thomas G.P. Gardiner E.M. Herzog H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), using either BioQuant software (R & M Biometrics Inc., Nashville, TN) or Leica QWin analysis software (Leica Microsystems Ltd., Heerberg, Switzerland). Radioimmunoassay kits were used to determine serum concentrations of IGF-1 (Biclone Australia PTY. Ltd., Marrickville, Australia) and corticosterone (MP Biomedicals, Orangeburg, NY). Osteocalcin was measured using a mouse osteocalcin EIA kit (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA). Statistical Analysis—All data were assessed by factorial analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's post hoc tests, using StatView version 4.5 (Abacus Concepts, San Francisco). For all statistical analyses, p < 0.05 was accepted as being statistically significant. Germ Line Y2 Receptor Deletion and Gonadectomy-induced Changes in Body Weight, Adipose, and Biochemical Parameters—To investigate whether deletion of Y2 receptors affects gonadectomy-induced changes in adipose tissue deposition, germ line Y2–/– mice were assessed for changes in body weight and adiposity at 16 weeks of age, 8 weeks following gonadectomy. Body weights of female sham-operated wild-type and Y2–/– mice were similar, with an increase in body weight in wild-type but not Y2–/– females following ovariectomy (Fig. 1A), associated with increased inguinal, retroperitoneal, and total WAT mass (Fig. 1, B, D, and E), which was not increased in Y2–/– mice. Total WAT mass was significantly lower in ovariectomized Y2–/– mice compared with wild type (Fig. 1E), suggesting that germ line Y2 deletion provides resistance to the ovariectomy-associated increase in adipose mass. Male germ line Y2–/– mice were significantly lighter than wild-type mice (Fig. 1H), with lighter inguinal, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and total WAT (Fig. 1, I–L) in Y2–/– males. BAT mass was also significantly lower in Y2–/– sham-operated males compared with wild-type (Fig. 1M), suggesting increased thermogenesis that would also likely contribute to reduced body weight. Orchidectomized mice were lighter compared with sham-operated genotype-matched controls (Fig. 1H), demonstrating that although lighter than wild-type mice, germ line deletion of Y2 receptors does not significantly alter the body composition changes that occur in response to orchidectomy. Serum concentrations of IGF-1 and osteocalcin were unaffected by gonadectomy or germ line deletion of Y2 receptors in both sexes. Serum corticosterone was significantly reduced in ovariectomized Y2–/– compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1G), but was significantly higher in male Y2–/– mice compared with wild type and in orchidectomized compared with sham-operated germ line Y2–/– mice (Fig. 1N), suggesting a gender-specific change in the levels and gonadectomy-induced response of this hormone. Germ Line Y2 Receptor Deletion and Gonadectomy-induced Bone Loss in the Distal Femur—16-Week-old male and female sham-operated germ line Y2–/– mice had significantly greater trabecular bone volume at the distal femur than the sham-operated wild type (Fig. 2, A, C, and J). Gonadectomy at 8 weeks of age significantly reduced trabecular bone volume of both wild-type and Y2–/– mice (Fig. 2, A, C, and J). In females, however, despite a similar percentage reduction in bone volume in both ovariectomized Y2–/– and wild-type mice, the remaining bone volume in ovariectomized Y2–/– mice was comparable with wild-type sham levels and remained significantly greater than bone volume of ovariectomized wild-type mice (Fig. 2C). Similarly, trabecular number and thickness (Fig. 2, D and E) both remained significantly greater in ovariectomized Y2–/– compared with wild-type mice. Hence germ line deletion of Y2 receptors provided some protection against ovariectomy-induced bone loss and deterioration of bone microarchitecture in the distal femur. In contrast to observations in ovariectomized female mice, orchidectomy of wild-type and Y2–/– male mice abolished the difference in trabecular bone volume between the two genotypes (Fig. 2J) because of reduced trabecular number and thickness (Fig. 2, K and L). In females, the loss of trabecular bone volume following ovariectomy was associated with increased osteoclast and mineralizing surface (MS), consistent with the characteristic response to estrogen deficiency (11Rehman M.T. Hoyland J.A. Denton J. Freemont A.J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1994; 47: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Wronski T.J. Walsh C.C. Ignaszewski L.A.

Res. 1998; 13: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The increased osteoclast surface in wild-type and Y2–/– mice was comparable and not affected by Y2 receptor deletion (Fig. 2F). MS, a measure of the extent of mineralization, was elevated in ovariectomized wild-type and Y2–/– mice, reaching statistical significance only in wild-type mice (Fig. 2G). Similarly, the loss of trabecular bone volume following orchidectomy in male mice was associated with significantly increased osteoclast surface in both genotypes (Fig. 2M). MS was elevated in orchidectomized Y2–/– but not wild-type mice (Fig. 2N). Importantly, however, the elevated rate of mineral apposition (MAR), which confers the greater trabecular bone volume in nonoperated Y2–/– mice (3Baldock P.A. Sainsbury A. Couzens M. Enriquez R.F. Thomas G.P. Gardiner E.M. Herzog H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), was maintained following gonadectomy in both female and male mice (Fig. 2, B, H, and O). Furthermore, BFR, a measure of total osteoblast activity, was elevated in gonadectomized Y2–/– mice to a level even greater than sham-operated values (Fig. 2, I and P). Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the Y2-associated anabolic response persists in the absence of sex hormones in both males and females, and the preservation of bone micro-architecture post-ovariectomy in female Y2–/– mice was likely the result of Y2-dependent anabolic activity, demonstrating this anabolic pathway to be independent of the presence of sex hormones. These results from germ line Y2–/– mice reveal that although the anabolic activity of the Y2 pathway remains elevated in the absence of sex hormones, this is not sufficient to provide resistance to gonadectomy-induced bone loss. In the clinic, however, an effective anabolic osteoporosis treatment must rebuild osteopenic bone. To assess whether activation of the Y2-mediated anabolic response can reverse bone loss that has already occurred, we utilized a conditional Y2 receptor knock-out model, using hypothalamic injection of recombinant adeno-associated viral vector containing the cre-recombinase gene (AAV-cre) to delete the Y2 receptor gene in adult Y2lox/lox mice. Hypothalamic Y2 receptors were deleted in 16-week-old Y2lox/lox mice, 8 weeks after gonadectomy, followed by a further 6 weeks to allow the consequences of Y2 gene deletion to develop. Control Y2lox/lox mice were injected with adeno-associated viral vector without the transgene (AAV-empty), therefore remaining genetically equivalent to wild-type mice. This model, in which the anabolic pathway is activated following the occurrence of bone loss, is more akin to the typical osteoporotic patient, in whom treatment is initiated after substantial bone has been lost. Conditional Hypothalamic Y2 Receptor Deletion and Gonadectomy-induced Changes in Body Weight, Adipose, and Biochemical Parameters—Investigation of whether conditional activation of this central pathway would affect gonadectomy-induced changes in body weight revealed that hypothalamus-specific deletion of Y2 receptors had no significant effect on body weight or food intake in gonadectomized female or male mice (Fig. 3, A and H, and data not shown). In females, fat pad weights from ovariectomized conditional Y2–/– mice were similar to sham-operated controls (Fig. 3, B–F). As WAT mass would be expected to increase following ovariectomy prior to the deletion of Y2 receptors, these findings suggest that similar to germ line deletion, hypothalamic deletion of Y2 receptors caused a decrease in WAT mass. In males, BAT was similarly reduced in both orchidectomized models (Fig. 3M). However, in contrast to orchidectomized germ line Y2–/– mice, which were significantly lighter and less fat than similarly operated wild-type mice, orchidectomized conditional Y2–/– mice had increased mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and total WAT mass compared with orchidectomized AAV-empty recipient mice (Fig. 3, J–L), suggesting that populations of Y2 receptors other than those in the hypothalamus, possibly peripheral, are important for sex hormone-regulated fat deposition in male mice. Conditional deletion of Y2 receptors did not affect serum levels of IGF-1, corticosterone, or osteocalcin, although corticosterone was elevated in both gonadectomized groups compared with conditional Y2–/– sham-operated mice, with the difference reaching significance only in AAV-empty recipient mice (Fig. 3, G and N). Conditional Hypothalamic Y2 Receptor Deletion and Gonadectomy-induced Bone Loss in the Distal Femur—Six weeks following conditional deletion of hypothalamic Y2 receptors in previously gonadectomized female and male Y2lox/lox mice, trabecular bone volume at the distal femur was 2-fold greater compared with bone volume in gonadectomized Y2lox/lox AAV-empty recipient mice (Fig. 4, A, B, and I). This difference in bone volume was due to a significantly greater trabecular number in male mice (Fig. 4J), with significantly greater trabecular thickness in both female and male mice (Fig. 4, D and K), demonstrating that conditional deletion of hypothalamic Y2 receptors can significantly improve outcome following gonadectomy-induced bone loss, with marked protection of bone mass and microarchitecture. Osteoclast surface was significantly increased by gonadectomy in both groups (AAV-cre and AAV-empty) compared with sham-operated AAV-cre recipient mice (Fig. 4, E and L), indicating that as in the germ line Y2 knock-outs, conditional deletion of hypothalamic Y2 receptors did not inhibit gonadectomy-induced increases in bone resorption at this skeletal site. MS was unaffected by surgery or by conditional deletion of Y2 receptors (Fig. 4, F and M). Importantly, and consistent with our findings in germ line Y2–/– mice, MAR was again significantly elevated in both sham-operated and gonadectomized mice lacking hypothalamic Y2 receptors, compared with AAV-empty controls (Fig. 4, G and N). A similar pattern was also observed for BFR (Fig. 4, H and O), and together they demonstrate that despite persistent high resorptive activity, conditional deletion of hypothalamic Y2 receptors can prevent further gonadectomy-induced bone loss in both female and male mice through activation of a central Y2-mediated bone anabolic pathway. Furthermore, this anabolic response was strong enough to produce a difference in bone mass compared with AAV-empty recipient mice within just 6 weeks, with substantial benefits to trabecular microarchitecture. Conditional Hypothalamic Y2 Receptor Deletion and Gonadectomy-induced Bone Loss of the Vertebrae and Femur—Analysis of lumbar vertebrae revealed a pattern similar to the distal femur, with conditional deletion of hypothalamic Y2 receptors in gonadectomized Y2lox/lox mice significantly elevating trabecular bone volume compared with AAV-empty controls (Fig. 5, A, B, and E). Osteoclast surface was significantly increased in gonadectomized compared with sham-operated male but not female mice regardless of knock-out status (Fig. 5, C and F). Importantly, as seen in the distal femur, the greater bone volume after hypothalamus-specific Y2 knock-out in gonadectomized mice could be attributed to a significantly greater MAR compared with gonadectomized AAV-empty recipient mice of both genders (Fig. 5, D and G). This is the first demonstration that the bone anabolic response elicited by deletion of hypothalamic Y2 receptors is similar in different skeletal regions and indicates a generalized anabolic activity in bone. Comparison with the effects of gonadectomy in wild-type mice establishes the consequences of deleting hypothalamic Y2 receptors in adult mice after the occurrence of significant gonadectomy-induced bone loss in the distal femur. In wild-type mice, trabecular bone volume was reduced by 50% in the distal femur 8 weeks after gonadectomy in either sex (Fig. 6, A and D). This reduction of bone volume continued to 14 weeks post-operation in AAV-empty recipient mice. Importantly, this latter phase of bone loss was blocked in mice in which hypothalamic Y2 receptors were deleted 6 weeks prior to collection, leaving these mice with twice the amount of bone volume compared with control AAV-empty recipient mice (Fig. 6, A and D). Osteoclast surface was elevated in all gonadectomy groups compared with sham-operated wild-type mice (Fig. 6, B and E). However, MAR was elevated only in mice deficient in hypothalamic Y2 receptors (Fig. 6, C and F), providing the first demonstration that the central Y2-associated anabolic response can overcome elevated bone resorption induced by sex hormone deficiency and effectively prevent further bone loss. This study clearly demonstrates that hypothalamus-specific deletion of Y2 receptors prevents bone loss induced by deficiency of gonadal hormones in both male and female mice. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that germ line deletion of Y2 receptors prevents the elevation in WAT mass following ovariectomy, with differences between the regulation of WAT mass in orchidectomized male germ line and hypothalamic Y2–/– mice suggesting that Y2 receptors other than those located in the hypothalamus may be responsible for this effect. Together these findings are indicative of site specificity or alternative pathways regulated by Y2 receptors controlling bone formation and the deposition of WAT in the absence of sex hormones. Sex hormones play an important role in regulating body fat, with levels of intra-abdominal fat increased up to 49% in post-menopausal compared with pre-menopausal women (15Toth M.J. Tchernof A. Sites C.K. Poehlman E.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 904: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Our study also demonstrates a significant increase in WAT content in ovariectomized wild-type mice but not germ line Y2–/– mice. Studies in humans (16Escobar C.M. Krajewski S.J. Sandoval-Guzman T. Voytko M.L. Rance N.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2338-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and rodents (8Shimizu H. Ohtani K. Kato Y. Tanaka Y. Mori M. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 204: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Ainslie D.A. Morris M.J. Wittert G. Turnbull H. Proietto J. Thorburn A.W. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) have established a potential role for elevated NPY in the accumulation of WAT that occurs with menopause. Our findings are supportive of a role for the NPY system in the regulation of WAT content following the removal of gonadal hormones and strongly suggest a role for Y2 receptors in the control of this process. These studies also demonstrate that whereas constitutive activation of the bone anabolic response in germ line Y2–/– mice does not entirely protect against sex hormone-deficient bone loss, selective activation of only the hypothalamic Y2-associated bone formation response following the occurrence of significant hypogonadal bone loss effectively prevents further bone loss. Of particular interest, this prevention of bone loss occurred despite elevated bone resorption and thus is specifically attributable to a Y2-associated anabolic response of osteoblastic cells. The end result was a doubling of trabecular bone volume in the distal femur and significantly increased bone mass in the lumbar vertebrae of gonadectomized mice lacking hypothalamic Y2 receptors compared with their counterparts with an intact Y2 receptor gene. Interestingly, maximal activation of the bone formation pathway was achieved equally by deletion of germ line and hypothalamic Y2 receptors, demonstrating this pathway to be centrally mediated. A recent study using pseudorabies virus-based transneuronal tracing to map trans-synaptically connected neurons from rat bone provided direct evidence that nerve fibers within bone tissue are under the control of synaptic transmission from the hypothalamus (17Denes A. Boldogkoi Z. Uhereczky G. Hornyak A. Rusvai M. Palkovits M. Kovacs K.J. Neuroscience. 2005; 134: 947-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), providing a putative mechanism by which deletion of hypothalamic Y2 receptors can affect osteoblastic activity. Notably, the marked improvement in bone volume seen in this study occurred within just 6 weeks of hypothalamic Y2 receptor deletion, a clear demonstration of the potency of this central anabolic pathway, providing crucial evidence that this pathway may be a suitable target to increase bone mass in osteoporotic patients, who are usually diagnosed only after significant bone loss has already occurred. It is interesting to note that mice with a constitutively active bone formation response because of germ line Y2 knock-out were not more resistant to gonadectomy-induced bone loss, whereas activation of the Y2 anabolic response in adults prevented any further bone loss. There are a number of possible explanations for this finding. Osteoclast surface was reduced at the 22-week time point in ovariectomized conditional Y2–/– female mice compared with 16-week-old ovariectomized germ line Y2–/– mice. This finding is not unexpected as the gonadectomy-induced increase in resorption is an acute response, which rapidly diminishes (13Wronski T.J. Dann L.M. Scott K.S. Cintron M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 45: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 14Baldock P.A. Morris H.A. Need A.G. Moore R.J. Durbridge T.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MAR was also higher in orchidectomized conditional Y2–/– male mice compared with germ line knockouts, suggesting that a greater osteoblastic response in the conditional knock-outs may be responsible for the protective effect on orchidectomy-induced bone loss. As the anabolic bone formation response was actually active in both male and female gonadectomized germ line Y2–/– mice, as evidenced by a greater MAR and BFR, it is possible that the only reason why a protective effect was observed in the conditional knock-outs and not in the germ lines was a longer time post-operation, allowing the anabolic response to overcome the acute increase in resorption. Higher body weight is associated with higher bone mineral density in human studies (18Reid I.R. Ames R. Evans M.C. Sharpe S. Gamble G. France J.T. Lim T.M. Cundy T.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 75: 45-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here, however, show that the increased bone volume of gonadectomized Y2 receptor knock-out mice was not because of increased body weight, as body weight and fat mass were actually reduced in germ line Y2 knock-out mice and unchanged in conditional knock-out mice. IGF-1 is known to affect bone growth and turnover (19McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2001; 11: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and Y2 receptors regulate serum IGF-1 concentrations under conditions of elevated NPY-ergic expression (4Sainsbury A. Schwarzer C. Couzens M. Herzog H. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3420-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, serum IGF-1 concentrations were unaffected by Y2 receptor deletion. Elevated corticosterone decreases bone mass; however, serum corticosterone also cannot explain the bone differences observed in these mice. Ovariectomized wild-type mice had greater serum corticosterone compared with ovariectomized Y2–/– mice, which could possibly influence bone volume; however, corticosterone was unchanged in sham-operated Y2–/– compared with wild-type mice suggesting this is unlikely. Moreover, serum corticosterone was actually greater in germ line Y2–/– mice compared with wild-type, which would be expected to produce a decrease rather than the observed increase in bone volume. In conditional Y2–/– mice, serum corticosterone levels in both male and female mice were similar between both gonadectomy groups, again arguing against changes in corticosterone levels being responsible for the bone changes. In osteoporosis, excess osteoclastic resorption results in deep resorption pits, causing trabecular perforation and loss of trabecular structures. A reduction in bone formation contributes to the deterioration of bone microarchitecture, as lost bone material is not adequately replaced (20Inoue K. Ohgushi H. Yoshikawa T. Okumura M. Sempuku T. Tamai S. Dohi Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Roholl P.J. Blauw E. Zurcher C. Dormans J.A. Theuns H.M. J. Bone Miner.

Anabolic treatments to balance out excess osteoclastic activity are therefore essential. In this study, conditional deletion of hypothalamic Y2 receptors in gonadectomized female and male adult mice resulted in significantly greater trabecular thickness compared with AAV-empty recipient mice and, most importantly, greater trabecular number in orchidectomized conditional knock-out mice compared with AAV-empty controls. A similar but non-significant trend was noted in female mice. These data suggest that the Y2 receptor-associated anabolic pathway not only improves total bone mass but also results in a beneficial microarchitectural outcome compared with gonadectomized wild-type mice. These beneficial effects on bone volume and microarchitecture occurred in the face of elevated resorption. It is possible that even more bone mass could be replaced over a longer period of time after conditional deletion of hypothalamic Y2 receptors. It will also be important to investigate whether concurrent or sequential administration of an anti-resorptive treatment in combination with Y2 receptor deletion can allow a more effective anabolic response. Interestingly, recent studies of co-administration of the only available anabolic therapy, parathyroid hormone-(1–34) with anti-resorptive bisphosphonate, indicated that the anti-resorptive treatment may reduce the anabolic potential of parathyroid hormone (24Finkelstein J.S.

With the aging population, it is predicted that an increase in the incidence of osteoporotic fractures will be a major problem (26Gullberg B. Johnell O. Kanis J.A. Osteoporos. Int. 1997; 7: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). The studies presented here demonstrate that inactivation of hypothalamic Y2 receptor signaling can prevent continued loss of bone by stimulating bone formation in gonadectomized adult mice. Furthermore, germ line deletion of Y2 receptors prevented the accumulation in WAT in ovariectomized female mice and reduced WAT mass in male mice. These results highlight the potential of this promising new avenue for the treatment of osteoporosis and obesity. Currently, there are no orally available Y2 receptor-specific antagonists. Our study emphasizes the need to develop such Y2 receptor-specific antagonists with the promising potential for treatment of excess fat deposition and bone degenerative conditions.

Here we report that Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) synthesizes a lectin termed Manila clam lectin (MCL) upon infection with the protozoan parasite Perkinsus olseni. MCL is synthesized in hemocytes as a ∼74-kDa precursor and secreted into hemolymph where it is converted to 30and 34-kDa polypeptides. The synthesis of MCL in hemocytes is stimulated by one or more factors in Perkinsus-infected hemolymph, but not directly by Perkinsus itself. MCL can bind to the surfaces of purified hypnospores and zoospores of the parasite, and this binding is inhibitable by either EDTA or GalNAc. Fluorescent beads coated with purified MCL were actively phagocytosed by hemocytes from the clam. Immunohistochemistry showed that secreted MCL is concentrated within cyst-like structures. To define the glycan binding specificity of MCL we examined its binding to an array of biotinylated glycans. MCL recognizes terminal non-reducing β-linked GalNAc as expressed within the LacdiNAc motif GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-R and glycans with terminal, non-reducing β-linked Gal residues. Our results show that the synthesis of MCL is specifically up-regulated upon parasite infection of the clams and may serve as an opsonin through recognition of terminal GalNAc/Gal residues on the parasites.

Marine invertebrates have an innate immune system that is similar in some ways to the innate immune system in vertebrates. The invertebrate innate immune system is constitutive with pre-existing or immediately expressed immune functions that serve to prevent and limit invading microbes and pathogens. In both the invertebrate and vertebrate innate immune systems carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) play crucial roles, with involvement in processes such as non-self-recognition, inflammation, opsonization, cell-cell and cell to extracellular matrix interactions, fertilization, development, and regeneration (1Vasta G.R.

These lectins may be classified into two general groups. One group is Ca2+-dependent and includes the C-type lectin family. Recently, C-type GalNAc-specific lectins from Cucumaria echinata were shown to interact with target membranes and exhibit strong hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity through pore formation (22Hatakeyama T. Furukawa M. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. Mori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16915-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the ascidian, Halocynthia roretzi, mannosebinding lectin has been reported (23Sekine H. Kenjo A. Azumi K. Ohi G. Takahashi M. Kasukawa R. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4504-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is associated with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases 1 and 2, which are the enzymes responsible for complement activation initiated by mannose-binding lectin in the lectin pathway (24Endo Y. Nonaka M. Saiga H. Kakinuma Y. Matsushita A. Takahashi M. Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4701-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The second group of lectins comprises the galactosyl-binding lectins, which have structural homologies with galectins. The sponges Geodia cydonium and Suberites domuncular express galectin-related lectins that are similar in structure to molecules that are involved mammalian immune responses (25Muller W.E. Blumbach B. Muller I.M. Transplantation. 1999; 68: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In marine bivalve host defense, a heterogeneous sialic acid-binding lectin with affinity for bacterial lipopolysaccharides has been isolated and partially characterized from the hemolymph of the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus (21Tunkijjanukij S. Olafsen J.A. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1998; 22: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The isolated horse mussel lectin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against tested Vibrio strains, which suggests that the lectin plays a role in the elimination of bacteria and participates in an innate immunity. We recently discovered a novel lectin (MCL) 2The abbreviations used are: MCL, Manila clam lectin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TTBS, TBS containing Tween; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBS-T, PBS containing EDTA; MS, mass spectrometry.2The abbreviations used are: MCL, Manila clam lectin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TTBS, TBS containing Tween; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBS-T, PBS containing EDTA; MS, mass spectrometry. from the Manila clam (26Bulgakov A.A. Park K.I. Choi K.S. Lim H.K. Cho M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2004; 16: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The lectin has an apparent molecular mass of 138 kDa in non-reducing SDS-PAGE and consists of 74-, 34-, and 30-kDa species. Inhibition assays showed that mucins containing GalNAc inhibit MCL binding (26Bulgakov A.A. Park K.I. Choi K.S. Lim H.K. Cho M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2004; 16: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To better understand the biological roles of MCL in clams, we have explored MCL biosynthesis, carbohydrate-binding specificity, and its potential function in host defense. Here we report that the infection of clams by the protozoan parasite Perkinsus olseni induces the synthesis of MCL by clam hemocytes. Newly synthesized MCL is secreted into hemolymph as a 74-kDa precursor protein that is processed to the 30and 34-kDa species. We have also defined the glycan-binding specificity of MCL and propose a potential role for the lectin in innate immunity in bivalve defense against the parasite. Purification of Perkinsus Trophozoites from Manila Clam—Trophozoites of P. olseni were extracted from the hemolymph withdrawn from the blood sinus of the adductor muscle of Manila clams, which were collected at Wando Island off the southern coast of Korea, where a high incidence of the parasite infection has been reported (27Park K.I. Choi K.S. Aquaculture. 2001; 203: 9-22Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Perkinsus in the hemolymph were propagated for 1 week in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:2) with Hepes buffer and 5% fetal bovine serum according to Ordas and Figueras (49Ordas M.C. Figueras A. Dis. Aquat. Org. 1998; 33: 129-136Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Perkinsus Purification and Culture—One milliliter of hemolymph containing trophozoites of Perkinsus was withdrawn from the blood sinus of the adductor muscle of Manila clams with an insulin syringe and seeded in 24-well polystyrene plates. One milliliter of 35% sterilized artificial sea water prepared with Marine Mix (Sigma-Aldrich) with 4000 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin was added to each well, and after 12 h of incubation at 26 °C, the contents of the wells were pooled and centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 × g. The pellet containing parasites was resuspended in artificial sea water with 4000 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin and incubated for another 12 h at 26 °C. Parasites were centrifuged again, and the supernatant was carefully removed from each well. To each well was added 1 ml of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Ham's F-12 (1:2) with 50 mm Hepes buffer, 3.5 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 5% fetal bovine serum in 35% artificial sea water. During the first week the media was changed twice, and when the number of Perkinsus cells was >107 cells/ml, another subculture was initiated. Biosynthesis of MCL in the Hemocytes—The hemolymph (1 ml) was withdrawn from the Perkinsus-infected clam and centrifuged (1000 × g). The supernatant was analyzed for a hemocyte-free hemolymph, and the pellet contained the hemocytes. The hemocytes were resuspended and incubated in media, as described above, for the indicated times at 37 °C and subjected to Western blot analysis for MCL. Hemolytic Assay—The potential hemolytic activity of MCL was assessed using human erythrocytes. Erythrocytes were isolated from heparinized blood by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min) and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell suspension was adjusted to 1 × 109 ml–1 in PBS. The cell suspensions (20 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with equal volumes of MCL. The incubation media was centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 min). The absorbance of the solution was measured at 420 nm. The absorbance obtained after treating erythrocytes with only PBS and 2% SDS were taken as 0 and 100%, respectively. Glycan Binding Specificity of MCL—MCL was purified as described previously (26Bulgakov A.A. Park K.I. Choi K.S. Lim H.K. Cho M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2004; 16: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and was dialyzed into 150 mm NaCl containing 100 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, and 10 mm CaCl2, and reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (50 μg of FITC/mg of protein). Procedures for probing the full glycan arrays are available at www.functionalglycomics.org/static/consortium/. Biotinylated glycans were bound to streptavidincoated plates (Pierce) by incubation at 4 °C overnight at a concentration of 100 μm. Purified MCL was labeled with FITC in the presence of ligand (GalNAc) to reduce the likelihood of labeling the active binding site. After labeling only the active lectin is purified by affinity chromatography and used for the experiments. Fluoresceinated MCL was incubated in the triplicate wells for 2 h at 4°C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and washed three times in the same buffer, without added albumin, before measuring fluorescence intensity in a fluorescence plate reader. Phagocytosis Assay—The opsonizing ability of MCL was tested by a flow-cytometric assay that measures the phagocytosis of MCL-coated fluorescent beads by hemocytes. Fluorescent latex beads (ϕ 2.0 μm, 20 μl, Polyscience, Inc., Warrington, PA) were prepared by incubating them for 2 h with either 20μl of MCL (10,000 titer/50 μl to human blood group O) in 1 ml of TBS-Ca2+; 20 μl of MCL with 2 mg/ml GalNAc in 1 ml of TBS-Ca2+; or 1 ml of filtered seawater (control group). After incubation the beads were washed 3 times with filtered seawater, and then 30 μl of a suspension of fluorescent beads from each preparation was added to a suspension of hemocytes prepared from Manila clams. Hemocytes were prepared from clam hemolymph (100 μl). The cells were incubated with different bead preparations at 20 °C in the dark on a gentle shaker for 1 h. An equal volume of 6% neutral formalin was added to the fix hemocytes, which were then analyzed by flow cytometry. Another control group was prepared where beads that had been incubated with 1 ml of filtered seawater were added to the hemocyte suspension and then immediately mixed with 3 μl of cytochalasin B at 0.1% final concentration to block further phagocytosis. Phagocytosis was then analyzed by two parameters, log amplifications of the complexity and cell size, and the log fluorescence frequency distribution histogram of the hemocyte population was determined. The data were collected for 100 s. The percentage of cells phagocytosing beads was noted. Statistical analyses were performed using statistical software with possible differences among groups defined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Duncan's multiple range tests. Differences were considered significant at a probability level of 0.05. SDS-PAGE—To determine the molecular sizes of the proteins that were eluted from the columns, 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used under non-reducing and reducing conditions. The molecular masses of the proteins were compared using high and low molecular weight markers (Sigma-Aldrich). Lectin Activity Assay—The direct hemagglutination assay was performed by a standard procedure using trypsin-treated human blood group O erythrocytes in TBS-Ca2+ (26Bulgakov A.A. Park K.I. Choi K.S. Lim H.K. Cho M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2004; 16: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 50 μl of an erythrocyte suspension, which were diluted 10-fold with TBS-Ca2+, were added to microplate wells and mixed with 100 μl of serially diluted MCL with or without inhibitors. The mixture was shaken for 10 min on a microplate well shaker, and hemagglutination was scored by microscopic observation of visible cell clumps. Western Blotting—After electrophoresis on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pierce). The transfer was carried out at 110 V for 2 h using 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, 20% MeOH, and 1% SDS as the transfer buffer. The gel was placed in Coomassie Blue to verify that the transfer was successful. The membrane was incubated in a blocking solution of TBS-containing Tween (TTBS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed three times for 10 min each in TTBS and incubated with anti-MCL antibody (1:500 dilution in TTBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (BioDom Co.), which was diluted 1:500 in TTBS. The membrane was re-washed, and the antigen-antibody complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Staining—Hypnospores and zoospores of Perkinsus were washed with PBS plus 20 mm EDTA (PBS-T), incubated with 100 ml of MCL in TBS-Ca2+ for 1 h, then incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T and a mono-specific antibody against MCL (1:100 dilution in PBS-T) for 1 h. The cells were then washed three times in PBS-T and incubated with a 1:200 dilution in PBS-T of FITC-conjugated goat antibody against rabbit immunoglobulins (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. The cells were incubated with pre-immune rabbit IgG as a control. For immunohistochemical staining, Perkinsus-infected clams collected from Wando Island were embedded in Jung Tissue Freezing Medium (Jung, Germany). Cryostat sections were fixed in ice-cold acetone and air-dried for 30 min. Tissues were equilibrated to 0.1 m PBS, and then incubated in 1% goat serum in PBS-T for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Samples were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-MCL (1/200) diluted in 0.1 m PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. A negative control was performed by replacing antibody by pre-immune rabbit IgG. Specific binding of the primary antibodies was visualized using a FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/1000). The immunofluorescence images were captured on a microscope (BX50, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Diagnosis of Perkinsus Infection—Two populations of the Manila clam were collected from Gomso and Gimyong on the west and south coasts of Korea. According to Park and Choi (27Park K.I. Choi K.S. Aquaculture. 2001; 203: 9-22Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), Gomso is known to be a Perkinsus-infected area, whereas Gimyong is Perkinsus-free. Clams were incubated in fluid thioglycollate medium, according to Ray (28Ray S.M. Proc. Natl. Shellfish. Assoc. 1966; 54: 55-69Google Scholar). After incubation for 1 week, the tissues were stained with Lugol's iodine and examined under a light microscope. Incidence of Perkinsus in clams was also confirmed by digesting the fluid thioglycollate medium-incubated clam tissues in 2 m NaOH, as described by Choi et al. (29Choi K.S. Park K.L. Lee K.W. Matsuoka K. J. Shellfish Res. 2002; 21: 119-125Google Scholar) and examining Perkinsus hypnospores using a light microscope. In-gel Digestion and Peptide Sample Preparation—All solvents used in this procedure were high-performance liquid chromatography grade. The SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein bands were excised from the stained gel. Then the excised bands were washed three times with 1:1 (v/v) solution of acetonitrile/deionized water for 10 min and dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile. The bands were finally washed with 1:1 (v/v) solution of 100% acetonitrile/100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and dried using a SpeedVac. Proteins contained in the gel pieces were reduced by using 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C for 45 min and then alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature for 30 min. Next, the washing step above was repeated on the alkylated sample. After the washing step, the gel pieces were dried and soaked in sequencing-grade trypsin solution (500 ng) on ice for 45 min. Then the gel pieces were immersed in 100 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 14–18 h. The resulting peptides were extracted sequentially for 20 min with 45% acetonitrile in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 45% acetonitrile in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and 75% acetonitrile in 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid with agitation. The extracts containing tryptic peptides were pooled together and evaporated under vacuum. Micro Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry Analysis and Protein Data Base Search—In-gel digested proteins were loaded onto fused silica capillary columns (100-μm inner diameter, 360-μm outer diameter) containing 8 cm of 5-μm particle size Aqua C18 reverse-phase column material. The column was placed in-line with an Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA) HP 1100 quaternary liquid chromatography pump, and a splitter system was used to achieve a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Buffer A (5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) were used to make a 90-min gradient. The gradient profile started with 5 min of 100% buffer A, followed by a 60-min gradient from 0 to 55% buffer B, a 25-min gradient from 55 to 100% buffer B, and a 5-min gradient of 100% buffer B. Eluted peptides were directly electrosprayed into an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Palo Alto, CA) by applying 2.3 kV of direct current voltage. A data-dependent scan consisting of one full mass spectrometry (MS) scan (400–1400 mass/charge) and five data-dependent MS/MS scans were used to generate MS/MS spectra of eluted peptides. A normalized collision energy of 35% was used throughout the data acquisition. MS/MS spectra were searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information rat protein sequence data base using Bioworks version 3.1 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and Sequest Cluster System (14 nodes, Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). DTASelect was used to filter the search results, and the following Xcorr values were applied to different charge states of peptides: 1.8 for singly charged peptides, 2.2 for doubly charged peptides, and 3.2 for triply charged peptides. Manual assignments of fragment ions in each MS/MS spectra were performed to confirm the protein data base search results. Induction of MCL upon Perkinsus Infection—MCL was purified from Manila clams as described previously (26Bulgakov A.A. Park K.I. Choi K.S. Lim H.K. Cho M. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2004; 16: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The protein has an apparent molecular mass of 138 kDa in non-reducing SDS-PAGE and consists of 74-, 34-, and 30-kDa species. However, during the purification of MCL from mucus fluid, we found that different batches of clams gave different yields, even when the amounts of starting material were similar. The different MCL yields appeared to correlate with the degree of infection of the Manila clam with Perkinsus. As shown in Table 1, body lysate from a Manila clam that was heavily infected with Perkinsus showed strong hemagglutinating activity, whereas that from a non-infected clam showed very little hemagglutinating activity. The mucus fluids from Perkinsus-infected or non-infected clams were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MCL antibody (Fig. 1). The mucus fluid from the infected clams showed strong expression of MCL, which migrated as three species (apparent molecular masses of 74, 34, and 30 kDa). Non-infected clams hardly express MCL if any. The presence of MCL in the infected clams suggested two obvious possibilities; either Perkinsus itself produced the MCL during infection, or clams produced it upon infection, possibly for host defense. It seemed unlikely that Perkinsus makes large amounts of MCL and secretes it into mucus fluid, because Perkinsus is a intracellular endoparasitic protozoan.TABLE 1Hemagglutinating activities of body lysates from Perkinsus-infected and non-infected Manila clamsHemagglutination titeraFresh clam meat (100 × g) was measured and added to 100 ml of distilled water. The mixture was blended three times for 30 s at maximum speed, incubated 1 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 5000 × g. The supernatant (100 μl) was used for hemagglutination. The titer was determined by serial 2-fold dilution and defined as the dilution factor. The blood type did not affect the hemagglutination titer.InfectedNon-infected10242819202048220484a Fresh clam meat (100 × g) was measured and added to 100 ml of distilled water.

Open table in a new tab To test the hypothesis that MCL might be induced by Perkinsus as part of the host defense mechanism in the clam, we purified Perkinsus trophozoites from infected clams and analyzed MCL production by Western blot analysis. A photograph of Perkinsus is shown in Fig. 2A. The infected clams contained high levels of MCL (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 4), whereas purified Perkinsus appeared to contain only a small amount of the 74-kDa species of MCL (Fig. 2B, lane 2). When Perkinsus were washed with 1 m NaOH for 2 min before Western blotting, the 74-kDa MCL band was lost (Fig. 2B, lane 3). The wash with NaOH did not affect the integrity of Perkinsus (data not shown), indicating that no MCL was contained within the parasite. These results indicate that MCL is bound to the surface of Perkinsus and suggest that MCL is acquired rather than synthesized by Perkinsus. MCL Is Synthesized in Hemocytes and Secreted as a 74-kDa Protein—Because it has been reported that invertebrate hemocytes can produce lectins (30Green P.L. Nair S.V. Raftos D.A. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Goto A. Kadowaki T. Kitagawa Y. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 32Jenny M.J.

(NY). 2002; 4: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we tested whether MCL is synthesized by Manila clam hemocytes. Hemocytes were purified from Perkinsus-infected Manila clams and analyzed by Western blotting. Body lysates and mucus fluids from inflected clams contained high levels of MCL (74-, 34-, and 30-kDa species, Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). By contrast, hemocytes from infected Manila clams also contained MCL (Fig. 3, lane 3), but only the 74-kDa band was predominant, and the 30and 34-kDa bands were present at only very low levels. These results suggest that MCL is synthesized as a 74-kDa precursor that may be processed to the 30and 34-kDa species. To test this possibility hemocytes were purified from infected clams and incubated in culture media for up to 6 h, and the MCL was probed by Western blot analyses. At the initial time isolated hemocytes contained predominantly the 74-kDa form of MCL, but upon incubation both the 30and 34-kDa species were generated (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that the 74-kDa form of MCL is a precursor to the 30and 34-kDa forms and that their production of the latter forms occurs by proteolytic cleavage after secretion. We also performed proteomic analyses of 74-, 34-, and 30-kDa polypeptides. MCL was purified and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Each peptide was digested with trypsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. As shown in Table 2, we found the identical tryptic peptides from 74-, 34-, and 30-kDa proteins, which confirmed 34and 30-kDa proteins came from the 74-kDa precursor. MCL seems to be a new protein, because BLAST searches of proteomic peptides showed no significant homology with any known protein. Interestingly, identical tryptic peptides were found from the 34and 30-kDa bands. This result may be interpreted either that the 74-kDa protein is degraded to 34 then 30 kDa or the 74-kDa peptide comprises a tandem-repeated gene structure.TABLE 2Common peptide sequences obtained from 74-, 34-, and 30-kDa polypeptides by tryptic digest and tandem mass spectrometryMr (with charge)Mr (without charge)Amino acid sequences (I = L, K = Q)aAmino acids I/L or Q/K could not be distinguished by mass.544.3 (+2)1086.6LAELEEQQK589.8 (+2)1177.6NALHVYR609.3 (+2)1216.6SNLLDGLEKa Amino acids I/L or Q/K could not be distinguished by mass. Open table in a new tab To test whether the cleavage occurs after secretion, we examined the form of MCL in fresh hemolymph and hemocytes from Perkinsus-infected clams. Only the 74-kDa species was detected in both samples, confirming that the MCL is generated as a 74-kDa species that is secreted and circulates as a 74-kDa protein prior to proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 4B). The nature of the protease(s) responsible for cleavage and their sites of action within the infected clam will be the subject of future studies.

Though much is known about PKC downstream signaling events, the mechanisms of regulation of PKC activation and subsequent translocation have not been elucidated. Protein-protein interactions regulate and determine the specificity of many cellular signaling events. Such a specific protein-protein interaction is described here between δPKC and annexin V. We demonstrate, at physiologically relevant conditions, that a transient interaction between annexin V and δPKC occurs in cells after δPKC stimulation, but before δPKC translocates to the particulate fraction. Evidence of δPKC-annexin V binding is provided also by FRET and by in vitro binding studies. Dissociation of the δPKC-annexin V complex requires ATP and microtubule integrity. Furthermore, depletion of endogenous annexin V, but not annexin IV, with siRNA inhibits δPKC translocation following PKC stimulation. A rationally designed eight amino acid peptide, corresponding to the interaction site for δPKC on annexin V, inhibits δPKC translocation and δPKC-mediated function as evidenced by its protective effect in a model of myocardial infarction. Our data indicate that translocation of δPKC is not simply a diffusion-driven process, but is instead a multi-step event regulated by protein-protein interactions. We show that following cell activation, δPKC-annexin V binding is a transient and an essential step in the function of δPKC, thus identifying a new role for annexin V in PKC signaling and a new step in PKC activation.

Protein-protein interactions determine the specificity of many cellular signaling events. One set of such interactions is mediated by RACKs 2The abbreviations used are: RACK, receptor for activated C kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; pAnxV, peptide designed from annexin V sequence; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CPK, creatine phosphokinase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; MBP, myelin basic protein. (receptors for activated C-kinase) that localize different activated protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes to distinct subcellular sites and determine isozyme-specific roles by anchoring each active PKC next to its corresponding substrates (1Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Other examples of anchoring proteins include AKAPs (2Scott J.D. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 227-239PubMed Google Scholar), and STICKs (3Chapline C. Cottom J. Tobin H. Hulmes J. Crabb J. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19482-19489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The importance of anchoring for downstream signaling is well recognized (4Pawson T. Scott J.D.

PKC isozymes are usually found in the cell cytosol when inactive. Following the generation of the second messenger diacylglycerol, active PKCs translocate to the cell particulate fraction (6Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Although the molecular basis of PKC translocation has not been elucidated, the critical role of PKC-RACK interaction in mediating specific PKC functions both in vitro and in vivo has been demonstrated using peptides designed to inhibit or increase PKC-RACK binding (7Chen L. Hahn H. Wu G. Chen C.H. Liron T. Schechtman D. Cavallaro G. Banci L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We previously found that both of the isozyme-specific RACKs identified to date (βIIRACK and ϵRACK) share a short sequence of homology with their corresponding PKCs (10Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J.

The RACK homologous sequences in the corresponding PKCs were termed pseudoRACK sequences (ψRACKs) (8Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat.

Peptides corresponding to the ψRACK site act as allosteric agonists by interfering with the auto-inhibitory intramolecular interaction between the ψRACK site and the RACK binding site within PKC, thus stabilizing a state in PKC in which the RACK binding site is available for protein-protein interaction (8Souroujon M.C.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3418-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Though much is known about its downstream signaling events, the process of δPKC translocation and activation, and the proteins that regulate it have not been identified. A potential insight into the δPKC translocation process came from the observation that the small molecule JTV-519 (also known as K201) has been shown to protect hearts from ischemia and reperfusion damage (24Inagaki K. Kihara Y. Izumi T. Sasayama S. Cardiovasc Drugs Ther. 2000; 14: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and to modulate the translocation of δPKC (25Inagaki K. Kihara Y. Hayashida W. Izumi T. Iwanaga Y. Yoneda T. Takeuchi Y. Suyama K. Muso E. Sasayama S. Circulation. 2000; 101: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that JTV-519 binds to δPKC directly, and therefore it is a possibility that JTV-519 modulates δPKC translocation indirectly through a change in protein-protein interaction during the activation process of δPKC. In a separate study, JTV-519 has been reported to modulate annexin V function (26Kaneko N. Matsuda R. Toda M. Shimamoto K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Kaneko N. Ago H. Matsuda R. Inagaki E. Miyano M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although we do not have access to JTV-519 for this study, based on the observations described above, we hypothesized that annexin V plays a role in the δPKC translocation process. Indirect evidence made this hypothesis plausible: members of the annexin family of proteins, like the PKC family, bind phospholipids, participate in a variety of similar cellular functions and co-localize with some PKC isozymes in cells (28John C. Cover P. Solito E. Morris J. Christian H. Flower R. Buckingham J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3060-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Prevostel C. Alice V. Joubert D. Parker P.J. J.

Members of the annexin family are also substrates of select PKC isozymes, and their cellular activity can be regulated by this PKC-mediated phosphorylation (31Antonicelli F. Omri B. Breton M.F. Martiny L. Rothhut B. Russo-Marie F. Lambert B. Pavlovic-Hournac M. Haye B. Reprod. Nutr. Dev. 1990; 30: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 32Barnes J.A. Michiel D.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 3936-3945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence for a role of annexins in PKC function has been suggested. Here, we determined that annexin V interacts with δPKC and studied the consequences of this protein-protein interaction on δPKC translocation and function. Our results have led us to propose that transient δPKC-annexin V interaction is an essential step in δPKC translocation and function. Materials—Anti-MBP antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs. Other antibodies, siRNA for annexins, and protein G-agarose beads were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. pAnxV and pEAnxV peptides were synthesized and conjugated by a Cys S-S bond to TAT47-57 (34Chen L.

Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Annexin V, a kind gift from Joel Ernst, was purified from Escherichia coli as described (37Burger A. Berendes R. Voges D. Huber R. Demange P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, transformed E. coli were grown to OD 0.8, then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, pellets lysed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The bacterial lysate was incubated with a liposome column (phospholipids were prepared as described (38Kikkawa U. Go M. Koumoto J. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), then conjugated to activated HZ beads (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, annexin V was eluted in wash buffer containing 10 μm CaCl2. MBP-δV1, MBP-ϵV1, and GST-δV5 lysates were induced as described for annexin V, and purified using amylose (New England Biolabs) and glutathione (Amersham Biosciences) beads, respectively. A partial PKC purification was conducted as described (38Kikkawa U. Go M. Koumoto J. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). ELISA—0.1 μg of pure annexin V was bound to an ELISA plate in carbonate buffer at 4 °C overnight, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Bacterial lysate expressing δPKC was incubated in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) in the presence of 10 μm CaCl2 for 1 h 37 °C with 0.5 μm peptides where appropriate, and washed with 100 mm HEPES. Amount of δPKC bound was then determined with anti-δPKC antibodies, and followed with a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and developed for 3 h using PNPP (Pierce). Overlay—All bacterial lysates were prepared as described above. Binding of δ and ϵPKC fragments and full-length enzyme to annexin V was determined as described (39Schechtman D. Murriel C. Bright R. Mochly-Rosen D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, annexin V bacterial lysate was chromatographed on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with recombinant PKC isoforms or fragments in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+ and phospholipids where necessary. After washing as described (39Schechtman D. Murriel C. Bright R. Mochly-Rosen D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar), the strips were probed with anti-MBP, anti-GST, or anti-PKC antibodies and visualized by ECL. Co-immunoprecipitation of the δPKC and Annexin V Complex—CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) were grown in F-12 (HAM) nutrient mixture supplemented with Glutamax, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, all from Invitrogen). Cells were cultured at 37 °C 5% CO2. 48 h prior to experiments, cells were serum-starved. They were stimulated with 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (LC Laboratories) or with 5 mm H2O2 (Sigma) for the indicated duration, as described by Konishi et al. (40Konishi H. Tanaka M.

Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized on ice with trituration in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1% formaldehyde). We found that 0.1% Triton extracts all the translocatable PKC from the cell. After 30 min at 4 °C, the lysates were quenched with 0.14 m glycine for 20 min at 4 °C, and samples spun at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of anti-δPKC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, followed by protein G beads (Invitrogen) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton), and separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-annexin V (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by visualization with ECL. Translocation of δPKC—Cells were fractionated as described in Ref. 41Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar. Briefly, after stimulation, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in homogenization buffer as described above (but without cross-linker), and spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, resulting in the soluble fraction. The pellet was then resuspended in homogenization buffer with 1% Triton X-100, and spun under the same conditions. Where applicable, the cells were preincubated with 1 μm peptide for 15 min prior to stimulation. The samples were then analyzed by Western blot, and loading corrected based on protein concentration, using an internal control such as actin or by Bradford. siRNA Knockdown of Annexin Protein Level—40% confluent CHO (as described above) or HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate). Cells were transfected using GeneSilencer (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 20 nm siRNA for annexin family members (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 24-h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h. CHO cells were then stimulated with 10 nm PMA and HeLa cells with 100 μm UDP (Sigma) for the indicated times and fractionated as described above. Microscopy and Analysis—CHO cells were grown on chambered no. 1 borosilicate coverglass (Lab-Tek), transfected at 50% confluency using FuGENE 6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions with CFP-annexin V and YFP-δPKC cloned into the pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 vectors, respectively (Clontech), and serum-starved for 24 h. Real-time confocal imaging was conducted on a spinning disk Nipkow confocal microscope. Cells were viewed using an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope with a ×40 oil immersion Olympus objective (1.35 NA), and images were acquired with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu) and 2×2 pixel binning. CFP was excited with the 442 nm laser line of a helium-cadmium laser (Kimmon), whereas YFP was imaged with the 514 nm line of an argon ion laser (Melles-Griot). Images were acquired at 27 °C every 5-10 s for 10 min. 100 nm PMA was added to the cell chamber after the 10th image in each time series. Where indicated, the cells were pretreated with nocodazole (10 μm, 30 min). Exposure time was adjusted for photobleaching levels lower than 10%. Fluorescence intensity was measured using Metamorph[regs] data analysis software (Universal Imaging). To monitor the translocation of PKC and increases in FRET signal, a small region of interest was selected from each cell and fluorescence intensity values graphed against time and normalized to the initial fluorescence. FRET was calculated using the formula that corrects for bleed-through and donor concentration as previously described (42Zal T. Gascoigne N.R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3923-3939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) in Equation 1.FRET=(I(442-530)-αI(442-480)-βI(515-530))/I(442-480)(Eq. 1) α and β coefficients were calculated from singly transfected cells, where α = I(442-530)/I(442-480) = 47.6% of CFP bleed-through into the YFP channel, and β = I(442-530)/I(515-530) = 14.4% of YFP excitation from the CFP channel. Ex Vivo Model of Ischemia and Reperfusion—Wistar rats (300-350 g) were heparinized (2000 units/kg IP) and then anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg IP). The hearts were rapidly excised and then perfused with an oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution containing (in mmol/liter) NaCl 120, KCl 5.8, NaHCO3 25, NaH2PO4 1.2, MgSO4 1.2, CaCl2 1.0, and dextrose 10, pH 7.4, at 37 °C in a Langendorff coronary perfusion system (43Hondeghem L.M. Cotner C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: H574-H580PubMed Google Scholar). The coronary flow rate was kept constant during the experiment at 10 ml/min. Hearts were submerged into a heat-jacketed organ bath set at 37 °C. Coronary effluent was collected to determine creatine phosphokinase (CPK) release from necrotic cells. After 10 min of equilibration, the hearts were subjected to a 30-min global ischemia and a 60-min reperfusion to measure ischemic damage and CPK release during reperfusion. The hearts were perfused with 1 μm TAT47-57 carrier peptide conjugated to pAnxV, TAT47-57 peptide conjugated to EpAnxV, TAT47-57 peptide alone, or vehicle for either 10 min prior to ischemia and/or during the first 10 min of reperfusion. Infarct Size Measurement—At the end of the reperfusion period, hearts were sliced into 1-mm thick transverse sections and incubated in triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution (1% in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 15 min, as reported previously (44Inagaki K. Hahn H.S. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Infarct size was expressed as a percentage of the total LV muscle mass. Statistical Analysis—For quantitative analysis, autoradiographs were scanned and quantified using NIH Image software. Statistical significance for all analyses was calculated using 2-tail type 2 Student's t test (Microsoft Excel). A Short Homologous Sequence Indicative of Protein-Protein Interaction Is Found in Annexin V and δPKC—As mentioned above, PKCs and their corresponding PKC-binding proteins, RACKs, share a short sequence of homology (6-8 amino acids long, Ref. 8Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The RACK-like sequence on the PKC was termed ψRACK, as it participates in an inhibitory intramolecular interaction with the RACK binding site on the PKC. This intramolecular interaction is broken upon PKC activation, allowing PKC binding to its RACK. We reasoned that if annexin V binds selectively to δPKC during its activation process, annexin V might also have a short δPKC homologous sequence. Using LALIGN (36Huang X.W.M. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar), we searched for a short homology between annexin V and δPKC. We focused on the V1/C2 domain of δPKC (amino acids 1-123), because that domain is critical for δPKC anchoring and mediation of many critical intracellular processes (45Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 46Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 47Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). A portion of the highest ranked region of homology from the LALIGN output features the characteristic charge difference (glutamate, Glu78 in δPKC to arginine, Arg161 in annexin V) (red in Fig. 1A), which we have previously found to be indicative of a potential protein-protein interaction site for PKC (8Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 10Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Importantly, as expected for a selective protein-protein interaction, the δPKC homologous sequence in annexin V is unique and not found in other members of the annexin family (Fig. 1B), and is conserved among different species (Fig. 1C). Surprisingly, the annexin V-like homology sequence in δPKC is located within the previously identified ψδRACK sequence (δPKC-(74-81); Ref. 7Chen L. Hahn H. Wu G. Chen C.H. Liron T. Schechtman D. Cavallaro G. Banci L. Guo Y. Bolli R. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11114-11119Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), further suggesting that that annexin V might be a δPKC-binding protein. In addition, the ψδRACK-like sequence in annexin V is in close proximity (3.2 Å, Fig. 1E) to the binding site on annexin V for JTV-519 (27Kaneko N. Ago H. Matsuda R. Inagaki E. Miyano M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a compound that regulates δPKC function (25Inagaki K. Kihara Y. Hayashida W. Izumi T. Iwanaga Y. Yoneda T. Takeuchi Y. Suyama K. Muso E. Sasayama S. Circulation. 2000; 101: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating the potential importance of the ψδRACK-like sequence on annexin V for δPKC binding. We therefore hypothesized that there is a specific protein-protein interaction between δPKC and annexin V that is mediated, at least in part, via the region of annexin V that is homologous between the two proteins. δPKC Binds Annexin V in Vitro—We first set out to determine whether δPKC binds annexin V in vitro, using immobilized annexin V and recombinant full-length δPKC as well as the δV1 (the C2 domain of δPKC), δV5, and ϵV1 fragments. All these domains have been previously shown to participate in important protein-protein interactions (45Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 46Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 48Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29644-29650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Domains V1/C2 and V5 of δPKC (Fig. 1F, red), as well as full-length δPKC bound to annexin V (Fig. 1G). In contrast, the V1 region of another member of the novel PKC isozymes, ϵPKC, did not bind to annexin V (Fig. 1G), indicating selectivity of this interaction. Phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol micelles, to which both annexin V and δPKC can bind independently, did not affect δPKC-annexin V association in vitro (data not shown), suggesting that annexin V binding to δPKC does not depend on a lipid bridge between these two lipid-binding proteins (49Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Association of δPKC-Annexin V Precedes δPKC Translocation in Cells—We next determined whether, in the absence of overexpression of any of the proteins in question, δPKC and annexin V interact in cells. The complexes formed with δPKC were then immunoprecipitated with anti-δPKC antibodies and probed for the presence of annexin V at the combined molecular mass of ∼110 kDa. Stimulation of CHO cells with PMA, 10 nm caused about a 4-fold increase in the amount of annexin V-δPKC complex within 0.5 min of treatment (Fig. 2A, left). The interaction was short-lived, and after 1 min of stimulation the amount of annexin V-δPKC complex was reduced often below the levels obtained prior to PMA treatment. Transient association between annexin V and δPKC was also observed following activation of δPKC with H2O2 (5 mm, 0.5-1 min of treatment, Fig. 2A, right). Therefore, annexin V-δPKC interaction occurs early after cell stimulation, regardless of the means used to stimulate δPKC. Activation of PKC results in its translocation from the cell soluble to the cell particulate fraction (6Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the timing of annexin V-δPKC complex formation relative to the timing of δPKC translocation to the particulate fraction. Whereas maximum annexin V-δPKC complex accumulation was found between 0.5 and 1 min (Fig. 2, A and C), translocation of δPKC from the soluble to the cell particulate fraction occurred later; it began only after 1 min of PMA stimulation and reached a maximum after 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 2, B and C). Based on the above observations, we concluded that formation of the δPKC-annexin V complex preceded δPKC translocation from the cytosol to the cell particulate fraction.

HTLV-I-associated neurological disorders HAM/TSP are characterized by polyclonal expansion of infected cells, high proviral loads, and virus-specific immune responses, including increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and HTLV-I-specific CTL (4Nagai M.

Nature. 1990; 348: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar).

It has also been shown that HTLV-I infected dendritic cells from HAM/TSP patients exhibit an enhanced capacity to stimulate antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation, which leads to autoimmunity (8Mostoller K. Norbury C.C. Jain P. Wigdahl B. J. Neurovirol. 2004; 10: 358-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast ATL pathogenesis is characterized by monoclonal expansion of infected cells, very low proviral loads, absence of pro-inflammatory cytokines (9Tendler C.L. Greenberg S.J. Burton J.D. Danielpour D. Kim S.J. Blattner W.A. Manns A. Waldmann T.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 46: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and very low frequency of virus-specific CTL (10Kannagi M.

HTLV-I-infected monocytes produce dysfunctional dendritic cells because of improper differentiation, which do not stimulate autologous T-cells (12Makino M. Ryoikibetsu. Shokogun. Shirizu. 2000; 31: 9-12Google Scholar). HTLV-I-infected ATL patients have pronounced immunodeficiency associated with frequent opportunistic infections by various pathogens, including Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Mycobacterium avium, and Aspergillus, Cytomegalovirus, and Strongyloides (13White J.D.

Hematol. 2005; 78: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). HTLV-I regulatory protein p30 has been shown to suppress virus expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Hence, it is anticipated, though not yet demonstrated, that p30 expression and or its functions are increased in ATL patients. The host immune system detects and responds to microbial infection mainly through a family of pattern recognition receptors called Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Signaling by these receptors induces antimicrobial genes, inflammatory cytokines, and dendritic cell maturation, which are necessary for initiating an adaptive immunity (15Iwasaki Y. Sawada K. Aiba I. Mukai E. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y. Sobue G. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl). 2004; 108: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Among the 10 TLRs identified in humans, TLR4 is the major lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor and elicits innate immune response against Gram-negative bacteria. TLR4 is expressed by B cells, myeloid dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and T-cells. Several recent reports indicate that TLR4 is targeted by viruses such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (16Kurt-Jones E.A. Popova L. Kwinn L. Haynes L.M. Jones L.P. Tripp R.A. Walsh E.E.

Medzhitov R.M. Chervonsky A.V. Golovkina T.V. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that TLR4 expression from its promoter is mainly regulated by the transcription factor PU.1 (19Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). PU.1 is a member of the ets family of transcription factors with a restricted expression to B lymphocytes, macrophages and all hematopoietic lineages except T-cell lines and mature T-lymphocytes. PU.1 levels increase during granulocytic/monocytic differentiation of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells and decline during erythroid differentiation (20Chen J. Zekeng L. Yamashita M. Takehisa J. Miura T. Ido E. Mboudjeka I. Tsague J.M. Hayami M. Kaptue L. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The human PU.1 protein consists of glutamine-rich and acidic residues toward the N-terminal necessary for transactivation, and DNA binding (ets) domain at the C-terminal (21Klemsz M.J. Maki R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PU.1 regulates the expression of lymphoid as well as myeloid genes. Among some of the human myeloid genes regulated by PU.1 are M-CSF receptor, G-CSF receptor, GM-CSF receptor, IL-1β, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Although CD4+ T lymphocytes represent the primary target for HTLV-I infection, the virus can infect other cell types including CD8+ T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, and central nervous system (CNS) astrocytes, and monocyte lineage cells such as tissue macrophages (22Ferreira Jr., O.C.

Lemp Jr., J.F. Gallo R.C. Franchini G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 1845-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In vitro infection of HTLV-I in human monocytes, macrophages and microglial cells has also been demonstrated (26Hoffman P.M. Dhib-Jalbut S. Mikovits J.A. Robbins D.S. Wolf A.L. Bergey G.K. Lohrey N.C. Weislow O.S. Ruscetti F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11784-11788Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Of note spliced viral mRNAs encoding for p40tax, p27rex, p12, and p30 were also identified in human macrophages infected with HTLV-I (25Koralnik I.J. Lemp Jr., J.F. Gallo R.C. Franchini G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 1845-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, we report that HTLV-I p30 protein targets the TLR4 signaling pathway. We found that virus-encoded protein p30 binds to and inhibits PU.1 DNA binding activity and PU.1-dependent transcription, leading to the down-regulation of TLR4 cell surface expression. As a result LPS-stimulated macrophages expressing p30 have a marked decrease in pro-inflammatory and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines released. This strategy may help the virus to evade the host innate immune responses and could make innate immune cells tolerant to opportunistic infections in ATL patients. Cell Lines—The human 293T and COS-7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The human monocytic cell line, THP-1 was maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, and was passaged every 3 days. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Full-length p30 cDNA sequence was cloned in-frame to LexA in between EcoRI and XhoI site of the pHybLex/Zeo vector (Invitrogen). This bait plasmid construct was transformed into L40 yeast strain (Invitrogen) and the bait-LexA fusion protein expression was confirmed by Western blot. To test for nonspecific activation of the bait, β-galactosidase filter assay was performed. Yeast two-hybrid interactor hunt was done using a normal adult human spleen cDNA library in pYESTrp2 plasmid (Invitrogen) as prey and with our already tested bait. The potent interactors were selected on several YC(-WHUK) selective plates and confirmed by β-galactosidase filter assay. The interactor cDNA was retrieved from yeast by PCR amplification, cloned into pCR2.1TA vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. Data base searches were performed using BLASTX. Co-immunoprecipitation and p30-hPU.1 in Vivo Binding—293T cells (1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were transfected with equal amounts (5 μg) of p30HA and/or hPU.1/c-Myb expression plasmids using a calcium-phosphate precipitation method (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 36-h post-transfection, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and sodium orthovanadate phosphatase inhibitor. Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science), and the immune complexes were captured with protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen). After washing three times, the beads were boiled in SDS-sample loading buffer, resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and detected by Western blot with PU.1 (T-21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody or human c-Myb (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Expression and Purification of hPU.1 Deletion Mutants—The full-length hPU.1 and the truncated mutants of hPU.1 were generated by PCR and cloned in-frame into BamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The respective GST-deletion constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Expression of the fusion proteins was then induced for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C. The cells were sonicated in 1× PBS, centrifuged, and the supernatants for respective constructs were mixed with a slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS and incubated at room temperature. After centrifugation, the respective pellets were washed three times with 5 volumes of 1× PBS with Complete and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione (Amersham Biosciences) in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4). The purified proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie staining. PU.1 deletion mutants with Myc tag were constructed by cloning the truncated ΔE and ΔA fragments of PU.1 into the SalI/NotI sites of pCMV/myc/cyto vector. The expression of these mutants was confirmed by Western blot with Myc antibody (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In Vitro and in Vivo Binding Assay—p30-HA was in vitro transcribed and translated by using TnT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation kit (Promega). For in vitro binding, the in vitro translated p30-HA was mixed with anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and 100 ng of purified hPU.1-GST or truncated hPU.1-GST mutants in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6; 50 mm NaCl; 0.5 mm EDTA; 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol) containing 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and Complete protease inhibitor. After overnight binding at 4 °C, protein G-agarose slurry was added, and the mixture incubated for 2 h with rotation at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed two times for 15 min with the binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. The beads were boiled in loading dye, resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western immunoblot using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal HA antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science). For in vivo binding the Myc-tagged PU.1 deletion constructs were transfected in 293T cells with or without p30-HA, and the lysates in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer were co-immunoprecipitated with HA (12CA5) antibody followed by Western blot with anti-Myc (A-14) antibody. Luciferase Assays and Western Blots—Luciferase assays to detect the effect of p30 on PU.1 expression was carried out in COS-7 cells with a trimerized PU.1 responsive-luciferase element, pTKPU.1 × 3 Luc, a gift by Dr. T Oikawa. COS-7 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish and transfected using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). The amounts of different constructs transfected are as indicated in Fig. 4. 36-h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1× luciferase lysis buffer (Promega) and analyzed using the Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized with protein concentration. Data represent results obtained from two independent experiments. To study the effect of p30 on TLR4 expression, transient transfection of human monocytic THP-1 cells was carried out using Effectene (Qiagen) with TLR4-P-Luc reporter construct (gift of Dr. M Rehli). THP-1 cells were diluted with RPMI-10% fetal bovine serum the day before transfection. Next day the cells were centrifuged, washed two times with 1× PBS and seeded at a density of 5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish. Transfection was carried out at a ratio of 8 (enhancer):25 (effectene) for 1 μg of transfected DNA. The cells were lysed 36-h post-transfection and analyzed as described above. Data (Fig. 5B) represent results from two independent experiments. To show that similar effects could be seen with physiological expression of p30, luciferase assay was carried out with TLR4-P-Luc reporter construct in THP-1 cells with wild type (pHTLV-X1MT) and p30/p12-deleted (pHTLV-ΔPSX) HTLV-I molecular clones. Western blots were carried out with equal amounts of protein extracts to confirm the expression of transfected constructs. As a negative control, we used pGL3-MRE (myb-responsive element) luciferase plasmid (27Nicot C. Mahieux R. Pise-Masison C. Brady J. Gessain A. Yamaoka S. Franchini G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7391-7402Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and repeated the same experiment with a dose-dependent increase of p30. PU.1 was detected with T-21 antibody, c-Myb with C-19, p30 with 3F10, actin with C-11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-tubulin with H-235 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To show that the activation of TLR4 promoter was specific, as a negative control (interferon regulatory factor-1) IRF-1 was cloned between SalI-NotI sites of pCMV/myc/cyto and the IRF-1 Myc-tagged expression plasmid was used in increasing doses along with a TLR4-luciferase promoter reporter construct. Western blots to detect phospho-GSK3 (Ser9) and phosphoglycogen synthase (Ser641) were carried out using phosphospecific antibodies from Cell Signaling.FIGURE 5p30 inhibition of PU.1 down-regulates TLR4 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells. A, dose-dependent repression of PU.1 transcription by p30 in THP-1 cells expressing endogenous PU.1. THP-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pTKLuc or pTKPU.1 × 3 Luc plasmids where indicated and increasing amounts (0.25 and 0.5 μg) of p30 plasmid. Expression levels of p30 and endogenous PU.1 were confirmed by Western blot. B, p30 expression represses TLR4 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. THP-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg each of pGL3-basic or pGL3-TLR4Luc reporter constructs and increasing amounts (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 μg, respectively) of p30-HA expression plasmid where indicated. Expression levels of transfected p30 and endogenous PU.1 were examined by Western blots. C, real-time quantitation of repression of TLR4 transcription by p30 in THP-1 cells. Total RNA was extracted from untransfected and p30 (0.5 μg) transfected THP-1 cells by TRIzol, DNaseI-treated, and reverse-transcribed. The resulting cDNA was analyzed by real-time PCR using human TLR4 and GAPDH primer sets. The authenticity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis. D, as a negative control, dose-dependent increase in similar increasing amounts of p30-HA expression plasmid does not repress transcription from a pGL3-myb-responsive element (MRE) Luc reporter construct. Endogenous c-Myb detected by anti-c-Myb antibody (C-19) and actin by C-11. E, TLR4 promoter activity is not affected by increasing amounts of IRF-1 (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 μg respectively).

The nuclear mixtures with biotin-labeled probe were preincubated on ice for 2 h with gentle agitation. 60 μl of 50% slurry of streptavidin magnetic beads (Roche) was added to the nuclear lysates and kept on ice for 1 h. The beads were collected by a magnet, washed two times with binding buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and loaded on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted, and detected for PU.1 using T-21 antibody (Fig. 4, C and D). Flow Cytometry for TLR4 Cell Surface Expression—Human monocytic THP-1 cells were transfected with p30 (0.5 μg) using Nucleofector Kit V (Amaxa Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For this study, untransfected and p30 transfected THP-1 cells were unstimulated or stimulated with 5 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (CalBiochem) for 3 h after 15 h post-transfection. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 600 rpm, washed two times with 1× PBS and incubated with anti-human TLR4 monoclonal antibody HTA125 (BD Biosciences) or isotype control at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 1 h on ice. Cells were then washed twice and incubated with FITC-conjugated mouse IgG (BD Biosciences) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml for 1 h on ice. Cells were then washed twice and analyzed by a flow cytometer equipped with the manufacturer's software (FACS Diva, Becton Dickinson) for data acquisition and analysis. As a negative control, the surface expression of CD14 was analyzed as described above with CD14-FITC-conjugated antibody by flow cytometry in THP-1-untransfected or p30-transfected cells by Nucleofector kit V. To demonstrate physiological relevance of p30′ effects, the TLR4 surface expression was measured as described above by flow cytometry in THP-1 cells by nucleofection of wild type (pHTLV-X1MT) and p30/p12-deleted (pHTLV-ΔPSX) HTLV-I molecular clones. Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from untransfected and p30 transfected THP-1 cells by TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen). The total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was analyzed by real-time PCR using human TLR4 and GAPDH primer sets (Superarray BioScience). The authenticity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis. Cytokine Profile Analysis—THP-1 cells (2 × 106) were plated into 24-well dishes and were transfected with p30 by Nucleofector kit. After 12 h of post-transfection, cells were stimulated with LPS (Sigma). Supernatants were collected at intervals of 3 h and were analyzed for the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-8, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), and IL-10 using the Beadlyte™ human multicytokine detection system 3 from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the multicytokine 3 standard was resuspended in assay buffer and then serially diluted from 2500 to 15.6 pg/ml. 50 μl of standard or sample was added to each well of a 96-well plate with 25 μl of the bead solution and was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The Beadlyte™ reporter solution was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h. Beadlyte™ streptavidin-phycoerythrin was diluted 1:25 in assay buffer and was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before the addition of the Beadlyte™ stop solution. The plate was then analyzed on the Luminex LabMAP™ system (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) and analyzed using Beadview multiplex data analysis software (Upstate). Statistical Data—Statistical analyses were performed by using Student's t tests or one-way variance analysis (independent group analysis). Statistical significance was considered to be p < 0.05. Interaction between p30 and Transcription Factor PU.1 in a Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—To identify binding partners of the HTLV-1 p30, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the full-length p30 protein as bait. L40 yeast cells were co-transformed by a plasmid encoding a chimera between p30 and the Lex A transcription factor DNA binding domain, along with a normal spleen-derived cDNA library fused in-frame to the Gal-4 activation domain (Invitrogen). The fusion protein LexA-p30 was expressed in L40 yeast strain as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Following screening on selective media (Fig. 1B), β-galactosidase-positive clones were retrieved by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. One of the isolated clones was found to correspond to a fragment of the PU.1 transcription factor. This clone was selected for further analysis on the basis of its hematopoietic restricted expression and also because of the fact that p30 has been reported to act as a transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression. We next determined if HTLV-1 p30, without being fused to Lex A, could associate with PU.1 in mammalian cells. 293T cells, which do not express endogenous PU.1, were transfected with an untagged PU.1 expression vector with or without an HA-tagged p30 vector. In vivo interaction was detected by co-immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA antibody followed by Western blot to detect untagged PU.1. As expected, HA antibody immunoprecipitated p30 only from transfected cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). PU.1 was readily immunoprecipitated and detected by Western blot only when both p30 and PU.1 were coexpressed (Fig. 1C, lane 4). Levels of p30 and PU.1 were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 1C, lower panels). To ensure that interactions were specific we coexpressed c-Myb and p30 in 293T cells. Under the same conditions in which p30 interacted with PU.1, no binding was detected between p30 and c-Myb (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that p30 and PU.1 specifically interact in transfected cells and that p30 does not affect the expression level of PU.1 when expression of the latter is driven by a CMV promoter. P30 Interacts with the ets Domain of PU.1—To identify which domain of PU.1 is involved in binding p30 we constructed several GST fusion constructs deleted for the transactivation, the DNA binding or both domains (Fig. 2A). These vectors were expressed in BL-21 bacteria (Fig. 2B) and purified to near homogeneity as shown by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2C). In vitro binding assays were performed using the different GST-PU.1 purified proteins along with rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translated p30HA protein and binding of p30 was detected by Western blot using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2D). As expected from results presented in Fig. 1, p30 interacted with the full-length GST-PU.1 but not to GST control (Fig. 2D). In fact, this result indicated that the ets domain of PU.1 is required and is sufficient for in vitro binding of p30. Comparable input of in vitro translated p30 and of each GST-PU.1 fusion protein used in each binding reaction was confirmed by Western blot using HA and GST antibody, respectively (Fig. 2, E and F). To further confirm the binding site in vivo, Myc-tagged PU.1 trun-cated mutants were constructed (Fig. 3A) and coexpressed along with p30 in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that p30 interacts with the ets domain of PU.1 (Fig. 3B). Levels of expression of both PU.1 truncated mutants were not affected by p30 (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3PU.1 ets domain is necessary and sufficient for in vivo binding to p30. A, schematic of human PU.1 protein and its functional domains. PU.1 deletion mutants with Myc tag are designated according to amino acid residues. B, 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg each of Myc-tagged PU.1 deletion constructs with or without 5μg of p30-HA construct. Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) followed by immunoblot by anti-Myc (A-14) showed that the ets-domain of human PU.1 physically interacts with p30.

https://openalex.org/W1990850715,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is an invasive malignancy of epidermal keratinocytes. Surgical excision is currently the main treatment; however, this can cause scarring and disfigurement. There is accordingly, an acute need for alternative strategies to treat SCC. The transcription factor c-Jun is expressed in human SCC and another common form of invasive skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma together with the mitogenic marker-proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Here, we have employed DNAzymes (catalytic DNA molecules) targeting c-Jun (Dz13) to inhibit c-Jun expression in SCC cells. Dz13 inhibits SCC proliferation and suppresses solid SCC tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in severe combined immunodeficient mice. We further demonstrate that Dz13 inhibits c-Jun, together with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression in the tumors, consistent with DNAzyme inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity by zymography. Dz13 also suppressed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 in the tumors. These findings demonstrate that c-Jun regulates SCC growth and suggest that DNAzymes targeting this transcription factor may potentially be useful as inhibitors of cutaneous carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2004478460,"Cell proliferation, an event associated with angiogenesis, involves coordinated activities of a number of proteins. The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in angiogenesis remains controversial. Utilizing proliferating PAI-1−/− endothelial cells (EC), the impact of a host PAI-1 deficiency on Akt activation was evaluated. Hyperactivation of Akt(Ser(P)473) was observed in PAI-1−/− EC, and this was probably due to enhanced inactivation of tumor suppressor PTEN, thus rendering the cells resistant to apoptotic signals. Higher levels of inactivated caspase-9 in PAI-1−/− EC led to lower levels of procaspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3, thereby promoting survival. These effects were reversed when recombinant PAI-1 was added to PAI-1−/− EC. Additional studies demonstrated that regulation of proliferation is dependent on its interaction with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Thus, PAI-1 is a negative regulator of cell growth, exerting its effect on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway and allowing controlled cell proliferation.

Angiogenesis is an important biological process involving the formation of new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, and it occurs in normal as well as pathophysiological settings. It involves a highly orchestrated series of events, including the stimulation of endothelial cells (EC) 2The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell(s); LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; rPAI-1, recombinant PAI-1; PAI-1−/−, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 homozygous deficient; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; VEGF, vascular endothelial cell growth factor; WM, wortmannin; WT, wild-type; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; CM, complete medium. by growth factors, degradation of the extracellular matrix, migration and proliferation of EC, and formation of new capillary tubes (1Carmeliet P.

Components of the fibrinolytic pathway have been implicated in the formation of angiogenic vessels, notably plasminogen activators, viz. urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator. The activation product, plasmin, a trypsin-like serine protease, facilitates degradation of the extracellular matrix, either directly or indirectly through activation of matrix metalloproteases. This process allows migration of EC and subsequent events leading to neovessel formation. However, specific inhibitors control proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, and PAI-1 is an important inhibitor of the plasminogen activation system (3Loskutoff D.J. van Mourik J.A. Erickson L.A.

Considering the important role of the plasminogen activator-PAI-1 system in angiogenesis and the availability of genetically engineered mice lacking various components of this system, several investigators have utilized transgenic approaches to establish the functional potential of components of the plasminogen activator-PAI-1 system in angiogenesis.

Similarly, T241 fibrosarcoma tumor growth was suppressed in PAI-1−/− mice relative to WT mice (6Gutierrez L.S. Schulman A. Brito-Robinson T. Noria F. Ploplis V.A. Castellino F.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5839-5847PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies demonstrated a lack of microvessel generation in an aortic ring assay derived from aortas of PAI-1−/− mice (7Devy L. Blacher S.

Laser-induced choroidal neoangiogenesis was also reduced in PAI-1−/− mice (14Lambert V. Munaut C. Carmeliet P. Gerard R.D. Declerck P.J. Gils A. Claes C. Foidart J.-M. Noel A. Rakic J.M. Invest.

This is in concordance with clinical studies that correlate high levels of PAI-1 with disease recurrence and reduced survival for patients from a variety of tumors (15Harbeck N. Alt U. Beger U.

Since vascular EC are the principal initiators of angiogenesis, they are highly relevant cells in which to gain insight into the role of PAI-1 in cell functions associated with the angiogenic process. This laboratory has previously reported that a complete deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with increased proliferation of aortic EC in vitro (16Ploplis V.A. Balsara R.D. Sandoval-Cooper M.J. Yin Z.J.

In particular, it has been demonstrated that vascular EC growth factor (VEGF), via the phosphotyrosine kinase KDR/Flk-1 receptor, activates Akt and induces an antiapoptotic response in different cell types (19Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). More recently, the role of VEGF receptor-3 has been elucidated in proliferation, migration, and survival of primary EC via activation of the Erk, Akt, and Jnk pathways (20Salameh A. Galvagni F. Bardelli M. Bussolino F. Oliviero S. Blood. 2005; 106: 3423-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In PAI-1−/− EC, interaction of VEGF with VEGF receptor-1 stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt (16Ploplis V.A. Balsara R.D. Sandoval-Cooper M.J. Yin Z.J. Batten J. Modi N. Gadoua D. Donahue D. Martin J.A. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6143-6151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been documented that activated Akt phosphorylates a number of downstream substrates involved in cell survival, cell cycle progression, glucose metabolism, and protein synthesis, which are biological functions of the EC that contribute to angiogenesis (21Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 22Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The crucial role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in cell survival is supported by the observation that the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten), which is inactivated in a number of human cancers, possesses a 3′-phosphoinositide-phosphatase activity, thereby inactivating the PI3K/Akt pathway (23Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2600) Google Scholar). It is also known that Akt promotes survival through inactivation of caspase-9 (24Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar), activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (25Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), and different components of the apoptotic machinery, such as BAD and forkhead transcription factor (27Brunet A.

Although a number of earlier studies have focused on the effect of PAI-1 or its deficiency on tumor development and vascularization, wound healing, and inflammation, our study is the first to mechanistically underline the effect of PAI-1 on EC survival via the PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathway (16Ploplis V.A. Balsara R.D. Sandoval-Cooper M.J. Yin Z.J. Batten J. Modi N. Gadoua D. Donahue D. Martin J.A. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6143-6151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (this study). Given that a proangiogenic signal (VEGF) in proliferating PAI-1−/− EC stimulates activation of Akt, the current study focused on an investigation of the EC-based consequences of this enhanced activation. The results of these investigations are presented herein. The α-tubulin antibody was obtained from Sigma and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antibodies against mouse Akt, mouse Akt(Ser(P)473), human PTEN, human PTEN(Ser(P)380), mouse caspase-9, human caspase-9(Thr(P)125), and human caspase-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Where required, the secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). The rabbit 2629 antihuman LRP polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. D. K. Strickland. Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for the Western blots. To prepare complete medium (CM), RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) was supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (100 units of penicillin, 0.1 mg of streptomycin, 0.25 μg of amphotericin B), 50 μg/ml endothelial growth factor supplement (BD Biosciences), 2 mm glutamine (Mediatech), 0.1 mm amino acids (Invitrogen), and 1 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). EC serum-free defined medium was purchased from Cell Applications (San Diego, CA). Recombinant WT murine PAI-1 and the variants, recombinant PAI-1 (R76E) and recombinant PAI-1 (R346A) were expressed and purified as described (28Xu Z. Balsara R.D. Gorlatova N.V. Lawrence D.A. Castellino F.J. Ploplis V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17914-17920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Endotoxin levels were evaluated using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate kit QCL-1000 (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). Final endotoxin levels of the PAI-1 protein preparations used were less than 0.01 enzyme units/ml. The characteristics of PAI-1−/− mice have been previously described (29Carmeliet P. Kieckens L. Schoonjans L. Ream B. van Nuffelen A. Prendergast G. Cole M. Bronson R. Collen D. Mulligan R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2746-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 30Carmeliet P. Stassen J.M. Schoonjans L. Ream L.B. van den Oord J.J. De Mol M. Mulligan R.C. Collen D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2756-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). PAI-1−/− mice were back-crossed into the C57BL/6J strain (>F8). WT C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were used as controls. Male mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age were utilized for this study. The mice were anesthetized, intraperitoneally, with a rodent mixture (0.015 mg of xylazine, 0.075 mg of ketamine, and 0.0025 mg of aceprozamine/g of body weight). Experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Notre Dame. The methods for harvesting of aortas and the isolation, purification, maintenance, and confirmation of homogeneity of primary EC have been described previously (16Ploplis V.A. Balsara R.D. Sandoval-Cooper M.J. Yin Z.J. Batten J. Modi N. Gadoua D. Donahue D. Martin J.A. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6143-6151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All cell culture experiments were performed at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. At least six mice/genotype/preparation have been used for each n value. Cell proliferation assays were performed as previously described (16Ploplis V.A. Balsara R.D. Sandoval-Cooper M.J. Yin Z.J. Batten J. Modi N. Gadoua D. Donahue D. Martin J.A. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6143-6151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). EC resuspended in CM at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml were added to collagen-coated 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The medium was then aspirated, and fresh CM without EC growth supplement was added (t = 0). The cells were then allowed to proliferate for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after the change in medium. For proliferation assays, where the addition of PAI-1 protein was required, the cells were plated as above, but at 72 h, 10 ng/ml rPAI-1 was added to the cells. The cells were then counted after 24 h. Manual cell counts were performed after the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then stained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The cells were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse TE200 microscope, and images were recorded using the SPOT camera and the SPOT advanced version 4.0.9 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Cell counts were determined in triplicate/time point/genotype (three fields/well). For proliferation assays involving inhibition of PI3K, EC were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well collagen-coated plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The medium was then aspirated, and fresh complete medium without EC growth supplement was added (t = 0). The cells were allowed to grow for 72 h and treated with 200 nm wortmannin for 2 h. After this time, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in EC-defined serum-free medium with 200 nm wortmannin and 20% serum where indicated. Cells were harvested after 18 h of incubation, and total cell counts were performed. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using the Guava EasyCyte Caspase 3/7 kit. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in a 6-well collagen-coated plate and allowed to adhere overnight. After this time, the medium was aspirated, and fresh CM without EC growth factor supplement was added. Cells were harvested at 72 and 96 h by collagenase treatment. Where required, rPAI-1 (10 ng/ml) was added to WT and PAI-1−/− EC, which were then used to perform the assay. Both WT and PAI-1−/− cells were resuspended in 100 μl of CM without endothelial cell growth supplement at a density of 5 × 104/ml and incubated with the FLICA (fluorescent labeled inhibitor of caspases) dye for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2. The cells were washed with 1× wash buffer followed by a 5-min incubation with propidium iodide. Samples were acquired on the Guava EasyCyte system using the Guava ExpressPlus application. This assay was also performed using EC treated with exogenous PAI-1. Although this kit assays for both early (caspase-7) and late apoptosis (caspase-3), data presented herein are for late apoptosis. A proliferation assay was set up as described under “Analysis of EC Apoptosis.” At the 96 h time point, WT and PAI-1−/− cells (in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml PAI-1) were analyzed for caspase-9 activity using the colorimetric caspase-9 assay kit (Calbiochem) as per the manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot of 2 × 106 cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was assayed. An aliquot of 400 μg of protein was diluted in cell lysis buffer and incubated with LEHD-p-nitroanilide substrate at 37 °C for 2 h, and samples were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader (SPEC-TRAmax Plus; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). This assay was also performed using EC treated with exogenous PAI-1. Data were expressed as percentage of WT activity. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in a 6-well collagen-coated plate and allowed to adhere overnight. After this time, the medium was aspirated, and fresh CM without EC growth factor supplement was added. The cells were then allowed to grow for 72 h and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. After this, they were incubated in EC serum-free defined medium (Cell Applications, Inc.) overnight and then treated with 150 or 200 nm wortmannin for 1 h. The cells were directly lysed with 100 μl of SDS gel loading buffer. For measurement of the levels of total Akt and Akt-(Ser(P)473), 25 μl of the cell lysates was fractionated on a gel, blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Osmonics, Inc., Minnetonka, MN), and immunoassayed in the usual manner using rabbit anti-mouse Akt or rabbit anti-mouse Akt-(Ser(P)473) primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). For detection of total Akt, Akt(Ser(P)473), α-tubulin, caspase-3, PTEN, PTEN(Ser(P)380), and caspase-9, cells were added to lysis buffer (1% Igepal CA-630, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaF, 200 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were fractionated on gels, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Osmonics Inc.), and immunoassayed according to the manufacturer's protocol. For some experiments, WT rPAI-1 was added to proliferating cells at 72 h, and the cells were lysed 24 h later. Cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 analyses were performed by fractionating the cell lysates on 10–20% linear gradient Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad). To enable distinct separation of the cleaved caspase-9 bands, the gel was run at 205 V until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel, and then the gel was run for an additional 10 min. Densitometric analyses of Western autoradiograms were performed using the Scion program downloaded from NIH (available on the World Wide Web at www.scioncorp.com). RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from WT and PAI-1−/− EC was isolated using the RNeasy mini method (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). LRP mRNA levels were detected by TaqMan analysis (Sequence Detection System 7700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using primer sequences 5′-TGCCCGCCCCATATGAC-3′ (forward) and 3′-GCCGCTTATACCAGAACACCA-3′ (reverse) to yield a predicted 144-bp product. The reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the SYBR® Green Master mix (Applied Biosystems). The reaction was loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide to observe the PCR band. Western Blot Analysis—Actively growing WT and PAI-1−/− cells at a confluence of 65–70% were lysed, and total protein was loaded on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions. Electroblotting was performed overnight, at first using 70 V for 1 h and then at 30 V overnight, followed by 70 V for 45 min. The membrane was blocked in blocking buffer (1× TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% milk powder, 1 mm CaCl2). The blot was exposed to the primary antibody, 1 mg/ml rabbit 2629 anti-human LRP polyclonal antibody, at room temperature for 2 h. An aliquot of 75 μg (for detecting cleaved caspase-3) or 100 μg (for detecting caspase-9(Thr(P)163)) of WT and PAI-1−/− cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C with 1:100 diluted caspase-3 antibody or 1:50 diluted caspase-9(Thr(P)125) antibody (recognizes Thr(P)163 of mouse caspase-9) in a total volume of 200 μl overnight with gentle rocking. To this mixture 20 μl of 50% bead slurry of Protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) was added and incubated for 3 h under the same conditions. The beads were washed five times under cold conditions with cell lysis buffer and resuspended in 20 μl of gel loading buffer, and equal volumes were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was used to perform Western blot analysis. Where applicable, results represent the mean ± S.E. Differences in mean values were analyzed using Student's t test. p values of ≤0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. PI3K Mediates Akt Activation and Affects Proliferative Activity in WT and PAI-1−/− EC—In unstimulated cells, Akt is present in the cytoplasm, and the two regulatory phosphorylation sites at Thr308 and Ser473 are nonphosphorylated. Upon growth factor stimulation, PI3K recruits Akt to the plasma membrane, where Akt is sequentially phosphorylated at Thr308 and Ser473. Phosphorylation at both sites is required for full activation of Akt (21Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Whereas the ratio of Akt(Ser(P)473)/Akt was 1.53 in PAI-1−/− EC compared with 0.12 for WT cells at 96 h, the levels of Akt(Thr(P)308) in the two genotypes were similar, as well as the levels of PDK1(Ser(P)241) (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1), a protein that facilitates phosphorylation of Akt(Thr308) (data not shown). The kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Akt(Ser473) has not been identified (31Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). To determine whether Akt activation is transduced by PI3K, proliferating WT and PAI-1−/− EC were treated for 1 h with wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of PI3K. Immunoblot analysis using anti-Akt(Ser(P)473) and anti-Akt antibodies, demonstrated that at doses of 150 nm or above, wortmannin inhibited phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in both cell types, whereas total levels of Akt were not altered (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that, as in WT cells, Akt activation in PAI-1−/− cells is mediated by PI3K. It has been reported that wortmannin is known to block growth factor-induced antiapoptotic activity as well as proliferative activity in different types of EC. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that wortmannin inhibits angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1)-induced antiapoptotic effects due to inhibition of basal PI3K activity in serum-deprived human umbilical vein EC (18Kim I. Kim H.G. So J.-N. Kim J.H. Kwak H.J. Koh G.Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Similarly, wortmannin is known to block the protective action of nerve growth factor (32Gagliardini V. Fernandez P.A. Lee R.K.K. Drexler H.C.A. Rotello R.J. Fishman M.C. Yuan J. Science. 1994; 263: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor in serum-deprived PC12 cells (33Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), as well as VEGF-mediated antiapoptotic activity in human umbilical vein EC (17Gerber H.-P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of PI3K in the proliferative process, proliferating WT and PAI-1−/− EC were incubated with 200 nm wortmannin and assayed for total cell counts (Fig. 1B). Wortmannin decreased the total cell counts in both WT and PAI-1−/− EC. The decrease in cell counts may be due to inhibition of basal PI3K activity present in serum-deprived cells. In the presence of serum, which activates Akt, an increase in cell counts was observed. These results support the conclusion that the proliferative function in WT and PAI-1−/− EC is mediated via PI3K. To further explore the basis of enhanced Akt(Ser(P)473) in proliferating PAI-1−/− cells, the upstream negative regulator, phosphatase PTEN, was analyzed. PTEN inhibits the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositide 3,4,5-triphosphate, which anchors Akt to the plasma membrane, a step that is crucial for allowing activation of Akt (23Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2600) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that phosphorylation at the C terminus of PTEN inhibits its activity, thus resulting in increased concentrations of phosphoinositide 3,4,5-triphosphate and Akt hyperactivation (34Vazquez F. Ramaswamy S. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5010-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation state of PTEN in proliferating WT and PAI-1−/− EC was analyzed. Consistent with enhanced Akt activation, higher"
https://openalex.org/W1986718029,"14-3-3sigma proteins regulate numerous cellular processes that are important to cancer development. One of its biological roles involves G2 cell-cycle arrest following DNA damage. It has also been reported that the loss of 14-3-3sigma expression via CpG methylation may contribute to malignant transformation by impairing the G2 cell-cycle checkpoint function, thereby allowing an accumulation of genetic defects. However, how the CpG methylation-dependent silencing mechanism works in relation to promoter methylation associated with methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MeCPs) is still unclear. To better understand the mechanism, we first examined the methylation status of the 14-3-3sigma promoter-associated CpG islands and 14-3-3sigma gene expression in a subset of prostate cancer cell lines using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), an HhaI-based DNA methylation assay, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). We found that the 14-3-3sigma expression is lost in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 prostate cancer cell lines and that this expression is restored after treatment with epigenetic silencing modifiers 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza) and trichostatin A (TSA). These results imply transcriptional silencing via promoter-associated CpG methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MBD2) is associated preferentially to the methylated CpG island in the 14-3-3sigma promoter in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 cells but not in 14-3-3sigma-expressing PC3 and DU145 cells, which contain an unmethylated CpG island in the 14-3-3sigma promoter region. The 14-3-3sigma gene silencing because of CpG methylation correlates with binding of MBD2. In addition, the activation of 14-3-3sigma gene expression by a combination of 5-aza and TSA also involves the release of the MBD2 from the 14-3-3sigma promoter-methylated CpG island in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 cells. Furthermore, MBD2 knockdown by siRNA stimulated 14-3-3sigma expression in LNCaP cells. We also investigated whether the loss of 14-3-3sigma expression in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 cells affects cell proliferation by MTT assays. Interestingly, we observed that 14-3-3sigma-inactivated LNCaP and Tramp-C1 cells had markedly decreased cell proliferation and protein expression of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) after restoration of 14-3-3sigma expression with 5-aza and TSA treatment. On the other hand, the same treatment did not significantly affect 14-3-3sigma-active PC3 and DU145 cells, which normally express 14-3-3sigma. Finally, 14-3-3sigma knockdown by siRNA resulted in increased proliferation in PC3 and DU145 cells. These findings suggest that the transcriptional silencing of the 14-3-3sigma gene is caused by promoter CpG island methylation associated with MBD2, and that this may play an important role in prostate cancer progression during the invasive and metastatic stages of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2168409923,"Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding secretory protein, which is distributed in the secondary granules of polynuclear lymphocytes as well as in the milk produced by female mammals. Although it has multiple functions, for example antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, antiviral, and anti-tumor metastasis activities, the receptors responsible for these activities are not fully understood. In this study, the binding epitopes for human LF were first isolated from a hexameric random peptide library displayed on T7 phage. Interestingly, two of the four isolated peptides had a representative cell adhesion motif, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), implying that human LF interacts with proteins with the RGD motif. We found that human LF bound to the RGD-containing human extracellular matrix proteins, fibronectin and vitronectin. Furthermore, human LF inhibited cell adhesion to these matrix proteins in a concentration-dependent manner but not to the RGD-independent cell adhesion molecule like laminin or collagen. These results indicate that a function of human LF is to block the various interactions between the cell surface and adhesion molecules. This may explain the multifunctionality of LF.

Lactoferrin (LF) 3The abbreviations used are: LF, lactoferrin; TF, transferrin; FN, fibronectin; LN, laminin; CN, collagen; h, human; LPS, lipopolysaccharide(s); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HEL, hen egg white lysozyme; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; pfu, plaque-forming unit; SA, streptavidin. is an 80-kDa secretory glycoprotein that is contained in the secretary granules of polynuclear leukocytes as well as in the milk produced by female mammals. This protein is thought to be important in transporting iron to cells or providing iron to infants because of the features it has in common (with respect to structure and iron binding ability) with a representative iron-transporting protein, transferrin (TF). However, LF has recently been recognized as a multifunctional protein because it has various biological activities. LF has antimicrobial activities against bacteria, fungi, and viruses (1Caccavo D. Pellegrino N.M. Altamura M. Rigon A. Amati L. Amoroso A. Jirillo E. J. Endotoxin Res. 2002; 8: 403-417PubMed Google Scholar). The antibacterial activity of LF is due to its N-terminal Arg-rich region, which binds to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on Gram-negative bacteria, and this region is also responsible for binding lysozyme, heparin, and DNA (2van Berkel P.H. Geerts M.E. van Veen H.A. Mericskay M. de Boer H.A. Nuijens J.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Legrand D. van Berkel P.H. Salmon V. van Veen H.A. Slomianny M.C. Nuijens J.H. Spik G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). With respect to its antiviral activity, LF acts as an inhibitor for viral entry to target cells but does not repress the intracellular replication of viruses (4van der Strate B.W. Beljaars L. Molema G. Harmsen M.C. Meijer D.K. Antiviral Res. 2001; 52: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). For example, LF prevents viral infection by binding to the envelope proteins E1 and E2 of the hepatitis C virus (5Yi M. Kaneko S. Yu D.Y. Murakami S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5997-6002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the VP1 protein in enterovirus (6Weng T.Y. Chen L.C. Shyu H.W. Chen S.H. Wang J.R. Yu C.K. Lei H.Y. Yeh T.M. Antiviral. Res. 2005; 67: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Several reports have also described the immunoregulatory and anti-tumor metastasis activities of LF. However, the reasons for these activities have not been well established. It was found that orally administrated human LF (hLF) inhibited the growth of established tumors to the same extent as the chemotherapeutic agent cis-platinum (7Varadhachary A. Wolf J.S. Petrak K. O'Malley Jr., B.W. Spadaro M. Curcio C. Forni G. Pericle F. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is thought that this anti-tumor activity is derived from induction of secretion of interleukin-18 in the intestinal tract (8Iigo M. Shimamura M. Matsuda E. Fujita K. Nomoto H. Satoh J. Kojima S. Alexander D.B. Moore M.A. Tsuda H. Cytokine. 2004; 25: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), subsequent systemic NK cell activation, and increased numbers of CD8+ T cells. However, in another report, LF was found to exert its anti-tumor activity by inhibiting the angiogenesis induced by the tumor cells (9Shimamura M. Yamamoto Y. Ashino H. Oikawa T. Hazato T. Tsuda H. Iigo M. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To account for these various activities, several LF receptors have been reported. Legrand et al. (3Legrand D. van Berkel P.H. Salmon V. van Veen H.A. Slomianny M.C. Nuijens J.H. Spik G. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) noted that a 105-kDa hLF receptor expressed on Jurkat cells binds to hLF with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 70 nm. Another research group isolated a hLF-specific receptor that forms a 110–120-kDa complex, which was purified from brush-border membrane in the intestinal tract (10Suzuki Y.A. Shin K. Lonnerdal B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15771-15779Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same group identified the associated hLF receptor gene (10Suzuki Y.A. Shin K. Lonnerdal B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15771-15779Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This receptor bound to hLF with a Kd of 1 μm. A nucleolar protein called nucleolin is also a potential hLF receptor (11Legrand D. Vigie K. Said E.A. Elass E. Masson M. Slomianny M.C. Carpentier M. Briand J.P. Mazurier J. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this case, both the N- and C-lobes of LF contributed to the receptor binding, and the Kd was 240 nm. However, nucleolin is known to function as a receptor of various other protein ligands. Therefore, the crucial receptor that is specifically directed to LF with high affinity has not been found. To search for proteins that interact with hLF, we first screened a 6-mer random peptide library displayed on T7 phage and isolated four hLF-specific peptides by biopanning with hLF. Interestingly, two of the four peptides had the typical cell adhesion motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), suggesting that hLF may interact with RGD-containing proteins. Binding experiments using ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis demonstrated that hLF bound to human fibronectin (hFN) and vitronectin (hVN) with relatively high affinity. Furthermore, the cell adhesion of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), HeLa, and RAW cells to hFN or hVN coated on the culture plate was inhibited by hLF in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that hLF interfered the cell adherent interaction through RGD motif. This is the first report describing the interaction between hLF and extracellular matrix proteins. The biological roles of hLF with respect to immunoregulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis are discussed from the perspective of the cell adhesion inhibitory activity of hLF. Materials— hLF, human transferrin (hTF), hFN, hVN, human laminin (hLN), and human collagen (hCN) were purchased from Sigma. Hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo). Peptides named LFpep-1 (GGGSRGDDWAG), LFpep-1A (GGGSAGDDWAG), LFpep-3A (GGGSRGADWAG), LFpep-4A (GGGSRGDAWAG), and LFpep-5A (GGGSRGDDAAG) were chemically synthesized by employing Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protection chemistry and purified on a reversed phase column. The biotinylation of the α-amino residue of peptide was carried out with the Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) biotinylation reagent according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Construction of Random Peptide T7 Phage Library—The T7 phage library displaying random 6-mer peptides used here was constructed using the phage vector T7Select415 (Novagen). To add hexameric amino acid sequences to the C-terminal of the G10 protein of T7 phage through the GGGS linker peptide, a template oligonucleotide (5′-GCCGCAAGCTTTTATCCMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNCGAACCTCCACCTGAATTCGG-3′) was synthesized. This oligonucleotide was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers (5′-CCGAATTCAGGTGGAGG-3′ and 5′-CGGCGTTCGAAAATAGG-3′) that harbored restriction sites for EcoRI and HindIII, respectively. The generated PCR product was purified on a PCR-M column (Viogene) and digested with EcoRI and HindIII. The DNA fragment was purified on a PCR-M column again and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in the T7Select415 vector. The ligation mixture was subjected to an in vitro packaging reaction using a T7 packaging extract (Novagen). The packaged T7 phages were infected into Escherichia coli BL21 and amplified once. The diversity of the library was estimated to be 2.5 × 106 by titering the phages with a plaque assay before propagation. Biopanning against hLF—Microplate wells (Nunc, Maxisorp) were coated with hLF (500 ng/100 μl/well) and blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS. The T7 phage library (5.0 × 1010 pfu) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the wells were washed seven times with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), the BL21 E. coli cells were added and cultured for phage propagation. The phages recovered from the culture supernatant by polyethylene glycol precipitation were used for the next round of panning. After four rounds of panning, the phages were cloned on the culture plates, forming phage plaques. ELISA to Detect the Interaction of hLF with Phages and Peptides—Each well of the microplates (Nunc, Maxisorp) was coated with hLF (100 ng/50 μl/well) in 0.1 m NaHCO3 and blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS. The phage clones (5 × 1010 pfu/well) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h, and the wells were washed five times with PBST. The bound phages were detected with anti-T7 phage mouse antibody (Novagen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG goat antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For the colorimetric assay, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Wako Chemicals) was used, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured on an ELISA plate reader (ImmunoMini NJ-2300, InterMed, Tokyo). The peptide ELISA was performed in a similar manner. Biotinylated LFpep-1, -1A, -3A, -4A, and -5A peptides (100 μm/well) were preincubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (SA) (Vector), and the mixture was added to hLF-coated wells. After 1-h incubation, the wells were washed three times with PBST, and the bound peptides were detected. ELISA to Detect the Interaction of hLF with hFN and hVN— The binding of hLF to hFN and hVN was assayed as described below. The wells were coated with hFN, hVN, hLN, or hCN (12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 ng/50 μl/well) and blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS. Human LF (500 ng/50 μl/well) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. The bound hLF was detected by anti-human LF polyclonal rabbit antibody (Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The inhibition of hLF binding with hFN by the isolated phage clones or LFpep-1 peptide was performed in a similar manner. Human LF was added to hFN-coated wells in the presence of phages (1–10 × 109 pfu/well) or biotinylated LFpep-1 peptide (15, 30, 65, and 130 μm), which bound SA to form a tetravalent peptide complex by mixing with an equimolar amount of SA, and the bound hLF was detected by using anti-human LF antibody. DNA Sequencing—The DNA sequencing of the peptide region displayed on the T7 phage was carried out by using the dye-terminator method on an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer. The sequencing reaction was carried out by using the Big Dye terminator 3.1 reagent (PE Biosystem) using the following primers: 5′-GGAGCTGTCGTATTCCAGTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AACCCCTCAAGACCCGTTTA-3′ (reverse primer). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—SPR analysis was performed on a BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore) apparatus at 25 °C. All reagents and the sensorchips were purchased from BIAcore. The immobilization of ligand proteins on the CM5 sensorchip was carried out according to the amine coupling protocols supplied by the manufacturer. The immobilization reaction was performed at pH 5.0, and the amount of immobilized protein was adjusted to within 1500–2000 resonance units. For regenerating the sensorchip, 0.2 m glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.7) was used. The association reaction was monitored by injection of T7 phage clones purified by ultracentrifugation (1.0 × 1010 pfu/100 μl), a synthetic peptide LFpep-1 (1, 10, 100, and 300 μm), or hVN (125, 500, and 2000 nm) into the flow cell at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The dissociation reaction was carried out by washing the flow cell with HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20). The binding kinetic parameters were analyzed by using BIAevaluation Version 3.2 software (BIAcore). Cell Adhesion Inhibition Assay—The cell adhesion activity of the extracellular matrix protein was evaluated by using a method described by Zhao and Newman (12Zhao T. Newman P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A 96-well cell culture plate (Iwaki, Tokyo) coated with hFN, hLN, or hCN (300 ng/100 μl/well) was preincubated with hLF, hTF, or HEL (1.5, 3, 6, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml) and washed three times with PBS. CHO (ATCC CCL-61; America Type Culture Collection), murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (ATCC TIB-71), and human epithelial cell line HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) (105 cells/100 μl/well) were added to the wells and cultured at 37 °C for 2 h in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. For the control experiments, the cells were pretreated with hLF (1.5, 3, 6, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml), washed, and added to the wells coated with hFN, hLN, or hCN. After the plate was agitated on a bioshaker at 500 rpm for 10 min, the adherent cells on the plate were counted. The cell adhesion ratio was represented as a percentage value relative to the number of adherent cells in the absence of hLF. Immunostaining of hLF—Biotinylated hLF (600 nm) was added to human monocytic cell line THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202) (105 cells/100 μl/well) and cultured at 37 °C for 1 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of LFpep-1 peptide (250 μm) or hLF (6 μm). After the cells were washed with fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer, the cells were subjected to permeabilization and fixation by employing the Cytofix Cytoperm plus kit (Pharmingen). After fixation, the cells were reacted with SA-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Pharmingen) for 30 min and observed by fluorescence microscopy (IX71 fluorescence microscope equipped with a DP30BW digital camera; Olympus). Isolation of hLF-specific Phage Clones from a T7 Phage-displayed Random 6-mer Peptide Library—Using a T7 phage library displaying hexameric random peptides, hLF-specific binding phages were isolated by a total of four rounds of biopanning against hLF. Fig. 1A shows the ratio of the output versus input phages (output/input ratio) in each round of panning. Enrichment for hLF-binding phages was observed at the fourth round. After the fourth round of panning, the cloned phages were subjected to the hLF-binding assay in an ELISA format. Forty out of the 50 isolated phages bound to hLF. All 40 clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis, and the peptide sequences displayed on the phages were identified. A total of four sequences (LF-1, -2, -4, and -7) were found, as listed in Table 1. Among them, LF-1 and LF-4 were highly enriched and possessed the RGD motif, a representative cell adhesion motif. These phage clones clearly showed specific binding to hLF but not to other proteins such as hTF (Fig. 1B). These binding specificities were confirmed by SPR analysis. All the four phage clones showed responsive curves with respect to SPR signal to the hLF immobilized on the sensorchip (Fig. 2), but no signals were observed for hTF and HEL (data not shown). The sensorgrams for the dissociation phase of all the phage clones were very slow (Kd < 10–5 s–1). This slow dissociation may be related to the multivalent interactions between the hLF immobilized on the matrix of the sensorchip and the peptides on the phages.TABLE 1Amino acid sequences of hLF-binding peptidePhage cloneSequenceFrequencyLF-1RGDDWA20/40 (50%)LF-4RGDDWE12/40 (30%)LF-7NRASNR4/40 (10%)LF-2KKILH*4/40 (10%) Open table in a new tab Binding Specificity of Synthetic Peptide LFpep-1 to hLF—To evaluate the specificity and the essential residues for the binding of the LF-1, LF-1 synthetic peptide (LFpep-1: GGGSRGDDWAG) and its Ala-substituted peptides were prepared. Fig. 3A shows the results of their binding to hLF and control proteins. LFpep-1 peptide specifically bound to hLF. On the other hand, the binding of Ala-substituted peptides (where Arg1, Asp3, Asp4, or Trp5 in LF-1 was replaced with Ala) resulted in significant decrease in affinity. These results indicate that not only cell adhesion motif (RGD) contributes to LF-1 binding to hLF but also that Asp4 and Trp5 play the role in LF-1 binding to hLF. To examine the binding constant between the LFpep-1 peptide and hLF, SPR analysis was carried out by injecting the synthetic peptide into the sensorchip immobilized with hLF (Fig. 3B). A concentration-dependent binding of LFpep-1 was observed on the sensorgram. However, the Kd was not able to be calculated because the affinity was extremely weak. Interaction of hLF and Extracellular Matrix Proteins—The finding that the cell adhesion motif (RGD) was in human LF-binding peptides suggested the possibility that extracellular matrix proteins such as FN or VN, which interact with integrin receptors on the cell surface through the RGD motif, could be acceptors for hLF. Therefore, we first confirmed this hypothesis by using ELISA. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, concentration-dependent binding of hLF with hFN and VN was observed. On the other hand, RGD-independent extracellular adhesion proteins such as hLN and hCN did not show the hLF binding. To examine the affinity and binding specificity between hLF and hVN, SPR analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 5A, the injection of hVN (2000 nm) onto the hLF sensorchips produced clear response curves, but no response was obtained for hTF. Fig. 5B shows the concentration-dependent response curves of the sensorgrams after injection of different concentrations of hVN (125, 500, and 2000 nm) onto the hLF-immobilization chip. From these analyses, the Kd value for their binding was calculated to be 370 nm (ka = 3.8 × 103m–1 s–1, Kd = 1.4 × 10–3 s–1). To further evaluate that the observed interaction between hLF and hFN occurs through the RGD motif, an inhibition assay was performed by using hLF-binding phage clones (Fig. 6A), LFpep-1 peptide, and its Ala-substituted peptides (Fig. 6B). The hLF-binding phage clones LF-1 and LF-4 effectively inhibited the hLF/hFN interaction in a titer-dependent manner. However, LF-7 phage clone, which did not possess the RGD motif, showed modest inhibitory effect despite its relatively high hLF-binding activity (Fig. 2), implicating that the LF-7 phage recognizes the different surface of hLF molecule from LF-1 and LF-4 phages. The biotinylated LFpep-1-forming tetrameric complex with SA also disturbed the interaction between hLF and hFN (Fig. 6B). All the Ala-substituted peptides (LFpep-1A, -3A, -4A, and -5A) did not show inhibitory activities, which is in good agreement with their binding abilities to hLF in ELISA (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of Cell Adhesion by hLF—The cellular receptor for the extracellular matrix proteins (hFN and hVN) is the αβ-heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein integrin (α5β1, αVβ1, αIIbβ3, and αVβ3), and they interact with each other through the RGD motif. Therefore, we examined whether LF could inhibit adhesion of three typical adherent cells (CHO, RAW, and HeLa cells) to hFN-coated plate (Fig. 7). Human LF preincubated with the hFN-coated well apparently inhibited cell-adhesion of CHO, RAW, and HeLa cells to the hFN-coated plate, while no changes in cell adhesion were occurred by the addition of control proteins (hTF and HEL). This specific inhibitory effect of hLF on cell adhesion was not observed in the case where the cells were first treated with hLF, and the mixture was added to the wells coated with hFN (data not shown), indicating that the inhibitory effect of hLF was exerted by specifically binding hFN. It is well known that extracellular matrix proteins like hLN and hCN also participate in cell adhesion functioning as ligands of integrin family proteins. These two proteins, however, utilize the different binding interactions other than RGD motifs in the integrin binding. Therefore, we tested the effect of hLF on the RGD-independent cell adhesion using hLN and hCN-coated plate. The inhibitory effect of hLF for cell adhesion to hLN and hCN-coated plate was not observed in all the three cell lines (data not shown). This result indicated that hLF blocked the specific interaction between hFN and integrin through RGD motif in cell adhesion. The IC50 of hLF in the inhibition of cell adhesion was approximately estimated to be 34–44 nm, which was far lower than that of cyclic RGD peptide, a typical inhibitor of cell adhesion (1.49 μm) (13van Well R.M. Overkleeft H.S. van der Marel G.A. Bruss D. Thibault G. de Groot P.G. van Boom J.H. Overhand M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Inhibition Activity of the LFpep-1 Peptide on Cell Internalization of hLF—The internalization of hLF into a human monocytic cell line THP-1 was previously described (20Haversen L. Ohlsson B.G. Hahn-Zoric M. Hanson L.A. Mattsby-Baltzer I. Cell. Immunol. 2002; 220: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), although the uptake mechanism remain to be known. To examine the biological activities of the LFpep-1 peptide, we examined the effect of the addition of the LFpep-1 peptide on the uptake of hLF in THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were incubated with biotinylated hLF in the presence of LFpep-1 peptide or hLF in the medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the incorporated hLF was detected by SA-fluorescein isothiocyanate on a fluorescence microscopy. In the absence of the LFpep-1 peptide, internalized biotinylated hLF was seen as positive staining (Fig. 8A), whereas no staining could be observed in the cells treated in the presence of the LFpep-1 peptide (Fig. 8B) or hLF itself (Fig. 8C). This result indicates that the LFpep-1 peptide inhibits the uptake of hLF into THP-1 cells, probably by disturbing the interaction between hLF and hFN through the RGD motif. In the present study, we isolated hLF-binding peptides from a T7 phage-displayed random hexameric peptide library. The obtained four peptides were all specific to hLF (Fig. 1), which was also confirmed by kinetic affinity experiments using SPR analysis. The apparent affinities of the isolated T7 phage clones seemed to be very strong since of the dissociation rate was very slow (Kd < 10–4 s–1) (Fig. 2). However, a synthetic peptide LFpep-1, derived from the LF-1 phage clone, had very weak affinity to hLF (Fig. 3). This discrepancy in affinity is thought to be occurred because of the avidity effect on the multivalent interactions between peptides on T7 phage and the hLF immobilized on the SPR sensorchip. Despite the low affinity of the peptide, it is significant that the RGD motif was found in the hLF-binding peptides among the major clones isolated (LF-1 and -4). The RGD motif is observed in many acceptors for integrins as a common recognition moiety (Table 2). The interaction between integrins and their acceptors through RGD motif is involved in various bioactivities, including cell adhesion, blood coagulation, angiogenesis, migration of lymphocytes, inflammation, and tumor metastasis. In this study, we demonstrated that hLF bound to the extracellular matrix proteins hFN and hVN which possess RGD motif and inhibited the hFN-mediated cell adhesion by blocking the interaction between the cellular surface integrin and RGD motif of hFN. Such blocking ability for cell adhesion may give a plausible interpretation for multiple functions of hLF.TABLE 2Amino acid sequence similarities between hLF-binding peptides and representative RGD-harboring proteinsProtein/PeptideMotif sequenceLF-1R G D D W ALF-4R G D D W EHuman fibronectinR G D S P AHuman vitronectinR G D V F THuman fibrinogenR G D S T FHuman TFRR G D F F R Open table in a new tab We scanned the important residues responsible for hLF binding in LF-1 sequence by using Ala-substituted peptides (Fig. 3A). As the result, we found not only Arg1 and Asp3, which form RGD motif, but also Asp4 and Trp5 located after the RGD motif play an important role in binding to hLF. These results suggest that the RGD region is necessary for binding to the specific site on hLF and that the Asp4 and Trp5 are involved in enhancement of affinity and/or specificity of LF-1 sequence to hLF. In natural RGD-containing proteins, the sequence after RGD motif is not conserved as summarized in Table 2. A study regarding the binding motifs recognized by integrin suggests that there are no favorable common features in amino acid sequence after the RGD motif (14Li R. Hoess R.H. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that the amino acids responsible for hFN and hVN to bind to hLF are essentially limited to the RGD motif. It has been reported that the RGD motif is involved in the binding of TF to its receptor (15Liu R. Guan J.Q. Zak O. Aisen P. Chance M.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12447-12454Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Kawabata H. Tong X. Kawanami T. Wano Y. Hirose Y. Sugai S. Koeffler H.P. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 127: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the basis of the tertiary structure of the complex, as analyzed by cryo-electron microscopy (17Cheng Y. Zak O. Aisen P. Harrison S.C. Walz T. Cell. 2004; 116: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), the first Arg646 residue of the RGD motif on the receptor forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Asp356 on the C-terminal lobe of TF. The corresponding site of Asp356 of TF is replaced by Asn in LF, leading to an absence of the electrostatic interaction. In fact, it has been reported that LF barely binds to the TF receptor (18Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding mode or site of RGD motif is probably different in hLF and hTF. The anti-bacterial activity of LF originates from the N-terminal Arg-rich region in hLF (Arg2, Arg3, Arg4, Arg5, and Arg28–31), and this region is also involved in binding heparin, LPS, and lysozyme (2van Berkel P.H. Geerts M.E. van Veen H.A. Mericskay M. de Boer H.A. Nuijens J.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We examined the anti-bacterial activity of hLF using E. coli BL21 in the presence of the LFpep-1 peptide (1–500 μm). However, even the presence of 500 μm LFpep-1 peptide did not affect the inhibitory activity of human LF against bacterial proliferation (data not shown), suggesting that the binding site of the LFpep-1 peptide is not the N-terminal Arg-rich region of LF. The suppressive activity of LF against the inflammatory cytokine production induced by LPS has been explained by its competitive binding to LPS with LPS-binding receptor CD14 (19Elass-Rochard E. Legrand D. Salmon V. Roseanu A. Trif M. Tobias P.S. Mazurier J. Spik G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 486-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has recently been proposed that LF directly suppresses cytokine production by inhibition of NFκB binding to the cytokine promoter region (20Haversen L. Ohlsson B.G. Hahn-Zoric M. Hanson L.A. Mattsby-Baltzer I. Cell. Immunol. 2002; 220: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In contrast, LF acts as an LPS-binding protein under the low concentrations of LPS, leading to the enhancement of inflammatory reactions (21Na Y.J. Han S.B. Kang J.S. Yoon Y.D. Park S.K. Kim H.M. Yang K.H. Joe C.O. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2004; 4: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Namely, LF forms a complex with LPS that is incorporated by macrophages, and LPS released in the intracellular fraction activates NFκB through possible TLR4 signaling. Although the uptake of LF is necessary for both cases, its mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, we tried to examine whether the RGD sequence is involved in the incorporation of LF into THP-1 cells, as it is reported that monocyte-derived THP-1 cells efficiently incorporate LF into the intracellular fraction by endocytosis (20Haversen L. Ohlsson B.G. Hahn-Zoric M. Hanson L.A. Mattsby-Baltzer I. Cell. Immunol. 2002; 220: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The uptake of hLF was observed in THP-1 cells and efficiently inhibited by the addition of LFpep-1 peptide (Fig. 8), implicating that the interaction of hLF and RGD-containing proteins may have a key role in the uptake of LF into cells. It is well known that hFN participates in the cellular uptake of the extracellular proteins or microorganisms which bind to hFN (22Jadoun J. Ozeri V. Burstein E. Skutelsky E. Hanski E. Sela S. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We consider that the uptake of hLF occurs in accompanying with the incorporation of hFN, which was attached with hLF by endocytosis. Actually the colocalization of hLF and hFN in the granules of polynuclear lymphocytes was observed (23Salcedo R. Segura C. Szekely L. de Mesquita R. Biberfeld P. Patarroyo M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), supporting our idea. Several reports have described the suppressive effect of LF against angiogenesis in tumor growth. Shimamura et al. (9Shimamura M. Yamamoto Y. Ashino H. Oikawa T. Hazato T. Tsuda H. Iigo M. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) found that orally administrated LF in mice represses tumor angiogenesis. This effect was explained by the direct growth inhibition of the vascular endothelial cells with the absorbed LF (9Shimamura M. Yamamoto Y. Ashino H. Oikawa T. Hazato T. Tsuda H. Iigo M. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which leads to anti-tumor activity in accompanied with immune enhancement by interleukin-18 induced by the intestinal LF receptor (9Shimamura M. Yamamoto Y. Ashino H. Oikawa T. Hazato T. Tsuda H. Iigo M. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 111: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Another group showed that LF inhibited in vivo angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (24Norrby K. Mattsby-Baltzer I. Innocenti M. Tuneberg S. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). During angiogenesis, an adherent receptor integrin, αvβ3, is selectively expressed, and its interaction with FN and VN promotes the viability of the angioblast to facilitate angiogenesis. Our finding that hLF inhibits the interaction between the integrin and FN in the RGD-dependent manor can plausibly explain the suppressive activities against angiogenesis involving in tumor metastasis. In the present study, we proposed the base for explaining the multifunctionality of LF. Namely, hLF interacts with hFN, hVN, and possibly other RGD-harboring proteins and blocks their interactions with counter receptors. Our findings enable us to explain various functions of LF, although the further investigation is necessary for correct understanding of the biological functions of LF."

https://openalex.org/W2126495756,"Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator that inhibits feeding and stimulates lipolysis by activating the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor-α. Little is known about the physiological regulation of this compound outside of the gastrointestinal tract, where its production is regulated by feeding. Here we show that cold exposure increases OEA levels in rat white adipose tissue but not in liver or intestine. This change is accompanied by parallel elevations in the activity of N-acyltransferase, a key enzyme responsible for OEA synthesis, without concomitant changes in fatty acid amide hydrolase, an enzyme responsible for OEA degradation. Moreover, cold stimulates the production of two species of N-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine OEA precursors. The changes in OEA biosynthesis are reversed by pretreatment with the β-receptor antagonist propranolol, suggesting a role for β-adrenoreceptors in this response. In agreement with these findings, the β-agonists noradrenaline and isoproterenol stimulate OEA production in isolated adipocytes, an effect that is mimicked by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. Collectively, these results identify cold exposure as a natural stimulus for OEA formation in white fat and suggest a role for the sympathetic nervous system in regulating OEA biosynthesis. Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an endogenous lipid mediator that inhibits feeding and stimulates lipolysis by activating the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor-α. Little is known about the physiological regulation of this compound outside of the gastrointestinal tract, where its production is regulated by feeding. Here we show that cold exposure increases OEA levels in rat white adipose tissue but not in liver or intestine. This change is accompanied by parallel elevations in the activity of N-acyltransferase, a key enzyme responsible for OEA synthesis, without concomitant changes in fatty acid amide hydrolase, an enzyme responsible for OEA degradation. Moreover, cold stimulates the production of two species of N-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine OEA precursors. The changes in OEA biosynthesis are reversed by pretreatment with the β-receptor antagonist propranolol, suggesting a role for β-adrenoreceptors in this response. In agreement with these findings, the β-agonists noradrenaline and isoproterenol stimulate OEA production in isolated adipocytes, an effect that is mimicked by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. Collectively, these results identify cold exposure as a natural stimulus for OEA formation in white fat and suggest a role for the sympathetic nervous system in regulating OEA biosynthesis.

Moreover, in the brain (9Murillo-Rodriguez E. Desarnaud F. Prospero-Garcia O. Life Sci. 2006; 79: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and white adipose tissue (WAT) (2Lo Verme J. Gaetani S. Fu J. Oveisi F. Burton K. Piomelli D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), OEA levels fluctuate diurnally, although the physiological significance of these oscillations remains unknown. The biosynthesis of OEA, like that of other FAEs, is thought to occur through two sequential biochemical steps. The first consists in the transfer of a fatty acid residue from the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine to the free amine group of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). This reaction is catalyzed by a Ca2+ and cyclic AMP-regulated N-acyltransferase (NAT) activity, which yields a family of N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) species (1Piomelli D. Nat. Rev. Neuroscience. 2003; 4: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The second reaction is mediated by a NAPE-specific phospholipase D (10Leung D. Saghatelian A. Simon G.M. Cravatt B.F.

In mammalian tissues, OEA is primarily eliminated through enzymatic hydrolysis to oleic acid and ethanolamine by one of two known enzymes, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) (12Schmid P.C.

To explore the possible roles of OEA in WAT, we drew upon our previous findings showing that OEA stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes when it is administered as a drug (5Guzmán M. Lo Verme J. Fu J. Oveisi F. Blazquez C. Piomelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27849-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that endogenous OEA levels might be regulated during physiological states in which fat stores are mobilized. One such a state is acute cold exposure, in which heightened sympathetic activity leads to increased lipolysis and fatty-acid release from WAT (15Rayner D.V. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bamshad M. Aoki V.T. Adkison M.G. Warren W.S. Bartness T.J. Am. J.

Syst. 1996; 60: 206-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Animals—We used male Wistar rats (150-200 g). All procedures met the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. For cold experiments, animals were kept in a cold room maintained at +4 °C for 3-6 h in group cages (five animals per cage). Chemicals—We purchased all chemicals from Sigma or Nu-Check Prep (Elysian, MN). Drugs were dissolved in 0.9% sterile saline and administered to rats at a volume of 1 ml-kg−1. Cell, Tissue, and Blood Preparation—We isolated epididymal adipocytes from free-feeding male Wistar rats (150-200 × g) by collagenase digestion, as described (18Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated adipocytes were incubated with drugs for 1 h at 37°C. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture and placed into Accuspin tubes (Sigma) containing EDTA (7.2 mg), and the plasma was separated by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 22 °C. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid N2 for LC/MS analyses. LC/MS Analyses—We solvent-extracted FAEs from tissues or media and quantified them by isotope dilution LC/MS, using methods delineated elsewhere (4Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Navarro M. Gómez R. Escuredo L. Nava F. Fu J. Murillo-Rodríguez E. Giuffrida A. LoVerme J. Gaetani S. Kathuria S. Gall C. Piomelli D.

Biochem. 2000; 280: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Cadas H. di Tomaso E. Piomelli D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1226-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, we first homogenized tissue samples in methanol spiked with the standards, [2H4]OEA, [2H4]palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and [2H4]stearoylethanolamide and subjected them to methanol/chloroform (1:2, v/v) extraction. For NAPE quantification the samples were spiked with the internal standard, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl), and quantified against the external synthetic standard, 1-palmityl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-arichidonyl. FAEs and their precursor NAPEs were fractionated by open-bed silica gel column chromatography. The lipid extracts were loaded onto small columns packed with silica gel G (60-Å 230-400 Mesh ASTM; Whatman, Clifton, NJ). FAEs and NAPEs were eluted from the columns with 9:1 and 5:5 (v/v) chloroform/methanol, respectively. Eluates were dried under N2 and reconstituted in 0.1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:3, v/v). LC/MS analyses were conducted using an HP1100 series high performance liquid chromatography/MS equipped with a Hewlett Packard octadecylsilica (ODS) Hypersil column (100 × 4.6 mm inner diameter, 5 μm). LC/MS conditions were the same as those described previously (19Giuffrida A. Rodríguez de Fonseca F. Piomelli D. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—We measured NAT and FAAH activities in membrane fractions under conditions that were linear with respect to protein concentration and time as described previously (21Cadas H. Gaillet S. Beltramo M. Venance L. Piomelli D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3934-3942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cravatt B.F. Demarest K. Patricelli M.P. Bracey M.H. Giang D.K. Martin B.R. Lichtman A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9371-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Briefly, NAT assays were performed in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing protein (4 mg/ml), 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 mm CaCl2 (or 10 mm EGTA), and [14C]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (1 μCi/ml, 80-120 mCi-mmol−1). After 1 h of incubation, reactions were stopped with methanol, and the lipids were extracted. The samples were applied to silica gel G-columns, [14C]NAPE-containing fractions were eluted with chloroform/methanol (5:5, v/v), and radioactivity in the fractions was measured by liquid scintillation counting. FAAH assays were performed under linear conditions, except that [3H]anandamide (arachidonyl-[1-3H]ethanolamide; 60 Ci mmol−1) was included as a substrate and radioactivity was measured in the aqueous phase after chloroform extraction. Statistics—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n separate experiments. The significance of differences among groups was evaluated using Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by a Tukey's multiple comparisons test or a Dunnett's post hoc test, as appropriate. We used isotope dilution LC/MS to measure tissue OEA content in rats that had been maintained at 4 °C for up to 6 h. Visceral fat depots isolated from these rats had significantly greater levels of OEA and its analog PEA than did those from control animals, which had been kept at room temperature for the same time (Fig. 1, A and B). This increase was time-dependent (Fig. 1C) and restricted to WAT: the cold challenge did not affect OEA levels in liver and intestine and caused a small, albeit significant OEA decrease in skeletal muscle and plasma (Fig. 1D). OEA accumulation in WAT may have resulted from increased biosynthesis and/or decreased degradation. We found that cold exposure enhanced NAT activity in fat (Fig. 2A), while it had no effect on intestinal or liver NAT activity and lowered it in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2B). In contrast to NAT, FAAH activity in fat was not significantly affected by the cold challenge (Fig. 2C), indicating that the rise in adipose OEA levels reflected increased formation rather than decreased elimination. In further support of this possibility, we found that the rise in adipose NAT activity was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the levels of various NAPE species, which may serve as OEA precursors, including alk-1-palmitoenyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerophosphoethanolamine-N-oleoyl (N-oleoyl-PE 1; Fig. 2D) and alk-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerophosphoethanolamine-N-oleoyl (N-oleoyl-PE 2; Fig. 2E). To identify neuroendocrine factors that contribute to the stimulation of OEA biosynthesis in response to cold, we focused on noradrenaline for two reasons. First, during the acute phase of cold adaptation noradrenaline is released from sympathetic fibers that innervate WAT (17Garofalo M.A. Kettelhut I.C. Roselino J.E. Migliorini R.H. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 1996; 60: 206-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 23Cinti S. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 319-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, by engaging β-adrenergic receptors on adipose cells, noradrenaline initiates fatty acid mobilization and modulates the formation of adipose-derived signaling molecules such as leptin and tumor necrosis factor-α (15Rayner D.V. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bamshad M. Aoki V.T. Adkison M.G. Warren W.S. Bartness T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R291-R299PubMed Google Scholar, 17Garofalo M.A. Kettelhut I.C. Roselino J.E. Migliorini R.H. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 1996; 60: 206-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Youngstrom T.G. Bartness T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: R744-R751PubMed Google Scholar). If noradrenaline mediates the cold-induced stimulation of OEA synthesis, β-adrenergic antagonists should block this response. In agreement with this prediction, systemic administration of the β-antagonist propranolol (25 mg kg−1, intraperitoneal, 30 min before cold exposure) prevented cold-induced changes in adipose levels of OEA (Fig. 3A), NAT activity (Fig. 3B) and OEA precursor NAPEs (Fig. 3C). The β-antagonist did not affect, however, adipose OEA content in animals that had been kept at room temperature (data not shown). As the effects of propranolol in vivo might be indirect, to further test the contribution of noradrenaline to OEA synthesis, we used adipocytes isolated from epididymal fat pads. Exposing the cells to noradrenaline (5 μm, 30 min) increased cellular OEA levels (Fig. 4A). The levels of PEA were also enhanced by noradrenaline (Fig. 4A). This response was likely due to activation of β-adrenergic receptors, as it was mimicked by the β-agonist isoproterenol (5 μm, 30 min) and prevented by the β-antagonist propranolol (100 μm) (Fig. 4B). In keeping with a role for β-adrenergic receptors, which are linked to cAMP generation, direct activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin (25 μm, 30 min) increased OEA accumulation (Fig. 4B). Together, we interpret these results to suggest that catecholamines released by sympathetic activity during cold exposure promote OEA synthesis through stimulation of adipocyte β-adrenergic receptors. The sympathetic nervous system plays a key role in the metabolic adaptation to low ambient temperatures (15Rayner D.V. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bamshad M. Aoki V.T. Adkison M.G. Warren W.S. Bartness T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R291-R299PubMed Google Scholar, 17Garofalo M.A. Kettelhut I.C. Roselino J.E. Migliorini R.H. J. Auton. Nerv.

Its activation by cold heightens noradrenaline release in adipose tissue (17Garofalo M.A. Kettelhut I.C. Roselino J.E. Migliorini R.H. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 1996; 60: 206-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and enables, through β-receptor-dependent phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase, and possibly other lipases (25Zechner R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the release of free fatty acids from triglyceride stores. Moreover, sympathetic activity contributes to the regulation of adipose signaling by changing expression of adipokines (such as leptin) and cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor-α) (15Rayner D.V. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2001; 60: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bamshad M. Aoki V.T. Adkison M.G. Warren W.S. Bartness T.J. Am. J.

Here, we show that acute cold exposure (3-6 h at 4 °C) up-regulates OEA synthesis in WAT. This response is prevented in vivo by the β-antagonist propranolol and reproduced in vitro by noradrenaline and the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, suggesting that noradrenaline may evoke OEA synthesis through direct stimulation of β-receptors on white adipose cells. Beyond the plausible implication of cAMP, implied by forskolin's ability to increase OEA levels, the molecular mechanism linking β-receptor occupation to OEA synthesis remains undefined. In particular, a critical feature of this mechanism, which warrants explanation, is its remarkable tissue specificity. We found, indeed, that cold exposure does not increase OEA synthesis in intestine and liver and even reduces it in skeletal muscle, a phenomenon that might be responsible for the lowering of plasma OEA levels observed after cold challenge but whose mechanistic underpinnings and functional significance are unclear. These questions notwithstanding, the finding that low ambient temperature selectively enhances adipose OEA synthesis suggests that this lipid mediator, which was previously shown to stimulate lipolysis in WAT (5Guzmán M. Lo Verme J. Fu J. Oveisi F. Blazquez C. Piomelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27849-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), may also be involved in adipose signaling. Interestingly, cold exposure stimulates the synthesis of the OEA analog PEA, which has also been shown to activate PPAR-α (7LoVerme J. Fu J. Astarita G. La Rana G. Russo R. Calignano A. Piomelli D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) and stimulate lipolysis in WAT (5Guzmán M. Lo Verme J. Fu J. Oveisi F. Blazquez C. Piomelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27849-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The present findings, in conjunction with previous results demonstrating that OEA stimulates fat utilization (5Guzmán M. Lo Verme J. Fu J. Oveisi F. Blazquez C. Piomelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27849-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), suggests a hypothetical model for the role of OEA in the regulation of lipid metabolism. According to this model, sympathetic outflow may control NAT activity and OEA synthesis in fat through local release of noradrenaline and/or elevation of circulating adrenaline. Supporting this role for the sympathetic nervous system, we also found that OEA levels follow a diurnal regulation in rat adipose tissue (2Lo Verme J. Gaetani S. Fu J. Oveisi F. Burton K. Piomelli D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which closely follows the diurnal variations of noradrenaline in WAT (26Davidovic V. Petrovic V.M. Arch. Int. Physiol. Biochim. 1981; 89: 457-460PubMed Google Scholar); although an enticing prediction, it remains to be determined whether sympathetic activity is indeed responsible for diurnal OEA fluxes. The physiological function of OEA in WAT during cold exposure remains to be defined and will be the subject of future inquiry. One possibility is that OEA may help contribute to the adrenergic mobilization of fat stores during a cold challenge. When sympathetic activity is enhanced, as it happens during acute cold exposure, occupation of β-adrenergic receptors may generate OEA in fat, which may participate in β-receptor-dependent lipolysis. We have previously shown that OEA-induced lipolysis occurs in a PPAR-α dependent manner (5Guzmán M. Lo Verme J. Fu J. Oveisi F. Blazquez C. Piomelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27849-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This result suggests that PPAR-α, which is present in WAT in small but significant levels (27Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), may also contribute to the response of adipose tissue to cold challenges. Of note, however, OEA also activates, at least under pharmacological conditions, PPAR-β in vitro (but not PPAR-γ) (6Fu J. Gaetani S. Oveisi F. Lo Verme J. Serrano A. Rodriguez de Fonseca F. Rosengarth A. Luecke H. Di Giacomo B. Tarzia G. Piomelli D. Nature. 2003; 425: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), TRPV-1 (28Wang D.H. Acta Pharmacol.

Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 167-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these receptors may also serve as targets for OEA during cold challenges. Irrespective of the answers to these questions, our finding that cold stimulation induces OEA biosynthesis in white adipose tissue provides a physiological framework for the actions of this lipid-derived mediator in adipocytes."

AHNP mimics many but not all of the antitumor characteristics exhibited by h4D5. However, the pharmacokinetic profiles of AHNP are less than optimal for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. To improve the binding affinity to p185her2/neu and the antitumor efficacy, we have engineered a fusion protein containing AHNP and a nonimmunoglobulin protein scaffold, streptavidin (SA). The recombinant protein, AHNP-SA (ASA) bound to p185her2/neu with high affinity, inhibited the proliferation of p185her2/neu-overexpressing cells, and reduced tumor growth induced by p185her2/neu-transformed cells. These data suggest that the bacterially produced tetrameric ASA can be used as an antibody-surrogate molecule. This class of molecule will play a role in the diagnosis and treatment of p185her2/neu-related tumors.

Based on the current topological model, NCX1 consists of nine transmembrane segments (TMSs). The N-terminal five TMSs are separated from the C-terminal four TMSs by a large intracellular loop. Cysteine 768 is modeled to be in TMS 6 close to the intracellular surface. In this study, the proximity of TMS 6 to TMSs 1 and 2 was examined. Insect High Five cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding mutant NCX1 proteins. Each mutant contained cysteine 768 and an introduced cysteine in TMS 1 or 2. Cross-linking between cysteines was determined after reaction with thiol-specific cross-linkers containing spacer arms of 6.5-12 Å. The data indicate that residues in TMSs 1 and 2 are close to cysteine 768 in TMS 6. Cysteine 768 cross-linked with residues at both ends of TMSs 1 and 2 and is likely located toward the middle of TMS 6. Based on these results, we present an expanded helix-packing model for NCX1. The cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) is a membrane protein that extrudes Ca2+ from cells using the energy of the Na+ gradient and is a key protein in regulating intracellular Ca2+ and contractility. Based on the current topological model, NCX1 consists of nine transmembrane segments (TMSs). The N-terminal five TMSs are separated from the C-terminal four TMSs by a large intracellular loop. Cysteine 768 is modeled to be in TMS 6 close to the intracellular surface. In this study, the proximity of TMS 6 to TMSs 1 and 2 was examined. Insect High Five cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding mutant NCX1 proteins. Each mutant contained cysteine 768 and an introduced cysteine in TMS 1 or 2. Cross-linking between cysteines was determined after reaction with thiol-specific cross-linkers containing spacer arms of 6.5-12 Å. The data indicate that residues in TMSs 1 and 2 are close to cysteine 768 in TMS 6. Cysteine 768 cross-linked with residues at both ends of TMSs 1 and 2 and is likely located toward the middle of TMS 6. Based on these results, we present an expanded helix-packing model for NCX1. Na+-Ca2+ exchangers (NCX) 2The abbreviations used are: NCX, Na+-Ca2+ exchanger; TMS, transmembrane segment;MTS,methanethiosulfonate;MTSET,[2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonatebromide; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; Ch-MβCD, cholesterol-cyclodextrin complex; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CuPhe, CuSO4/phenanthroline; o-PDM, N′, N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide; p-PDM, N′, N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide; M3M, 1,3-propanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate; M6M, 1,6-hexanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate; WT, wild-type. are found in many tissues. The cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1) plays a key role in myocardial contraction and relaxation. NCX exchanges three Na+ ions for one Ca2+ and can move Ca2+ either into or out of cells, depending on the electrochemical driving force. During the depolarization phase of the action potential, Ca2+ enters the cardiomyocyte primarily through L-type Ca2+ channels to trigger sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ release and to initiate contraction. During the relaxation phase, Ca2+ is transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by an ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump and is extruded from the cell by NCX1 (1Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. Second Edition. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2001: 133-160Google Scholar). The current topological model of the NCX protein contains nine transmembrane segment (TMS) helices and two reentrant loops (Fig. 1). There is a large cytoplasmic loop between TMSs 5 and 6, and the N and C termini are located on the extracellular and intracellular sides, respectively. The native Na+-Ca2+ exchanger protein has a molecular mass of 110 kDa based on amino acid sequence (2Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic analysis of purified NCX1 displays three protein bands with molecular masses of 160, 120, and 70 kDa. The 70-kDa band is likely a proteolytic fragment (3Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Durkin J.T. Ahrens D.C. Pan Y.C. Reeves J.P. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Under reducing conditions, the 160-kDa band is weak, and the 120-kDa band is more intense. Under nonreducing conditions, the 120-kDa band disappears, and the 160-kDa band becomes prominent (3Philipson K.D. Longoni S. Ward R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 945: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This mobility shift is due to an intramolecular disulfide bond between cysteine 792 and either cysteine 14 or cysteine 20 as shown by mutagenesis and biochemical analysis (5Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, cross-linking between the N- and C-terminal halves of the exchanger results in decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE (6Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, it is necessary to learn about the three-dimensional arrangement of the TMSs within the plasma membrane. However, hydrophobic membrane proteins are difficult to crystallize, and a high resolution structure of NCX1 is not available. Qiu et al. (6Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) developed an alternative method for obtaining structural information about NCX1 by taking advantage of the shift in electrophoretic mobility when there is a cross-link between the two halves of the protein. A helix-packing model of TMSs 2, 3, 7, and 8 of NCX1 was formulated by introducing pairs of cysteine mutants into a cysteine-less background and testing for disulfide cross-linker-induced mobility shifts. Here, we extend the packing model of NCX1 to include TMSs 1 and 6. Cysteine mutations were introduced into the N or C terminus of TMSs 1 or 2 and then paired with cysteine 768 in TMS 6. cDNAs of NCX1 mutants were expressed in insect High Five cells. Intramolecular cross-linking was detected by mobility shifts on SDS-PAGE gels following treatment of intact cells with cross-linking agents. The results indicate that TMSs 1 and 2 are in proximity with TMS 6. Strikingly, cysteine 768 in TMS 6 could form cross-links with residues modeled to be near both the intracellular and the extracellular surfaces of TMS 1 and TMS 2. Cysteine 768 is likely near the center of TMS 6. Construction of Exchanger Cysteine Mutants—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) was used to prepare mutants (7Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Mutations were generated in 300-500-bp cassettes and verified by sequencing. Full-length exchangers with single or double mutations were constructed by subcloning the mutated cassettes into the cysteine-less exchanger. Expression of the NCX1 Cysteine Mutants in Insect High Five Cells—A lepidopteran insect cell expression system, BTI-TN-5B1-4 (High Five, Invitrogen), was used for transient transfection of NCX1 cysteine mutants. High Five cells were cultured at 27 °C in Express Five SFM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Mutant NCX1 cDNA was subcloned into the pIB/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into High Five insect cells using lipid-mediated transfection with Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). 4 h after transfection, 0.1 mm cholesterol-cyclodextrin complex (Ch-MβCD) (8Gimpl G. Klein U. Reilander H. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13794-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) was added to the transfected cells to increase exchanger protein expression. 24-48 h after transfection, Na+ gradient-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake in transfected High Five insect cells was measured. Cells were harvested and washed twice with washing buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl) and then loaded with Na+ by incubation with 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm ouabain, and 25 μm nystatin for 10 min at room temperature. Nystatin was removed from the cells by two washes with washing buffer plus 0.4 mm ouabain. Uptake was initiated by resuspending the cell pellet in assay medium: 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 140 mm KCl (or NaCl as control), 25 μm CaCl2, 0.4 mm ouabain, and 5 μCi/ml 45Ca2+. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold quenching solution (140 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA) followed by two additional washes with quenching solution. Cell pellets were dissolved in 1 n NaOH at 60 °C for 30 min. Aliquots of samples were subjected to scintillation counting and protein assay (MicroBCA, Pierce). Cross-linking Procedures—Intact cells were washed with washing buffer, and cross-linking was carried out at room temperature by the addition of oxidative reagent (CuSO4/phenanthroline (CuPhe)), thiol-specific homobifunctional cross-linker, or methanethiosulfonate (MTS) cross-linkers (Toronto Research Chemicals) to the intact cell suspension. The final concentrations of reagents were 1 mm CuSO4, 3 mm phenanthroline, or 0.5 mm N′, N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide (o-PDM) or 0.5 mm p-PDM, 0.5 mm 1,3-propanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M3M), or 0.5 mm 1,6-hexanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M6M). Some samples were preincubated with 10 mm [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) or 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Reactions were terminated after 20 min by the addition of NEM (10 mm). Cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors (Complete, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Aliquots were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing reagents, and immunoblot analysis was carried out with NCX1 antibody R3F1 (SWant). Cysteine Residues Introduced into the Cysteine-less Na+-Ca2+ Exchanger—Fig. 1 shows residues mutated to cysteine in this study. The residues labeled with asterisks, 14, 20, 122, 768, and 792, are cysteines in the wild-type canine NCX1 but were mutated to alanine to produce the cysteine-less exchanger (7Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The cysteine-less exchanger was used as our background protein for introduction of cysteines. Thus, each mutant contains only one or two cysteines as indicated. In the single-cysteine mutant A122C, for example, the alanine at position 122 in the cysteine-less exchanger has been mutated back to a cysteine. In addition to the five reintroduced cysteines, we also used cysteine mutants at positions 101 and 102, as described previously (9Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and new cysteine introductions at positions 40, 41, 42, 45, 49, 59, and 765-767. Single cysteines or pairs of cysteines were introduced into the cysteine-less NCX1 background, and the proximity of the paired cysteine residues was then readily assayed by gel mobility shifts following treatment with disulfide or chemical cross-linking reagents (6Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Na+ Gradient-dependent45Ca2+ Uptake of Cysteine Mutants in High Five cells Increased by Applying Ch-MβCD—As a eukaryotic expression system, High Five cells provide similar posttranslational modifications as mammalian cell lines and have successfully been used to express the K+-dependent Na+-Ca2+ exchangers (10Szerencsei R.T.

We found that transient transfection of High Five cells with the wild-type (WT) Na+-Ca2+ exchanger gave very consistent levels of NCX1 activity and immunoreactive protein (data not shown). Relative protein expression levels were determined by Na+-gradient-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into cells and immunoblot analysis and compared with expression levels of WT NCX1. The mutant proteins expressed a wide range of functional activities from almost none to about 95% of WT NCX1 (Table 1). Protein levels of mutants and WT NCX1, detected by immunoblot, showed a positive correlation with activity.TABLE 1Activity of NCX1 cysteine mutants The Na+-gradient 45Ca2+ uptake into High Five cells expressing each of the mutants was determined and normalized to WT activity (n = 3–5, mean ± S.D.).MutantNCX activityFold increase–Ch-MβCD+Ch-MβCDWT100170 ± 301.7Cysteine-less19 ± 775 ± 243.9A14C/A20C/A768C4 ± 220 ± 125.0I40C/A792C7 ± 521 ± 63.0A41C/A768C6 ± 344 ± 337.3A41C/A767C10 ± 1153 ± 215.3A41C/W766C6 ± 130 ± 45.0V45C/A768C15 ± 1551 ± 403.4A49C/A768C8 ± 1044 ± 245.5I59C/A768C11 ± 827 ± 72.5I59C/A767C12 ± 1041 ± 273.4I59C/A792C4 ± 512 ± 23.0N101C/A768C7 ± 232 ± 134.6L102C/A768C8 ± 1222 ± 202.5A122C/A768C36 ± 1195 ± 402.6A122C/A792C10 ± 747 ± 344.7A122C22 ± 2287 ± 513.9A768C11 ± 563 ± 405.7 Open table in a new tab It has been reported that the level of cholesterol in the insect cell membrane is much lower than in mammalian cell membranes (8Gimpl G. Klein U. Reilander H. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13794-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and for some membrane proteins, expression is improved by increasing membrane cholesterol with Ch-MβCD (8Gimpl G. Klein U. Reilander H. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13794-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Since NCX1 activity is affected by cholesterol (12Vemuri R. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 937: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Vemuri R. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8680-8685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that the low activity of some NCX1 mutants might be improved by increasing membrane cholesterol levels. We tested the effect on exchanger activity of adding Ch-MβCD to the culture medium after transfection. The activity of most mutants was substantially increased by the addition of Ch-MβCD (Table 1). Thus, all cross-linking studies were carried out using transfected cells treated with Ch-MβCD, and only active mutants were examined. Cross-linking of TMSs 1 and 6 of the Na+-Ca2+ Exchanger— To ascertain the proximity of cysteine residues, many cross-linkers are available, and their use is widespread for topology studies of membrane proteins. CuPhe is an oxidative reagent, which can catalyze disulfide formation between sulfhydryl groups. o-PDM and p-PDM are dimaleimide sulfhydryl cross-linkers with linker distances of 7.7 and 12 Å, respectively, and have been used successfully with NCX1 in a previous study (6Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MTS cross-linkers react selectively with cysteines, resulting in a disulfide attachment of the spacer arm. We used the two different chemistries of MTS and PDM cross-linkers in this study. The MTS reagents we chose, M3M (6.5 Å) and M6M (10.4 Å), have similar cross-link sizes as o-PDM and p-PDM. All the cross-linkers chosen for this study are membrane-permeable, and the cross-linking experiments were carried out using intact cells. The WT NCX1 expressed in High Five insect cells migrates as a 120-kDa band in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (data not shown). Under nonreducing conditions, an additional band at 140 kDa is seen. For NCX1 expressed in other cell types (cardiomyocytes or HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells)), the additional band is at 160 kDa. This discrepancy may be due to glycosylation differences (14Tomiya N. Narang S. Lee Y.C. Betenbaugh M.J. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 343-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The 140-kDa (or 160-kDa) band results from an intramolecular disulfide bond between cysteine 792 and either cysteine 14 or cysteine 20 (5Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and disappears under reducing conditions. Unlike in HEK293 cells, the exchanger protein is not seen in higher molecular weight aggregates on SDS-PAGE when expressed in High Five cells, thus making this a cleaner cell system to test for mobility shifts of the exchanger protein. The general approach we took to identify interactions between TMSs was to first generate a set of consecutive single-cysteine mutants near the surface of a TMS (for example, in TMS 1, we made mutations at residues 40, 41, 42, and 43). Then, we paired each single-cysteine mutant with a second cysteine mutant in the other half of the exchanger and tested for cross-linking-induced gel shifts. We tested more than 20 double-cysteine mutants before finding one that showed a gel shift. There are numerous reasons why we might not detect cross-linking ranging from lack of proximity between TMSs, incorrect orientation of the TMSs, or simply an insufficient change in conformation in the cross-linked protein for detection on SDS-PAGE. A lack of gel shift for any given double mutant gives no information regarding helix packing, and null mutants 3Null mutants included: 40/788, 40/789, 40/892, 40/907, 40/909, 40/912, 40/923, 41/788, 41/789, 41/892, 41/907, 41/909, 41/912, 41/923, 42/789, 42/892, 42/907, 42/909, 42/923, 59/892, 59/907, 59/909, 59/912, 59/923. were not pursued. The first mutant we found positive for cross-linking was A41C/A768C. This indicated that residues located in TMSs 1 and 6 were close enough in the protein to result in cross-linking using o-PDM, p-PDM, M3M, or M6M (Fig. 2A, upper panel). The lowest concentration of M3M that induced a 140-kDa band was 100 μm. At 500 μm M3M, the maximal amount of NCX1 protein in the 140-kDa band was observed (about 50%). This level of cross-linking was observed within 1 min of exposure to M3M. We were surprised that residues 41 and 768 cross-linked since they were modeled to be near opposite sides of the membrane (Fig. 1). To further explore the relationship between TMSs 1 and 6, we paired A768C with residues 45, 49, and 59, all modeled to be on the same face of TMS 1 as residue 41 (see Fig. 7). Residues 45 and 49 are modeled to be toward the center of TMS 1, whereas residue 59 is modeled to be at the intracellular surface. Mobility shifts in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions following application of cross-linkers were observed for mutants V45C/A768C (Fig. 2B, left panel) and I59C/A768C (Fig. 2C, upper panel) but not for mutant A49C/A768C (Fig. 2B, right panel) indicating that residue 768 can react with residues along the entire length of TMS 1. We also found that mutants A41C/A767C and I59C/A767C showed evidence of cross-linking (Fig. 2D). Mobility shifts could be prevented by incubating the cells with 10 mm NEM before application of cross-linkers (Fig. 2, lower panels). On a helical wheel projection of TMS 1, residues 41, 45 and 59 are within a few degrees of each other, whereas residue 49 is slightly offset (see Fig. 7), suggesting that residues outside of the packing faces would not cross-link. Therefore, we tried pairing A768C with I40C and R42C, residues within one turn of A41C. However, neither of these double-cysteine mutants displayed NCX activity. Conversely, we also paired A41C with G765C, W766C, and A767C. Neither NCX1 protein nor activity could be detected with mutant A41C/G765C. Mutant A41C/W766C is active but showed no mobility shift upon application of cross-linkers (data not shown). However, mutant A41C/A767C both is active and demonstrates cross-linker-induced gel shifts (Fig. 2D, left panel). Similarity, we paired I59C with G765C, W766C, and A767C. No protein expressed in the mutants I59C/G765C and I59C/W766C. Mutant I59C/A767C showed activity and cross-linker-induced mobility shift in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2D, right panel). These data confirm that TMSs 1 and 6 interact along one face of their respective helices. Cross-linking of TMSs 2 and 6 of the Na+-Ca2+ Exchanger— We also tested for proximity of residue 768 to residues on either end of TMS 2. In the wild-type NCX1, there is a cysteine at position 122. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis studies indicate that this residue is located in TMS 2 or the first reentrant loop close to the extracellular surface (7Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Iwamoto T. Nakamura T.Y. Pan Y. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We reintroduced the two native cysteine residues 122 and 768 into the cysteine-less background and transfected the cDNA into High Five insect cells. The A122C/A768C mutant migrated as a 120-kDa band in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3A, first lane). Both 120-kDa and 140-kDa bands were observed upon application of CuPhe or the cross-linkers o-PDM or M3M. The 140-kDa band was especially intense with CuPhe (Fig. 3A, second lane). CuPhe catalyzes formation of a disulfide bond between adjacent cysteines. Thus, residues 122 and 768 are close enough to form a disulfide bond. Pretreatment with either 10 mm NEM (Fig. 3A, bottom panel) or 10 mm MTSET (data not shown) does not fully prevent cross-linking of residues 122 and 768. Thus, residues 122 and 768 may be buried in lipid or protein and is not readily accessible to NEM. Residues Ser-100 and Leu-102 were previously shown to be near the intracellular surface of TMS 2 since the activities of mutants S100C and L102C were inhibited by intracellular applications of MTSET (9Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We paired A768C with either N101C or L102C on the cysteine-less background and examined the effect of cross-linking reagents M3M or M6M on SDS-PAGE mobility (Fig. 3, B and C). For both mutants, cross-linker-induced mobility shifts, which could be inhibited by preincubation with NEM, were observed. We were unable to examine the effect of disulfide cross-linking on the activity of exchanger mutants expressed in High Five cells as the activity of the cysteine-less exchanger itself was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by cross-linking reagents. This may be secondary to alterations of other cellular constituents by the cross-linking reagents. Evidence to Support the Location of Cysteines 40, 59, 122, and 768—Many data support the topological model presented in Fig. 1 (7Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, details, such as the precise beginning and ending points for TMSs, are uncertain. Thus, we undertook experiments to verify the proposed positions of cysteines at positions 40, 59, 122, and 768. Cysteines at positions 40, 59, and 122 were paired with native cysteine 792, which has been shown to be at the extracellular side of the membrane (5Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Residues 40 and 122, modeled to be at the extracellular surfaces of TMS 1 and 2, respectively, demonstrated mobility shifts when paired with A792C and treated with cross-linkers (Fig. 4, A and B). On the other hand, when residue 59, modeled to be at the intracellular surface of TMS 1, was paired with A792C, no cross-linker-induced mobility shifts were seen (Fig. 4C). To determine the location of Cys-768, it was combined with native cysteines Cys-14 and Cys-20. These residues are both located at the N-terminal, extracellular surface of NCX1 (5Santacruz-Toloza L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4D, no mobility shift was observed for this mutant following cross-linking, thus suggesting that Cys-768 is not accessible to the extracellular surface. To obtain more information on the location of Cys-768, we examined the effect of sulfhydryl-modifying reagents on the activity of the single-cysteine mutant Cys-768 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We have used this approach previously to determine NCX1 topology (7Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). cRNA of NCX1 exchanger mutant A768C was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, and exchanger activity was measured following treatment with the sulfhydryl reagents MTSET or NEM. MTSET is a cationic, membrane-impermeable reagent, and NEM is membrane-permeable. Both form covalent bonds with accessible cysteines. MTSET or NEM were either applied extracellularly, by incubating oocytes in medium containing 10 mm reagent, or applied intracellularly, by injecting MTSET solution into the oocyte for an estimated cytoplasmic concentration of 10 mm (Fig. 5). Extracellular application of impermeant MTSET had no significant effect on mutant A768C activity. On the other hand, intracellular application of MTSET or extracellular application of permeant NEM inhibited the activity of A768C. The results verify that residue 768 is more accessible from the cytoplasmic than extracellular side of the membrane. The results also suggest that residue 768 may be in a functionally significant region because exchange activity was inhibited by sulfhydryl modifications. Interestingly, intracellular application of MTSET had no effect on the activity of WT NCX1 (9Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which also contains a cysteine at position 768. Perhaps labeling of other native cysteines blocks accessibility to Cys-768, or Cys-768 forms an undetected disulfide bond with another native cysteine. The latter seems less likely since Cys-768 is accessible to the intracellular milieu and thus probably is in a reducing environment. Co-transfection of Single-cysteine Mutants—To distinguish between cross-linking derived from intermolecular versus intramolecular interactions, single-cysteine mutants (I40C, A41C, I59C, A122C, N101C, L102C, A768C, and A792C) were transfected into High Five cells. No mobility shift band was observed for any single-cysteine mutant after the addition of cross-linking reagents (data not shown). Next, pairs of single-cysteine mutants were co-transfected into High Five cells followed by cross-linking experiments. As shown in Fig. 6, cross-linking was not observed when single-cysteine mutant A41C, I59C, or A122C was coexpressed with single mutant A768C. Thus, the cross-linking that was observed in the double-cysteine mutants was due to intramolecular, and not intermolecular, interactions. A previous helix-packing study of NCX1 demonstrated that TMSs 2, 3, 7, 8, and their associated reentrant loops are in proximity (6Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The results of this current study extend these observations to include TMS 1 and 6. Our data show that residue 768 in TMS 6 is in proximity to residues in TMS 1 and 2. A new helical wheel projection of NCX1 that includes TMSs 1 and 6 along with TMSs 2, 3, 7, and 8 is shown in Fig. 7. This figure summarizes the results obtained in the present study and also includes the results from Qiu et al. (6Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For this model, it was assumed that each TMS spans the membrane uninterrupted by discontinuities and that each of the indicated residues is in a helical part of the TMS and not in connecting loops. This model should provide guidelines and predictions for further experimentation and model refinement. The only TMSs not yet accounted for in our helix-packing model are TMSs 4, 5, and 9. Most of the loops connecting consecutive TMSs appear to be relatively short, with the notable exception of the large loop connecting TMSs 5 and 6. It has also been noted that consecutive TMSs tend to be near one another in packed structures of membrane proteins (16Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 780-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that TMSs 4 and 5 will reside in the vicinity of TMS 3. Likewise, TMS 9 is likely to be near TMS 8. Qiu et al. (6Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported cross-linking in the nonfunctional mutant S117C/K909C, which also supports placing TMS 9 into the area bounded by TMSs 8, 2, and 7. The most striking experimental result presented here indicates that residues Cys-768 and Ala-767 are accessible to residues modeled to be near both the extracellular and the intracellular sides of TMSs 1 and 2 (Figs. 2 and 3). Cys-768 has previously been modeled to be in TMS 6 toward the intracellular surface of the membrane (Fig. 1) (17Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Quednau B.D. Reuter H. John S. Qiu Z. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the position of Cys-768 can just as easily be modeled to be more toward the center of TMS 6 without significantly reducing hydrophobicity of the TMS. Our results strongly indicate that this is the case. Nevertheless, accessibility of Cys-768 to both sides of the membrane is still surprising. If TMS 1 and TMS 2 are both continuous α helices, then the residues that interact with Cys-768 would be separated by five turns or a distance of about 27 Å. Assuming a static interaction between the helices, a single residue in the middle of TMS 6 would require a cross-linker that is longer than 10 Å to reach both residues at either side of the membrane. However, cross-linking was observed with M3M, a 6.4 Å cross-linker. There are a number of possibilities for how this might occur. For example, TMS 1 and 2 may not be continuous helices. There is a growing body of x-ray structures of membrane proteins in which TMSs are not continuous α helices (18Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 19Hunte C. Screpanti E. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 435: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). If there are nonhelical sections of TMSs 1 and 2, then residues modeled to be on opposite sides of the membrane could be closer than estimated from the rise of a single helix. TMS 2 does have a proline at residue 112, about half the distance between residues 101 and 122, that might induce a kink in the helix. Also, there are several tyrosines (weak helix breakers) and a glycine (strong helix breaker) in TMS 1, although these residues are not consecutive. Alternatively, the residues that are modeled to be within a transmembrane-spanning region may be in a loop connecting TMSs. Loops could be flexible and reach in toward residue 768 if there is a vestibule-like structure in NCX to allow accessibility. Finally, there may be flexibility in the exchanger protein such that TMS 6 can move depending on the conformation of the protein. This might allow Cys-768 to alternately interact with residues at the intracellular or extracellular surface. A precedent is the S4 segment of ion channels, which moves outward in response to membrane depolarization (20Yang N. George Jr., A.L. Horn R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 21Yang N. George Jr., A.L. Horn R. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2260-2268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Grottesi A. Domene C. Hall B. Sansom M.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14586-14594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Notable also is the interaction between residues 122 and 768. In the wild-type NCX1, both of these residues are cysteines. Residue 122 is near the interface between the extracellular end of TMS 2 and the reentrant loop of the α-1 repeat, a region of functional importance (23Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There had been no previous indication of interaction between Cys-122 and Cys-768 in the WT NCX1 (5Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, a disulfide bond formed between residues Cys-768 and Cys-122 in the presence of CuPhe (Fig. 3A) indicates a short distance between these two cysteine residues. Proximity of the two residues is consistent with a functional importance for TMS 6. Crystallization of membrane proteins is a difficult process. The NCX1 protein has not yet been crystallized, and large quantities of purified functional protein are not available. Hopefully, our studies on helix packing of NCX1 may help provide initial insight on the mechanism of action of this ion transporter and lead to the design of additional studies."
https://openalex.org/W1977621737,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimeric Ser/Thr phosphatase that is involved in regulating a plethora of signaling pathways in the cell, making its regulation a critical part of the well being of the cell. For example, three of the non-catalytic PP2A subunits have been linked to carcinogenic events. Therefore, the molecular basis for the complicated protein-protein interaction pattern of PP2A and its regulators is of special interest. The PP2A phosphatase activator (PTPA) protein is highly conserved from humans to yeast. It is an activator of PP2A and has been shown to be essential for a fully functional PP2A, but its mechanism of activation is still not well defined. We have solved the crystal structure of human PTPA to 1.6Å. It reveals a two-domain protein with a novel fold comprised of 13 α-helices. We have identified a highly conserved cleft as a potential region for interaction with peptide segments of other proteins. Binding studies with ATP and its analogs are not consistent with ATP being a cofactor/substrate for PTPA as had previously been proposed. The structure of PTPA can serve as a basis for structurefunction studies directed at elucidating its mechanism as an activator of PP2A."
https://openalex.org/W1998940228,"Topoisomerase II catalyzes the ATP-dependent transport of a DNA segment (T-DNA) through a transient double strand break in another DNA segment (G-DNA). A fundamental mechanistic question is how the individual steps in this process are coordinated. We probed communication between the DNA binding sites and the individual enzymatic activities, ATP hydrolysis, and DNA cleavage. We employed short DNA duplexes to control occupancy at the two binding sites of wild-type enzyme and a variant with a G-DNA site mutation. The DNA concentration dependence of ATP hydrolysis and a fluorescence anisotropy assay provided thermodynamic information about DNA binding. The results suggest that G-DNA binds with higher affinity than T-DNA. Enzyme with only G-DNA bound is competent to cleave DNA, indicating that T-DNA is dispensable for DNA cleavage. The ATPase activity of enzyme bound solely to G-DNA is partially stimulated. Full stimulation requires binding of T-DNA. Both DNA binding sites therefore signal to the ATPase domains. The results support and extend current mechanistic models for topoisomerase II-catalyzed DNA transport and provide a framework for future mechanistic dissection."

Pto is a myristoylated protein, and N-myristoylation is required for signaling. Here we demonstrated a role for N-myristoylation in controlling Pto kinase activity. A myristoylated peptide corresponding to Pto residues 2-10 significantly impaired the kinase activity of N-truncated Pto. We show that kinase inhibition was specific to the myristoylated form of the peptide and that free myristate supplied in trans was a potent suppressor of Pto kinase activity. Thus, myristate, but not Pto residues 2-10, contributes to suppression of kinase activity in vitro. Accordingly, elimination of the in vivo myristoylation potential of Pto de-repressed kinase activity. The increased potency of free myristate relative to the myristoylated N-peptide inhibitor suggested that the peptide moiety is antagonistic to repression by myristate. Suppression of related protein kinases by myristate declined with similarity to Pto, and the inhibitory activity could be attributed to hydrophobicity. We present evidence that inhibition of Pto by the myristoylated N-peptide is mediated through a previously identified surface regulatory patch. The data show a role for negative regulation of Pto by N-myristoylation, in addition to the previously demonstrated positive role, and are consistent with a model in which the acylated N terminus is sequestered in the catalytic cleft prior to release by Pto activation.

Moffett P. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The physical events underlying pathogen recognition are not well understood. In some cases, Avr products appear to interact directly with R proteins (2Deslandes L. Olivier J. Peeters N. Feng D.X. Khounlotham M. Boucher C. Somssich I.E. Genin S. Marco Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4004-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), whereas several examples of indirect association, in which the Avr product contacts a linker protein associated with the R component, have been described (4Belkhadir Y. Subramaniam R. Dangl J.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 5Shao F. Golstein C. Ade J. Stoutemyer M. Dixon J.E. Innes R.W. Science. 2003; 301: 1230-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The molecular events underlying activation of R proteins, which commonly possess a central nucleotide-binding motif known as the NB-ARC domain and C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (NBARC-LRR proteins (6Dangl J.L. Jones J.D.G. Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar)), are poorly understood, as are the immediate proximal events in signal transduction. The tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) R gene Pto confers race-specific resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato bacteria carrying avrPto or avrPtoB (7Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Pto, a Ser/Thr protein kinase, apparently interacts directly with both Avrs upon delivery into host cells through the type III secretion system, although physical association in planta has yet to be demonstrated. Pto-mediated resistance requires the NBARC-LRR gene Prf (8Salmeron J.M. Oldroyd G.E.D. Rommens C.M.T. Scofield S.R. Kim H.-S. Lavelle D.T. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We have found that Pto and Prf associate constitutively in planta to regulate Avr perception and basal signaling. 4Mucyn, T., Clemente, A., Andriotis, V. M. E., Balmuth, A., Oldroyd, B., Staskawicz, B., and Rathjen, J. P. (2006) Plant Cell, in press. In addition, various potential downstream members of the Pto signaling pathway have been reported (7Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 11del Pozo O. Pedley K.F. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), such as the protein kinase Pti1, which is phosphorylated by Pto in vitro and provides an informative measure of Pto kinase activity (12Zhou J. Loh Y.-T. Bressan R.A. Martin G.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 925-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Pto and its homologues Fen, Pth2, Pth3, and Pth5 encode consensus N-terminal myristoylation motifs (13Chang J.H. Tai Y.S. Bernal A.J. Lavelle D.T. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein N-myristoylation involves the typically co-translational, covalent, and irreversible attachment of the 14-carbon saturated fatty acid myristate at the N-terminal glycine residue (14Farazi T.A. Waksman G. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39501-39504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation often contributes to membrane localization of target proteins, acting either constitutively or induced by myristate exposure through so-called myristoyl switches (15Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Pto is myristoylated in vivo dependent on the Gly-2 residue, but we were unable to demonstrate that Pto myristoylation status determines subcellular localization (16de Vries J.S. Andriotis V.M.E. Wu A.-J. Rathjen J.P. Plant J. 2006; 45: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Gly-2 is essential for signaling both by wild type Pto and constitutive gain-of-function (CGF) forms in Nicotiana benthamiana (16de Vries J.S. Andriotis V.M.E. Wu A.-J. Rathjen J.P. Plant J. 2006; 45: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, many Avr and R proteins possess consensus N-myristoylation motifs (17Boisson B. Giglione C. Meinnel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43418-43429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and several Avr proteins are myristoylated in vivo (18Nimchuk Z. Marois E. Kjemtrup S. Leister R.T. Katagiri F. Dangl J.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 19Shan L. Thara V.K. Martin G.B. Zhou J.-M. Tang X. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2323-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation may also enhance intra- or inter-molecular protein interactions (20Matsubara M. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Hayashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48898-48902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and influence protein structural and thermal stability (21Kennedy M.T. Brockman H. Rusnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26517-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Of interest is the effect of acylation on enzyme activity. Abolishing myristoylation of the β1 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase resulted in a significant increase in kinase activity (22Warden S.M. Richardson C. O'Donnell Jr., J. Stapleton D. Kemp D.E. Witters L.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This is reminiscent of an autoinhibitory mechanism in the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl, for which elimination of the myristoylation potential also de-represses kinase activity (23Hantschel O. Nagar B. Guettler S. Kretzschmar J. Dorey K. Kuriyan J. Superti-Furga G. Cell. 2003; 112: 845-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In c-Abl, the myristate group is sequestered in a hydrophobic pocket within the kinase domain, inducing a bend within a C-terminal α-helix and promoting docking of domains distal to the c-Abl active site, thus locking the enzyme in a regulated, autoinhibited conformation (23Hantschel O. Nagar B. Guettler S. Kretzschmar J. Dorey K. Kuriyan J. Superti-Furga G. Cell. 2003; 112: 845-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 24Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Upon activation, removal of the myristate group from the hydrophobic pocket might mimic the unmyristoylated form, thus enhancing enzymic activity. We recently identified a surface-exposed, hydrophobic region on Pto that confers negative regulation of Pto signaling (the negative regulatory patch (NRP) (25Wu A.-J. Andriotis V.M.E. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). This surface is required for Pto-Avr interaction and spans the Pto catalytic cleft and adjacent residues. Mutations within the NRP result in CGF forms of Pto that elicit Avr-independent cell death in N. benthamiana. We proposed a model in which the NRP is normally occupied by a negative regulatory molecule that acts to repress Pto kinase activity. Avr binding displaces the repressor, allowing regulatory phosphorylation and a conformational change in the Pto tertiary structure leading to activation (25Wu A.-J. Andriotis V.M.E. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The identity of the putative negative regulator is unknown. In this paper we describe a role of the myristoylated Pto N terminus in suppressing Pto kinase activity in vitro. We show that myristate-modified peptides are potent inhibitors of the auto- and trans-phosphorylation activities of Pto. Free myristate severely inhibited kinase capability in a dose-dependent manner. Removal of the myristoylation potential of Pto expressed in planta resulted in stimulation of kinase activity relative to the wild type protein. We show that the inhibitory effect of the myristoylated N-peptide is mediated by a key residue within the NRP. Our data suggest that the myristoylated N terminus may be associated with the catalytic cleft of Pto kinase, consistent with our previous prediction of a peptide or molecule suppressing kinase activity. Cloning and Expression of Pto Mutants in N. benthamiana and Escherichia coli—All constructs were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and sequenced to exclude PCR errors. For expression in planta, constructs were cloned in the pTFS40 binary vector (26Rathjen J.P. Chang J.H. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recombinant binary vectors were transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV2260 for expression in planta, and the presence of the vector was confirmed by PCR. Manipulation of A. tumefaciens strain GV2260 containing the required binary plasmid for transient in planta expression of Pto was as described (16de Vries J.S. Andriotis V.M.E. Wu A.-J. Rathjen J.P. Plant J. 2006; 45: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Six-week-old N. benthamiana plants grown under standard greenhouse conditions were inoculated by pressure infiltration using a disposable syringe. For expression of Pto mutants, Fen and Pti1 in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions, constructs were cloned in the pGEX-2TK vector (GE Healthcare) and transferred either to E. coli strains DH5α or BL21-CodonPlus (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transformed bacterial cultures were grown in SOB media supplemented with appropriate antibiotics to A600 ∼0.4 at 37 °C, and expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 16 °C overnight. Alternatively, Pto was expressed with a C-terminal His6 epitope tag with the pBAD expression system (Invitrogen). Expression of recombinant Pto-His6 was induced with l-arabinose at 16 °C overnight as for the GST fusion proteins. Recombinant Protein Purification—GST fusion proteins were purified over glutathione-Sepharose columns (GE Healthcare) as described (16de Vries J.S. Andriotis V.M.E. Wu A.-J. Rathjen J.P. Plant J. 2006; 45: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Wu A.-J. Andriotis V.M.E. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GST-pti1K96N to be used as the substrate in Pto kinase assays was expressed as described (26Rathjen J.P. Chang J.H. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and purified over GSTrap FF columns as for Pto. Where required, GST-pti1K96N was treated with thrombin protease (GE Healthcare) to cleave the GST moiety (25Wu A.-J. Andriotis V.M.E. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For Pto-His6 purification, cells from induced cultures were pelleted, resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and bacterial protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Crude extracts were filtered through 0.45-μm filters and applied to HisTrap FF columns (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, and finally desalted through PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Protein Immunoprecipitation Using Epitope Tags—FLAG epitope-tagged proteins transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves were immunoprecipitated from crude extracts with anti-FLAG ® M2 affinity gel (Sigma) as described (16de Vries J.S. Andriotis V.M.E. Wu A.-J. Rathjen J.P. Plant J. 2006; 45: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed with 1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS), resuspended in 1× TBS, 50% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at -20 °C for subsequent kinase assays. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides corresponding to Pto N-terminal residues 2-10 (Gly2-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Ala-Thr-Asn10) were synthesized commercially (Sigma Genosys). These were produced in the myristoylated (at Pto Gly-2; myr-Pto2-10) and nonmyristoylated (Pto2-10) forms. The protein kinase Cθ pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptides myr-PKCθ and PKCθ (Leu-His-Gln-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ala-Ile-Leu-Lys-Gln-Ala-Lys-Val-His-His-Val-Lys-Cys-NH2; myristoylated, myr-PKCθ; non myristoylated, PKCθ) were obtained commercially (Calbiochem). The hemagglutinin (HA) peptide (Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) was from Roche Applied Science. MAPK Activation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta cell suspension cultures were treated at room (ambient) temperature for 10 min with 100 nm flagellin peptide (flg22) (27Nuhse T.S. Peck S.C. Hirt H. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7521-7526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by vacuum filtration, ground under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder, and suspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, plant protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma). Following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, crude extracts were filtered through 0.45-μm filters. Activated AtMAPK3 and AtMAPK6 were immunoprecipitated with specific antisera, and immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), washed with the same buffer, and finally resuspended in kinase buffer (see under “In Vitro Kinase Activity Assays”). Activated AtMAPK3 and AtMAPK6 were detected by Western blotting using α-DP-ERK (Sigma) as the primary antibody. This reacts specifically with the epitope containing the phosphorylated Thr and Tyr residues within the regulatory site of active MAPK. Immunodetection was performed with an ECL chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare). In Vitro Kinase Activity Assays—Pto in vitro kinase assays contained the following in a total volume of 50 μl: 1 μg of recombinant Pto or 10 μl of immunoprecipitated Pto-FLAG (1:1 (v/v) suspension in 1× TBS, 50% (v/v) glycerol), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 183 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For assays of Pto trans-phosphorylation activity, either full-length GST-pti1K96N or cleaved pti1K96N (1 μg) was also included in kinase reactions as required. Reactions were initiated by addition of the substrate, incubated at 25 °C for 7.5 min, and terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. Under these assay conditions, incorporation of radiolabel was found to be linear with time and the enzyme concentration used. To assess the effect of inhibitors on Pto kinase activity, each inhibitor was included in the kinase assays at the concentrations indicated under “Results.” At the end of each assay, samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE. Postelectrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to confirm equivalent loading or used for Western blots with specific antisera against Pto (25Wu A.-J. Andriotis V.M.E. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Subsequently, they were subjected to autoradiography with a FUJI Film FLA5000 PhosphorImager (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Specific activity was estimated as the ratio between radioactive incorporation (PhosphorImager signal) and amount of protein added, except for Western blots where protein density was estimated with the QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad) after specific chemiluminescent detection of each protein. Results were expressed as % of the uninhibited enzyme. In vitro kinase activity of GST-Fen and GST-Pti1 kinases was assayed as described above for Pto, but omitting pti1K96N. MAPK activity was assessed in 20-μl reactions containing immunoprecipitated AtMAPK3 or AtMAPK6 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2,10mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm NaVO4 (kinase buffer). Assays were initiated by the addition of 10 μm ATP, 37 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare), and 1 μg of Phos32 as the peptide substrate, 5G. Merkouropoulos and S. Peck, unpublished data. incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling. Samples were then processed as described for Pto. SYMRK intracellular kinase domain with N-terminal His6 epitope tag (His6-SYMRK) was a generous gift of Dr. Satoko Yoshida (Genetics Institute, Ludwig Maximillians Universität, München, Germany). In vitro kinase activity of His6-SYMRK against myelin basic protein (MBP) was as described (28Yoshida S. Parniske M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9203-9209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The in Vitro Kinase Activity of Pto Is Inhibited in Trans by the Myristoylated N-peptide—We previously identified the Pto NRP, a hydrophobic surface on Pto overlapping the kinase catalytic cleft that negatively regulates signaling (25Wu A.-J. Andriotis V.M.E. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this patch is normally occupied by an unknown molecule acting to repress kinase activity. This could be part of Pto itself or derived from another molecule. Removal of the negative regulator was predicted to be sufficient to activate downstream signaling. We found that N-myristoylation was important for the activity of CGF forms of Pto, downstream of kinase activity (16de Vries J.S. Andriotis V.M.E. Wu A.-J. Rathjen J.P. Plant J. 2006; 45: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given its important functions and location outside of the kinase domain, we investigated whether the myristoylated N terminus of Pto is a candidate for the proposed regulatory molecule. To test this, we explored the ability of a peptide comprising amino acids 2-10 to repress Pto kinase activity in vitro. We expressed pto[N-10] in E. coli as a C-terminal fusion with the GST protein. This protein lacks 10 N-terminal amino acids and was shown previously to be an active kinase in vitro (16de Vries J.S. Andriotis V.M.E. Wu A.-J. Rathjen J.P. Plant J. 2006; 45: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To test the ability of residues 2-10 (not including Met-1, which is cleaved after translation) to repress Pto kinase activity, we synthesized the unmyristoylated (Pto2-10) and myristoylated (myr-Pto2-10, modified on Gly-2) forms of this peptide. Both were included in in vitro kinase activity assays of GST-pto[N-10] with pti1K96N as the substrate. This assay allows measurement of both the auto- and trans-phosphorylation activities of Pto. Increasing the concentration of the myr-Pto2-10 peptide effected significant inhibition of the transphosphorylation activity of GST-pto[N-10] against pti1K96N (Fig. 1a). Pto trans-phosphorylation activity was reduced by more than 90% at myr-Pto2-10 concentrations higher than 100 μm. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was estimated to be ∼50 μm. Conversely, neither Pto2-10 nor the unrelated hemagglutinin peptide (HA) had a significant effect on Pto kinase activity. Pto autophosphorylation activity was also suppressed by myr-Pto2-10, albeit to a lesser extent than trans-phosphorylation (Fig. 1b). We also tested whether Pto expressed in planta was inhibited by myr-Pto2-10. pto[N-10] fused to a sequence encoding a C-terminal FLAG epitope was transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The protein was immunoprecipitated from crude extracts with anti-FLAG ® M2-agarose beads and used for in vitro kinase assays in the presence of myr-Pto2-10 and Pto2-10. As for GST-pto[N-10], severe inhibition of kinase activity was effected at increasing concentration of myr-Pto2-10 but not Pto2-10 (Fig. 1c). We next asked whether the inhibition caused by myr-Pto2-10 could be observed in the presence of a myristoylated peptide of random sequence. To test this, we used two peptides unrelated to Pto2-10, myr-PKCθ and PKCθ, differing only for myristoylation status. These peptides function as pseudosubstrate inhibitors of protein kinase C, isoform θ (PKCθ) activity (29Ward N.E. O'Brian C.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11903-11909Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A progressive reduction of both the trans-(Fig. 1d) and auto-phosphorylation (Fig. 1e) activities of GST-pto[N-10] was observed in the presence of increasing concentrations of the myristoylated peptide (myr-PKCθ). The rate and the extent of inhibition caused by myr-PKCθ were comparable with that effected by myr-Pto2-10. The estimated IC50 for the inhibition of GST-pto[N-10] trans-phosphorylation activity by myr-PKCθ was ∼55 μm, similar to myr-Pto2-10 (∼50 μm). Comparable with Pto2-10, the nonmyristoylated PKCθ peptide did not suppress Pto kinase activity. Therefore, we conclude that Pto residues 2-10 do not contribute to suppression of Pto kinase activity in vitro. Free Myristate Inhibits Pto Kinase Activity in Vitro—The results above suggest that inhibition of Pto kinase activity by myr-Pto2-10 was because of the myristate moiety on Gly-2. To test this, we added myristate directly to kinase assays in the absence of conjugated peptide. These experiments used myristate-coenzyme A (myr-CoA) as the inhibitor to overcome the insolubility of myristate in aqueous solution. Severe inhibition of both the trans- and auto-phosphorylation activities of recombinant Pto was observed in the presence of myr-CoA (Fig. 2). Conversely, kinase activity was not significantly inhibited by CoA alone; therefore, inhibition was because of the myristate moiety. Less than 10% of kinase activity was retained at myr-CoA levels higher than 20 μm. The corresponding IC50 for inhibition of trans-phosphorylation activity by myr-CoA was ∼15 μm, substantially lower than the IC50 of myr-Pto2-10 (∼50 μm). Similar results were obtained with Pto-FLAG purified from N. benthamiana leaf extracts (data not shown). We reasoned that the inhibition of kinase activity by myristate might be attributable to its hydrophobic nature. In this case, other fatty acids might cause similar repression of Pto kinase activity. Therefore, we substituted myr-CoA in the kinase assays with CoA derivatives of both saturated (lauric acid, C12:0; palmitic acid, C16:0) and unsaturated (oleic acid, C18:1; linoleic acids, C18:2) fatty acids. Severe inhibition of Pto kinase activity was effected by all fatty acids tested (Fig. 3). The extent of suppression in all treatments was similar to that caused by myristate. These results indicate that the hydrophobic nature of the inhibitor is important for suppression of kinase activity in vitro. Inhibition of Kinase Activity by N-Myristoylation Declines with Evolutionary Distance from Pto—The protein kinase family is monophyletic, and all crystallized eukaryotic protein kinases possess a common fold (30Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested to test the generality of kinase activity repression by myr-Pto2-10 or myristate. If the observed inhibition is specific to Pto, then less closely related protein kinases should not be affected to the same extent by either inhibitor. We first investigated the in vitro activity of two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) from A. thaliana, AtMAPK3 and AtMAPK6. These enzymes are stimulated by a wide array of abiotic stresses and biotic elicitors, including the peptide flg22 derived from bacterial flagellin (27Nuhse T.S. Peck S.C. Hirt H. Boller T. J. Biol.

AtMAPK3 and AtMAPK6 were immunoprecipitated from flg22-treated A. thaliana cell suspension cultures and the immune complexes used directly in in vitro kinase assays with Phos32 protein as the substrate.5 Inclusion of either myr-Pto2-10 (not shown) or myr-CoA in the kinase assays did not have a pronounced effect on the activity of AtMAPK3. At myr-CoA levels that caused more than 90% inhibition of Pto kinase, AtMAPK3 enzymic activity was repressed only by 20-25% (Fig. 4). Results similar to the AtMAPK3 data were also obtained with AtMAPK6 (data not shown).TABLE 1Kinase inhibition by myristate declines with decreasing similarity to PtoIdentity to PtoIC50Maximum inhibitionOverallKinase domainAutophosphorylationTransphosphorylation%μm%AtMAPK31416NDaND indicates not d"

The donor RNA, D199, was a 199-nucleotide sequence from the 5′-end of the genome to the primer binding site (PBS) and shared 97 nucleotides of homology with the acceptor RNA. To investigate the influence of RNA structure on transfer, a second donor RNA, D520, was generated by extending the 3′-end of D199 to include an additional 321 nucleotides of the genome. The position of priming, length of homology with the acceptor, and length of cDNA synthesized were identical with the two donors. Interestingly, at 200% NC coating, donor D520 yielded a transfer efficiency of about 75% compared with about 35% with D199. A large proportion of the D520 promoted transfers occurred after the donor RNA was copied to the end. Analysis of donor RNA cleavage, the acceptor invasion site and R homology requirements indicated that transfers with D520 involved a similar but more efficient acceptor invasion mechanism compared with D199. RNA structure probing by RNase T1 and the RT pause profile during synthesis indicated conformational differences between D199 and D520 in the starting structure, and in dynamic structures formed during synthesis within the R region. Overall observations suggest that regions 3′ of the primer binding site influence the conformation of the R region of D520 to facilitate steps that promote strand transfer.

In retrovirus reverse transcription, the single-stranded genomic RNA is converted into a double-stranded DNA by reverse transcriptase (RT) 3The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; PBS, primer binding site; NC, nucleocapsid; nt, nucleotide; R, repeat; -sssDNA, minus strand strong stop DNA; BMH, branched multiple-hairpin; LDI, long-distance interaction; DIS, dimerization initiation signal.

In HIV-1, extension of a tRNALys3 primer from the primer binding site (PBS) to the 5′-end of the genomic RNA generates a 199 nt minus strand strong stop DNA (-sssDNA). A 97-nt repeat sequence (R) present at both ends of the genome, facilitates the translocation of -sssDNA to the 3′-end of genomic RNA, in a process referred to as minus strand strong stop transfer (Refs. 3Telesnitsky A.

Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar and references therein). Early studies indicated that the RT RNase H is required for the degradation of 5′-copied genomic RNA (donor RNA template), allowing the subsequent minus strand transfer to the 3′-end of the RNA genome (acceptor RNA template) (5Garces J.

The viral nucleocapsid protein (NC) is an important nucleic acid binding protein involved in viral replication (Refs. 7Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem.

In addition, NC has been shown to stimulate RT-associated RNase H cleavages, contributing to degradation of the donor RNA template (18Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J.

Previously, we designed a system in vitro consisting of a donor RNA D199 and an acceptor RNA A97h to simulate -sssDNA transfer (21Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). D199 was sufficiently long that a full-length -sssDNA could be made. A97h includes the entire 3′-R region in an attempt to simulate minus strand transfer in vivo. Analysis of minus strand transfer using this system led to the proposal of an acceptor invasion initiated transfer mechanism. By this mechanism, synthesis of the -sssDNA is accompanied by RNase H cleavages of the donor template. As pausing of RT promotes local RNase H cleavages (22DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12459-12467Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), when synthesis stalls at the base of TAR, a structured site in the R region, RT pauses and makes more adjacent cuts, generating a gap to which the acceptor template can then invade and anneal to the cDNA. The acceptor-cDNA hybrid propagates by branch migration, displacing the remaining pieces of donor template. Transfer is completed by annealing the DNA primer terminus to the acceptor and continuing synthesis (21Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

In vivo, minus strand transfer occurs efficiently, with no significant accumulation of -sssDNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells (25Varmus H.E. Heasley S. Kung H.J. Oppermann H. Smith V.C.

While in the D199 transfer system in vitro, although the acceptor, RT and NC were in excess over the donor, only about 35% of the -sssDNA transferred. What reduced the strand transfer? The HIV-1 genomic RNA is about 9.2-kb long and highly structured (28Ratner L. Haseltine W. Patarca R. Livak K.J. Starcich B. Josephs S.F. Doran E.R. Rafalski J.A. Whitehorn E.A. Baumeister K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown that structure of the R region is influenced both by NC and by the length and sequence of the flanking regions (42Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 43Ooms M. Verhoef K. Southern E. Huthoff H. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Presumably, the flanking region could fold back and induce the R region to restructure. Therefore, we wanted to test the possibility that use of longer templates in vitro would produce a better model for RNA structures that promote highly efficient minus strand transfer. In the present study, we have examined -sssDNA transfer in the context of two different length donor RNA templates, D199 (+1 through +199) and D520 (+1 through +520), derived from the viral genome. Although both templates contained the 5′-R and U5 sequences and shared the same homology with the acceptor RNA, the D520 donor yielded twice the amount of transfers (75%) as D199 (35%). We have analyzed steps of the transfer mechanism, and both the initial and dynamic structures of the two donor templates, in an effort to delineate the reasons for the efficient transfers with D520.

All the other reagents were purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Generation of RNA Templates—Genomic sequences from the HIV-1 pNL4–3 strain were amplified by PCR using the Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create double-stranded DNA templates for generation of RNA transcripts. The donor RNA template D199 and acceptor RNA templates A97h, A82h, and A70h were generated by run-off transcription in vitro as described previously (21Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J.

RNA concentration was measured by Ribogreen assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or UV absorbance (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Transfer Assay—The PBS DNA primer or RNA templates were radiolabeled at the 5′-end as described previously for either primer extension assay or donor and acceptor RNA templates degradation assays, respectively (21Chen Y.

Primer was heat-annealed to donor RNA by incubating at 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. Then acceptor RNA was added, and substrates were incubated with 200% NC (100% NC = 7 nt/NC) at 37 °C for 5 min. The ratio of donor:acceptor: primer was 1:3:1.5. RT was then preincubated with substrates at 37 °C for 5 min before the initiation of reactions by MgCl2 and dNTPs. The final reactions contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm dNTPs. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and stopped at appropriate times by adding 1 volume of termination dye (10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 90% formamide (v/v), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue). Products were then resolved by polyacrylamide-urea gels, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and ImageQuant software (version 2.1). Sizes of DNA products were estimated using 10-bp DNA ladders, and sizes of RNA products were measured using RNA ladders generated by RNase T1 digestion. Distribution of Transfer Products—To determine where the primer terminus switched between the donor and acceptor templates, transfer products were isolated and amplified as described previously (47Kim J.K.

PCR amplification by Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was performed using the forward primer 5′-CACGAGCTCAGGCCTGCTTTTTGCCTGTACTGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTAGGATCCGTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCAC-3′. Amplified products were cloned by TOPO TA cloning (Invitrogen). Individual colonies were picked and sequenced using the M13 Reverse (–20) primer from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Structure Probing by RNase T1—Structure probing by RNase T1 was performed as described previously with slight modifications (40Heilman-Miller S.L. Wu T. Levin J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44154-44165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 30 fmol of 5′-end-labeled D199 or D520 donor templates were heat-annealed to unlabeled PBS primer as described earlier. After incubating the reaction mix with 200% NC at 37 °C for 5 min, 1 μg of tRNA was added, and the volume was brought up to 10 μl. The final reaction contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Digestion reactions were initiated by adding 0.5 unit of RNase T1, incubated at room temperature, and stopped 5 min later by adding one volume of termination dye. Products were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and visualized as described above. We considered whether the region of the HIV-1 genome 3′ of the PBS could influence the efficiency of minus strand transfer. To test this concept, we compared transfer efficiency using templates having or lacking sequences in that region. D520 Promotes Better Minus Strand Transfer Than D199— Compared with donor D199, the newly designed donor RNA D520 included an additional 321 nt 3′ of the PBS (Fig. 1A). It was similar to D199 in that there was no change in homology between the donor and acceptor, and the primer still annealed to the PBS. The acceptor RNA A97h was composed of the 3′-R and 20 nt from U3. Synthesis produced the same full-length products and transfer products in both reactions. During the course of transfer reactions (Fig. 1B), full-length products were detected by 1 min with both templates. Interestingly, minus strand transfer products, which were not detected until about 4 min with D199, were detectable as early as 2 min with D520. The full-length products accumulated to about 8 min, and then decreased as they were chased into transfer products with D520. However, with D199, full-length products accumulated with time throughout the transfer reaction. There was a time-dependent increase in transfer efficiency with both D520 and D199 (Fig. 1C). However, the transfer efficiency of D520 reached 75% by 32 min, more than 2-fold greater than the 35% with D199. Clearly D520 promotes more efficient transfer than D199. The Improved Transfer with D520 Depends on NC—In contrast to the large differences between D199 and D520 transfer profiles with NC, the formation of full-length and transfer products was similar for the two templates without NC (Fig. 2A). Instead of fading out with time, full-length products accumulated with D520 in the absence of NC, similar to D199. Moreover, the transfer efficiency was only about 10% for both donor templates after a 32-min reaction (Fig. 2B). Clearly, NC promotes transfer in both systems. Also, significantly, these results demonstrate that the stimulation of minus strand transfer with D520 is dependent on NC. Altered Donor-Acceptor Homology Results Support a Similar Transfer Mechanism for D199 and D520—Previously we have shown that transfer with D199 was most efficient if the homology with acceptor included all of the R region (21Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Three acceptor templates, A97h, A82h, and A70h, which shared a homology of 97, 82, and 70 nt with D199 and D520, were assessed for transfer (Fig. 3A). The acceptors differed at their 3′-ends, so the effect of losing portions of the R homology segment would be reflected in their transfer ability. The above three acceptors were employed in transfer reactions at a 200% NC coating level (Fig. 3B). For the D199 donor, transfer decreased from 35% with A97h to 31% with A82h, and 21% with A70h. Similarly, for donor D520, transfer decreased nearly proportionally from 75% with A97h to 68% with A82h, and 48% with A70h (Fig. 3C). Reducing acceptor homology had the effect of decreasing transfers with both the short and long donor templates. Clearly, both template systems involve a transfer mechanism that is better facilitated with longer homology. Donor Cleavage in the Transfer Reaction—We have proposed that the mechanism for -sssDNA transfer with D199 involves pausing of RT at the base of TAR, which then allows the RT-RNase H to clear a site for acceptor invasion (21Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14443-14452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The synthesis profile of the D520 transfer reaction also revealed a prominent RT pause at the same site (142 and 146 nt, Fig. 1B). When D199 was 5′-end radiolabeled and analyzed at increasing times during the transfer reaction, we observed substantial RNase H cleavages (57–97 nt, Fig. 4) near that pause site. Analysis of the degradation of 5′-end radiolabeled D520 also showed similar cleavages in the region as was observed with D199 (Fig. 4). The cleavage at that site was distinctive among those observed throughout the region of R homology. This result is consistent with the interpretation that pausing at the 3′-end of the TAR region results in RNA cleavage that allows acceptor invasion by a similar mechanism in both D199 and D520. Acceptor Mapping Indicates the Site of Acceptor Invasion— We recently developed an approach using a 5′-end radiolabeled acceptor to detect acceptor-cDNA interaction during the transfer process (24Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14443-14452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Acceptor-cDNA annealing creates a hybrid structure that is sensitive to RT-RNase H cleavage. By sampling the reaction over time, we could assess both the initial site of contact and the propagation of this hybrid. The earliest observed position of cleavage on the acceptor represents the site involved in invasion (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows the acceptor cleavage profile in transfer reactions with D199 and D520. With D199, the earliest cleavages were detectable by 2 min at a distance 80–110 nt from the 5′-end of the acceptor. This was consistent with acceptor invasion in the region of homology behind TAR (21Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38368-38375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Chen Y. Balakrishnan M. Roques B.P. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14443-14452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subsequent cleavage products, 60–5 nt in size, suggest that the acceptor-cDNA hybrid then propagated from the invasion site to the 5′-end of acceptor in a time-dependent manner. With D520, the earliest cleavages were detectable by 1 min at the same positions, 80–110 nt from the 5′-end of the acceptor. These data indicate that the initial point of acceptor-cDNA interaction, the principal invasion site, is the same with both D199 and D520. Interestingly, the quantity of cleavage products formed at the invasion site in early time points was much higher with D520 than observed with D199. Furthermore, with D520, a higher relative abundance of cleavages at the 5′-end of the acceptor is consistent with a greater proportion of acceptor molecules being involved in successful completion of transfer than with D199. Overall these results support the interpretation that the invasion and hybrid propagation steps of transfer are occurring similarly with D199 and D520, however, with substantially higher efficiency with D520. Transfer Distribution Analysis Reveals More End Transfer with D520—The final step of the invasion mechanism of transfer is the switch of the cDNA primer terminus from the donor to the acceptor template. To identify where transfer completions occur, five base substitution markers were introduced into the R region of the acceptor to generate the mut-A97h acceptor (Fig. 6A). The sequence of the transfer products could then be used to indicate the position of primer terminus transfer. Transfer efficiencies of D199 and D520 with mut-A97h were the same as with the wild-type A97h (data not shown). Fig. 6B shows the percentage of transferred primers that switched from donor to acceptor in each marker-defined region. The values in Fig. 6B were generated by dividing the number of products showing transfer between two adjacent markers by the total number of transfer products sequenced. With D199, about 40% of primer termini transferred after completing synthesis to the end of the donor template, while it was about 56% with D520. The significant percentage of transfers occurring only after the 5′-end of D520 had been copied is in agreement with the time-dependent conversion of full-length products into transfer products in the transfer reaction profile of D520 (Fig. 1B). About 30% of the transfers with D199 were completed in the region just before and at the base of TAR (before marker 2), whereas with D520, that value was only about 13%. Because segments between two adjacent markers are of different lengths, the distance corrected transfer distribution shows which segment is most recombinogenic (Fig. 6C). The values in Fig. 6C were generated by dividing the raw transfer distribution (Fig. 6B) by the number of nucleotides in each segment and multiplying by 10. The profile suggests that with both D199 and D520, the segment at the base of TAR, between markers 1 and 2, is the segment in which most internal recombination occurs. Interestingly, for D199, that region was twice as recombinogenic as for D520 (Fig. 6C). As D520 promotes transfers more effectively than D199, to enable a direct comparison of the transfer events in the D199 and D520 systems, we corrected the raw transfer distribution (Fig. 6B) for transfer efficiency. Fig. 6D shows the distribution of the 75 and 35% transfers of D520 and D199, respectively, after multiplying the raw transfer distribution in each segment (Fig. 6B) by the transfer efficiency for each system. Results indicate that 42% of the minus strand DNA synthesized in the transfer reaction underwent end transfer with D520. This was three times the 14% observed with D199. Taken together, these results indicate that a substantial amount of the additional transfers that occur with D520 are completed at the end of the donor template.
