We investigated interregional coordination of gamma oscillations using high-density electrophysiological recordings in the rat hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. We found that 30–80 Hz gamma dominated CA1 local field potentials (LFPs) on the descending phase of CA1 theta waves during navigation, with 60–120 Hz gamma at the theta peak. These signals corresponded to CA3 and entorhinal input, respectively. Above 50 Hz, interregional phase-synchronization of principal cell spikes occurred mostly for LFPs in the axonal target domain. CA1 pyramidal cells were phase-locked mainly to fast gamma (>100 Hz) LFP patterns restricted to CA1, which were strongest at the theta trough. While theta phase coordination of spiking across entorhinal-hippocampal regions depended on memory demands, LFP gamma patterns below 100 Hz in the hippocampus were consistently layer specific and largely reflected afferent activity. Gamma synchronization as a mechanism for interregional communication thus rapidly loses efficacy at higher frequencies. Precisely how rhythms support neuronal communication remains obscure.

Gamma synchronization as a mechanism for interregional communication thus rapidly loses efficacy at higher frequencies. The hippocampal-entorhinal system is characterized by a number of distinct oscillations, including the prominent theta and gamma rhythms (Buzsáki et al., 1983Buzsáki G. Leung L.W. Vanderwolf C.H.

An important goal of such investigations is to understand how the rate and timing of spikes in neurons of a downstream network are governed by upstream regions and local interactions and how such interactions support spatial navigation and memory (O’Keefe and Recce, 1993O’Keefe J.

The local field potential (LFP) can be helpful in this process, provided that its components can be related to individual synaptic sources and the output spiking of specific neuronal populations (Buzsáki et al., 2012Buzsáki G.

Area CA1 in the hippocampus is under the control of two major upstream regions: area CA3 and the direct entorhinal input from layer 3 (EC3; Witter et al., 1989Witter M.P. Groenewegen H.J.

The three-dimensional organization of the hippocampal formation: a review of anatomical data.Neuroscience. 1989; 31: 571-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). The layer-segregated axon terminals of these inputs mediate both dendritic excitation and feedforward inhibition (Buzsáki, 1984Buzsáki G. Feed-forward inhibition in the hippocampal formation.Prog. Neurobiol. 1984; 22: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To determine the theta-gamma timing relationships between the entorhinal and CA3 inputs to the CA1 region, and their impact on the CA1 output, we used high-density extracellular recordings, combined with source separation techniques and unbiased spike-LFP coherence methods, while rats performed different maze tasks and slept in their home cages. We report that CA1 gamma-band LFP patterns and the spike timing of pyramidal cells and interneurons within the theta cycle depended on the relative strengths of the CA3 and EC3 inputs and associated gamma patterns in their target dendritic layers. EC3 input was strongest at the peak of the theta cycle, referenced to the LFP in CA1 stratum pyramidale, and was reflected by a mid-frequency (60–120 Hz) gamma oscillation in the LFP, followed one quarter cycle later by the CA3 input on the descending phase in the form of a transient 30–80 Hz gamma pattern. The relative strength of these signals was strongly influenced by brain state and behavior. Rhythmic input at medium to fast gamma frequencies, however, poorly entrained pyramidal cell spiking. Instead, the output of the CA1 pyramidal cell population was dominated by fast (>100 Hz) oscillations that arose within the CA1 network. Experiments were carried out while animals ran on a linear track (250 cm long), a T maze, or open field (Mizuseki et al., 2009Mizuseki K. Sirota A. Pastalkova E. Buzsáki G.

Recordings from the hippocampus were made by six- or eight-shank silicon probes covering most layers of CA1 to CA3 and dentate gyrus regions along the transverse axis of the hippocampus (Figures 1D and S1; six rats), allowing us to monitor LFPs from up to 256 sites (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In separate animals, single unit and LFP recordings were made simultaneously in the CA1 or CA3 pyramidal layer and in multiple layers of the dorsocaudal medial EC (three rats) or CA3 and CA1 pyramidal layers (three rats) using high-density four- or eight-shank silicon probes. Histological localization of the electrodes, criteria for clustering of single units, and separation of principal neurons and interneurons in a subset of these animals have been described in detail previously (Montgomery and Buzsáki, 2007Montgomery S.M.

All single units were recorded near the cell body layers, and we therefore included only a subset of the diverse interneuron population (Freund and Buzsáki, 1996Freund T.F. Buzsáki G.

Theta epochs during behavioral tasks were classified as RUN, while those during sleep were classified as rapid eye movement (REM). The LFP at any point in the brain typically reflects the simultaneous activation of multiple current sinks and sources. Decomposition of the individual current generators was performed by one-dimensional current-source density (CSD) analysis of the LFPs recorded on single shanks (Figure 1A; Nicholson and Freeman, 1975Nicholson C. Freeman J.A. Theory of current source-density analysis and determination of conductivity tensor for anuran cerebellum.J. Neurophysiol. 1975; 38: 356-368PubMed Google Scholar). CSD analysis revealed alternating and phase-shifted inward (sink) and outward (source) theta currents in the str. radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare (Buzsáki et al., 1986Buzsáki G. Czopf J. Kondákor I. Kellényi L.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1381-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the major termination zones of the CA3 and EC3 inputs, respectively. The correct identity of layers and current generators was further supported by independent component analysis (ICA) of the multielectrode LFP. ICA discriminates the contributing sources on the basis of their distinct spatial distributions and temporal activations and is less sensitive to spurious sources caused by variability of electrode impedance than CSD methods (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Fernández-Ruiz and Herreras, 2013Fernández-Ruiz A. Herreras O. Identifying the synaptic origin of ongoing neuronal oscillations through spatial discrimination of electric fields.Front Comput Neurosci. 2013; 7: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Applying ICA to each linear shank separated CA1 LFPs into three major pathway-specific independent components (ICs) (Figures 1B–1D and S1). The CSD depth profile of one IC (rad) matched the source-sink-source distribution-generated spontaneously occurring sharp waves (SPWs) during immobility, corresponding to strong excitation of CA1 neurons by synchronous CA3 output (Figures 1A and 1B; Bragin et al., 1995Bragin A. Jandó G. Nádasdy Z. Hetke J. Wise K. Buzsáki G. Gamma (40-100 Hz) oscillation in the hippocampus of the behaving rat.J.

Schaffer-specific local field potentials reflect discrete excitatory events at gamma frequency that may fire postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 units.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5165-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another IC (lm) corresponded to a current sink in str. lacunosum-moleculare (Figures 1B and 1D; Brankack et al., 1993Brankack J. Stewart M. Fox S.E. Current source density analysis of the hippocampal theta rhythm: associated sustained potentials and candidate synaptic generators.Brain Res. 1993; 615: 310-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, Benito et al., 2014Benito N.

Spatial modules of coherent activity in pathway-specific LFPs in the hippocampus reflect topology and different modes of presynaptic synchronization.Cereb. Cortex. 2014; 24: 1738-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the site of EC3 axon terminals. In contrast to the other two ICs, which were dominated by current sinks in the dendritic layers, the third component (CA1pyr) had a current source at the CA1 str. pyramidale (Figures 1B and 1D), which is identifiable by large amplitude ripples and unit firing (Mizuseki et al., 2011Mizuseki K. Diba K. Pastalkova E. Buzsáki G. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells form functionally distinct sublayers.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Concatenating and smoothing the one-dimensional IC voltage loadings across shanks resulted in 2D maps showing the layer specificity of each component (Figure 1D; similar layer specificity was found in all six rats). The spectral characteristics of the example traces shown for each component (Figures 1A and S1C) were conserved across entire sessions (Figure S1D). Neural activity is often coordinated on multiple timescales, with interactions between oscillatory processes manifested in cross-frequency coupling (Bragin et al., 1995Bragin A. Jandó G. Nádasdy Z.

(2014) Untangling cross-frequency coupling in neuroscience. arXiv, arXiv:1405.7965, http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7965.Google Scholar). Measuring the modulation of LFP power at higher frequencies (30–300 Hz) by the phase of lower frequency (2–20 Hz) components revealed gamma amplitude-theta frequency (GA-TF) coupling (Tort et al., 2010Tort A.B.L. Komorowski R. Eichenbaum H. Kopell N. Measuring phase-amplitude coupling between neuronal oscillations of different frequencies.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 1195-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) in the CA1 pyramidal layer. We identified three relatively distinct, but overlapping, gamma sub-bands during RUN (Figure 2A; Belluscio et al., 2012Belluscio M.A. Mizuseki K. Schmidt R. Kempter R. Buzsáki G. Cross-frequency phase-phase coupling between θ and γ oscillations in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), corresponding to slow gamma (gammaS, 30–80 Hz), midfrequency gamma (gammaM, 60–120 Hz), and fast gamma (gammaF, or epsilon band, > 100 Hz). Because LFP gamma currents in the pyramidal layer reflect a combination (in unknown proportions) of active inhibitory currents, passive return currents from the dendritic layers, and spikes (Csicsvari et al., 2003Csicsvari J.

The spiking component of oscillatory extracellular potentials in the rat hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 11798-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we also examined the layer-specific distribution of theta-gamma coupling using ICA. GA-TF analysis of the LFP ICs (Figure 2) revealed significantly theta-modulated gamma bands in all animals (p < 0.001 for each IC/LFP, surrogate test; 12 rats). In the CA1pyr IC, theta oscillations most strongly modulated gammaF frequencies (Figures 2A and 2C; mean ± SEM, 149.4 ± 4.3 Hz). In the rad IC, the dominant theta-modulated gamma frequencies were between 30 and 80 Hz (Figures 2A and 2C; 47.3 ± 0.6 Hz), in agreement with a similar gamma band modulation (p > 0.05, t test between frequencies) in the CA3 pyramidal layer IC (CA3pyr; Figures 2A and 2C; 47.6 ± 1.2 Hz). Compared to the rad IC, theta-coupled gamma oscillations in the lm IC were significantly faster (p < 0.0001, t test; Figures 2A and 2C; 85.7 ± 1.8 Hz). In the EC3 LFP, the corresponding afferent layer, theta-coupled gamma oscillations were significantly faster than both the CA3pyr and CA1 rad ICs (p < 0.0001, t test; Figures 2A and 2C; 90.0 ± 4.9 Hz), but not significantly different in peak frequency from the CA1 lm IC (p > 0.05, t test). During REM, the frequency distribution of the theta-modulated gamma sub-bands was largely similar to waking (Figures 2B and 2C; p > 0.05, t test). However, the strength of GA-TF coupling (or modulation index, MI) and power of gammaS in the rad IC were significantly reduced during REM compared to RUN (p < 0.0001, t test; Figures 2B, 2D, and 2E), whereas theta-gammaM coupling and power in the lm IC were significantly increased (p < 0.0001, t test; Figures 2B, 2D, and 2E). These changes were accompanied by a parallel reduction of theta-gammaS coupling in CA3pyr (p < 0.01, t test; Figures 2B and 2D) and increased theta-gammaM coupling in EC3 LFP during REM (p < 0.01, t test; Figures 2B and 2D). Consistent with the LFP changes, CA3 and EC3 pyramidal neuron firing rates decreased and increased, respectively, during REM compared to RUN (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference test; Figure 2F). We next examined gamma power variation as a function of theta phase of the LFP recorded from CA1 str. pyramidale (0° and 180° refer to positive polarity peak and negative polarity trough, respectively). This gamma amplitude-theta phase (GA-TP) analysis reinforced the layer preferences of the different gamma sub-bands (Figures 3, S1, and S2). The theta phase ordering of gamma patterns (Figures 3A–3C and S2) and the predominant phases of input and output spiking (Mizuseki et al., 2009Mizuseki K. Sirota A. Pastalkova E. Buzsáki G. Theta oscillations provide temporal windows for local circuit computation in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop.Neuron. 2009; 64: 267-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) during RUN are summarized in Figure 3E (see also the Discussion). GammaF power (>100 Hz) in the CA1pyr IC was maximal near the trough of the theta cycle (174.8° ± 3.3°; Figures 3A and 3C), coincident with the highest probability of spikes of the CA1 pyramidal neurons at this phase (Buzsáki et al., 1983Buzsáki G.

GammaS (30–80 Hz) was most prominent in the rad IC, occurring predominantly on the descending phase of theta (mean across animals, 128.3° ± 2.0°; Figures 3A and 3C), which coincides with the gamma oscillations in the CA3pyr IC (138.9° ± 4.5°; Figures 3A and 3C) and most CA3 spiking (Csicsvari et al., 2003Csicsvari J.

The gammaM (60–120 Hz) that dominated the lm IC was phase-locked to the peak of the reference theta waves (348.8° ± 5.3°; Figures 3A and 3C), coincident with maximal EC3 gamma LFPs (355.8° ± 14.8°; Figures 3A and 3C) and pyramidal cell firing (Mizuseki et al., 2009Mizuseki K.

Theta oscillations provide temporal windows for local circuit computation in the entorhinal-hippocampal loop.Neuron. 2009; 64: 267-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). During REM sleep, the theta phase and layer distributions of slow and mid-gamma activity were qualitatively similar to RUN (nonsignificant differences in theta phases of maximal gamma power, p > 0.05, t test; Figures 3B and 3C), but theta-modulated gamma power decreased in the rad and CA3pyr ICs (p < 0.001, t test) while it increased in the lm IC and EC3 LFP (p < 0.0001, t test) during REM (Figures 3B and 3D). GammaF (epsilon) power became bimodal in the CA1 pyramidal layer IC and LFP, with power increases at both the trough and peak of CA1 theta cycle (see below, Figure 4), similar to the phase-shifted firing of many CA1 neurons during REM (Mizuseki et al., 2011Mizuseki K. Diba K. Pastalkova E. Buzsáki G. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells form functionally distinct sublayers.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition to theta phase and layer differences, the gamma frequency bands were also distinct in their promixo-distal distribution (Figure 4). Rad ICs closer to the CA3 region (proximal CA1) showed stronger theta-gammaS coupling than at sites near the subicular border of the CA1 region (distal CA1), whereas the opposite relationship was observed for the gammaM band in the lm ICs (p < 0.001; ANOVA tests; six rats; Figure 4A). Their frequencies remained constant along the entire transverse hippocampal axis (Figure S3). During RUN, the CA1pyr IC theta-gammaF coupling was stronger at sites closer to CA3, while it was stronger near the subicular end during REM (p < 0.001, ANOVA tests; Figures 4A and 4B). The changes in CA1pyr theta-gammaF coupling along the proximo-distal axis and between RUN and REM mostly reflected changes in its theta phase distribution. A bimodal phase distribution, exhibiting increased power at both the trough and peak, emerged on the distal end during RUN and at all sites during REM (Figure 4C). The altered phase distributions were limited to the CA1pyr ICs; quantifying the phase distribution with the “center of mass” of gamma power showed significant variation for CA1pyr from the proximal to distal ends during both RUN and REM (p < 0.001, ANOVA tests; Figure S3), but not for the other components (p > 0.05, ANOVA tests). The next level of analysis examined within-layer, cross-layer, and cross-regional interactions among the various gamma oscillations. As a first step, coherence maps in the gamma frequency band were constructed using gammaS,M coherence between LFPs at reference sites in different layers and the remaining 255 channels. This procedure reliably outlined the anatomical layer boundaries in CA1 (Figure 5A). Gamma-band coherence of the ICA c"

The p53 protein is a key transcriptional factor regulating cellular homeostasis. A majority of HGSOCs have inactive p53 because of genetic mutations. However, genetic mutation is not the only cause of p53 inactivation. The aggregation of p53 protein has been discovered in different types of cancers and may be responsible for impairing the normal transcriptional activation and pro-apoptotic functions of p53. We demonstrated that in a unique population of HGSOC cancer cells with cancer stem cell properties, p53 protein aggregation is associated with p53 inactivation and platinum resistance. When these cancer stem cells differentiated into their chemosensitive progeny, they lost tumor-initiating capacity and p53 aggregates. In addition to the association of p53 aggregation and chemoresistance in HGSOC cells, we further demonstrated that the overexpression of a p53-positive regulator, p14ARF, inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 degradation and led to the imbalance of p53 turnover that promoted the formation of p53 aggregates. With in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated that the inhibition of p14ARF could suppress p53 aggregation and sensitize cancer cells to platinum treatment. Moreover, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry we discovered that the aggregated p53 may function uniquely by interacting with proteins that are critical for cancer cell survival and tumor progression. Our findings help us understand the poor chemoresponse of a subset of HGSOC patients and suggest p53 aggregation as a new marker for chemoresistance. Our findings also suggest that inhibiting p53 aggregation can reactivate p53 pro-apoptotic function. Therefore, p53 aggregation is a potential therapeutic target for reversing chemoresistance. This is paramount for improving ovarian cancer patients' responses to chemotherapy, and thus increasing their survival rate."
https://openalex.org/W2040627454,"Sensitive diagnostic tests for infectious diseases often employ nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAATs). However, most NAAT assays, including many isothermal amplification methods, require power-dependent instrumentation for incubation. For use in low resource settings (LRS), diagnostics that do not require consistent electricity supply would be ideal. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal amplification technology that has been shown to typically work at temperatures ranging from 25–43°C, and does not require a stringent incubation temperature for optimal performance. Here we evaluate the ability to incubate an HIV-1 RPA assay, intended for use as an infant HIV diagnostic in LRS, at ambient temperatures or with a simple non-instrumented heat source. To determine the range of expected ambient temperatures in settings where an HIV-1 infant diagnostic would be of most use, a dataset of the seasonal range of daily temperatures in sub Saharan Africa was analyzed and revealed ambient temperatures as low as 10°C and rarely above 43°C. All 24 of 24 (100%) HIV-1 RPA reactions amplified when incubated for 20 minutes between 31°C and 43°C. The amplification from the HIV-1 RPA assay under investigation at temperatures was less consistent below 30°C. Thus, we developed a chemical heater to incubate HIV-1 RPA assays when ambient temperatures are between 10°C and 30°C. All 12/12 (100%) reactions amplified with chemical heat incubation from ambient temperatures of 15°C, 20°C, 25°C and 30°C. We also observed that incubation at 30 minutes improved assay performance at lower temperatures where detection was sporadic using 20 minutes incubation. We have demonstrated that incubation of the RPA HIV-1 assay via ambient temperatures or using chemical heaters yields similar results to using electrically powered devices. We propose that this RPA HIV-1 assay may not need dedicated equipment to be a highly sensitive tool to diagnose infant HIV-1 in LRS."
https://openalex.org/W2024852746,"In response to cell stress, cancer cells often activate the endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress sensor, the unfolded protein response (UPR). Little was known about the potential role in cancer of a different mode of UPR activation, anticipatory activation of the UPR prior to accumulation of unfolded protein or cell stress. We show that estrogen, acting via estrogen receptor α (ERα), induces rapid anticipatory activation of the UPR, resulting in increased production of the antiapoptotic chaperone BiP/GRP78, preparing cancer cells for the increased protein production required for subsequent estrogen-ERα-induced cell proliferation. In ERα-containing cancer cells, the estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2) activates the UPR through a phospholipase C γ (PLCγ)-mediated opening of EnR IP3R calcium channels, enabling passage of calcium from the lumen of the EnR into the cytosol. siRNA knockdown of ERα blocked the estrogen-mediated increase in cytosol calcium and UPR activation. Knockdown or inhibition of PLCγ, or of IP3R, strongly inhibited the estrogen-mediated increases in cytosol calcium, UPR activation and cell proliferation. E2-ERα activates all three arms of the UPR in breast and ovarian cancer cells in culture and in a mouse xenograft. Knockdown of ATF6α, which regulates UPR chaperones, blocked estrogen induction of BiP and strongly inhibited E2-ERα-stimulated cell proliferation. Mild and transient UPR activation by estrogen promotes an adaptive UPR response that protects cells against subsequent UPR-mediated apoptosis. Analysis of data from ERα(+) breast cancers demonstrates elevated expression of a UPR gene signature that is a powerful new prognostic marker tightly correlated with subsequent resistance to tamoxifen therapy, reduced time to recurrence and poor survival. Thus, as an early component of the E2-ERα proliferation program, the mitogen estrogen, drives rapid anticipatory activation of the UPR. Anticipatory activation of the UPR is a new role for estrogens in cancer cell proliferation and resistance to therapy."

We investigated the activity of liposomal amikacin for inhalation (LAI) against NTM in vitro as well as in a murine model of respiratory infection. Macrophage monolayers were infected with three strains of Mycobacterium avium, two strains of Mycobacterium abscessus, and exposed to LAI or free amikacin for 4 days before enumerating bacterial survival. Respiratory infection was established in mice by intranasal inoculation with M. avium and allowing three weeks for the infection to progress. Three different regimens of inhaled LAI were compared to inhaled saline and parenterally administered free amikacin over a 28 day period. Bacteria recovered from the mice were analyzed for acquired resistance to amikacin. In vitro, liposomal amikacin for inhalation was more effective than free amikacin in eliminating both intracellular M. avium and M. abscessus. In vivo, inhaled LAI demonstrated similar effectiveness to a ∼25% higher total dose of parenterally administered amikacin at reducing M. avium in the lungs when compared to inhaled saline. Additionally, there was no acquired resistance to amikacin observed after the treatment regimen. The data suggest that LAI has the potential to be an effective therapy against NTM respiratory infections in humans."

Methods In this cross sectional study, body composition and muscle strength of the quadriceps were assessed in 34 MS (EDSS: 2.5±0.19) patients and 18 matched healthy controls (HC). Hereafter a muscle biopsy (m.vastus lateralis) was taken. Results Compared to HC, mean muscle fiber CSA of all fibers, as well as CSA of type I, II and IIa fibers were smaller and muscle strength of the quadriceps was lower in MS patients. Whole body composition was comparable between groups. However, compared to HC, the biopsied leg tended to have a higher fat percentage (p = 0.1) and a lower lean mass (p = 0.06) in MS patients. Conclusion MS seems to negatively influence skeletal muscle fiber CSA, muscle strength and muscle mass of the lower limbs of mildly affected MS patients. This emphasises the need for rehabilitation programs focusing on muscle preservation of the lower limb. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01845896"

https://openalex.org/W2085569253,"Functional genetic analyses in mice rely on efficient and in-depth characterization of the behavioral spectrum. Automated home-cage observation can provide a systematic and efficient screening method to detect unexplored, novel behavioral phenotypes. Here, we analyzed high-throughput automated home-cage data using existing and novel concepts, to detect a plethora of genetic differences in spontaneous behavior in a panel of commonly used inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, DBA/2J, NOD/LtJ, FVB/NJ, WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ). Continuous video-tracking observations of sheltering behavior and locomotor activity were segmented into distinguishable behavioral elements, and studied at different time scales, yielding a set of 115 behavioral parameters of which 105 showed highly significant strain differences. This set of 115 parameters was highly dimensional; principal component analysis identified 26 orthogonal components with eigenvalues above one. Especially novel parameters of sheltering behavior and parameters describing aspects of motion of the mouse in the home-cage showed high genetic effect sizes. Multi-day habituation curves and patterns of behavior surrounding dark/light phase transitions showed striking strain differences, albeit with lower genetic effect sizes. This spontaneous home-cage behavior study demonstrates high dimensionality, with a strong genetic contribution to specific sets of behavioral measures. Importantly, spontaneous home-cage behavior analysis detects genetic effects that cannot be studied in conventional behavioral tests, showing that the inclusion of a few days of undisturbed, labor extensive home-cage assessment may greatly aid gene function analyses and drug target discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2038740090,"N-formyl peptide receptors (FPR1, FPR2 and FPR3) are involved in innate immunity, inflammation and cancer. FPR expression, initially described in immune cells, was later observed in non-hematopoietic cell populations and tissues. Several studies suggested a role for FPRs in the progression of various tumor histotypes, including gastric cancer (GC), for which a positive association with a specific FPR1 polymorphism has recently been described. We previously showed that FPRs are expressed on gastric epithelium and are required for wound repair and restitution of barrier integrity. Here we assess the role of FPRs in GC. We characterized the functions of FPRs in GC epithelial cells (MKN28, AGS and MKN45) cultured in vitro by assessing migration, proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Activation of each FPR induced the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and migration of GC cells in culture. Blocking compounds or RNA interference of each FPR reverted these effects. We also defined the in vivo tumorigenic potential of GC epithelial cells silenced for FPRs by xenograft experiments in immunocompromised mice. Interestingly, FPR1 silencing in GC cells (shFPR1) significantly enhanced xenograft growth with respect to shCTR, shFPR2 and shFPR3 xenografts, because of augmented vessel density and cell proliferation. Accordingly, HIF-1α and VEGF mRNA levels were higher in shFPR1 xenografts than in controls. Moreover, the in vitro production of proangiogenic factors in response to FPR2/3 agonists (WKYMVm, LL-37, uPA, uPAR84-95, AnxA1) or to other proinflammatory mediators (IL-1α) was higher in shFPR1 GC cells than in shCTR, shFPR2 and shFPR3 cells, suggesting that FPR1 functions as an inhibitor of CG angiogenesis. Thus, we propose that FPR1 stimulation may represent a novel therapeutic approach to counteract tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2152272484,"At eye opening, neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are selective for stimulus features, but circuits continue to refine in an experience-dependent manner for some weeks thereafter. How these changes contribute to the coding of visual features embedded in complex natural scenes remains unknown. Here we show that normal visual experience after eye opening is required for V1 neurons to develop a sensitivity for the statistical structure of natural stimuli extending beyond the boundaries of their receptive fields (RFs), which leads to improvements in coding efficiency for full-field natural scenes (increased selectivity and information rate). These improvements are mediated by an experience-dependent increase in the effectiveness of natural surround stimuli to hyperpolarize the membrane potential specifically during RF-stimulus epochs triggering action potentials. We suggest that neural circuits underlying surround modulation are shaped by the statistical structure of visual input, which leads to more selective coding of features in natural scenes."
https://openalex.org/W2030833878,"Campylobacter is a normal inhabitant of the chicken gut. Pathogenic infection with this organism in humans is accompanied by severe inflammation of the intestinal mucosal surface. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 (LG2055) to inhibit the adhesion and invasion of Campylobacter jejuni in vitro and to suppress C. jejuni colonization of chicks in vivo. Pretreatment with LG2055 significantly reduced adhesion to and invasion of a human epithelial cell line, Intestine 407, by C. jejuni 81–176. Methanol (MeOH)-fixed LG2055 also reduced infection by C. jejuni 81–176. However, proteinase K (ProK)-treated LG2055 eliminated the inhibitory effects. Moreover, LG2055 co-aggregated with C. jejuni 81–176. ProK treatment prevented this co-aggregation, indicating that the co-aggregation phenotype mediated by the proteinaceous cell-surface components of LG2055 is important for reducing C. jejuni 81–176 adhesion and invasion. In an in vivo assay, oral doses of LG2055 were administered to chicks daily for 14 days after oral inoculation with C. jejuni 81–176. At 14 days post-inoculation, chicks treated with LG2055 had significantly reduced cecum colonization by C. jejuni. Reduction in the number of C. jejuni 81–176 cells adhering to and internalized by human epithelial cells demonstrated that LG2055 is an organism that effectively and competitively excludes C. jejuni 81–176. In addition, the results of the chick colonization assay suggest that treatment with LG2055 could be useful in suppressing C. jejuni colonization of the chicks at early growth stages."
https://openalex.org/W2053976130,"CD200 acts through its receptor (CD200R) to inhibit excessive inflammation. The role of CD200-CD200R1 interaction in tumor immunity is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the role of CD200-CD200R1 interaction in the progression and metastasis of highly aggressive 4THM murine-breast carcinoma using CD200 transgenic (CD200(tg)) and CD200R1 knock-out (CD200R1(-)(/-)) BALB/c mice. 4THM cells induce extensive visceral metastasis and neutrophil infiltration in affected tissues. CD200 overexpression in the host was associated with decreased primary tumor growth and metastasis, whereas lack of CD200R1 expression by host cells was associated with enhanced visceral metastasis. Absence of CD200R1 expression led to decreased tumor-infiltrating-cytotoxic T cells and increased the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6. In contrast, CD200 overexpression led to increased tumor-induced interferon-γ and IL-10 response and decreased TNF-α and IL-6 release. Neutrophil infiltration of tissues was markedly decreased in CD200(tg) animals and increased in CD200R1(-/-) mice. These findings are contradictory to what has been reported in the EMT6 mouse breast-cancer model. Other distinguishing features of tumor elicited by EMT6 and 4THM cell injections were also examined. Visceral tissues from mice bearing EMT6 tumors showed a lack of neutrophil infiltration and decreased IL-6 release in CD200R1(-/-) mice. EMT6 and 4THM cells also differed in vimentin expression and in vitro migration rate, which was markedly lower in EMT6 tumors. These results support the hypothesis that CD200 expression can alter immune responses, and can inhibit metastatic growth of tumor cells that induce systemic and local inflammatory response. Increasing CD200 activity/signaling might be an important therapeutic strategy for treatment of aggressive breast carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2027679615,"The salivary mucins that include MUC5B (gel-forming) and MUC7 (non-gel-forming) are major contributors to the protective mucus barrier in the oral cavity, and it is possible that dietary components may influence barrier properties. We show how one dietary compound, the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), can substantially alter the properties of both the polymeric MUC5B network and monomeric MUC7. Using rate-zonal centrifugation, MUC5B in human whole saliva and MUC5B purified from saliva sedimented faster in the presence of EGCG. The faster sedimentation by EGCG was shown to be greater with increasing MUC5B concentration. Particle tracking microrheology was employed to determine the viscosity of purified MUC5B solutions and showed that for MUC5B solutions of 200–1600 µg/mL, EGCG caused a significant increase in mucin viscosity, which was greater at higher MUC5B concentrations. Visualisation of the changes to the MUC5B network by EGCG was performed using atomic force microscopy, which demonstrated increased aggregation of MUC5B in a heterogeneous manner by EGCG. Using trypsin-resistant, high-molecular weight oligosaccharide-rich regions of MUC5B and recombinant N-terminal and C-terminal MUC5B proteins, we showed that EGCG causes aggregation at the protein domains of MUC5B, but not at the oligosaccharide-rich regions of the mucin. We also demonstrated that EGCG caused the majority of MUC7 in human whole saliva to aggregate. Furthermore, purified MUC7 also underwent a large increase in sedimentation rate in the presence of EGCG. In contrast, the green tea polyphenol epicatechin caused no change in the sedimentation rate of either MUC5B or MUC7 in human whole saliva. These findings have demonstrated how the properties of the mucin barrier can be influenced by dietary components. In the case of EGCG, these interactions may alter the function of MUC5B as a lubricant, contributing to the astringency (dry puckering sensation) of green tea."
https://openalex.org/W1979903031,"The inability to control timely bladder emptying is one of the most serious challenges among the several functional deficits that occur after a complete spinal cord injury. Having demonstrated that electrodes placed epidurally on the dorsum of the spinal cord can be used in animals and humans to recover postural and locomotor function after complete paralysis, we hypothesized that a similar approach could be used to recover bladder function after paralysis. Also knowing that posture and locomotion can be initiated immediately with a specific frequency-dependent stimulation pattern and that with repeated stimulation-training sessions these functions can improve even further, we reasoned that the same two strategies could be used to regain bladder function. Recent evidence suggests that rats with severe paralysis can be rehabilitated with a multisystem neuroprosthetic training regime that counteracts the development of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. No data regarding the acute effects of locomotion on bladder function, however, were reported. In this study we show that enabling of locomotor-related spinal neuronal circuits by epidural stimulation also influences neural networks controlling bladder function and can play a vital role in recovering bladder function after complete paralysis. We have identified specific spinal cord stimulation parameters that initiate bladder emptying within seconds of the initiation of epidural stimulation. The clinical implications of these results are substantial in that this strategy could have a major impact in improving the quality of life and longevity of patients while simultaneously dramatically reducing ongoing health maintenance after a spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W1965383997,"The biological outcome of TMPRSS2:ERG chromosomal translocations in prostate cancer (PC) remains poorly understood. To address this, we compared the transcriptional effects of TMPRSS2:ERG expression in a transgenic mouse model with those of ERG knockdown in a TMPRSS2:ERG-positive PC cell line. This reveals that ERG represses the expression of a previously unreported set of androgen receptor (AR)—independent neuronal genes that are indicative of neuroendocrine (NE) cell differentiation—in addition to previously reported AR-regulated luminal genes. Cell sorting and proliferation assays performed after sustained ERG knockdown indicate that ERG drives proliferation and blocks the differentiation of prostate cells to both NE and luminal cell types. Inhibition of ERG expression in TMPRSS2:ERG-positive PC cells through blockade of AR signaling is tracked with increased NE gene expression. We also provide evidence that these NE cells are resistant to pharmacological AR inhibition and can revert to the phenotype of parental cells upon restoration of AR/ERG signaling. Our findings highlight an ERG-regulated mechanism capable of repopulating the parent tumor through the transient generation of an anti-androgen therapy-resistant cell population, suggesting that ERG may have a direct role in preventing resistance to anti-androgen therapy."

Na+ flux through presynaptic plasma membrane hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels enhanced presynaptic Na+ concentration and thus controlled postsynaptic quantal size.

https://openalex.org/W2000859778,"Liver kinase B1 (LKB1, also known as serine/threonine kinase 11, STK11) is a tumor suppressor mutated in Peutz–Jeghers syndrome and in a variety of sporadic cancers. Herein, we demonstrate that LKB1 controls the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protects the genome from oxidative damage. Cells lacking LKB1 exhibit markedly increased intracellular ROS levels, excessive oxidation of DNA, increased mutation rates and accumulation of DNA damage, which are effectively prevented by ectopic expression of LKB1 and by incubation with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. The role of LKB1 in suppressing ROS is independent of AMP-activated protein kinase, a canonical substrate of LKB1. Instead, under the elevated ROS, LKB1 binds to and maintains the activity of the cdc42–PAK1 (p21-activated kinase 1) complex, which triggers the activation of p38 and its downstream signaling targets, such as ATF-2, thereby enhancing the activity of superoxide dismutase-2 and catalase, two antioxidant enzymes that protect the cells from ROS accumulation, DNA damage and loss of viability. Our results provide a new paradigm for a non-canonical tumor suppressor function of LKB1 and highlight the importance of targeting ROS signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer cells lacking LKB1."
https://openalex.org/W2072622904,"Breast cancer is genetically heterogeneous, and recent studies have underlined a prominent contribution of epigenetics to the development of this disease. To uncover new synthetic lethalities with known breast cancer oncogenes, we screened an epigenome-focused short hairpin RNA library on a panel of engineered breast epithelial cell lines. Here we report a selective interaction between the NOTCH1 signaling pathway and the SUMOylation cascade. Knockdown of the E2-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (UBE2I) as well as inhibition of the E1-activating complex SAE1/UBA2 using ginkgolic acid impairs the growth of NOTCH1-activated breast epithelial cells. We show that upon inhibition of SUMOylation NOTCH1-activated cells proceed slower through the cell cycle and ultimately enter apoptosis. Mechanistically, activation of NOTCH1 signaling depletes the pool of unconjugated small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) and SUMO2/3 leading to increased sensitivity to perturbation of the SUMOylation cascade. Depletion of unconjugated SUMO correlates with sensitivity to inhibition of SUMOylation also in patient-derived breast cancer cell lines with constitutive NOTCH pathway activation. Our investigation suggests that SUMOylation cascade inhibitors should be further explored as targeted treatment for NOTCH-driven breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1991397054,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates multiple signaling cascades essential for cell proliferation, growth and differentiation. Using a genetic approach, we found that Drosophila FERM and PDZ domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, dPtpmeg, negatively regulates border cell migration and inhibits the EGFR/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway during wing morphogenesis. We further identified EGFR pathway substrate 15 (Eps15) as a target of dPtpmeg and its human homolog PTPN3. Eps15 is a scaffolding adaptor protein known to be involved in EGFR endocytosis and trafficking. Interestingly, PTPN3-mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation of Eps15 promotes EGFR for lipid raft-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. PTPN3 and the Eps15 tyrosine phosphorylation-deficient mutant suppress non-small-cell lung cancer cell growth and migration in vitro and reduce lung tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Moreover, depletion of PTPN3 impairs the degradation of EGFR and enhances proliferation and tumorigenicity of lung cancer cells. Taken together, these results indicate that PTPN3 may act as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer through its modulation of EGFR signaling."

Urgent steps are still needed for the mitigation or control of Pd to save bats. We hypothesized that a focus on fungal community would advance the understanding of ecology and ecosystem processes that are crucial in the disease transmission cycle. This study was conducted in 2010–2011 in New York and Vermont using 90 samples from four mines and two caves situated within the epicenter of WNS. We used culture-dependent (CD) and culture-independent (CI) methods to catalogue all fungi (‘mycobiome’). CD methods included fungal isolations followed by phenotypic and molecular identifications. CI methods included amplification of DNA extracted from environmental samples with universal fungal primers followed by cloning and sequencing. CD methods yielded 675 fungal isolates and CI method yielded 594 fungal environmental nucleic acid sequences (FENAS). The core mycobiome of WNS comprised of 136 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) recovered in culture and 248 OTUs recovered in clone libraries. The fungal community was diverse across the sites, although a subgroup of dominant cosmopolitan fungi was present. The frequent recovery of Pd (18% of samples positive by culture) even in the presence of dominant, cosmopolitan fungal genera suggests some level of local adaptation in WNS-afflicted habitats, while the extensive distribution of Pd (48% of samples positive by real-time PCR) suggests an active reservoir of the pathogen at these sites. These findings underscore the need for integrated disease control measures that target both bats and Pd in the hibernacula for the control of WNS."

A key function of the brain is to extract meaning from relatively limited, noisy, and ambiguous sensory information. We indeed perceive—and are aware of seeing—the face of a particular person rather than the combination of pixels and specific features that compose the person’s face. This process of extracting meaning involves categorizations and perceptual decisions (Beale and Keil, 1995Beale J.M. Keil F.C.

Converging evidence has demonstrated the involvement of the ventral visual pathway—going from primary visual cortex to inferotemporal cortex—in visual perception (Logothetis and Sheinberg, 1996Logothetis N.K.

At the top of the hierarchy along the ventral visual pathway, high-level visual areas have strong connections to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) (Saleem and Tanaka, 1996Saleem K.S. Tanaka K.

It is precisely in this area where we previously reported the presence of “concept cells”—i.e., neurons with highly selective and invariant responses that represent the meaning of the stimulus. In fact, concept cells are selectively activated by different pictures of a particular person, by the person’s written or spoken name, and even by internal recall, in the absence of any external stimulus (Quian Quiroga et al., 2005Quian Quiroga R.

In the quest to understand how the brain constructs meaning from sensory information, several works have studied the firing of single neurons in monkeys using identical but ambiguous stimuli that elicit different perceptual outcomes (for reviews, see Logothetis, 1998Logothetis N.K.

Neurosci. 2002; 3: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). One such experimental manipulation is the use of face adaptation, where the perception of an ambiguous face is biased by the presentation of another face shortly preceding it (Leopold et al., 2001Leopold D.A.

Visual adaptation and face perception.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2011; 366: 1702-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this work, we used the unique opportunity of recording the activity of multiple single neurons in awake human subjects—who were implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical reasons—to study how neurons in the MTL respond to face adaptation. In particular, starting from two pictures of persons known to the subject (for which we had a neuron firing to one of them but not to the other), we created ambiguous morphed images that were briefly flashed, immediately following the presentation of an adaptor image (one of the two pictures). Given the high-level representation by cells in this area, we asked whether, and to what extent, the firing of MTL neurons follows the perceptual decision by the subjects. Subjects saw the presentation of ambiguous morphed images (e.g., a morph between presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush) preceded by an adaptor (the picture of Clinton or the one of Bush) and had to respond whether the ambiguous picture corresponded to one or the other (Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows the overall behavioral responses obtained in 21 experimental sessions with ten subjects for the three degrees of morphing used. In agreement with previous work (Leopold et al., 2005Leopold D.A. Rhodes G. Müller K.M. Jeffery L. The dynamics of visual adaptation to faces.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2005; 272: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), subjects tended to identify the ambiguous morphed pictures (M1, M2, and M3) as the opposite of the adaptor. That means, for each morphing, the adaptation to picture A led to a significantly higher recognition of the ambiguous picture as B (and vice versa) (M1: p < 10−3; M2: p < 10−4; M3: p < 10−7; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This perceptual difference was larger for longer presentations of the adaptors (Figure 1C). Given the different perceptual outcomes using the same set of ambiguous images, we then asked whether the firing of single neurons in the medial temporal lobe was entirely driven by visual features or whether it was modulated by the subjects’ decision (picture A or B). Altogether, we obtained 81 significant responses (defined as a statistical significant response to a specific face; see Experimental Procedures) in 62 units (45 units with 1 response, 15 with 2, and 2 units with 3 responses): 26 in the hippocampus, 20 in the entorhinal cortex, 15 in the parahippocampal cortex, and 20 in the amygdala. Figure 2 shows the responses of a single unit in the hippocampus during the adaptation paradigm. The neuron fired selectively to actress Whoopi Goldberg (picture B) when shown without morphing (100% B; mean: 7.37 spikes/s) and did not respond to Bob Marley (100% A; mean: 3.87 spikes/s). The middle columns (highlighted) show the responses to the morphed pictures separated according to the subject’s response (recognized A or B). Even though the ambiguous pictures were exactly the same, there was a larger activation of the neuron when the subject reported recognizing them as Goldberg (mean: 7.84 spikes/s) compared to when he recognized them as Marley (mean: 2.40 spikes/s). In line with this observation, a linear classifier could correctly predict the subject’s response upon the presentation of the ambiguous morphed pictures in 77% of the trials, which is significantly better than chance with p < 10−3 (see Experimental Procedures). We applied the linear classifier to the 75 out of 81 responses for which we had at least five trials for each decision (recognized A and recognized B). Altogether, the decoding performance was significantly larger than chance with p < 0.05 (see Experimental Procedures) for 23 of the 75 responses (31%). A pattern similar to the one in Figure 2 (additional examples are shown in Figures S1, S2, and S3 in the Supplemental Information available online) was found in the average normalized responses (Figure 3). For the three morphed images, M1, M2, and M3, there was a significantly higher activation when the subjects recognized the ambiguous images as person B (responsive) compared to A (nonresponsive) (Figure 3A). Moreover, the response to the three morphed images perceived as picture B did not differ statistically from the one obtained in response to the presentation of picture B without morphing. Similarly, the presentation of picture A (without morphing) elicited a response that did not differ statistically from the one elicited by the morphed images when recognized as A. Figure 3B shows the results pooled together the three morphs used. As before, there was a significantly larger response to picture B and the ambiguous pictures recognized as B, compared to picture A and the ambiguous pictures recognized as A. For each response (A or B) there were no significant differences in the neurons’ firing to the ambiguous and the original (nonmorphed) pictures. These results were consistent across MTL areas. That means, when considering the neurons of each area separately (hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), in all cases the response to the ambiguous pictures recognized as picture B were significantly larger than when recognized as A, and there were no significant differences in the responses to the original (nonmorphed) pictures A or B and the ambiguous pictures recognized as picture A or B, respectively. This lack of significant differences between the ambiguous and the original pictures should, however, be interpreted with caution, given that such null result could be due to an insufficient number of trials or a large variability in the responses across different neurons, among other factors. To further study this issue, we used a linear classifier to predict the presentation of the original or the ambiguous pictures leading to the same perceptual outcome (recognized A or recognized B). As before, we considered those responses for which we had at least five trials in each condition. In 10 out of 52 cases (19%) the linear classifier could discriminate better than chance (p < 0.05) the presentation of the original picture B from the ambiguous picture recognized as B, whereas in 15 out of 62 cases (24%) the classifier could significantly distinguish between picture A and the ambiguous picture recognized as A. Complementing these results, in Figure 4 we show the time course of the normalized average instantaneous firing rate curves (see Experimental Procedures) for the four conditions (pictures A or B, and ambiguous pictures recognized as A or B). Note the similarity of the firing rate curves in response to the pure picture B and to the ambiguous pictures recognized as B (difference nonsignificant; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). These responses were significantly larger than the ones to picture A and to the ambiguous pictures recognized as A (K-S test; p < 10−10 in all cases). Note, however, that in this case there is also a lower response to picture A compared to the ambiguous picture recognized as A, which was statistically significant (K-S test; p < 10−8). Given these results, it seems plausible to argue that the lack of statistical significance when analyzing the whole response strength (Figure 3B) was due to variability in the different responses, an interpretation that is in line with the cell-by-cell decoding results described in the previous paragraph. The mean response latencies (see Experimental Procedures) for picture B and the ambiguous pictures recognized as B (335 ms and 312 ms, respectively) were not significantly different. The response latencies for picture A and the ambiguous pictures recognized as A were slightly larger (469 ms and 399 ms, respectively) but also not statistically different from each other, or from the responses to picture B. Finally, to disentangle whether the differential responses to the morphed pictures (according to the subjects’ perception) could, at least in part, be explained by a modulation in the firing of the neurons given by the presentation of the preceding adaptors, we performed a two-way ANOVA with “decision” (recognized A or B) and “adaptor” (picture A or B) as independent factors. This analysis showed that the differential firing of MTL neurons was due to the decision and not due to the preceding adaptor. In fact, there was a significant effect for the factor “decision” (p < 10−4) but not for “adaptor” or for the interaction between both factors.

McDermott J. Chun M.M. The fusiform face area: a module in human extrastriate cortex specialized for face perception.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4302-4311PubMed Google Scholar), have identified specific areas involved in the recognition of faces. We here used face adaptation to bias the perception of ambiguous morphed images to investigate whether such perceptual bias affected the firing of MTL neurons. We indeed found a strong modulation of the responses of these neurons when the subject perceived one person or the other, in spite of the fact that the ambiguous images were exactly the same. In particular, the responses to the ambiguous images were significantly larger when the subject recognized the image as person B (the one for which the neuron originally fired) compared to person A. Interestingly, the responses to the ambiguous images identified as picture B (the one eliciting responses) were not significantly different, both in terms of magnitude and latency, from the ones obtained when showing picture B without morphing. The responses to picture A (the one not eliciting responses) were also not significantly different, in terms of magnitude and latency, from the ones to the ambiguous pictures recognized as A when considering the whole response strength (Figure 3). However, in this case there was a tendency for higher responses to the ambiguous pictures that did reach statistical significance when considering the time-resolved average responses (Figure 4). Thus, the lack of statistical difference with the whole response strength may be attributed to variability in the neurons’ responses. In fact, in about 20% of the cases, a linear classifier could distinguish above chance the presentation of the original and ambiguous pictures leading to the same perceptual decision. Such differences could, in principle, be attributed to a higher cognitive load when deciding the identity of a morphed compared to a nonmorphed image, which could have involved different degrees of attention. It is also possible that, even if eventually making a single decision in each trial, subjects may have had (at least in some cases) an alternating percept between both identities when seeing the morphed pictures. We also observed a smaller difference between the responses to the original and the morphed presentations for the images eliciting responses (picture B) compared to the difference for the images not eliciting responses (picture A), which could in principle be attributed to a firing rate saturation—i.e., there was little modulation in the responses to picture B because the neurons were already close to their maximum firing rates. Ambiguous percepts have a long history of being used to dissociate neural responses underlying the subjective perception by the subject from the sensory representation of the visual stimuli (Logothetis and Schall, 1989Logothetis N.K.

Neural events and perceptual awareness.Cognition. 2001; 79: 89-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this respect, a classic paradigm is binocular rivalry, where two distinct images presented at each eye compete with each other and give rise to a fluctuating perception of one or the other. Single-cell recordings along the ventral visual pathway in monkeys have shown an increase in the number of neurons following the subjective perception in higher visual areas (Logothetis, 1998Logothetis N.K. Single units and conscious vision.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 1801-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).

Hippocampal-neocortical interaction: a hierarchy of associativity.Hippocampus. 2000; 10: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), where modulations of the neurons’ firing with subjective perception were also found using a binocular rivalry paradigm (Kreiman et al., 2002Kreiman G. Fried I. Koch C. Single-neuron correlates of subjective vision in the human medial temporal lobe.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 8378-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and where we previously showed, using short presentation times together with backward masking, that human MTL neurons fired only when the stimulus was recognized and remained at baseline firing levels when it was not (Quian Quiroga et al., 2008bQuian Quiroga R.

USA. 2008; 105: 3599-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this later study, the variability in recognition could be attributed to internal processes, independent of the actual stimulus presentation, and varying degrees of attention. Along this line, we here presented further evidence supporting the claim that MTL neurons follow the subjective perception by the subjects, but in this case using ambiguous images representing competing stimuli—i.e., a morphed image that can be recognized as one person or the other—and modifying the actual perception by means of adaptation. The data come from 21 sessions in 10 patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. Extensive noninvasive monitoring did not yield concordant data corresponding to a single resectable epileptic focus. Therefore, the patients were implanted with chronic depth electrodes for 7–10 days to determine the seizure focus for possible surgical resection (Fried et al., 1997Fried I. MacDonald K.A.

Here we report data from sites in the hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex. All studies conformed to the guidelines of the Medical Institutional Review Board at UCLA and the Institutional Review Board at Caltech. The electrode locations were based exclusively on clinical criteria and were verified by CT coregistered to preoperative MRI. Each electrode probe had a total of nine microwires at its end, eight active recording channels, and one reference. The differential signal from the microwires was amplified using a 64-channel Neuralynx system, filtered between 1 and 9,000 Hz and sampled at 28 kHz. Each recording session lasted about 30 min. Subjects sat in bed, facing a laptop computer on which images were presented. The stimuli used were chosen from previous “screening sessions” in which a set of about 100 different pictures of people well known to the subjects (along with several pictures of landmarks, objects, and animals) were shown for 1 s, six times each in pseudorandom order (Quian Quiroga et al., 2005Quian Quiroga R.

The pictures used in the screening sessions were partially chosen according to the subject’s interests and preferences. After a fast offline analysis of the data, it was determined which of the presented pictures elicited responses in at least one unit. Between 2 and 5 (mean: 3.14; SD: 0.65) pictures of individuals eliciting responses in the screening sessions were used in the adaptation paradigm reported here. To design the adaptation paradigm, tuned for each patient based on the obtained responses for the selected individuals (e.g., Bill Clinton, Jennifer Lopez), we chose a second person (e.g., George Bush, Jennifer Aniston) and for each stimulus pair (e.g., Bill Clinton and George Bush, Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Aniston) we created 120 morphed images, going gradually from 100% picture A (Bill Clinton) to 100% picture B (George Bush). Then, we showed the patients each sequence of morphs as a continuous movie (with a presentation rate of 30 frames per s and 4 s per movie) 16 times for each stimulus pair, in pseudorandom order and in both directions, namely, going from picture A to picture B and vice versa. Subjects had to press and hold the down-arrow key to begin the movie presentation, which started 100 ms after the key press, and were instructed to release the key at the moment they recognized the second person. Movies involving the same stimulus pair in either direction were never shown in consecutive trials. Finally, according to the subjects’ responses, for each pair we selected three morphed images (M1, M2, and M3) giving an ambiguous perception: M2 was the one estimated to give the most ambiguous perception to the subject—i.e., the image that corresponded to the mean response time, averaging the presentations going from A to B with the ones going from B to A; M1 and M3 were closer to pictures A and B, respectively, and were between three to eight frames away from M2 (the exact number of frames was heuristically selected in each case to give an ambiguous image but with a slight bias toward recognition of one or the other image). The morphed pictures were created using the software SmartMorph, after rescaling and cropping the images with Photoshop. Images were presented at the center of the laptop screen and covered about 1.5° of visual angle. After determining the morphs eliciting an ambiguous perception, subjects performed the adaptation paradigm, in which the perception of the ambiguous images was biased by first showing one of the two original pictures used to generate the morphs (Figure 1A). The basic idea is that, when shown a morphing between pictures A and B, subjects are more likely to recognize it as picture B if the morphed image is preceded by a presentation of picture A (the adaptor) and vice versa (Webster et al., 2004Webster M.A. Kaping D. Mizokami Y. Duhamel P. Adaptation to natural facial categories.Nature. 2004; 428: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, Leopold et al., 2005Leopold D.A. Rhodes G. Müller K.M. Jeffery L. The dynamics of visual adaptation to faces.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2005; 272: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This effect has been attributed to diminished responses of feature-selective neurons after previous stimulation by the adaptor (Leopold et al., 2005Leopold D.A. Rhodes G. Müller K.M. Jeffery L. The dynamics of visual adaptation to faces.Proc. Biol. Sci. 2005; 272: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In the first eight sessions, the adaptor image (either picture A or B of each pair) was shown for 1 and 1.5 s (first six and following two sessions, respectively), but a better perceptual bias was later obtained when using a longer presentation (4 s) of the adaptors (Figure 1C), which was used in the remaining 13 sessions. For each picture pair, a total of six to eight presentations of each morph (M1, M2, and M3) preceded by an adaptation to picture A, and an equal number of times preceded by an adaptation to B, were shown in pseudorandom order. Each trial started with a fixation cross displayed at the center of the screen for 500 ms. After a random delay between 0 and 100 ms, the adaptor picture was presented (for 1, 1.5, or 4 s) and, following a blank of 300 ms, one of the morphed images was shown for 200 ms. In order to compare the responses elicited by the morphed pictures to those to the nonambiguous images, in 15 of the 21 sessions we also added a presentation of the original pictures A and B after the adaptors. The “target images” (M1, M2, M3, 100% A, and 100% B) were followed by a 500 ms blank, after which the names of the two persons of the corresponding stimulus pair were shown and the subject had to indicate which one (s)he perceived with the left/right arrow key (Figure 1A). From the continuous wide-band data, spike detection and sorting were carried out using “Wave_Clus,” an adaptive and stochastic clustering algorithm (Quian Quiroga et al., 2004Quian Quiroga R. Nadasdy Z. Ben-Shaul Y. Unsupervised spike detection and sorting with wavelets and superparamagnetic clustering.Neural Comput. 2004; 16: 1661-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). As in previous works (Quian Quiroga et al., 2009Quian Quiroga R. Kraskov A. Koch C. Fried I. Explicit encoding of multimodal percepts by single neurons in the human brain.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1308-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), a response was considered significant if, for the presentation of the “target images”—either for the 100% A, 100% B (when available), the “recognized A” or “recognized B” presentations (pulling together the responses for the three morphs)—it fulfilled the following criteria: (1) the firing in the response period (defined as the 1 s interval following the stimulus onset) was significantly larger than in the baseline period (the 1 s preceding stimulus onset) according to a paired t test with p < 0.01; (2) the median number of spikes in the response period was at least 2; (3) the response contained at least five trials (given that the number of trials in the conditions “recognized A” and “recognized B” was variable). For the average population plots (Figure 3), we normalized each response by the maximum response across conditions (100% A, 100% B, M1, M2, M3, separated according to the decision: A or B). Statistical comparisons were performed using nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (Zar, 1996Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs1996Google Scholar). A linear classifier was used to decode the subjects’ decision upon the presentation of the ambiguous morphed images (recognized picture A or B) in those cases where we had at least five trials for each decision. One at a time, the firing in each trial was used to test the classifier, which was trained with the remaining trials (all-but-one cross-validation). As in previous works (Quian Quiroga et al., 2007Quian Quiroga R. Reddy L. Koch C. Fried I. Decoding visual inputs from multiple neurons in the human temporal lobe.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 1997-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Quian Quiroga and Panzeri, 2009Quian Quiroga R. Panzeri S. Extracting information from neuronal populations: information theory and decoding approaches.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), to evaluate the statistical significance of decoding performance, we used the fact that since the outcomes of the predictions of each decision are independent trials with two possible outcomes, success or failure, the probability of successes in a sequence of trials follows the Binomial distribution. Given a probability p of getting a hit by chance (p = 1/K, K: number of possible decisions), the probability of getting k hits by chance in n trials is P(k)=(nk)pk(1−p)n−k, where (nk)=n!(n−k)!k! is the number of possible ways of having k hits in n trials. From this, we assessed statistical significance and calculated a p value by adding up the probabilities of getting k or more hits by chance: p-value=∑j=knP(j). We considered a significance level of p = 0.05, thus expecting 5% of the responses to reach significance just by chance. The same procedure was also used to compare the presentation of the original (nonmorphed) and morphed pictures for each perceptual decision (i.e., recognized A versus 100% A, and recognized B versus 100% B). Instantaneous firing rate curves were calculated by convolving the normalized spike trains with a Gaussian window of 100 ms width. For each response, we estimated the latency onset as the point where the instantaneous firing rate crossed the mean + 2.5 SD of the baseline for at least 100 ms. Similar results were obtained using a threshold of 3 or 4 SD. Statistical differences between the different average firing rate curves were assessed with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in the time window from 0 to 1 s after stimulus onset.

https://openalex.org/W2091829437,"Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in women, is a highly heterogeneous disease, characterized by distinct genomic and transcriptomic profiles. Transcriptome analyses prevalently assessed protein-coding genes; however, the majority of the mammalian genome is expressed in numerous non-coding transcripts. Emerging evidence supports that many of these non-coding RNAs are specifically expressed during development, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. The focus of this study was to investigate the expression features and molecular characteristics of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in breast cancer. We investigated 26 breast tumor and 5 normal tissue samples utilizing a custom expression microarray enclosing probes for mRNAs as well as novel and previously identified lncRNAs. We identified more than 19,000 unique regions significantly differentially expressed between normal versus breast tumor tissue, half of these regions were non-coding without any evidence for functional open reading frames or sequence similarity to known proteins. The identified non-coding regions were primarily located in introns (53%) or in the intergenic space (33%), frequently orientated in antisense-direction of protein-coding genes (14%), and commonly distributed at promoter-, transcription factor binding-, or enhancer-sites. Analyzing the most diverse mRNA breast cancer subtypes Basal-like versus Luminal A and B resulted in 3,025 significantly differentially expressed unique loci, including 682 (23%) for non-coding transcripts. A notable number of differentially expressed protein-coding genes displayed non-synonymous expression changes compared to their nearest differentially expressed lncRNA, including an antisense lncRNA strongly anticorrelated to the mRNA coding for histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which was investigated in more detail. Previously identified chromatin-associated lncRNAs (CARs) were predominantly downregulated in breast tumor samples, including CARs located in the protein-coding genes for CALD1, FTX, and HNRNPH1. In conclusion, a number of differentially expressed lncRNAs have been identified with relation to cancer-related protein-coding genes."
https://openalex.org/W2128328834,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which negatively regulates tumorigenic phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) signaling, is a commonly mutated tumor suppressor. The majority of cancer-associated PTEN mutations block its essential PIP3 phosphatase activity. However, there is a group of clinically identified PTEN mutations that maintain enzymatic activity, and it is unknown how these mutations contribute to tumor pathogenesis. Here, we show that these enzymatically competent PTEN mutants fail to translocate to the plasma membrane where PTEN converts PIP3 to PI(4,5)P2. Artificial membrane tethering of the PTEN mutants effectively restores tumor suppressor activity and represses excess PIP3 signaling in cells. Thus, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of tumorigenic PTEN deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2041630534,"Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important zoonotic pathogen causing severe infections in pigs and humans. The pathogenesis of S. suis 2 infections, however, is still poorly understood. Spx proteins are a group of global regulators involved in stress tolerance and virulence. In this study, we characterized two orthologs of the Spx regulator, SpxA1 and SpxA2 in S. suis 2. Two mutant strains (ΔspxA1 and ΔspxA2) lacking the spx genes were constructed. The ΔspxA1 and ΔspxA2 mutants displayed different phenotypes. ΔspxA1 exhibited impaired growth in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, while ΔspxA2 exhibited impaired growth in the presence of SDS and NaCl. Both mutants were defective in medium lacking newborn bovine serum. Using a murine infection model, we demonstrated that the abilities of the mutant strains to colonize the tissues were significantly reduced compared to that of the wild-type strain. The mutant strains also showed a decreased level of survival in pig blood. Microarray analysis revealed a global regulatory role for SpxA1 and SpxA2. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that Spx is involved in triggering the host inflammatory response. Collectively, our data suggest that SpxA1 and SpxA2 are global regulators that are implicated in stress tolerance and virulence in S. suis 2."
https://openalex.org/W2053443135,"Bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have the potential to significantly contribute to skeletal muscle healing through the secretion of paracrine factors that support proliferation and enhance participation of the endogenous muscle stem cells in the process of repair/regeneration. However, MSC-derived trophic molecules have been poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to investigate paracrine signaling effects of MSCs on skeletal myoblasts. It was found, using a biochemical and morphological approach that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a natural bioactive lipid exerting a broad range of muscle cell responses, is secreted by MSCs and represents an important factor by which these cells exert their stimulatory effects on C2C12 myoblast and satellite cell proliferation. Indeed, exposure to conditioned medium obtained from MSCs cultured in the presence of the selective sphingosine kinase inhibitor (iSK), blocked increased cell proliferation caused by the conditioned medium from untreated MSCs, and the addition of exogenous S1P in the conditioned medium from MSCs pre-treated with iSK further increased myoblast proliferation. Finally, we also demonstrated that the myoblast response to MSC-secreted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) involves the release of S1P from C2C12 cells. Our data may have important implications in the optimization of cell-based strategies to promote skeletal muscle regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2064071103,"Although the encapsulation of paclitaxel into liposomes has been extensively studied, its significant hydrophobic and uncharged character has generated substantial difficulties concerning its efficient encapsulation into the inner water core of liposomes. We found that a more hydrophilic paclitaxel molecule, 7-glucosyloxyacetylpaclitaxel, retained tubulin polymerization stabilization activity. The hydrophilic nature of 7-glucosyloxyacetylpaclitaxel allowed its efficient encapsulation into the inner water core of liposomes, which was successfully accomplished using a remote loading method with a solubility gradient between 40% ethylene glycol and Cremophor EL/ethanol in PBS. Trastuzumab was then conjugated onto the surface of liposomes as immunoliposomes to selectively target human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-overexpressing cancer cells. In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that the immunoliposomes enhanced the toxicity of 7-glucosyloxyacetylpaclitaxel in HER2-overexpressing cancer cells and showed more rapid suppression of cell growth. The immunoliposomes strongly inhibited the tumor growth of HT-29 cells xenografted in nude mice. Notably, mice survived when treated with the immunoliposomes formulation, even when administered at a lethal dose of 7-glucosyloxyacetylpaclitaxel in vivo. This data successfully demonstrates immunoliposomes as a promising candidate for the efficient delivery of paclitaxel glycoside."
https://openalex.org/W1991976787,"Background The endocannabinoid system has previously been implicated in the regulation of neurons and inflammatory cells. Additionally, it has been reported that endocannabinoid receptors are present on circulating platelets, but there has been conflicting evidence on their contribution to platelet function. Objectives Our aim was to examine the role of endocannabinoids in platelet function in vitro and in vivo. Methods and Results We studied the effects of the well-characterized endogenous endocannabinoid anandamide on platelet aggregation in suspension, α-granule release, calcium mobilization, Syk phosphorylation, as well as platelet spreading and aggregate formation under flow. Anandamide inhibits platelet aggregation and α-granule release by collagen, collagen-derived peptide CRP-XL, ADP, arachidonic acid and thromboxane A2 analogue U46619. However, activation via thrombin receptor PAR-1 stays largely unaffected. Calcium mobilization is significantly impaired when platelets are stimulated with collagen or CRP-XL, but remains normal in the presence of the other agonists. In line with this finding, we found that anandamide prevents collagen-induced Syk phosphorylation. Furthermore, anandamide-treated platelets exhibit reduced spreading on immobilized fibrinogen, have a decreased capacity for binding fibrinogen in solution and show perturbed platelet aggregate formation under flow over collagen. Finally, we investigated the influence of Cannabis sativa consumption by human volunteers on platelet activation. Similar to our in vitro findings with anandamide, ex vivo collagen-induced platelet aggregation and aggregate formation on immobilized collagen under flow were impaired in whole blood of donors that had consumed Cannabis sativa. Conclusions Endocannabinoid receptor agonists reduce platelet activation and aggregate formation both in vitro and ex vivo after Cannabis sativa consumption. Further elucidation of this novel regulatory mechanism for platelet function may prove beneficial in the search for new antithrombotic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2073401782,"Aberrant activation of Notch signaling has an essential role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1), also known as steroid receptor coactivator 3 or NCOA3, is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. However, AIB1 implication in CRC progression through enhancing Notch signaling is unknown. In this study, we found that several CRC cell lines expressed high levels of AIB1, and knockdown of AIB1 decreased cell proliferation, colony formation and tumorigenesis of these CRC cells. Specifically, knockdown of AIB1 inhibited cell cycle progression at G1 phase by decreasing the mRNA levels of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, cyclin E2 and hairy and enhancer of split (Hes) 1. Furthermore, AIB1 interacted with Notch intracellular domain and Mastermind-like 1 and was recruited to the Hes1 promoter to enhance Notch signaling. Downregulation of AIB1 also decreased CRC cell invasiveness in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Besides that, knockout of AIB1 in mice inhibited colon carcinogenesis induced by azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate treatment. The mRNA levels of cyclin B1 and Hes5 were downregulated, but p27, ATOH1 and MUC2 were upregulated in the colon tumors from AIB1-deficient mice compared with those from wild-type mice. Thus, our results signify the importance of AIB1 in CRC and demonstrate that AIB1 promotes CRC progression at least in part through enhancing Notch signaling, suggesting that AIB1 is a potential molecular target for CRC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2131653210,"Expression of the cellular adhesion protein N-cadherin is a critical event during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The SMAD4 protein has been identified as a mediator of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily signaling, which regulates EMT, but the mechanisms linking TGF-β signaling to N-cadherin expression remain unclear. When the TGF-β pathway is activated, SMAD proteins, including the common mediator SMAD4, are subsequently translocated into the nucleus, where they influence gene transcription via SMAD binding elements (SBEs). Here we describe a mechanism for control of CDH2, the gene encoding N-cadherin, through the canonical TGFβ–SMAD4 pathway. We first identified four previously undescribed SBEs within the CDH2 promoter. Using telomerase immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelium, we found that TGF-β stimulation prompted specific SMAD4 binding to all four SBEs. Luciferase reporter and SMAD4-knockdown experiments demonstrated that specific SMAD4 binding to the SBE located at −3790 bp to −3795 bp within the promoter region of CDH2 was necessary for TGF-β-stimulated transcription. Expression of N-cadherin on the surface of epithelial cells facilitates motility and invasion, and we demonstrated that knockdown of SMAD4 causes decreased N-cadherin expression, which results in diminished migration and invasion of human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Similar reduction of cell motility was produced after CDH2 knockdown. Together, these findings suggest that SMAD4 is critical for the TGF-β-driven upregulation of N-cadherin and the resultant invasive phenotype of human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells during EMT."
https://openalex.org/W2017948732,"The sapB gene, encoding Bacillus pumilus CBS protease, and seven mutated genes (sapB-L31I, sapB-T33S, sapB-N99Y, sapB-L31I/T33S, sapB-L31I/N99Y, sapB-T33S/N99Y, and sapB-L31I/T33S/N99Y) were overexpressed in protease-deficient Bacillus subtilis DB430 and purified to homogeneity. SAPB-N99Y and rSAPB displayed the highest levels of keratinolytic activity, hydrolysis efficiency, and enzymatic depilation. Interestingly, and at the semi-industrial scale, rSAPB efficiently removed the hair of goat hides within a short time interval of 8 h, thus offering a promising opportunity for the attainment of a lime and sulphide-free depilation process. The efficacy of the process was supported by submitting depilated pelts and dyed crusts to scanning electron microscopic analysis, and the results showed well opened fibre bundles and no apparent damage to the collagen layer. The findings also revealed better physico-chemical properties and less effluent loads, which further confirmed the potential candidacy of the rSAPB enzyme for application in the leather industry to attain an ecofriendly process of animal hide depilation. More interestingly, the findings on the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the enzyme using the synthetic peptide para-nitroanilide revealed strong preferences for an aliphatic amino-acid (valine) at position P1 for keratinases and an aromatic amino-acid (phenylalanine) at positions P1/P4 for subtilisins. Molecular modeling suggested the potential involvement of a Leu31 residue in a network of hydrophobic interactions, which could have shaped the S4 substrate binding site. The latter could be enlarged by mutating L31I, fitting more easily in position P4 than a phenylalanine residue. The molecular modeling of SAPB-T33S showed a potential S2 subside widening by a T33S mutation, thus suggesting its importance in substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2047896202,"Evasion of cell death is fundamental to the development of cancer and its metastasis. The role of the BCL-2-mediated (intrinsic) apoptotic program in these processes remains poorly understood. Here we have investigated the relevance of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM to breast cancer progression using the MMTV-Polyoma middle-T (PyMT) transgenic model. BIM deficiency in PyMT females did not affect primary tumor growth, but substantially increased the survival of metastatic cells within the lung. These data reveal a role for BIM in the suppression of breast cancer metastasis. Intriguingly, we observed a striking correlation between the expression of BIM and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition transcription factor SNAI2 at the proliferative edge of the tumors. Overexpression and knockdown studies confirmed that these two genes were coordinately expressed, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis further revealed that Bim is a target of SNAI2. Taken together, our findings suggest that SNAI2-driven BIM-induced apoptosis may temper metastasis by governing the survival of disseminating breast tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2066331475,"School playtime provides daily opportunities for children to be active outdoors, but only makes small contributions to physical activity (PA) requirements. Natural environments facilitate unstructured PA and children report a preference for play in nature. Thus, play on the school field might encourage children to be more active during playtime. The primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of the school playing environment on children's PA. Descriptive data and fitness were assessed in 25 children aged 8-9 years from a single primary school. Over two consecutive weeks participants were allocated to either play on the school field or playground during playtime. The order of play in the two areas was randomised and counterbalanced. Moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was assessed during playtime on the last two days of each week using accelerometers. There was a significant interaction of environment and sex on MVPA during morning play (F(1,22) = 6.27; P<0.05; np2 = 0.222), but not during lunch (P>0.05; np2 = 0.060) or all of playtime combined (P>0.05; np2 = 0.140). During morning play boys were significantly more active than girls on the playground (t(23) = 1.32; P<0.01; n2 = 0.291), but not on the field (P>0.05; n2 = 0.071). For lunch (F(1,22) = 24,11; P<0.001; np2 = 0.523) and all of playtime combined (F(1,22) = 33.67; P<0.001; np2 = 0.616) there was a significant effect of environment. There was also a significant main effect of sex during lunch (F(1,22) = 11.56; P<0.01; np2 = 0.344) and all of playtime combined (F(1,22) = 12.37; P<0.01; np2 = 0.371). MVPA was higher on the field and boys were more active than girls. Play on the field leads to increases in MVPA, particularly in girls. The promising trend for the effect of the natural environment on MVPA indicates that interventions aimed at increasing MVPA should use the natural environment and that schools should encourage greater use of their natural areas to increase PA."
https://openalex.org/W1998020450,"Natural killer (NK) cells provide defense in the early stages of the immune response against viral infections. Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) expressed on the surface of NK cells play an important role in regulating NK cell response through recognition of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules on target cells. Previous studies have shown that specific KIR/ligand combinations are associated with the outcome of several viral infectious diseases.We investigated the impact of inhibitory and activating KIR and their HLA-class I ligand genotype on the susceptibility to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV2) infections. From April to July 2010 in Gabon, a large outbreak of CHIKV and DENV2 concomitantly occurred in two provinces of Gabon (Ogooué-Lolo and Haut-Ogooué). We performed the genotypic analysis of KIR in the combination with their cognate HLA-class I ligands in 73 CHIKV and 55 DENV2 adult cases, compared with 54 healthy individuals.We found in CHIV-infected patients that KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS5 are significantly increased and decreased respectively, as compared to DENV2+ patients and healthy donors. The combination of KIR2DL1 and its cognate HLA-C2 ligand was significantly associated with the susceptibility to CHIKV infection. In contrast, no other inhibitory KIR-HLA pairs showed an association with the two mosquito-borne arboviruses.These observations are strongly suggestive that the NK cell repertoire shaped by the KIR2DL1:HLA-C2 interaction facilitate specific infection by CHIKV."
https://openalex.org/W2061789212,"Individual variation in the response to environmental challenges depends partly on innate reaction norms, partly on experience-based cognitive/emotional evaluations that individuals make of the situation. The goal of this study was to investigate whether pre-existing differences in behaviour predict the outcome of such assessment of environmental cues, using a conditioned place preference/avoidance (CPP/CPA) paradigm. A comparative vertebrate model (European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax) was used, and ninety juvenile individuals were initially screened for behavioural reactivity using a net restraining test. Thereafter each individual was tested in a choice tank using net chasing as aversive stimulus or exposure to familiar conspecifics as appetitive stimulus in the preferred or non preferred side respectively (called hereafter stimulation side). Locomotor behaviour (i.e. time spent, distance travelled and swimming speed in each tank side) of each individual was recorded and analysed with video software. The results showed that fish which were previously exposed to appetitive stimulus increased significantly the time spent on the stimulation side, while aversive stimulus led to a strong decrease in time spent on the stimulation side. Moreover, this study showed clearly that proactive fish were characterised by a stronger preference for the social stimulus and when placed in a putative aversive environment showed a lower physiological stress responses than reactive fish. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time in sea bass, that the CPP/CPA paradigm can be used to assess the valence (positive vs. negative) that fish attribute to different stimuli and that individual behavioural traits is predictive of how stimuli are perceived and thus of the magnitude of preference or avoidance behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2003909448,"Purpose This study was designed to formulate a model that efficiently predicts splenic hilar lymph node metastasis (SHLNM) in patients with proximal gastric cancer and to assess indications for laparoscopic spleen-preserving no.10 lymph node dissection (LSPNo.10LND) based on this model. Methods Patients (N = 346) with proximal gastric cancer who underwent LSPNo.10LND from January 2010 to October 2013 were prospectively enrolled and retrospectively evaluated. Groups of patients with and without SHLNM were compared, and independent risk factors for SHLNM determined. An optimal predictive model of SHLNM in patients with proximal gastric cancer was well established. Results Of the 346 patients with proximal gastric cancer, only 35 (10.1%) were diagnosed with SHLNM. Depth of invasion, tumor location and metastases to No.7 and No.11 lymph nodes (LNs) were independent risk factors for SHLNM (p<0.0001 each). A model involving depth of invasion, tumor location and metastasis to No.7 and 11 LNs yielded a lowest Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) of −913.535 and a highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.897(95%CI:0.851–0.944). Stratification analysis showed no SHLNMs in the absence of serosal invasion of the lesser curvature and metastases at No.7 and No.11 LNs (T2-3∶0/87, 95% CI: 0.00–4.15). Conclusions A model including depth of invasion, tumor location and metastases at No.7 and No.11 LNs was found optimal for predicting SHLNM for proximal gastric cancers. LSPNo.10LND may be avoided when tumors on the lesser curvature did not show serosal invasion or metastases at No.7 and No.11 LNs."
https://openalex.org/W2044944500,"We evaluated the restoration of physical habitats and its influence on macroinvertebrate community structure in 18 Danish lowland streams comprising six restored streams, six streams with little physical alteration and six channelized streams. We hypothesized that physical habitats and macroinvertebrate communities of restored streams would resemble those of natural streams, while those of the channelized streams would differ from both restored and near-natural streams. Physical habitats were surveyed for substrate composition, depth, width and current velocity. Macroinvertebrates were sampled along 100 m reaches in each stream, in edge habitats and in riffle/run habitats located in the center of the stream. Restoration significantly altered the physical conditions and affected the interactions between stream habitat heterogeneity and macroinvertebrate diversity. The substrate in the restored streams was dominated by pebble, whereas the substrate in the channelized and natural streams was dominated by sand. In the natural streams a relationship was identified between slope and pebble/gravel coverage, indicating a coupling of energy and substrate characteristics. Such a relationship did not occur in the channelized or in the restored streams where placement of large amounts of pebble/gravel distorted the natural relationship. The analyses revealed, a direct link between substrate heterogeneity and macroinvertebrate diversity in the natural streams. A similar relationship was not found in either the channelized or the restored streams, which we attribute to a de-coupling of the natural relationship between benthic community diversity and physical habitat diversity. Our study results suggest that restoration schemes should aim at restoring the natural physical structural complexity in the streams and at the same time enhance the possibility of re-generating the natural geomorphological processes sustaining the habitats in streams and rivers. Documentation of restoration efforts should be intensified with continuous monitoring of geomorphological and ecological changes including surveys of reference river systems."
https://openalex.org/W2073510097,"Lean-type Pekin duck is a commercial breed that has been obtained through long-term selection. Investigation of the differentially expressed genes in breast muscle and skin fat at different developmental stages will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the lean-type Pekin duck phenotype. In the present study, RNA-seq was performed on breast muscle and skin fat at 2-, 4- and 6-weeks of age. More than 89% of the annotated duck genes were covered by our RNA-seq dataset. Thousands of differentially expressed genes, including many important genes involved in the regulation of muscle development and fat deposition, were detected through comparison of the expression levels in the muscle and skin fat of the same time point, or the same tissue at different time points. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes clustered significantly in many muscle development and fat deposition related pathways such as MAPK signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, Calcium signaling pathway, Fat digestion and absorption, and TGF-beta signaling pathway. The results presented here could provide a basis for further investigation of the mechanisms involved in muscle development and fat deposition in Pekin duck."
https://openalex.org/W2002021248,"Background Hypoglycemia-induced brain edema is a severe clinical event that often results in death. The mechanisms by which hypoglycemia induces brain edema are unclear. Methods In a hypoglycemic injury model established in adult rats, brain edema was verified by measuring brain water content and visualizing water accumulation using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Temporal expression of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were evaluated. We assessed the distribution and expression of AQP4 following glucose deprivation in astrocyte cultures. Results Brain edema was induced immediately after severe hypoglycemia but continued to progress even after recovery from hypoglycemia. Upregulation of AQP4 expression and moderate breakdown of the BBB were observed 24 h after recovery. In vitro, significant redistribution of AQP4 to the plasma membrane was induced following 6 h glucose deprivation. Conclusion Hypoglycemia-induced brain edema is caused by cytotoxic and vasogenic factors. Changes in AQP4 location and expression may play a protective role in edema resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1964371561,"The Polycomb group protein Bmi-1 is an essential regulator of cellular senescence and is believed to function largely through the direct repression of the Ink4a/Arf locus. However, concurrent deletion of Ink4a/Arf does not fully rescue the defects detected in Bmi-1−/− mice, indicating that additional Bmi-1 targets remain to be identified. The expression of the chromatin-associated Sin3B protein is stimulated by oncogenic stress, and is required for oncogene-induced senescence. Here we demonstrate that oncogenic stress leads to the dissociation of Bmi-1 from the Sin3B locus, resulting in increased Sin3B expression and subsequent entry into cellular senescence. Furthermore, Sin3B is required for the senescent phenotype and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species elicited upon Bmi-1 depletion. Altogether, these results identify Sin3B as a novel direct target of Bmi-1, and establish Bmi-1-driven repression of Sin3B as an essential regulator of cellular senescence."

The incidence of and factors associated with false positives in this assay have not been previously evaluated.After an NV outbreak caused by the GII.4 Sydney strain in 2012, we reanalysed 250 stool samples positive for NV by RdRp gene detection. True positives were confirmed in 154 (61.6%) samples by successful amplification and sequencing confirmation of the viral protein 1 gene. Of the remaining 96 samples that underwent RT-PCR for the RdRp gene, 34 samples yielded PCR products of the expected length. However, the sequences of the amplicons belonged to the human genome, with 91-97% matched nucleotide sequences, indicating false positives. Multivariate analysis of the clinical features of the patients identified a positive stool culture for bacteria (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 9.07, 95% adjusted confidence interval [aCI] 2.17-37.92, P = .003) and the use of parenteral antibiotics (aOR 5.55, 95% aCI 1.21-24.73, P = .027) as significant and independent factors associated with false positives.Conventional RT-PCR targeting the RdRp gene of NV can lead to false positives in patients with bacterial enterocolitis by incidental amplification of DNA from a human source."
https://openalex.org/W2065554200,"Importance The association between hospital volume and inpatient mortality for severe sepsis is unclear. Objective To assess the effect of severe sepsis case volume and inpatient mortality. Design Setting and Participants Retrospective cohort study from 646,988 patient discharges with severe sepsis from 3,487 hospitals in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2002 to 2011. Exposures The exposure of interest was the mean yearly sepsis case volume per hospital divided into tertiles. Main Outcomes and Measures Inpatient mortality. Results Compared with the highest tertile of severe sepsis volume (>60 cases per year), the odds ratio for inpatient mortality among persons admitted to hospitals in the lowest tertile (≤10 severe sepsis cases per year) was 1.188 (95% CI: 1.074–1.315), while the odds ratio was 1.090 (95% CI: 1.031–1.152) for patients admitted to hospitals in the middle tertile. Similarly, improved survival was seen across the tertiles with an adjusted inpatient mortality incidence of 35.81 (95% CI: 33.64–38.03) for hospitals with the lowest volume of severe sepsis cases and a drop to 32.07 (95% CI: 31.51–32.64) for hospitals with the highest volume. Conclusions and Relevance We demonstrate an association between a higher severe sepsis case volume and decreased mortality. The need for a systems-based approach for improved outcomes may require a high volume of severely septic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2168136729,"For sensitive detection of rare gene repair events in terminally differentiated photoreceptors, we generated a knockin mouse model by replacing one mouse rhodopsin allele with a form of the human rhodopsin gene that causes a severe, early-onset form of retinitis pigmentosa. The human gene contains a premature stop codon at position 344 (Q344X), cDNA encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at its 3′ end, and a modified 5′ untranslated region to reduce translation rate so that the mutant protein does not induce retinal degeneration. Mutations that eliminate the stop codon express a human rhodopsin-EGFP fusion protein (hRho-GFP), which can be readily detected by fluorescence microscopy. Spontaneous mutations were observed at a frequency of about one per retina; in every case, they gave rise to single fluorescent rod cells, indicating that each mutation occurred during or after the last mitotic division. Additionally, the number of fluorescent rods did not increase with age, suggesting that the rhodopsin gene in mature rod cells is less sensitive to mutation than it is in developing rods. Thus, there is a brief developmental window, coinciding with the transcriptional activation of the rhodopsin locus, in which somatic mutations of the rhodopsin gene abruptly begin to appear."
https://openalex.org/W2007664557,"Brain metastasis of breast cancer is an important clinical problem, with few therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. Recent data have implicated mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) in controlling the in vitro migratory capacity of breast cancer cells, as well as the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells from the mammary fat pad to distant lymph nodes in a mouse xenograft model. We therefore set out to test whether MLK3 plays a role in brain metastasis of breast cancer cells. To address this question, we used a novel, brain penetrant, MLK3 inhibitor, URMC099. URMC099 efficiently inhibited the migration of breast cancer cells in an in vitro cell monolayer wounding assay, and an in vitro transwell migration assay, but had no effect on in vitro cell growth. We also tested the effect of URMC099 on tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer brain metastasis. This analysis showed that URMC099 had no effect on the either the frequency or size of breast cancer brain metastases. We conclude that pharmacologic inhibition of MLK3 by URMC099 can reduce the in vitro migratory capacity of breast cancer cells, but that it has no effect on either the frequency or size of breast cancer brain metastases, in a mouse xenograft model."
https://openalex.org/W2099917868,"New-hoof growth is regarded as the most reliable metric for predicting age of newborn ungulates, but variation in estimated age among hoof-growth equations that have been developed may affect estimates of survival in staggered-entry models. We used known-age newborns to evaluate variation in age estimates among existing hoof-growth equations and to determine the consequences of that variation on survival estimates. During 2001–2009, we captured and radiocollared 174 newborn (≤24-hrs old) ungulates: 76 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Minnesota and South Dakota, 61 mule deer (O. hemionus) in California, and 37 pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in South Dakota. Estimated age of known-age newborns differed among hoof-growth models and varied by >15 days for white-tailed deer, >20 days for mule deer, and >10 days for pronghorn. Accuracy (i.e., the proportion of neonates assigned to the correct age) in aging newborns using published equations ranged from 0.0% to 39.4% in white-tailed deer, 0.0% to 3.3% in mule deer, and was 0.0% for pronghorns. Results of survival modeling indicated that variability in estimates of age-at-capture affected short-term estimates of survival (i.e., 30 days) for white-tailed deer and mule deer, and survival estimates over a longer time frame (i.e., 120 days) for mule deer. Conversely, survival estimates for pronghorn were not affected by estimates of age. Our analyses indicate that modeling survival in daily intervals is too fine a temporal scale when age-at-capture is unknown given the potential inaccuracies among equations used to estimate age of neonates. Instead, weekly survival intervals are more appropriate because most models accurately predicted ages within 1 week of the known age. Variation among results of neonatal-age models on short- and long-term estimates of survival for known-age young emphasizes the importance of selecting an appropriate hoof-growth equation and appropriately defining intervals (i.e., weekly versus daily) for estimating survival."
https://openalex.org/W2046695824,"This paper investigates the effect of thermal radiation on unsteady convection flow and heat transfer over a vertical permeable stretching surface in porous medium, where the effects of temperature dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity are also considered. By using a similarity transformation, the governing time-dependent boundary layer equations for momentum and thermal energy are first transformed into coupled, non-linear ordinary differential equations with variable coefficients. Numerical solutions to these equations subject to appropriate boundary conditions are obtained by the numerical shooting technique with fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta scheme. Numerical results show that as viscosity variation parameter increases both the absolute value of the surface friction coefficient and the absolute value of the surface temperature gradient increase whereas the temperature decreases slightly. With the increase of viscosity variation parameter, the velocity decreases near the sheet surface but increases far away from the surface of the sheet in the boundary layer. The increase in permeability parameter leads to the decrease in both the temperature and the absolute value of the surface friction coefficient, and the increase in both the velocity and the absolute value of the surface temperature gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2070321379,"Genome-wide participation and importance of the histone chaperone Asf1 (Anti-Silencing Function 1) in diverse DNA transactions like replication, repair, heterochromatic silencing and transcription are well documented. Yet its genome-wide targets have not been reported. Using ChIP-seq method, we found that yeast Asf1 associates with 590 unique targets including centromeres, telomeres and condensin-binding sites. It is found selectively on highly transcribed regions, which include replication fork pause sites. Asf1 preferentially associates with the genes transcribed by RNA polymerase (pol) III where its presence affects RNA production and replication-independent histone exchange. On pol II-transcribed genes, a negative correlation is found between Asf1 and nucleosome occupancy. It is not enriched on most of the reported sites of histone exchange or on the genes, which are misregulated in the asf1Δ cells. Interestingly, chromosome-wide distributions of Asf1 and one of the condensin subunits, Brn1 show a nearly identical pattern. Moreover, Brn1 shows reduced occupancy at various condensin-binding sites in asf1Δ cells. These results along with high association of Asf1 with heterochromatic centromeres and telomeres ascribe novel roles to Asf1 in condensin loading and chromatin dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2012311550,"Telomere dysfunction promotes genomic instability and carcinogenesis via inappropriate end-to-end chromosomal rearrangements, or telomere fusions. Previous work indicates that the DNA Damage Response (DDR) factor 53BP1 promotes the fusion of telomeres rendered dysfunctional by loss of TRF2, but is dispensable for the fusion of telomeres lacking Pot1 or critically shortened (in telomerase-deficient mice). Here, we examine a role for 53BP1 at telomeres rendered dysfunctional by loss or catalytic inhibition of DNA-PKcs. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking 53BP1 and/or DNA-PKcs, we show that 53BP1 deficiency suppresses G1-generated telomere fusions that normally accumulate in DNA-PKcs-deficient fibroblasts with passage. Likewise, we find that 53BP1 promotes telomere fusions during the replicative phases of the cell cycle in cells treated with the specific DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7026. However, telomere fusions are not fully abrogated in DNA-PKcs-inhibited 53BP1-deficient cells, but occur with a frequency approximately 10-fold lower than in control 53BP1-proficient cells. Treatment with PARP inhibitors or PARP1 depletion abrogates residual fusions, while Ligase IV depletion has no measurable effect, suggesting that PARP1-dependent alternative end-joining operates at low efficiency at 53BP1-deficient, DNA-PKcs-inhibited telomeres. Finally, we have also examined the requirement for DDR factors ATM, MDC1 or H2AX in this context. We find that ATM loss or inhibition has no measurable effect on the frequency of NU7026-induced fusions in wild-type MEFs. Moreover, analysis of MEFs lacking both ATM and 53BP1 indicates that ATM is also dispensable for telomere fusions via PARP-dependent end-joining. In contrast, loss of either MDC1 or H2AX abrogates telomere fusions in response to DNA-PKcs inhibition, suggesting that these factors operate upstream of both 53BP1-dependent and -independent telomere rejoining. Together, these experiments define a novel requirement for 53BP1 in the fusions of DNA-PKcs-deficient telomeres throughout the cell cycle and uncover a Ligase IV-independent, PARP1-dependent pathway that fuses telomeres at reduced efficiency in the absence of 53BP1."
https://openalex.org/W2020303481,"Experimental studies suggested that statins attenuate vascular AT1 receptor responsiveness. Moreover, the augmented excessive pressor response to systemic angiotensin II infusions in hypercholesterolemic patients was normalized with statin treatment. In 12 hypercholesterolemic patients, we tested the hypothesis that statin treatment attenuates angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction in hand veins assessed by a linear variable differential transducer. Subjects ingested daily doses of either atorvastatin (40 mg) or positive control irbesartan (150 mg) for 30 days in a randomized and cross-over fashion. Ang II-induced venoconstriction at minute 4 averaged 59%±10% before and 28%±9% after irbesartan (mean ± SEM; P<0.05) compared to 65%±11% before and 73%±11% after 30 days of atorvastatin treatment. Plasma angiotensin levels increased significantly after irbesartan treatment (Ang II: 17±22 before vs 52±40 pg/mL after [p = 0.048]; Ang-(1-7): 18±10 before vs 37±14 pg/mL after [p = 0.002]) compared to atorvastatin treatment (Ang II: 9±4 vs 11±10 pg/mL [p = 0.40]; Ang-(1-7): 24±9 vs 32±8 pg/mL [p = 0.023]). Our study suggests that statin treatment does not elicit major changes in angiotensin II-mediated venoconstriction or in circulating angiotensin II levels whereas angiotensin-(1-7) levels increased modestly. The discrepancy between local vascular and systemic angiotensin II responses might suggest that statin treatment interferes with blood pressure buffering reflexes.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00154024."
https://openalex.org/W2067502052,"Background Needle-free delivery improves the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines but is also associated with more local reactogenicity. Here we report the first comparison of Biojector and needle administration of a candidate rAd5 HIV vaccine. Methods Thirty-one adults, 18–55 years, 20 naive and 11 prior rAd5 vaccine recipients were randomized to receive single rAd5 vaccine via needle or Biojector IM injection at 1010 PU in a Phase I open label clinical trial. Solicited reactogenicity was collected for 5 days; clinical safety and immunogenicity follow-up was continued for 24 weeks. Results Overall, injections by either method were well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events. Frequency of any local reactogenicity was 16/16 (100%) for Biojector compared to 11/15 (73%) for needle injections. There was no difference in HIV Env-specific antibody response between Biojector and needle delivery. Env-specific antibody responses were more than 10-fold higher in subjects receiving a booster dose of rAd5 vaccine than after a single dose delivered by either method regardless of interval between prime and boost. Conclusions Biojector delivery did not improve antibody responses to the rAd5 vaccine compared to needle administration. Homologous boosting with rAd5 gene-based vectors can boost insert-specific antibody responses despite pre-existing vector-specific immunity.

https://openalex.org/W2006576044,"Background The therapeutic effect of lymph node dissection for pancreas invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) remains unclear. The study investigated whether cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) rates among invasive IPMN patients improve when more lymph nodes are harvested during surgery. Study Design The study cohort was retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The lymph node count was categorized into quartiles. The relationship between lymph node count and survival was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier curves and a Cox proportional-hazards model. The stage migration was assessed by Chi-square tests. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to minimize confounding variables between groups. Results In total, 1,080 patients with resected invasive IPMNs from 1992 to 2011 were included. Univariate and multivariate Cox models indicated that an increased lymph node count independently improves survival. The Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests identified 16 nodes as an optimal cut-off value that yielded a significant survival benefit for all invasive IPMN patients. The stage migration effect existed in this cohort. After PSM, the 5-year CSS increased from 36% to 47%, and the median survival rate increased from 30 months to 40 months by increasing the lymph node count to over 16, alone. The 5-year OS rate also provided additional support for this result. Conclusion Increased lymph node counts were associated with improved survival in invasive IPMN patients. One cut-off value of lymph node count was 16 for this improvement."
