https://openalex.org/W2016197401,"We have analyzed DNA modification in the human gamma delta beta-globin gene region at 17 cleavage sites of restriction endonucleases which are unable to cleave DNA if 15-methylcytosine is present at certain positions in their respective cleavage sites. Using this criterion, all sites tested in the globin gene region are fully modified in the germ line (sperm) DNA. In somatic tissues, however, methyl groups are absent at specific sites in the globin gene region. In tissues not expressing the genes, these losses range from one of these cleavage sites in lymphocyte DNA to essentially all of these sites in the entire region in placental DNA. In the DNA of tissues expressing the globin genes, the region surrounding and including the genes expressed shows a low level of modification, whereas the neighboring DNA regions have a high level of modification. The data suggest that a low level of DNA methylation may be a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for gene expression in higher eucaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2074909561,"Specific cholecystokinin binding sites in particulate fractions of rat brain were measured with iodine 125-labeled Bolton-Hunter cholecystokinin, a cholecystokinin analog that has full biological activity. Binding was detected in brain regions known to contain immunoreactive cholecystokinin. Binding was saturable, reversible, of high affinity (dissociation constant, 1.7 × 10-9M), and was inhibited by cholecystokinin analogs but not by unrelated hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1967452306,"Using electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, we have investigated the intracellular location of the src protein (p21) in cells transformed by the Harvey strain of Murine Sarcoma Virus (Ha-MSV). Antibodies to p21 were derived from tumor-bearing rats inoculated with Ha-NRK cells. The distribution of p21 in intracellular sites in MDCK dog cells transformed by Ha-MSV was examined and quantified using a recently developed immunocytochemical technique. More than 95% of p21 was localized to the inner surface of the plasma membrane in these Ha-MSV-transformed cells; p21 was not exposed on the outside surface of the plasma membrane. A similar location was observed by immunofluorescence in other Ha-MSV-transformed cell lines, including cells derived from rat, mouse and mink. This finding, and the previous demonstration that p60src of avian sarcoma virus is concentrated on the inner surface of the plasma membrane, suggests that the plasma membrane is a major site of action for transforming proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2053245866,"A synthetic peptide, representing a portion of the 16K (16,000 dalton)-fragment sequence within the pro-adrenocorticotropin/endorphin precursor molecule, potentiates the steroidogenic action of the 1 to 24 portion of adrenocorticotropin [ACTH(1-24)] on the rat adrenal cortex. The peptide has 27 amino acid residues and consists of gamma-melanotropin with a carboxyl terminal extension. It affects both the inner and outer adrenocortical zones of hypophysectomized animals, as evidenced by a synergistic augmentation of corticosterone and aldosterone production, respectively. The peptide can be distinguished from adrenocorticotropin by its activation of cholesterol ester hydrolase and its failure to stimulate cholesterol side-chain cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1988511469,"Site-specific inversion of a controlling element is responsible for flagellar phase transition in Salmonella. When a 900 bp DNA sequence is in one configuration, it allows the expression of the H2 gene, a structural gene which codes for the flagellar antigen. When it is in the opposite configuration, the H2 gene is not expressed. A hybrid λ phage containing the invertible control region and the adjacent H2 gene was constructed, and expression of the H2 gene was shown to be regulated by the orientation of the inversion region. Transposon Tn5 insertion derivatives of this hybrid phage were isolated and λH2::Tn5 mutants defective for inversion (H2 switching) were selected and characterized. Two classes of switching phenotypes were observed among the mutants—those which had slightly reduced frequencies of transition from expression of the H2 gene (H2 on) to nonexpression (H2 off) (intermediate class) and those in which the frequency of transition was reduced at least three orders of magnitude (null class). Physical mapping of the Tn5 insertion sites revealed that in all mutants the insertion was located inside the inversion region. Tn5 insertion sites in the null class of mutants defined a region of DNA including approximately 500 bp which was necessary for inversion. Genetic complementation tests showed that these λH2::Tn5 mutants could invert the H2 gene control element if the 500 bp region was introduced in the trans configuration. It is concluded that a gene is located inside the inversion segment and codes for a protein which is required for the inversion event. Furthermore, the two sites at which the crossover event occurred functioned in a cis configuration and were required for inversion. The presence of a gene which is involved in controlling site-specific recombination events may be a general feature of transposon-like elements."
https://openalex.org/W2019807322,"Site-specific integrative recombination of bacteriophage λ involves unequal partners. The minimal phage att site is composed of approximately 240-base pairs and four distinct binding sites for Int protein, at least three of which are crucial for function. This ‘donor site’ recombines efficiently with a smalle ‘recipient site’ that lacks the extensive interactions with Int protein."
https://openalex.org/W2015572255,"beta-Receptors were identified in rat brain by a light microscopic autoradiographic technique. The procedure involved binding 3H-labeled dihydroalprenolol to beta-receptors in intact slide-mounted tissue sections and generating autoradiograms by the apposition of emulsion-coated cover slips, Biochemical analysis of the binding indicated that these conditions provided a high degree of selective labeling of beta-receptors. High densities of receptors were found in superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, throughout the caudate-putamen, in the periventricular nucleus of the thalamus, in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, and in other areas. These results are in agreement with other electrophysiological and histochemical data. This radiohistochemical approach should be an important addition to other methods for mapping functional catecholamine neuronal pathways and sites of hormonal action."

https://openalex.org/W1986583118,"Addition of serum to resting cultures of Swiss mouse 3T3 cells causes an immediate multiple phosphorylation of 40S ribosomal protein S6. After 60 min of stimulation, changing to medium containing no serum led to the net dephosphorylation of S6. During this same period, a second protein, as yet unidentified, became increasingly phosphorylated. Incubation of cells with cycloheximide prior to the addition of serum almost completely blocked the activation of protein synthesis. There was no effect on the serum-induced phosphorylation of S6. If cells were stimulated in the presence of cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors theophylline or SQ 20006, both S6 phosphorylation and the activation of protein synthesis were inhibited. Stimulation of cells with serum also led to an immediate drop in total intracellular cAMP levels. This was blocked by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), which caused a 10 fold increase in total intracellular cyclic AMP. However, PGE1 had no effect on protein synthesis or S6 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1996131391,"Revertants of dedifferentiated variants of Reuber H35 rat hepatoma cells can be readily detected, for they acquire the ability to proliferate in G− (glucose-free) medium owing to the production of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and fructose diphosphatase, two liver-specific enzymes required for the gluconeogenic pathway. We have tried to obtain both spontaneous and mutagen-induced revertants of two independent variant lines of hepatoma cells, H5 and Faofl, both characterized by the absence of expression of all or most of the seven liver-specific functions analyzed. No spontaneous or mutagen-induced revertant of 1s or 2s H5 cells has been obtained among a total of 3.3 × 109 cells challenged with G− medium; we conclude that multiple and/or irreversible changes underlie the dedifferentiation of H5 cells. Three out of five subclones of Faofl cells gave rise to revertants, at frequencies of 1–7 × 10−8. FaoflC2 cells were treated with EMS, X-rays or ICR-191G; the numbers of revertants in the treated populations were not above background. All the Faofl revertants are of one phenotypic class: they express not only the two gluconeogenic enzymes necessary for survival in G− medium but also all of the other liver functions examined. We conclude that reversion of Faofl cells involves modification in activity of genes responsible for regulation of the entire group of liver functions, and that this change is not provoked by mutagens."

https://openalex.org/W1595874787,"Membranes prepared from the adrenal gland of mice and rats possess high affinity binding sites that recognize 125I-labeled human low density lipoprotein (LDL). These binding sites resemble the functional LDL receptors that mediate the uptake of LDL by cultured mouse and bovine adrenal cells. The number of LDL binding sites per mg of membrane protein increased 2- to 5-fold over 24 h when mice or rats were treated with adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). In rats, this increase was accompanied by a similar ACTH-induced increase in the adrenal uptake of intravenously administered 125I-LDL, suggesting that the LDL binding sites mediate the uptake of LDL by the adrenal in the intact animal. The number of LDL binding sites on adrenal membranes rose by 5-fold when animals were rendered lipoprotein-deficient, either by treatment of mice with 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine or by treatment of rats with 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol. This increase was prevented when endogenous ACTH secretion was blocked by administration of dexamethasone, suggesting that ACTH was required. The current experiments suggest that LDL receptors provide one source of cholesterol for the mouse and rat adrenal in vivo and that the number of LDL receptors of this organ is regulated by ACTH."
https://openalex.org/W1551841702,"Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) forms a 1:1 complex with globular actin (G-actin) and also will depolymerize filamentous actin (F-actin) to form a 1:1 complex. The effect of DNase I on the exchange of the actin nucleotide has been investigated. When DNase I is added to G-actin, the rate of nucleotide exchange is decreased from 1.16 +/- 0.25 X 10(-4) s-1 to 0.28 +/- 0.09 X 10(-4) s-1 (0 degrees C). The presence of ATP or ADP in the actin has little effect on the rate of exchange of the nucleotide for ATP. This suggests that the weaker affinity of ADP than ATP for actin is due to a slower association rate of ADP. The rate of the nucleotide exchange in the actinDNase I complex is increased by the addition of NaCl or MgCl2. When DNase I is added to F-actin, the rate of nucleotide exchange (6.2 +/- 1.6 X 10(-4) x-1, 0 degrees C) is similar to the rate of depolymerization as measured by loss of viscosity. The actinDNase I complex formed by depolymerization of F-actin exchanges nucleotide at a 4-fold faster rate than the G-actinDNase I complex in the same ionic conditions. This and other experiments suggest that DNase I binds first to F-actin before dissociating the monomer from the filament. These results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of action depolymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1988099503,"Batrachotoxin is present in remarkably high amounts in the skin of Phyllobates terribilis. Levels of batrachotoxin tend to be reduced when P. terribilis is maintained in captivity, but even after being confined for up to 6 years, these frogs were still at least five times more toxic than other Phyllobates species used by natives for poisoning blowgun darts. Batrachotoxin was not detectable in F1 progeny reared to maturity in captivity. Nerve and muscle preparations from wild-caught frogs and from the nontoxic F1 frogs were both insensitive to batrachotoxin. The regulatory site controlling sodium-channel activation and permeability appears to have been minimally altered to prevent interaction with batrachotoxin, but is still sensitive to other sodium conductance activators (veratridine, grayanotoxin) to which the frogs arenot exposed naturally."

https://openalex.org/W2082040194,"Abstract In Drosophila several transposing elements that contain the white locus are known. Transpositions of one such element, which carries both the white-apricot ( w a ) and the neighboring roughest ( rst + ) genes, have been isolated at more than 120 sites scattered over the entire genome (Ising and Ramel 1976). We have isolated a recombinant plasmid (61F4) containing sequences that appear to be present on this transposing element ( TE ). In nontransposed stocks, 61F4 hybridizes to approximately 40 sites in the polytene chromosomes including the nucleolus, the chromocenter and chromosome section 3C (that is, the white-apricot roughest region). In six different tranpositions tested, the genetic map position of the TE corresponds to one site of in situ hybridization of 61F4, indicating that the TE contains homologous sequences. The sites of in situ hybridization correlate with the w a allele or alleles derived from w a but not with w + and other w alleles tested, nor with an X-ray-induced revertant of w a . Thus w a strains appear to carry additional DNA sequences homologous to 61F4, close to or within the w gene. The recombinant plasmid 61F4 carries 7.3 kb of Drosophila DNA inserted into pSF2124. It contains a segment homologous to a member of the copia gene family (Finnegan et al. 1978). Since copia appears to be a highly mobile element (Strobel, Dunsmuir and Rubin 1979), the association of copia sequences with the w a - rst + transposing element suggests that copia sequences may be responsible for the transposition of this element."
https://openalex.org/W2094429192,DNA containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene was used to transform wild-type tk+ mouse L cells to a tk++ status in vitro using methotrexate as a selective agent. HSVtk DNA was also used to transform mouse bone marrow cells in vitro. Transformed marrow cells injected into irradiated and methotrexate-treated recipient mice gave rise to proliferating cells which in some cases dominated the marrow population and which contained HSVtk gene sequences.

https://openalex.org/W1568510014,Large simian virus 40 tumor antigen was bound as immune complex to protein A-Sepharose and then subjected to limited proteolysis which yielded several discrete fragments. Primary structures near the cleavage sites were determined by radiosequencing techniques. Experimental data for five fragments matched an amino acid sequence predicted from a nucleotide sequence at 0.51 map unit of the viral genome. We have thus identified the reading frame of translation beyond the intervening sequence at 0.60 to 0.53 map units. A cleavage map of tumor antigen was established on the basis of the sequence data and of the apparent molecular weights of the fragments. The bond most susceptible to cleavage by trypsin was between arginine-130 and lysine-131 in a cluster of five basis amino acids. Other cleavage sites were located in the COOH-terminal half of tumor antigen. Each fragment was analyzed by complete tryptic proteolysis and peptide mapping on an ion exchange column. Peaks occurring in the peptide map of large tumor antigen could thus be assigned to different segments of the protein. Two specific regions of tumor antigen were shown to be phosphorylated.
https://openalex.org/W2024557136,"Cupric ion, a thiol oxidant, caused naloxone-reversible analgesia when injected intracerebroventricularly in mice; its potency was close to that of morphine. Dithiothreitol, a thiol reductant, reversed the analgesia induced by cupric ion and antagonized analgesia induced by morphine. Oxidized dithiothreitol had no effect. These findings, together with evidence for redox modification of opiate receptor binding in vitro, suggest that a mechanism of oxidation-reduction of thiols may modulate opiate receptor function."

The K+/O2 stoichiometries of 11.8 ± 0.2 and 8.4 ± 0.6 were obtained for reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide- and flavoprotein-linked substrates, respectively. These values complement classical K+ to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and ATP/O2 stoichiometries, thereby demonstrating a remarkably efficient coupling between the processes of Na+- and K+-dependent adenosinetriphosphatase-mediated ion transport and oxidative phosphorylation within the intact cell."

https://openalex.org/W2089133541,"Abstract Cloned infectious vesicular stomatitis virus isolated following 5 years of persistent infection of BHK21 cells in vitro exhibits a number of peptide map changes in the G protein (spike glycoprotein), the M protein (membrane matrix protein) and the N protein (nucleocapsid structural protein). Only slight alterations have occurred in the peptide maps of the two VSV polymerase-associated proteins L and NS. Dideoxy sequencing of the 3′ ends of the cloned virus originally used to establish the persistent infection, and of the cloned virus recovered following 5 years of persistence, shows one base substitution in the three base junction between the 3′ leader sequence and the N protein-coding region. Repeated lytic passages of virus recovered from persistent infection led to no oligonucleotide map changes after 30 passages, but two map changes were present after 102 and remained after 133 lytic passages in BHK21 cells in vitro. Only one of these represented reversion to the original map position, and this mutant virus still exhibited a temperature-sensitive small plaque phenotype. Finally, the mutated virus recovered after more than 512 years of persistent infection is now so slow-growing that it can establish persistent infection of BHK21 cells in the absence of DI particles (although DI particles are present constantly once the cells recover from the initial cytopathology)."
https://openalex.org/W2005679493,"Abstract Subgenomic fragments of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) DNA, generated by Eco RI digestion of DNA of RSV-infected chicken cells, induced transformation of NIH/3T3 mouse cells with efficiencies that were 100–1000 fold lower than the efficiency of transformation by intact RSV DNA. Analysis of the DNAs of NIH cells transformed by Eco RI-digested RSV DNA indicated that these cells contained no more than 2 × 10 6 daltons of RSV DNA, and did not contain sequences from the 5′ terminus of RSV RNA which are included in the leader sequence of subgenomic src mRNA of RSV-infected cells. The product of the RSV src gene (pp60 src ), however, was produced in apparently similar quantities by NIH cells transformed by Eco RI fragments of RSV DNA and by intact RSV DNA. Thus expression of the src gene of RSV in NIH cells transformed by subgenomic fragments of RSV DNA did not require the terminal sequences of the RSV genome, which appear to be involved in synthesis and processing of src mRNA in RSV-infected cells. DNAs of NIH cells transformed by Eco RI-digested RSV DNA were found to induce transformation in secondary transfection assays with efficiencies that were similar to the efficiency of transformation by intact RSV DNA. These results suggest that transformation by subgenomic fragments of RSV DNA may be a consequence of integration of src gene-containing DNA fragments in the vicinity of a promoter site in the recipient cell genome, leading to efficient expression of the RSV src gene."
https://openalex.org/W1524593404,"A transient dichroism is detected after photolysis by a linearly polarized laser flash of the cytochrome oxidaseCO complex in bovine heart mitochondria, rat heart mitochondria, and bovine heart submitochondrial particles. A decay in the absorption anisotropy is characterized by a time constant of about 300 to 400 mus in both mitochondria and submitochondrial particles. Since vesicle tumbling in the time range less than 5 ms can be excluded in these experiments, we conclude that cytochrome oxidase rotates in the mitochondrial membrane with a relaxation time of several hundred microseconds. However, it is likely that only about one-half of cytochrome oxidase contributes to the observed decay, the remainder being relatively immobile."

https://openalex.org/W2416887171,"Herpes simplex virus type 2-transformed tumorigenic rat embryo fibroblasts contain less polyunsaturated fatty acids in all phosphoglyceride classes than do their diploid precursor fibroblasts. This change was most pronounced in the phosphatidylcholine fraction and less apparent in the phosphatidylethanolamine fraction. Both the diploid cells and tumor cells were capable of elongating and desaturating radiolabeled palmitate (16:0), oleate (18:1), and linoleate (18:2). Through these studies, both cell types were shown to have A5, A‘, and A’ acyl coenzyme A desaturase systems. However, the tumor cells synthesized and incorporated more of the products of 16:O metabolism than did the diploid fibroblasts, which synthesized and incorporated more of the products of 18:2 metabolism than did the tumor cells. The diploid fibroblasts incorporated 20:4 predominately into phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, the transformed cells incorporated 20:4 mainly into phosphatidylethanolamine and a reduced amount into phosphatidylcholine. Quantitation of the fatty acid pools in the culture medium before and after growth demonstrated that the cells obtain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as 20:4, directly from the culture medium as well as from 18:2 metabolism. Free arachidonic acid was depleted from the culture medium and incorporated into cellular phosphoglycerides and neutral glycerides. Although both cell types had the capacity for synthesis of polyunsaturates, the tumor cells synthesized less polyunsaturates of the linoleate series than did the diploid fibroblasts. The data also indicated the regulation of polyunsaturate incorporation into glycerides of transformed cells was different from that of nontransformed cells and that it was these differences in fatty acid and phosphoglyceride metabolism that gave rise to the abnormal composition of the tumor cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1565594811,"Two human breast cancer cell lines (T-47D and MCF-7) and one cell line derived from normal human milk (HBL-100) not only specifically bound but also degraded prolactin. Quantitative differences in the ability to bind and degrade prolactin among the cell lines exist, although there was a good correlation between the number of prolactin receptor sites and prolactin degradative activity. Iodo-prolactin as well as native prolactin were degraded. The prolactin molecule was processed to yield at least three small molecular weight peptides which were released into the incubation medium. These peptides neither bound to fresh receptors nor to anti-prolactin antibodies. The protease inhibitor N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine and ammonium chloride, and metabolic inhibitors 2,4-dinitrophenol and sodium azide, all abolished prolactin degradation by the breast cancer cells. When prolactin degradation was inhibited, specific binding and the subsequent release of intact 125I-prolactin was still observable, suggesting that hormonal degradation was not a prerequisite to dissociation of prolactin. However, prolactin degradation did account for the accelerated rate of dissociation of prolactin. Studies utilizing inhibitors suggest that the receptor-bound 125I-prolactin was degraded by an energy-dependent internalization process such as pinocytosis; lysosomal enzymes are probably involved in the degradation of prolactin by human breast cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W1505695228,"Abstract The interaction of vanadate with the (Na+ + K+)-stimulated ATPase from electric organ was investigated using the acid quench-flow technique. At 21 degrees C, incubation of the enzyme with 1.3 to 1.6 muM vanadate in the presence of 75 mM Na+ and 25 mM K+ strongly inhibits phosphorylation by ATP. Enzyme activity remaining under these conditions shows no change in the apparent rates of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, although effects were noted which suggest that vanadate increases the reverse rate of dephosphorylation. Ten micromolar vanadate, sufficient to inhibit the (Na+ + K+)-stimulated ATPase by more than 98%, has no effect on phosphorylation in the presence of Na+ alone. Phosphoenzyme formed in the presence of Na+ and K+ consists of rapidly and slowly decaying components which differ in sensitivity to vanadate. Up to 2 muM vanadate suppresses predominantly the rapidly decaying phosphoenzyme, while at higher concentrations vanadate inhibits both the rate and level of formation of the slowly decaying phosphoenzyme. These results indicate that vanadate is a useful reagent for distinguishing between these two phosphorylation reactions."
