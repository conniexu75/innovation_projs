https://openalex.org/W1494075612,"The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is an important model system for identifying genes and determining their functions. Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans— the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2010055427,Vision is believed to dominate our multisensory perception of the world. Here we overturn this established view by showing that auditory information can qualitatively alter the perception of an unambiguous visual stimulus to create a striking visual illusion. Our findings indicate that visual perception can be manipulated by other sensory modalities.

This work identifies a high-affinity transport protein mediating the uptake of bilirubin and its conjugates into human hepatocytes. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) permanently expressing the recombinant organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2 (human OATP2, also known as LST-1 or OATP-C; symbol SLC21A6) showed uptake of [3H]monoglucuronosyl bilirubin, [3H]bisglucuronosyl bilirubin, and [3H]sulfobromophthalein withKm values of 0.10, 0.28, and 0.14 μm, respectively. High-affinity uptake of unconjugated [3H]bilirubin by OATP2 occurred in the presence of albumin and was not mediated by another basolateral hepatic uptake transporter, human OATP8 (symbol SLC21A8). OATP2 and OATP8 differed by their capacity to extract substrates from albumin before transport. In comparison to the high-affinity transport by OATP2, OATP8 transported [3H]sulfobromophthalein and [3H]monoglucuronosyl bilirubin with lower affinity, withKm values of 3.3 and 0.5 μm, respectively. The organic anion indocyanine green potently inhibited transport mediated by OATP2, with a Ki value of 112 nm, but did not inhibit transport mediated by OATP8. Human OATP2 may play a key role in the prevention of hyperbilirubinemia by facilitating the selective entry of unconjugated bilirubin and its glucuronate conjugates into human hepatocytes.

For human OATP1 (SLC21A3), which is expressed at high levels in brain and kidney and at a low level in human liver, kinetic studies revealed only a moderate affinity for BSP with a Km value of 20 μm (15Kullak-Ublick G.A.

The availability of cell lines stably expressing human OATP2 and OATP8 enabled us to answer the question of whether these two major human hepatic OATP family members are capable of transporting bilirubin and its conjugates from blood across the basolateral membrane into hepatocytes.DISCUSSIONWe conclude that uptake of bilirubin into human hepatocytes, the first step of its detoxification, is mediated by OATP2, a major transport protein localized to the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, but not by the isoform OATP8 localized to the same membrane domain. Our conclusion is based on the following experimental data: (a) the structurally and chemically related lipophilic anionic compounds BSP, monoglucuronosyl bilirubin, and bisglucuronosyl bilirubin were high-affinity substrates for OATP2, with nanomolarKm values, whereas OATP8 transported BSP and monoglucuronosyl bilirubin with markedly lower affinity (Fig. 1 and Table I); (b) OATP2, but not OATP8, was able to extract substrates from albumin (Fig. 2) to which bilirubin binds with high affinity; (c) ICG inhibited OATP2 at nanomolar concentrations but exerted no inhibitory effect on OATP8 at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig. 3); and (d) [3H]bilirubin uptake by OATP2 was directly demonstrated by uptake studies with OATP2-expressing HEK transfectants (Fig. 4). Together with previous data, we propose the following scheme for the detoxification and elimination pathway of bilirubin in human liver (Fig. 5): bilirubin (B) bound to albumin is taken up across the basolateral membrane by OATP2 and conjugated in the hepatocyte by the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A (UGT1A1), resulting in monoglucuronosyl bilirubin and bisglucuronosyl bilirubin. Bilirubin glucuronides are finally excreted into bile by the apical conjugate export pump multidrug resistance protein 2 localized to the hepatocyte canalicular (apical) membrane (6Kamisako T.

However, we do not exclude additional bilirubin uptake through passive diffusion. The differentiation between carrier-mediated and diffusional bilirubin uptake into the liver will be supported by the identification of mutations in the OATP2 (SLC21A6) gene leading to the loss or functional impairment of OATP2 in the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes. Moreover, in view of the fact that current knowledge of the human OATP family is not complete, additional transport proteins may further contribute to the selective uptake of bilirubin from the blood circulation into liver.

However, inactivation of a fully functional receptor by heterodimerization has not been documented. Here we show that the somatostatin receptor (sst) subtypes sst2A and sst3 exist as homodimers at the plasma membrane when expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Moreover, in coimmunoprecipitation studies using differentially epitope-tagged receptors, we provide direct evidence for heterodimerization of sst2A and sst3. The sst2A-sst3 heterodimer exhibited high affinity binding to somatostatin-14 and the sst2-selective ligand L-779,976 but not to the sst3-selective ligand L-796,778. Like the sst2A homodimer, the sst2A-sst3 heterodimer stimulated guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases after exposure to the sst2-selective ligand L-779,976. However, unlike the sst3 homodimer, the sst2A-sst3 heterodimer did not promote GTPγS binding, adenylyl cyclase inhibition, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in the presence of the sst3-selective ligand L-796,778. Interestingly, during prolonged somatostatin-14 exposure, the sst2A-sst3 heterodimer desensitized at a slower rate than the sst2A and sst3 homodimers. Both sst2A and sst3 homodimers underwent agonist-induced endocytosis in the presence of somatostatin-14. In contrast, the sst2A-sst3 heterodimer separated at the plasma membrane, and only sst2A but not sst3 underwent agonist-induced endocytosis after exposure to somatostatin-14. Together, heterodimerization of sst2A and sst3results in a new receptor with a pharmacological and functional profile resembling that of the sst2A receptor, however with a greater resistance to agonist-induced desensitization. Thus, inactivation of sst3 receptor function by heterodimerization with sst2A or possibly other G protein-coupled receptors may explain some of the difficulties in detecting sst3-specific binding and signaling in mammalian tissues.

Although G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 generally were believed to act as monomeric entities, a growing body of evidence suggests that they may form functionally relevant dimers. The existence of homodimers has been shown for several GPCRs including the β2-adrenergic receptor (1Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

Varghese G. Zeman P.R. Seeman P. Ng G.Y. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 30244-30248Google Scholar). GPCRs seem to dimerize via different mechanisms. Whereas dimerization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (1Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 16384-16392Google Scholar) and D2 dopamine receptor (8Ng G.Y. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Chung H.T. Brann M.R. Seeman P. George S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1996; 227: 200-204Google Scholar) occurs via their transmembrane regions, dimerization of the δ-opioid receptor involves the carboxyl terminus (2Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 26959-26964Google Scholar). In contrast, the metabotrobic glutamate receptor 5 (4Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 28612-28616Google Scholar) and the calcium-sensing receptor (5Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 23605-23610Google Scholar, 9Pace A.J. Gama L.

Chem... 1998; 273: 14476-14483Google Scholar) appear to be disulfide-linked dimers, and dimerization occurs via their large amino termini. The question of to what extent agonist binding affects dimerization remains controversial. Recent evidence obtained in living cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer suggests that the β2-adrenergic receptor exists at the cell surface as a constitutive dimer that is stabilized by agonist binding (11Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar). In contrast, agonist stimulation reduced the level of δ-opioid receptor dimers suggesting that monomerization precedes agonist-induced internalization of this receptor (2Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 26959-26964Google Scholar). Biochemical and functional studies suggest that GPCRs can also assemble as heterodimers with enhanced functional activity (3Jordan B.A. Devi L.A.

Formation of heterodimers between two nonfunctional γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, GABABR1 and GABABR2, was necessary for a fully functional GABAB receptor (14Jones K.A. Borowsky B. Tamm J.A.

Sci... 1999; 20: 396-399Google Scholar). δ- and κ-Opioid receptors form heterodimers with ligand binding and signaling properties resembling that of the κ2 receptor (3Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature.. 1999; 399: 697-700Google Scholar). Finally, the somatostatin receptor (sst) sst5 and the D2 dopamine receptor heterodimerize to form a new receptor with enhanced activity (20Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Patel S.C. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. Science.. 2000; 288: 154-157Google Scholar). The neuropeptide somatostatin (SS-14) is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system and periphery. SS-14 is involved in multiple functions including endocrine and exocrine hormone release, cognition, sleep, and motor activity. In addition, peptide derivatives of somatostatin have successfully been used in the treatment of neuroendocrine malignancies. The actions of SS-14 are mediated via five distinct somatostatin receptor subtypes, termed sst1–sst5, which belong to the superfamily of GPCRs. All somatostatin receptors bind SS-14 with high affinity and inhibit adenylyl cyclase. There is also evidence for different, although not mutually exclusive, pathways of intracellular signaling of somatostatin receptor subtypes, e.g. activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) via sst1, sst3, and sst4; activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatases via sst1, sst2, and sst3; activation of phospholipase A2 via sst4; and modulation of K+ channels via sst2 (21Meyerhof W. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol... 1998; 133: 55-108Google Scholar,22Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol... 1999; 20: 157-198Google Scholar). Individual target cells often express more than one somatostatin receptor, raising the possibility that the functional diversity of these receptors could be expanded by heterodimerization among somatostatin receptor subtypes. Recently, Rocheville et al. (23Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Sasi R. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 7862-7869Google Scholar) provided evidence, based on photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer, for homodimerization of the sst5 somatostatin receptor. The sst5 receptor also appears to form heterodimers with sst1 but not sst4. In this study, we have examined dimerization of sst2A and sst3somatostatin receptors. In coimmunoprecipitation studies using differentially epitope-tagged receptors, we show that sst2Aand sst3 associate as dimers, both as homodimers and heterodimers. sst2A-sst3 heterodimerization resulted in a new receptor with enhanced sst2A-like and diminished sst3-like activity. The sst2-selective ligand L-779,976 and the sst3-selective ligand L-796,778 were kindly provided by Dr. Susan Rohrer (24Rohrer S.P. Birzin E.T. Mosley R.T. Berk S.C. Hutchins S.M. Shen D.M. Xiong Y.

Science.. 1998; 282: 737-740Google Scholar) (Merck). The radioligand 3-[125I]iodotyrosyl-SS-14 (74 TBq/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [35S]GTPγS (46.25 TBq/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Mouse monoclonal anti-T7 tag antibody was obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI), and polyclonal rabbit anti-T7 and anti-c-Myc antibodies were obtained from Gramsch Laboratories (Schwabhausen, Germany). The rabbit anti-sst2Aantibody (6291) and the guinea pig anti-sst2A antibody (GP3) were generated to the peptide ETQRTLLNGDLQTSI, which corresponds to residues 355–369 of the carboxyl terminus of the rat/mouse/human sst2A and have been characterized extensively (25Schulz S. Schmidt H. Handel M. Schreff M. Hollt V. Neurosci. Lett... 1998; 257: 37-40Google Scholar, 26Schulz S. Schreff M. Schmidt H. Handel M. Przewlocki R. Hollt V. Eur. J. Neurosci... 1998; 10: 3700-3708Google Scholar). The anti-sst3 antibody (7986) was generated to the peptide TAGDKASTLSHL, which corresponds to residues 417–428 of the carboxyl terminus of the rat/mouse sst3 and has also been characterized previously (27Handel M. Schulz S. Stanarius A. Schreff M. Erdtmann-Vourliotis M. Schmidt H. Wolf G. Hollt V. Neuroscience.. 1999; 89: 909-926Google Scholar). All polyclonal rabbit antisera were affinity-purified against their immunizing peptides using the Sulfo-Link coupling gel (Pierce) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The wild-type rat sst2A and sst3 receptors were tagged at their amino termini either with the c-Myc epitope tag sequence MEEQKLISEEDLLR or the T7 epitope tag sequence MASMTGGQQMG using polymerase chain reaction. Two more amino acids, KL, were added representing aHindIII cloning site encoded by the nucleotide sequence AAGCTT. The resulting fragments were then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vectors containing either a neomycin or a hygromycin resistance (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The integrity of all constructs was verified by dideoxy sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. Cells were first transfected with plasmids containing the neomycin resistance using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Stable tranfectants were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). To generate lines coexpressing two differentially epitope-tagged receptors, cells were subjected to a second round of transfection using Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 and 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Three clones expressing sst2A alone, four clones expressing sst3 alone, and two clones coexpressing sst2Aand sst3 were generated. Receptor expression was monitored using saturation ligand binding assays as described below. TheBmax values of all selected clones were in the range of 800–1200 fmol/mg of protein, and KD values were in the range of 0.16–0.24 nm. In addition, quantitative Western blot analysis was carried out to ensure that clones coexpressing ∼1:1 ratio of sst2A and sst3 were selected and used throughout this study. Finally, double immunofluorescent staining was performed to validate that sst2A and sst3 were coexpressed within the same cells. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 150-mm dishes and grown to 80% confluence. When indicated, cells were exposed to agonist, treated with reducing agents, or incubated with cross-linking agents. Agonist exposure was performed with either SS-14, L-779,976, or L-796,778 at a concentration of 1 μm for 10, 30, or 60 min at 37 °C. Treatment with reducing agents was performed with 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubation with cross-linking agents was performed with either 2 mmbis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) or 5 mmdithiobis-(succinimidylpropionate) (both from Pierce) for 30 or 60 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) for 15 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and harvested into ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mmiodoacetamide, and the following proteinase inhibitors: 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml bacitracin). Iodoacetamide was included in each buffer used for protein preparation to prevent nonspecific disulfide linkages. Cells were swollen for 15 min on ice and homogenized. The homogenate was spun at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. Membranes were then pelleted at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and pelleted membranes were lysed in detergent buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 4 mg/ml β-dodecylmaltoside, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and proteinase inhibitors as above) for 1 h on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the resulting supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce); samples containing equal amounts of protein (300 μg) were then subjected to immunoprecipitation, or glycoproteins were purified using wheat germ lectin. For enrichment of glycoproteins, one ml of the supernatant was incubated with 100 μl wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 90 min at 4 °C with continuous agitation. Beads were washed five times with detergent buffer, and adsorbed glycoproteins were either subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation or directly eluted into 200 μl of SDS-sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) at 60 °C for 20 min. Deglycosylation experiments were performed using peptideN-glycosidase F according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were precleared with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) for 2 h. After immunoprecipitation with 10 μg of either mouse monoclonal anti-T7, affinity-purified rabbit anti-c-Myc, affinity-purified rabbit anti-sst2A (6291), or affinity-purified rabbit anti-sst3 (7986) antibodies, immunocomplexes were collected using 100 μl of protein A-agarose beads. Beads were washed five times with detergent buffer, and immunoprecipitates were eluted from the beads with 200 μl of SDS-sample buffer at 60 °C for 20 min. Equal amounts of protein of each sample were then loaded onto regular 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which contain 0.1% SDS. When indicated gels containing 2-fold (0.2%) or 4-fold (0.4%) higher SDS concentrations were run to test the sensitivity of dimers to stronger denaturing conditions. After electroblotting, membranes were incubated with either mouse monoclonal anti-T7, affinity-purified rabbit anti-c-Myc, affinity-purified rabbit anti-sst2A (6291) or affinity-purified rabbit anti-sst3 (7986) antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml for 12 h at 4 °C, followed by detection using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. Densitometric analysis of Western blots exposed in the linear range of the x-ray film was performed as described (31Schulz S. Pauli S.U. Handel M. Dietzmann K. Firsching R. Hollt V. Clin. Cancer Res... 2000; 6: 1865-1874Google Scholar). The amount of immunoreactive material in each lane was quantified using NIH Image 1.57 software. Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips overnight and then exposed to agonists. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, for 40 min at room temperature and washed several times in 10 mm Tris, 10 mmphosphate buffer, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% thimerosal, pH 7.4 (TPBS). Specimens were then incubated for 3 min in 50% methanol and for 3 min in 100% methanol and subsequently washed several times in TPBS and preincubated with TPBS and 3% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. For single immunofluorescence, cells were then incubated with either mouse monoclonal anti-T7, affinity-purified rabbit anti-c-Myc, affinity-purified rabbit anti-sst2A(6291), or affinity-purified rabbit anti-sst3 (7986) antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in TPBS and 1% normal goat serum overnight. Bound primary antibody was detected with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:100; Vector, Burlingame, CA) followed by cyanine 3.18-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For double immunofluorescence, cells were incubated either with a mixture of mouse monoclonal anti-T7 and affinity-purified rabbit anti-c-Myc or guinea pig anti-sst2A (GP3) and affinity-purified rabbit anti-sst3 (7986) antibodies. Bound primary antibodies were detected with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibodies, followed by a mixture of cyanine 2.18-conjugated streptavidin and cyanine 5.18-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-guinea pig antibodies (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were then dehydrated, cleared in xylol, and permanently mounted in DPX (Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany). Specimens were examined using a Leica TCS-NT laser-scanning confocal microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a krypton/argon laser. Cyanine 2.18 was imaged with 488-nm excitation and 500–560-nm band pass emission filters, cyanine 3.18 with 568-nm excitation and 570–630-nm band pass emission filters, and cyanine 5.18 with 647-nm excitation and 665-nm long pass emission filters. Confocal micrographs were taken by a person blinded to the treatments who was instructed to randomly select one colony of 4–12 cells per coverslip. Cells were harvested into PBS and stored at −80 °C. After thawing, cells were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Cell membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with lysis buffer, and resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml bacitracin, pH 7.5). For saturation binding assays, aliquots of the membrane preparations containing 25 μg of protein were incubated with increasing concentrations of [125I-Tyr11]SS-14 ranging from 0.025 to 0.3 nm. Receptor densities (Bmax) and ligand affinities (KD) were calculated as mean ± S.E. from four or five determinations performed in duplicate. Nonspecific binding was defined as that not displaced by 1 μm SS-14. For competition binding assays, aliquots of the membrane preparation containing 25 μg of protein were incubated with 0.05 nm [125I-Tyr11]SS-14 in the presence or absence of either SS-14, L-779,976, or L-796,778 in concentrations ranging from 10−12 to 10−5m. The experiment for each concentration was performed in triplicate. Assays were performed in 96-well polypropylene plates in a final volume of 200 μl for 45 min at room temperature. The incubation was terminated by vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters presoaked in 0.1% polyethyleneimine using an Inotech cell harvester (Dittikon, Switzerland). Filters were rinsed twice with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and air-dried. Bound radioactivity was determined using a γ-counter. Protein content was determined by the Lowry method. Cells were harvested and lysed as described above except that a lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris and 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) was used. The resulting pellet was resuspended in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), and aliquots containing 25 μg of protein were incubated with 3 μm GDP and 0.05 nm [35S]GTPγS in the presence or absence of either SS-14, L-779,976, or L-796,778 in concentrations ranging from 10−12 to 10−6m. Assays were carried out in a final volume of 1 ml for 30 min at 30 °C under continuous agitation. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled GTPγS. The incubation was terminated by vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters as described above. Filters were rinsed twice with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Scintillation mixture was added, and radioactivity was determined using a β-counter. The maximal effector response (Emax) was determined by stimulation with sst agonists at a concentration of 1 μm. Transfected cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105/well onto poly-l-lysine-treated 22-mm 12-well dishes. On the next day, cells were either not preincubated or preincubated with 1 μm SS-14 for 1, 2, 4, or 6 h in Opti-MEM 1 (Life Technologies). The medium was then removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of serum-free RPMI medium containing 25 μm forskolin or 25 μm forskolin plus either SS-14, L-779,976, or L-796,778 in concentrations ranging from 10−12 to 10−6m. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by removal of the culture medium and the subsequent addition of 1 ml of ice-cold HCl/ethanol (1 volume of 1 n HCl, 100 volumes of ethanol). After centrifugation, the supernatant was evaporated, the residue was dissolved in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 7.5), and the cAMP content was determined using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105/well onto poly-l-lysine-treated 22-mm 12-well dishes and grown for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. Cells were then exposed to either SS-14, L-779,976, or L-796,778 in concentrations ranging from 10−12 to 10−6m for 5 min in RPMI medium without fetal calf serum at 37 °C. Incubation was terminated by removal of the culture medium and the subsequent addition of 300 μl of boiling SDS-sample buffer. Samples were heated to 95 °C for an additional 5 min period. Equal amounts of protein of each sample were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The protein content was determined using the BCA method. After blocking with 5% low fat dried milk dissolved in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal phosphospecific anti-ERK1/2 antibody clone E10 (1:1000; New England Biolabs). Blots were developed using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometric analysis of phospho-ERK1/2 levels on Western blots exposed in the linear range of the x-ray film was performed using NIH Image 1.57 software. Data from ligand binding, GTPγS, cAMP, and ERK assays were analyzed by nonlinear regression curve fitting using GraphPad Prism 3.0 software. To examine dimerization of the sst2A receptor, we used HEK 293 cells stably expressing either the T7-tagged sst2A alone (Bmax = 820 ± 19 fmol/mg of membrane protein) or stably coexpressing T7-tagged sst2A and Myc-tagged sst2A receptors were used. Western blot analysis of membrane extracts from these cells with the anti-sst2Aantibody (6291) revealed a predominant receptor band migrating at 80 kDa (Fig. 1 A). We also observed an additional band with a higher molecular mass migrating at 160 kDa (Fig. 1 A). These bands were not only detected with antibodies directed against the carboxyl terminus (6291, GP3) but also with antibodies directed against the amino-terminal added T7 or Myc tag (not shown). A similar ratio of these two immunoreactive bands was observed when the cells had been subjected to cross-linking using the cell-impermeable cross-linker BS3 prior to cell lysis (Fig.1 A). However, enzymatic deglycosylation reduced the size of the 80-kDa protein to 55 kDa and the size of the 160-kDa protein to 110 kDa, suggesting that the band with the higher molecular weight may consist of two sst2A receptor proteins (Fig.1 B). Exposure to SS-14 did not grossly modulate the dimer/monomer ratio (Fig. 1 C). The sst2A dimer was stable under reducing conditions. Similar levels of sst2A dimers were detected after incubation of the cells with 1 mm DTT for 30 min prior to cell lysis (Fig. 1 D). The addition of DTT to the SDS-sample buffer also did not reduce the level of sst2A dimers detected on Western blots. sst2A dimers were also stable in the presence of 2% SDS (e.g. heating to 60 °C for 20 min in SDS-sample buffer and loading onto regular SDS-polyacrylamide gels). However, when these samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 2- or 4-fold higher SDS concentrations, the sst2A dimer was destabilized in a concentration-dependent manner, and only the monomeric form of the receptor was detectable under these conditions (Fig.1 D). This suggests that the sst2A dimer is formed by noncovalent interactions of two receptor proteins. To directly examine the presence of sst2A receptor dimers, we used coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting of differentially epitope-tagged sst2A receptors. HEK 293 cells coexpressing Mycsst2A and T7sst2A were lysed, and the receptors from these cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-c-Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-T7 antibody. As depicted in Fig. 1 E, anti-T7 antibody detected a single band migrating at 160 kDa, which represents the Mycsst2A-T7sst2A dimer. Receptor monomer was not detectable, suggesting that the coprecipitated sst2A dimers w"

The critical parameters for superconductivity (current and field) of a mesoscopic sample are determined by the pattern of vortices in it, which in turn is controlled by the symmetry imposed by the shape of the sample (see ref. 1 and references therein). Hitherto it has been unclear what happens when the number of vortices is not consistent with the natural symmetry. Here we show that additional vortex-antivortex pairs nucleate spontaneously so as to preserve the symmetry of the sample. For example, in a square with three vortices, the spontaneously generated pair, along with the original three vortices, distribute themselves so that the four vortices sit in the four corners, with the antivortex in the centre. The measured superconducting phase boundary (of superconducting transition temperature Tc versus magnetic field strength) is in very good agreement with the calculations, giving direct experimental evidence for these symmetry-induced vortex-antivortex pairs. Vortex entry into the sample is also changed: vortices enter a square in fours, with antivortices generated to preserve the imposed vorticity. The symmetry-induced nucleation of antivortices is not restricted to superconductors, but should also apply to symmetrically confined superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates."

https://openalex.org/W1574133493,"Introns are removed from nuclear messenger RNA precursors through two sequential phospho-transesterification reactions in a dynamic RNA-protein complex called the spliceosome. But whether splicing is catalysed by small nuclear RNAs in the spliceosome is unresolved. As the spliceosome is a metalloenzyme, it is important to determine whether snRNAs coordinate catalytic metals. Here we show that yeast U6 snRNA coordinates a metal ion that is required for the catalytic activity of the spliceosome. With Mg2+, U6 snRNA with a sulphur substitution for the pro-Rp or pro-Sp non-bridging phosphoryl oxygen of nucleotide U80 reconstitutes a fully assembled yet catalytically inactive spliceosome. Adding a thiophilic ion such as Mn2+ allows the first transesterification reaction to occur in the U6/sU80(Sp)- but not the U6/sU80(Rp)-reconstituted spliceosome. Mg2+ competitively inhibits the Mn2+-rescued reaction, indicating that the metal-binding site at U6/U80 exists in the wild-type spliceosome and that the site changes its metal requirement for activity in the Sp spliceosome. Thus, U6 snRNA contributes to pre-messenger RNA splicing through metal-ion coordination, which is consistent with RNA catalysis by the spliceosome."

Three of the four gene products that have been expressed so far give rise to pacemaker channels with distinct activation kinetics and are differentially distributed among the brain, with considerable overlap between some isoforms. This raises the possibility that HCN channels may coassemble to form heteromeric channels in some areas, similar to other K+ channels. In this study, we have provided evidence for functional heteromerization of HCN1 and HCN2 channels using a concatenated cDNA construct encoding two connected subunits. We have observed that heteromeric channels activate several-fold faster than HCN2 and only a little slower than HCN1. Furthermore, the voltage dependence of activation is more similar to HCN2, whereas the cAMP sensitivity is intermediate between HCN1 and HCN2. This phenotype shows marked similarity to the current arising from coexpressed HCN1 and HCN2 subunits in oocytes and the native pacemaker current in CA1 pyramidal neurons.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2980-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) but is currently unknown for HCN channels. HCN channel subunits have an overall structure similar to voltage-gated K+ channel subunits, including 6 transmembrane domains (S1–S6), a selectivity filter containing the GYG motif, and a putative voltage sensor (S4) containing a positively charged residue at every third position. Based on these structural similarities it has been suggested that HCN channels will most likely adopt the general tetrameric subunit architecture of both 6- and 2-transmembrane segment K+ channels (4Santoro B. Tibbs G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 741-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that functional heteromeric HCN channels may form by coassembly of different HCN isoforms, we expressed a concatenated cDNA construct encoding a covalently linked HCN1 and HCN2 subunit into Xenopus oocytes. Currents were recorded using the 2-microelectrode voltage clamp technique and were compared with the biophysical properties of channels formed upon coexpression of HCN1 and HCN2 subunits and channels formed upon expression of HCN1 and HCN2 alone. The cAMP sensitivity of the homomeric and heteromeric HCN channels was assessed by coexpression of a G-protein-coupled receptor. The entire coding sequence for the mouse HCN1 and HCN2 channels (originally termed mBCNG-1 and mBCNG-2, respectively) were subcloned into the vector pSD64TF and pGEMHE, respectively. Plasmids were first linearized either with BamHI (for HCN1) or with SphI (for HCN2). Next, the cRNAs were synthesized from the linearized plasmids using the large scale SP6 (for HCN1) or T7 (for HCN2) mMessage mMachine transcription kit (Ambion). A concatenated construct encoding a covalently linked HCN1 and HCN2 subunit was engineered by digesting HCN1 with PshAI (blunt) and SpeI. HCN2 was digested with SmaI (blunt) and SpeI and ligated into the corresponding sites of the previous construct. The ligation product, HCN1·HCN2, was linearized with XbaI for size verification on an agarose gel and in vitrotranscription using the large scale SP6 mMessage mMachine transcription kit. The encoded dimer lacks the last 45 residues of the HCN1 C terminus and contains a 9-amino acid linker (GDPNSPFLA) that connects HCN1-Gln865stop to HCN2-M1 (see Fig.1 A). The human μ-opioid receptor (MOR) cDNA was subcloned into our custom high expression vector, pGEMHE (17Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) and linearized for transcription as previously described (22Ulens C. Van Boven M. Daenens P. Tytgat J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 1024-1033PubMed Google Scholar). The rat GαsQ227L cDNA clone (23Chan J.S. Chiu T.T. Wong Y.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2682-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was subcloned in pcDNA1.1 and linearized with XbaI for in vitro transcription. The mouse 5-HT4(a)R cDNA clone (24Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 910-920PubMed Google Scholar) in its original vector (pRK5) was first subcloned into theXbaI and HindIII sites of pSGEM, a modified version of pGEMHE (25Villmann C. Bull L. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7634-7643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription, 5-HT4(a)R/pSGEM, was linearized with NheI. The capped cRNAs were synthesized from the linearized plasmids using the large-scale T7 mMessage mMachine transcription kit. The isolation of Xenopus laevis oocytes was as previously described (17Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 10 ng/50 nl HCN1, HCN2, or HCN1·HCN2 cRNA. For determination of cAMP sensitivity, oocytes were coinjected with 0.05 ng of MOR; 0.05 ng of GαsQ227L or 0.01 ng of 5-HT4(a)R; and 10 ng of HCN1, HCN2, or HCN1·HCN2 (final injection volume, 50 nl). Injected oocytes were maintained in ND-96 solution (KCl 2 mm, NaCl 96 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, CaCl21.8 mm, HEPES 5 mm, pH 7.5) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. Whole-cell currents from oocytes were recorded as previously described (22Ulens C. Van Boven M. Daenens P. Tytgat J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 1024-1033PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out using a high potassium (HK) external solution (KCl 96 mm, NaCl 2 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, CaCl2 1.8 mm, HEPES 5 mm, pH 7.5). Reversal potentials were determined in both HK and low potassium (ND-96) external solution (NaCl 96 mm, KCl 2 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, CaCl21.8 mm, HEPES 5 mm, pH 7.5). Cesium sensitivity of all the channel constructs was assessed by application of a hyperpolarizing pulse to −100 mV, long enough to achieve a fully activated state (4 s for HCN1 channels, 15 s for HCN2 channels, and 4 s for tandem HCN1·HCN2 channels). In this study, we coexpressed either μ-opioid or 5-HT4(a) receptors with HCN channels. Both receptors are representative members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily that display an overlapping distribution pattern with HCN1 and HCN2 isoforms in the brain (24Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 910-920PubMed Google Scholar, 26Peckys D. Landwehrmeyer G.B.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2682-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 910-920PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway through which the effect occurs involves Gβγ activation of adenylyl cyclase (27Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 28Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and requires coexpression of GαsQ227L (a constitutively active mutant) in the case of the μ-opioid receptor (23Chan J.S. Chiu T.T. Wong Y.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2682-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The effect of the 5-HT4(a) receptor, in part caused by its constitutive activity (24Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 910-920PubMed Google Scholar), occurs directly through Gαsactivation. HCN currents were recorded before, during, and after application of an agonist (1 μm DAMGO for μ-opioid receptors and 1 μm 5-HT for 5-HT4(a)receptors) to activate the receptor. Current-voltage relationships were obtained by measuring the current amplitude after application of 4 s hyperpolarizing test pulses and normalization to the fully activated current at −110 mV (HCN1), −115 mV (HCN1·HCN2 tandem), and −125 mV (HCN2). Boltzmann activation curves were constructed using peak tail current amplitudes observed upon application of subsequent hyperpolarizing test pulses. Current values were plotted as a function of the applied voltage step and fitted with a Boltzmann equation, I=Ioff+Imax1+exp(−(Vtest−V1/2)/S)Equation 1 where I represents the current,Ioff the offset, Imax the maximal current, Vtest the applied test voltage,V 12 the midpoint potential, and S the slope of the Boltzmann curve. Curves of n experiments were normalized to the maximal tail current amplitude and corrected for the offset. Time constants of activation were determined by fitting the late rising phase of the current with a double exponential function. The initial lag of the rising phase was excluded from the fitting procedure to obtain an appropriate fit. The lag phase maximally comprised the first 12 ms, 32 ms, and 280 ms of the rising current for HCN1, HCN1·HCN2 dimers, and HCN2, respectively. Averaged data are indicated as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis of differences between groups was carried out with Student's t test, and a probability of 0.05 was taken as the level of statistical significance. In this study, we investigated the possible heteromerization of HCN channels by expressing a concatenated cDNA construct encoding a covalently linked HCN1 and HCN2 subunit (Fig.1 A) into Xenopusoocytes. Both HCN1 and HCN2 are members of the HCN gene family (3Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Biel M. Ludwig A. Zong X. Hofmann F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 136: 165-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), encoding pacemaker channels with easily distinguishable kinetic properties. For comparison, all records shown in Fig. 1 Bwere evoked using the same voltage step protocol. Homomeric HCN1 channels activate relatively fast, whereas homomeric HCN2 channels activate more slowly (Fig. 1 B, TableI). Expression of cRNA encoding the dimeric construct gives rise to currents that activate somewhat slower than HCN1, but still several-fold faster than HCN2 (Fig. 1 B, Table I). This finding provides important evidence that the concatenated construct encodes heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels, because the unexpectedly fast kinetics cannot be accounted for by the mathematical average expected from homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels. Furthermore, the heteromeric phenotype shows marked resemblance to currents that were evoked from oocytes coinjected with equal amounts of HCN1 and HCN2 cRNA (Fig. 1 B). This result suggests that HCN1 and HCN2 subunits could spontaneously coassemble to form a population of channels with a subunit arrangement similar to the heteromeric channels formed by HCN1·HCN2 dimers.Table IComparison between HCN clones and Ih in CA1 hippocampal neuronscAMP-dependent shift of V 12 , S (2-s pulses)mVmsmVHCN10.02 ± 1.13 1-aDetermined with a coexpressed μ-opioid receptor and GαSQ227L.23.7 ± 2.9−66.6 ± 0.10.3 ± 1.4 1-bDetermined with a coexpressed 5-HT4(a) receptor.138 ± 11−13.2 ± 0.06HCN215.4 ± 1.0 1-aDetermined with a coexpressed μ-opioid receptor and GαSQ227L.287.2 ± 8.9−91.4 ± 1.614.4 ± 1.1 1-bDetermined with a coexpressed 5-HT4(a) receptor.1794 ± 98−7.9 ± 0.8HCN1 · HCN27.1 ± 1.3 1-aDetermined with a coexpressed μ-opioid receptor and GαSQ227L.99.8 ± 7.7−80.8 ± 1.97.3 ± 1.3 1-bDetermined with a coexpressed 5-HT4(a) receptor.440 ± 16−11.6 ± 1.1Ih(13)7 1-cDetermined by including 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP in the pipette solution.64.4 ± 2.9−84.3 ± 0.5537 ± 47−10.1 ± 0.31-a Determined with a coexpressed μ-opioid receptor and GαSQ227L.1-b Determined with a coexpressed 5-HT4(a) receptor.1-c Determined by including 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP in the pipette solution. Open table in a new tab Current-voltage relationships were constructed from the records in Fig.1 B and are compared in Fig. 1 C. It should be noted that the 4-s test pulses applied to record the traces shown in Fig. 1 B do not allow HCN2 channels to obtain a steady-state level of activation because of their relatively slow time course of activation (12Santoro B. Chen S. Luthi A. Pavlidis P. Shumyatsky G.P. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To make a valid comparison of the voltage dependence of activation between homomeric and heteromeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels, we calculated half-maximal values of activation (V 12 ) from experiments with voltage steps of increasing duration (Fig. 1 D). These results show that the use of relatively short hyperpolarizing pulses shifts the estimates of the V 12 -values to more negative potentials. Comparison of calculated V 12 -values shows that heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels activate at membrane potentials intermediate to homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels for pulses ≤5 s. However, heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels activate at membrane potentials more negative than the average of steady-state V 12 -values for homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels (average indicated with a dashed line), for pulses long enough to achieve steady-state levels of activation (>10 s). This result would suggest that a voltage-dependent transition in the opening of the heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channel complex is limited by the isoform that activates at the most negative membrane voltages, as in the case of HCN2. As could be observed from the current traces in Fig. 1 B, heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels activate with a faster time course than the average of homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels predicts. For clarification, we have superimposed traces from homomeric and heteromeric channels recorded during a hyperpolarizing step to −90 mV (Fig. 2 A). The current trace recorded from oocytes coexpressing HCN1 and HCN2 channels perfectly matches with the trace obtained from the tandem HCN1·HCN2 channels, suggesting that channels are formed with a subunit stoichiometry similar to the defined subunit arrangement of the tandem-linked channels. Next, we quantified the kinetics of activation by fitting current traces during hyperpolarizing voltage steps (as shown in Fig.1 B) with two exponential functions (12Santoro B. Chen S. Luthi A. Pavlidis P. Shumyatsky G.P. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated fast and slow time constants of activation were plotted as a function of the applied test potential and are shown in Fig. 2, B andC, respectively. Values calculated for the traces in Fig.2 A were τfast = 214 ± 20 ms (n = 6) and τslow = 909 ± 54 ms (n = 6) for tandem HCN1·HCN2 channels and τfast = 168 ± 8 ms (n = 6) and τslow = 944 ± 49 ms (n = 6) for coexpressed HCN1 and HCN2 channels. Homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels as well as heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels have slow time constants of activation that are 5- to 10-fold higher than fast time constants. Compared with the respective time constants for homomeric HCN1 channels, homomeric HCN2 channels have fast and slow time constants that are ∼10-fold higher. These results are in accordance with recently reported data on pacemaker channels in the mouse CNS (12Santoro B. Chen S. Luthi A. Pavlidis P. Shumyatsky G.P. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels have time constants of activation that are significantly faster than the average of homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels predicts (indicated with a dashed line). Heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels activate similarly to homomeric HCN1 channels, with fast and slow time constants of activation that are only about 3-fold higher. This result suggests that HCN1 subunits dominate the activation rate of the heteromeric channel complex. Another striking feature that discriminates between homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels is their differential sensitivity to cAMP (6Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 7Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Hormones and neurotransmitters acting through the second messenger cAMP finely tune the activation of the pacemaker current by shifting the voltage dependence of activation along the voltage axis (1DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 2Pape H.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism involves direct binding of cAMP to the channel cyclic nucleotide binding domain (29DiFrancesco D. Tortora P. Nature. 1991; 351: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Similar to studies using excised inside-out patches (6Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 7Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), we found that activation of a coexpressed G-protein-coupled receptor, either the 5-HT4(a) or μ-opioid receptor, shifts the V 12 -value by 14.9 mV toward more positive potentials for homomeric HCN2 channels and no shift for homomeric HCN1 channels (Fig.3 A). Intriguingly, heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels display a cAMP sensitivity that is intermediate to homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels, with a 7.2 mV shift toward more positive potentials in response to activation of coexpressed G-protein-coupled receptor. Representative current traces from experiments using homomeric and heteromeric channels coexpressed with μ-opioid or 5-HT4(a) receptors are shown in Fig. 3,B and C, respectively. Based on the structural similarities of the 6 transmembrane domains, the pore-forming region and cytoplasmic N and C termini of HCN channels with other K+ channels, it has previously been suggested that HCN channels will most likely conform to the tetrameric subunit arrangement of both the 6- and 2-transmembrane domain K+ channels (4Santoro B. Tibbs G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 741-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). With respect to our results with HCN1·HCN2 tandems, this idea would suggest that functional channels are likely to be formed by coassembly of two HCN1·HCN2 tandems, adopting a HCN1/HCN2/HCN1/HCN2 or HCN1/HCN2/HCN2/HCN1 subunit stoichiometry. Our experimental results on the cAMP sensitivity of heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels support the idea of a tetrameric subunit arrangement, because the shift of theV 12 -value for heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels (7.2 mV) is exactly half of the shifts determined for homomeric HCN1 (0.2 mV) and HCN2 (14.9 mV) channels. Finally, HCN channels are characterized by weak selectivity for K+ over Na+ and the inward current is sensitive to block by application of external Cs+. Therefore, we compared the reversal potentials and the cesium sensitivity for homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels with heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels. Reversal potentials determined in ND-96 solution (2 mmK+) and HK solution (96 mm K+) were −30 ± 1 mV (n = 5) and −2 ± 2 mV (n = 6) for HCN1 channels, −29 ± 2 mV (n = 5) and 0 ± 1 mV (n = 6) for HCN2 channels, and −30 ± 2 mV (n = 6) and −1 ± 2 mV (n = 6) for tandem HCN1·HCN2 channels. Application of external Cs+ caused a complete inhibition of the inward current through HCN channels, characterized by IC50 values of 124 ± 28 μm(n = 6) for HCN1 channels, 63 ± 12 (n = 6) for HCN2 channels and 79 ± 11 (n = 6) for tandem HCN1·HCN2 channels. These results indicate that heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels share identical ion selectivity and cesium sensitivity with homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels. Taken together, our data raise the question about the relevance to native pacemaker currents. To address this issue, it is important to note that HCN isoforms not only differ in their biophysical properties and cAMP sensitivity, but also in their distinct distribution pattern across the brain (12Santoro B. Chen S. Luthi A. Pavlidis P. Shumyatsky G.P. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Franz O. Liss B. Neu A. Roeper J. Eur J.

Nevertheless, considerable overlap was shown between HCN1 and HCN2 using in situ hybridization, namely in hippocampal pyramidal cells and some brainstem nuclei (12Santoro B. Chen S. Luthi A. Pavlidis P. Shumyatsky G.P. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the coexistence of HCN1 and HCN2 mRNA has been demonstrated at the single cell level for hippocampal CA1 neurons (13Franz O. Liss B. Neu A. Roeper J. Eur J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2685-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that heteromeric channel complexes could form in some areas. In Table I, we have compared our data to the results obtained by Franz et al. (13Franz O. Liss B. Neu A. Roeper J. Eur J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2685-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) based on the similar recording conditions (room temperature, whole cell configuration) and data analysis (double exponential fits to the time course of activation). The cAMP-induced shift of theV 12 -value for Ih in hippocampal CA1 neurons correlates well with the shift that we observed for heteromeric HCN1·HCN2 channels. This result can be expected from a population of channels that either consists of equal amounts of homomeric HCN1 and HCN2 channels or a population of channels with a heteromeric stoichiometry, similar to the tandem-linked channels. Comparison of the kinetic properties and the voltage dependence of activation for Ih in hippocampal CA1 neurons with our results however favors the formation of heteromeric channels, because equally distributed homomeric channels cannot account for the fast gating properties of the native Ih. In conclusion, the cAMP dependence and gating properties of tandem-linked HCN1 and HCN2 subunits reveal that HCN channels can function as heteromers, most likely tetramers. Based on the resemblance of the tandem it's distinct current phenotype with currents obtained from coexpressed HCN1 and HCN2 subunits and native pacemaker current in neurons in which different isoforms coexist, our results suggest that heteromerization of different HCN channels may further contribute to the functional heterogeneity of native pacemaker currents. Finally, the dimeric construct may also serve as a model to elucidate the physiological role of native pacemaker currents and as a relevant pharmacological tool to develop new compounds for these channels.

These complexes are assembled by scaffold proteins often devoid of enzymatic activity and for the sole function of bringing together different signaling molecules (1Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 2Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). These signaling/scaffold protein complexes are necessary and often indispensable for signaling, as disruption or blocking the formation of these complexes decreases the efficiency of signaling or negates it altogether.Even though cAMP is a diffusible second messenger, the enzymes involved in this signaling pathway are targeted to different subcellular compartments. With few exceptions, adenylyl cyclases are plasma membrane-associated proteins, and protein kinase A (PKA),1 one of the effectors of cAMP signaling, is anchored to discrete structures within the cell via regulatory subunit interaction with A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (3Rubin C.S.

Several different AKAPs that function as scaffold proteins have been characterized. For instance, AKAP79 is part of a multicomplex, which, in addition to the PKA regulatory subunit RII, includes protein kinase C and the phosphatase PP2B/calcineurin (5Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Disruption of the PKA interaction with AKAPs abolishes the cAMP-dependent regulation of ion channels (6Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 7Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PKA regulatory subunits have also been localized in the centrosome in culture cells (8Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and in cells of the central nervous system (9De Camilli P. Moretti M. Donini S.D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), thus opening the possibility that microenvironments of cAMP signaling may be necessary for intracellular trafficking and organelle movements during cell replication.Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, the enzymes that degrade and inactivate cAMP, may play an important role in signaling compartmentalization by controlling cAMP diffusion to reach the PKA isoenzymes anchored to different organelles. Of the wide array of PDE isoforms present in a cell (10Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 11Conti M. Jin S.-L.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Conti M. Nemoz G. Sette C. Vicini E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 370-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 13Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), several are recovered in the particulate fraction of the homogenate and have been immunolocalized to different cellular compartments. We and others have shown that variants derived from the PDE4D gene are particulate or soluble, depending on the amino terminus present in the protein (14Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 15Iona S. Cuomo M. Bushnik T. Naro F. Sette C. Hess M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and are located in different subcellular compartments as shown by immunofluorescence studies. In FRTL-5 thyroid cells, two variants (PDE4D3 and PDE4D4) with long amino termini are recovered in the particulate fraction, and are localized in a perinuclear region corresponding to centrosomal inner/Golgi structures, as well as to the membrane cortical region (16Jin S.L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Conversely, a third variant (PDE4D2), the expression of which is cAMP-dependent, is recovered mostly in the soluble fraction and its induction by cAMP is associated with diffuse immunofluorescent signals in these cells (16Jin S.L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Localization of PDE4D in discrete subcellular structures has also been demonstrated in macrophages (17Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Merricks E.P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings open the possibility that the subcellular localization of PDE4D is finely controlled and this localization may be dynamically regulated during cAMP signaling.To understand the mechanism of PDE4 subcellular targeting, we sought to identify proteins that interact with these PDE4D variants and to anchor them to different organelles. Here we describe the properties of a novel protein named myomegalin, which is a major component of skeletal and cardiac muscle but is expressed at low levels in all cells studied. Although in nonmuscle cells it is targeted to the Golgi/centrosomal region, myomegalin localizes in the sarcomeres in heart and skeletal muscle. This protein colocalizes with PDE4D in the cells and tissue studied.DISCUSSIONWith these studies, we report the identification and the initial characterization of myomegalin, a novel protein with the properties of a structural/scaffold protein. At least three potential splicing variants of myomegalin detected in rat may serve distinct functions in muscle and nonmuscle cells. Myomegalin is targeted to the Golgi/centrosomal region in cultured COS-7 and FRTL-5 cells and in germ cells of the testis, whereas in cardiac and skeletal muscle it is associated with the sarcomere or the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We propose that one of the functions of this protein is in cAMP signaling compartmentalization because it targets a PDE component of the cAMP signaling to these subcellular structures.Myomegalin is structurally related to the Drosophilacentrosomin (cnn). Centrosomin was originally identified while screening for genes regulated by antennapedia or other homeotic genes (26Heuer J.G. Li K. Kaufman T.C. Development. 1995; 121: 3861-3876PubMed Google Scholar) and is mostly composed of coiled-coil structures with three leucine zipper domains. The first leucine zipper near the amino terminus is very similar to the only leucine zipper found in one variant of myomegalin. The extensive arrangement in coiled-coil structures is also shared between centrosomin and myomegalin. TheDrosophila centrosomin is a component of the centrosomes and the mitotic spindle (30Megraw T.L. Li K. Kao L.R. Kaufman T.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2829-2839PubMed Google Scholar) and is thought to play a crucial role during morphogenesis of the central nervous system and midgut (26Heuer J.G. Li K. Kaufman T.C. Development. 1995; 121: 3861-3876PubMed Google Scholar). A testis-specific isoform of centrosomin has been described in fly (31Li K. Xu E.Y. Cecil J.K. Turner F.R. Megraw T.L. Kaufman T.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupt the spermatogenic-specific centrosomin impair cytokinesis, kariokinesis, and organization of the sperm axoneme. In a strikingly similar fashion, a splicing variant of the mammalian myomegalin is expressed in germ cells of rat testis and is localized in a Golgi/centrosomal region of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids; however, it could not conclusively be determined whether it is located in the basal body of the developing flagellum. Thus, it is likely that the mammalian myomegalin has functions during spermatogenesis that overlap with those of the centrosomin inDrosophila.It should be pointed out that other mammalian proteins homologous to the Drosophila centrosomin have been described previously. These include mouse centrosomin A and B and human 167 protein (32Joswig G. Petzelt C. Werner D. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar, 33Petzelt C. Joswig G. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Stammer H. Werner D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2573-2578PubMed Google Scholar, 34Scholler J.K. Kanner S.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, their similarity to the Drosophila centrosomin protein is low, and myomegalin is more related to centrosomin than to these mammalian centrosomins. The function of mammalian centrosomin is at present unknown.Recently, several large coiled-coil proteins localized in the Golgi apparatus have been classified as a distinct golgin family of proteins (35Munro S. Nichols B.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 377-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Among the many members identified, golgin-230/245/256, golgin 97, GM130, and giantin proteins have extensive coiled-coil structure and a domain at the carboxyl terminus that specifies Golgi targeting (grip domain). Myomegalin is weakly homologous to golgin 230/245/256 (20% identity, 40% conservative substitutions) in several coiled-coil domains. However, a domain similar to the grip domain could not be identified at the carboxyl terminus of myomegalin, even though the last 550 amino acids of this latter protein are sufficient to target it to the Golgi/centrosome structures.Although formal proof of an interaction of PDE4D with the full-length myomegalin was precluded by the insolubility of the protein, we have provided evidence of an interaction of the 62–64-kDa myomegalin variant with PDE4D. Four independent lines of evidence indicate that the two proteins may indeed exist in a complex in the intact cell. In addition to the interaction detected with the yeast two-hybrid screening, the 64-kDa variant of myomegalin and PDE4D interact specifically in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, cotransfection of myomegalin targeted the recombinant PDE4D3 to the particulate fraction of COS-7 cells. Finally, myomegalin and PDE4D were colocalized in cultured cells as well as in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue.Deletion mutagenesis of PDE4D indicates that a site of interaction with myomegalin is in a domain that corresponds to the amino terminus of the upstream conserved region 2 (UCR2). This domain is conserved in all the long forms of PDE4 opening the possibility that other PDE4s may interact with myomegalin. This interacting domain of PDE4D consists of a region of predicted α-helical structure with amphipathic distribution of the charges. The carboxyl terminus of myomegalin also contains α-helical domains that may mediate the interaction with a PDE. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have reported that this PDE4D domain, which interacts with myomegalin, is also involved in intramolecular interactions with the amino-terminal regulatory domain and that it functions as an autoinhibitory domain that modulates the catalytic activity of the enzyme (18Lim J. Pahlke G. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19677-19685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At present, it is not clear whether the intramolecular interaction and the binding to myomegalin are mutually exclusive or if they can occur at the same time, nor is it known whether the binding of myomegalin alters the catalytic activity of the PDE. We have reported that phosphorylation of PDE4D3 alters the interaction of this domain with the amino terminus (18Lim J. Pahlke G. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19677-19685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); it is then possible that the state of phosphorylation also affects the ability of the PDE4D to interact with myomegalin. Further studies are required to clarify this issue. It is possible that the interaction of PDE4D with myomegalin, and therefore with the Golgi/centrosome, may be a dynamic process and that translocation of this protein may occur during signaling. Indeed, data have recently been reported indicating that PDE4D3 may translocate upon activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (38Liu H. Maurice D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10557-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In view of its extensive coiled-coil composition, it is likely that myomegalin either oligomerizes with itself or interacts with other proteins. The presence of a leucine zipper domain, which is also known to mediate protein/protein interaction, is consistent with this conclusion. In addition to a PDE, other proteins may be interacting with myomegalin. Using homology searches, a domain similar to the domain involved in dynactin-centractin interaction, a helix-loop-helix found in Clip170, and an uncharged domain that resembles an Src homology 3 binding domain, were identified. Thus, the presence of these putative interacting domains suggests that myomegalin is present in a complex with several additional proteins, which may be involved in vesicle transport or with their interaction with cytoskeletal structures. This raises the possibility that myomegalin may play a role in vesicle transport between the different layers of the Golgi stack.Myomegalin is expressed at high levels in skeletal and cardiac tissue, suggesting an important function in muscle cells. Upon staining with a myomegalin antibody, a periodic pattern was observed indicating localization either in the z region between sarcomeres or in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It could not be determined whether PDE4D and myomegalin are in the z band proper or are associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Several other cAMP-signal transduction proteins have been localized in the same region of the sarcomere including adenylyl cyclase, L channels, and the regulatory subunit of PKA (39Gao T. Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Chien A.J. Green R.D. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19401-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar,40Yang J. Drazba J.A. Ferguson D.G. Bond M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that myomegalin brings PDE4D to a site where several steps in the cAMP signaling cascade take place in muscle cells.The colocalization of PDE4D and myomegalin in Golgi/centrosomal structures points to a role of cyclic nucleotide signaling in the function of these organelles. Targeting of a PDE to the Golgi may have an important function in controlling cAMP diffusion to these regions. Interestingly, PKA regulatory subunits, and anchoring AKAPs, have also been localized in the Golgi apparatus and in the centrosome (8Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 9De Camilli P. Moretti M. Donini S.D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 41Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B.F. Skalhegg B. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,42Witczak O. Skalhegg B.S. Keryer G. Bornens M. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Orstavik S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings suggest that PDE4D localization in these regions serves to control the state of activation of PKAs and therefore the cAMP-regulated phosphorylations in these domains. The exact role of cAMP signaling in centrosome function and in vesicle transport in the Golgi is largely unknown, even though there is ample indirect evidence that cAMP regulates both cytoskeleton assembly as well as vesicle transport (43Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4381-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Muniz M. Martin M.E. Hidalgo J. Velasco A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14461-14466Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Pigment granule redistribution inXenopus melanocytes is regulated by cAMP (45Reilein A.R. Tint I.S. Peunova N.I. Enikolopov G.N. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and cyclic nucleotides have long been implicated in the control of flagellar movements (46Bloodgood R.A. Biol. Cell. 1992; 76: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that strategic localization of a PDE in these regions via myomegalin interaction may be involved in the control of organelle movements or cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly. Only in recent years has it been realized that the components of the signal transduction machinery are organized in macromolecular complexes located in close proximity to the plasma membrane or in discrete subcellular structures. These complexes are assembled by scaffold proteins often devoid of enzymatic activity and for the sole function of bringing together different signaling molecules (1Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 2Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). These signaling/scaffold protein complexes are necessary and often indispensable for signaling, as disruption or blocking the formation of these complexes decreases the efficiency of signaling or negates it altogether. Even though cAMP is a diffusible second messenger, the enzymes involved in this signaling pathway are targeted to different subcellular compartments. With few exceptions, adenylyl cyclases are plasma membrane-associated proteins, and protein kinase A (PKA),1 one of the effectors of cAMP signaling, is anchored to discrete structures within the cell via regulatory subunit interaction with A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) (3Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 4Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Several different AKAPs that function as scaffold proteins have been characterized. For instance, AKAP79 is part of a multicomplex, which, in addition to the PKA regulatory subunit RII, includes protein kinase C and the phosphatase PP2B/calcineurin (5Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Disruption of the PKA interaction with AKAPs abolishes the cAMP-dependent regulation of ion channels (6Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 7Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). PKA regulatory subunits have also been localized in the centrosome in culture cells (8Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and in cells of the central nervous system (9De Camilli P. Moretti M. Donini S.D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), thus opening the possibility that microenvironments of cAMP signaling may be necessary for intracellular trafficking and organelle movements during cell replication. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, the enzymes that degrade and inactivate cAMP, may play an important role in signaling compartmentalization by controlling cAMP diffusion to reach the PKA isoenzymes anchored to different organelles. Of the wide array of PDE isoforms present in a cell (10Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 11Conti M. Jin S.-L.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Conti M. Nemoz G. Sette C. Vicini E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 370-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 13Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), several are recovered in the particulate fraction of the homogenate and have been immunolocalized to different cellular compartments. We and others have shown that variants derived from the PDE4D gene are particulate or soluble, depending on the amino terminus present in the protein (14Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 15Iona S. Cuomo M. Bushnik T. Naro F. Sette C. Hess M. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Jin S.L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and are located in different subcellular compartments as shown by immunofluorescence studies. In FRTL-5 thyroid cells, two variants (PDE4D3 and PDE4D4) with long amino termini are recovered in the particulate fraction, and are localized in a perinuclear region corresponding to centrosomal inner/Golgi structures, as well as to the membrane cortical region (16Jin S.L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Conversely, a third variant (PDE4D2), the expression of which is cAMP-dependent, is recovered mostly in the soluble fraction and its induction by cAMP is associated with diffuse immunofluorescent signals in these cells (16Jin S.L. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Localization of PDE4D in discrete subcellular structures has also been demonstrated in macrophages (17Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Merricks E.P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings open the possibility that the subcellular localization of PDE4D is finely controlled and this localization may be dynamically regulated during cAMP signaling. To understand the mechanism of PDE4 subcellular targeting, we sought to identify proteins that interact with these PDE4D variants and to anchor them to different organelles. Here we describe the properties of a novel protein named myomegalin, which is a major component of skeletal and cardiac muscle but is expressed at low levels in all cells studied. Although in nonmuscle cells it is targeted to the Golgi/centrosomal region, myomegalin localizes in the sarcomeres in heart and skeletal muscle. This protein colocalizes with PDE4D in the cells and tissue studied. DISCUSSIONWith these studies, we report the identification and the initial characterization of myomegalin, a novel protein with the properties of a structural/scaffold protein. At least three potential splicing variants of myomegalin detected in rat may serve distinct functions in muscle and nonmuscle cells. Myomegalin is targeted to the Golgi/centrosomal region in cultured COS-7 and FRTL-5 cells and in germ cells of the testis, whereas in cardiac and skeletal muscle it is associated with the sarcomere or the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We propose that one of the functions of this protein is in cAMP signaling compartmentalization because it targets a PDE component of the cAMP signaling to these subcellular structures.Myomegalin is structurally related to the Drosophilacentrosomin (cnn). Centrosomin was originally identified while screening for genes regulated by antennapedia or other homeotic genes (26Heuer J.G. Li K. Kaufman T.C. Development. 1995; 121: 3861-3876PubMed Google Scholar) and is mostly composed of coiled-coil structures with three leucine zipper domains. The first leucine zipper near the amino terminus is very similar to the only leucine zipper found in one variant of myomegalin. The extensive arrangement in coiled-coil structures is also shared between centrosomin and myomegalin. TheDrosophila centrosomin is a component of the centrosomes and the mitotic spindle (30Megraw T.L. Li K. Kao L.R. Kaufman T.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2829-2839PubMed Google Scholar) and is thought to play a crucial role during morphogenesis of the central nervous system and midgut (26Heuer J.G. Li K. Kaufman T.C. Development. 1995; 121: 3861-3876PubMed Google Scholar). A testis-specific isoform of centrosomin has been described in fly (31Li K. Xu E.Y. Cecil J.K. Turner F.R. Megraw T.L. Kaufman T.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupt the spermatogenic-specific centrosomin impair cytokinesis, kariokinesis, and organization of the sperm axoneme. In a strikingly similar fashion, a splicing variant of the mammalian myomegalin is expressed in germ cells of rat testis and is localized in a Golgi/centrosomal region of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids; however, it could not conclusively be determined whether it is located in the basal body of the developing flagellum. Thus, it is likely that the mammalian myomegalin has functions during spermatogenesis that overlap with those of the centrosomin inDrosophila.It should be pointed out that other mammalian proteins homologous to the Drosophila centrosomin have been described previously. These include mouse centrosomin A and B and human 167 protein (32Joswig G. Petzelt C. Werner D. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar, 33Petzelt C. Joswig G. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Stammer H. Werner D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2573-2578PubMed Google Scholar, 34Scholler J.K. Kanner S.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, their similarity to the Drosophila centrosomin protein is low, and myomegalin is more related to centrosomin than to these mammalian centrosomins. The function of mammalian centrosomin is at present unknown.Recently, several large coiled-coil proteins localized in the Golgi apparatus have been classified as a distinct golgin family of proteins (35Munro S. Nichols B.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 377-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Among the many members identified, golgin-230/245/256, golgin 97, GM130, and giantin proteins have extensive coiled-coil structure and a domain at the carboxyl terminus that specifies Golgi targeting (grip domain). Myomegalin is weakly homologous to golgin 230/245/256 (20% identity, 40% conservative substitutions) in several coiled-coil domains. However, a domain similar to the grip domain could not be identified at the carboxyl terminus of myomegalin, even though the last 550 amino acids of this latter protein are sufficient to target it to the Golgi/centrosome structures.Although formal proof of an interaction of PDE4D with the full-length myomegalin was precluded by the insolubility of the protein, we have provided evidence of an interaction of the 62–64-kDa myomegalin variant with PDE4D. Four independent lines of evidence indicate that the two proteins may indeed exist in a complex in the intact cell. In addition to the interaction detected with the yeast two-hybrid screening, the 64-kDa variant of myomegalin and PDE4D interact specifically in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, cotransfection of myomegalin targeted the recombinant PDE4D3 to the particulate fraction of COS-7 cells. Finally, myomegalin and PDE4D were colocalized in cultured cells as well as in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue.Deletion mutagenesis of PDE4D indicates that a site of interaction with myomegalin is in a domain that corresponds to the amino terminus of the upstream conserved region 2 (UCR2). This domain is conserved in all the long forms of PDE4 opening the possibility that other PDE4s may interact with myomegalin. This interacting domain of PDE4D consists of a region of predicted α-helical structure with amphipathic distribution of the charges. The carboxyl terminus of myomegalin also contains α-helical domains that may mediate the interaction with a PDE. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have reported that this PDE4D domain, which interacts with myomegalin, is also involved in intramolecular interactions with the amino-terminal regulatory domain and that it functions as an autoinhibitory domain that modulates the catalytic activity of the enzyme (18Lim J.

At present, it is not clear whether the intramolecular interaction and the binding to myomegalin are mutually exclusive or if they can occur at the same time, nor is it known whether the binding of myomegalin alters the catalytic activity of the PDE. We have reported that phosphorylation of PDE4D3 alters the interaction of this domain with the amino terminus (18Lim J. Pahlke G. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19677-19685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); it is then possible that the state of phosphorylation also affects the ability of the PDE4D to interact with myomegalin. Further studies are required to clarify this issue. It is possible that the interaction of PDE4D with myomegalin, and therefore with the Golgi/centrosome, may be a dynamic process and that translocation of this protein may occur during signaling. Indeed, data have recently been reported indicating that PDE4D3 may translocate upon activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (38Liu H. Maurice D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10557-10565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In view of its extensive coiled-coil composition, it is likely that myomegalin either oligomerizes with itself or interacts with other proteins. The presence of a leucine zipper domain, which is also known to mediate protein/protein interaction, is consistent with this conclusion. In addition to a PDE, other proteins may be interacting with myomegalin. Using homology searches, a domain similar to the domain involved in dynactin-centractin interaction, a helix-loop-helix found in Clip170, and an uncharged domain that resembles an Src homology 3 binding domain, were identified. Thus, the presence of these putative interacting domains suggests that myomegalin is present in a complex with several additional proteins, which may be involved in vesicle transport or with their interaction with cytoskeletal structures. This raises the possibility that myomegalin may play a role in vesicle transport between the different layers of the Golgi stack.Myomegalin is expressed at high levels in skeletal and cardiac tissue, suggesting an important function in muscle cells. Upon staining with a myomegalin antibody, a periodic pattern was observed indicating localization either in the z region between sarcomeres or in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It could not be determined whether PDE4D and myomegalin are in the z band proper or are associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Several other cAMP-signal transduction proteins have been localized in the same region of the sarcomere including adenylyl cyclase, L channels, and the regulatory subunit of PKA (39Gao T. Puri T.S.

J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that myomegalin brings PDE4D to a site where several steps in the cAMP signaling cascade take place in muscle cells.The colocalization of PDE4D and myomegalin in Golgi/centrosomal structures points to a role of cyclic nucleotide signaling in the function of these organelles. Targeting of a PDE to the Golgi may have an important function in controlling cAMP diffusion to these regions. Interestingly, PKA regulatory subunits, and anchoring AKAPs, have also been localized in the Golgi apparatus and in the centrosome (8Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 9De Camilli P. Moretti M. Donini S.D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings suggest that PDE4D localization in these regions serves to control the state of activation of PKAs and therefore the cAMP-regulated phosphorylations in these domains. The exact role of cAMP signaling in centrosome function and in vesicle transport in the Golgi is largely unknown, even though there is ample indirect evidence that cAMP regulates both cytoskeleton assembly as well as vesicle transport (43Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4381-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Muniz M. Martin M.E. Hidalgo J. Velasco A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14461-14466Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Pigment granule redistribution inXenopus melanocytes is regulated by cAMP (45Reilein A.R. Tint I.S. Peunova N.I. Enikolopov G.N. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and cyclic nucleotides have long been implicated in the control of flagellar movements (46Bloodgood R.A. Biol. Cell. 1992; 76: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that strategic localization of a PDE in these regions via myomegalin interaction may be involved in the control of organelle movements or cytoskeletal assembly/disassembly. With these studies, we report the identification and the initial characterization of myomegalin, a novel protein with the properties of a structural/scaffold protein. At least three potential splicing variants of myomegalin detected in rat may serve distinct functions in muscle and nonmuscle cells. Myomegalin is targeted to the Golgi/centrosomal region in cultured COS-7 and FRTL-5 cells and in germ cells of the testis, whereas in cardiac and skeletal muscle it is associated with the sarcomere or the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We propose that one of the functions of this protein is in cAMP signaling compartmentalization because it targets a PDE component of the cAMP signaling to these subcellular structures. Myomegalin is structurally related to the Drosophilacentrosomin (cnn). Centrosomin was originally identified while screening for genes regulated by antennapedia or other homeotic genes (26Heuer J.G. Li K. Kaufman T.C. Development. 1995; 121: 3861-3876PubMed Google Scholar) and is mostly composed of coiled-coil structures with three leucine zipper domains. The first leucine zipper near the amino terminus is very similar to the only leucine zipper found in one variant of myomegalin. The extensive arrangement in coiled-coil structures is also shared between centrosomin and myomegalin. TheDrosophila centrosomin is a component of the centrosomes and the mitotic spindle (30Megraw T.L. Li K. Kao L.R. Kaufman T.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2829-2839PubMed Google Scholar) and is thought to play a crucial role during morphogenesis of the central nervous system and midgut (26Heuer J.G. Li K. Kaufman T.C. Development. 1995; 121: 3861-3876PubMed Google Scholar). A testis-specific isoform of centrosomin has been described in fly (31Li K. Xu E.Y. Cecil J.K. Turner F.R. Megraw T.L. Kaufman T.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupt the spermatogenic-specific centrosomin impair cytokinesis, kariokinesis, and organization of the sperm axoneme. In a strikingly similar fashion, a splicing variant of the mammalian myomegalin is expressed in germ cells of rat testis and is localized in a Golgi/centrosomal region of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids; however, it could not conclusively be determined whether it is located in the basal body of the developing flagellum. Thus, it is likely that the mammalian myomegalin has functions during spermatogenesis that overlap with those of the centrosomin inDrosophila. It should be pointed out that other mammalian proteins homologous to the Drosophila centrosomin have been described previously. These include mouse centrosomin A and B and human 167 protein (32Joswig G. Petzelt C. Werner D. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar, 33Petzelt C. Joswig G. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Stammer H. Werner D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2573-2578PubMed Google Scholar, 34Scholler J.K. Kanner S.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 515-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, their similarity to the Drosophila centrosomin protein is low, and myomegalin is more related to centrosomin than to these mammalian centrosomins. The function of mammalian centrosomin is at present unknown. Recently, several large coiled-coil proteins localized in the Golgi apparatus have been classified as a distinct golgin family of proteins (35Munro S. Nichols B.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 377-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Among the many members identified, golgin-230/245/256, golgin 97, GM130, and giantin proteins have extensive coiled-coil structure and a domain at the carboxyl terminus that specifies Golgi targeting (grip domain). Myomegalin is weakly homologous to golgin 230/245/256 (20% identity, 40% conservative substitutions) in several coiled-coil domains. However, a domain similar to the grip domain could not be identified at the carboxyl terminus of myomegalin, even though the last 550 amino acids of this latter protein are sufficient to target it to the Golgi/centrosome structures. Although formal proof of an interaction of PDE4D with the full-length myomegalin was precluded by the insolubility of the protein, we have provided evidence of an interaction of the 62–64-kDa myomegalin variant with PDE4D. Four independent lines of evidence indicate that the two proteins may indeed exist in a complex in the intact cell. In addition to the interaction detected with the yeast two-hybrid screening, the 64-kDa variant of myomegalin and PDE4D interact specifically in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, cotransfection of myomegalin targeted the recombinant PDE4D3 to the particulate fraction of COS-7 cells. Finally, myomegalin and PDE4D were colocalized in cultured cells as well as in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue. Deletion mutagenesis of PDE4D indicates that a site of interaction with myomegalin is in a domain that corresponds to the amino terminus of the upstream conserved region 2 (UCR2). This domain is conserved in all the long forms of PDE4 opening the possibility that other PDE4s may interact with myomegalin. This interacting domain of PDE4D consists of a region of predicted α-helical structure with amphipathic distribution of the charges. The carboxyl terminus of myomegalin also contains α-helical domains that may mediate the interaction with a PDE. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have reported that this PDE4D domain, which interacts with myomegalin, is also involved in intramolecular interactions with the amino-terminal regulatory domain and that it functions as an autoinhibitory domain that modulates the catalytic activity of the enzyme (18Lim J. Pahlke G. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19677-19685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). At present, it is not clear whether the intramolecular interaction and the binding to myomegalin are mutually exclusive or if they can occur at the same time, nor is it known whether the binding of myomegalin alters the catalytic activity of the PDE. We have reported that phosphorylation of PDE4D3 alters the interaction of this domain with the amino terminus (18Lim J. Pahlke G. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19677-19685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); it is then possible that the state of phosphorylation also affects the ability of the PDE4D to interact with myomegalin.

However, given the difficulties noted above, definitively ascribing a cell phenotype to a transporter will require molecular tools. It is therefore extremely important not only to clone the genes encoding various Na+-driven HCO 3−transporters, but also to assign their function unambiguously to one of the schemes in Fig. 1. Here we report the tissue distribution, chromosomal location, and functional characterization of a cDNA that we cloned from human brain (GenBankTM accession number AF069512 and NCBI accession number AAC82380). Our physiological analysis indicates that this cDNA encodes an electroneutral Na+-driven Cl-HCO3 exchanger (NDCBE1, Fig. 1 A). We cloned NDCBE1 in three parts. After performing a BLAST search, using the salamander NBCe1 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF001958) as the query, of the GenBankTM data base, we obtained the central part as a cDNA expressed sequence tag (EST)1 clone AA775966(catalogue number CDNA-1401, Genome System Inc., St. Louis, MO). We obtained the 5′-end by performing rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Using human brain poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as the template, we generated cDNA using an NDCBE1-specific primer corresponding to nucleotide sequence 598–627 (numbered from first nucleotide of open reading frame). The downstream, NDCBE1-specific primers for RACE corresponded to nt 547–579 and nt 328–358. We used the two upstream primers provided in the RACE kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). We obtained the 3′-end by performing a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using a human brain λZAPII cDNA library (gift of Dr. Nancy Lynn Johnston, John Hopkins University) as the template. The upstream, NDCBE1-specific primers corresponded to nt 1876–1905 and nt 2014–2043, and the downstream primer corresponded to a sequence near the polycloning site in the pBluescript vector. We verified that the three cDNA fragments represent a single transcript by performing PCR using an upstream primer corresponding to a region (nt −44 to −18) in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and a downstream primer corresponding to a region in the 3′-UTR (nt 3136–3165). We obtained the consensus sequence by directly sequencing the full-length PCR product (Keck Sequencing Center, Yale University). We also subcloned the full-length PCR product into the oocyte expression vector pGH19 (27Trudeau M.C. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), sequenced the clone, and corrected PCR errors on the basis of the consensus sequence. The full-length sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AF069512) was released in 1998. Using a NDCBE1 cDNA as template, we generated a 304-bp cDNA probe, corresponding to a unique region (nt 54–358). DNA clone 477 L 11 from the RPCI-11 human BAC library was identified by Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). The purified BAC DNA was labeled with biotin-dUTP by nick translation. DNA of a chromosome-12 painting library was labeled with Cy3-dUTP by PCR. A biotin-labeled BAC probe, alone or together with Cy3-labeled chromosome-12 painting probe, was hybridized to metaphase chromosome spreads in the presence of human Cot-1 DNA and salmon sperm DNA. The biotin-labeled probe was detected by avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate. Fifty metaphase spreads were taken for analysis and measurements. Gray scale images were obtained using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope coupled to a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ). Fractional length measurement and band assignment were established by analysis of ten chromosomes (28Francke U. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 65: 206-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blots from various human tissues (catalogue numbers 7760-1 and 7759-1) were obtained fromCLONTECH. The [32P]dCTP-labeled, randomly primed 671-bp cDNA probe was generated to the unique 5′-region of NDCBE1 (nt −44 to 627). Membranes were incubated overnight at 68 °C in ExpressHyb™ hybridization buffer (CLONTECH) containing the 32P-labeled probe. Subsequently, membranes were washed at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS for 40 min and then at 50 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1.5 h, before being exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −80 °C for 24 h for detection of high-intensity signals. We transcribed NDCBE1 cDNA in vitrousing an mMessage mMachine™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) with T7 RNA polymerase. Defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes (Stage V–VI) were prepared as described previously (29Grichtchenko I.I. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and injected with 50 nl of NDCBE1 cRNA (1 μg/μl) or water and incubated in OR3 media. Injected oocytes were maintained for 3–7 days at 18 °C before use. For experiments in which we reversed NDCBE1, the 50-nl injectate contained not only NDCBE1 cRNA (1 μg/μl), but also cRNA encoding the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+channel (ENaC; 0.2 μg/μl, gift of Dr. Cecilia Canessa, Yale University). Immediately after this coinjection, we added 20 μm amiloride to the oocyte culture media. One hour prior to the experiment, we transferred coinjected oocytes into amiloride-free HEPES solution. The voltage, pH- and sodium-sensitive microelectrodes, were prepared as described previously (10Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 29Grichtchenko I.I. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Siebens A.W. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 799-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The pH electrode tip was filled with proton ionophore 1 mixture B (Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY) and back-filled with a pH 7 phosphate buffer (31Chao P. Ammann D. Oesch U. Simon W. Lang F. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Na+ electrode tip was filled with sodium ionophore 1 mixture A (Fluka Chemical Corp.) and back-filled with 10 mm NaCl. Electrodes were connected to high-impedance electrometers (model FD-223; World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL), which in turn were connected to the A-D converter of a computer. In electrophysiological experiments, the CO2/HCO 3−-free ND96 solution contained (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.5); osmolality was 188–200 mOsm/kg, 22 °C. In solutions equilibrated with 1.5% CO2 (pH 7.50), 5% CO2 (pH 7.50), and 20% CO2 (pH 6.9), we replaced 10, 33, and 33 mm NaCl, respectively, with an equivalent molarity of NaHCO3. EtherN-methyl-d-glucammonium (NMDG+) replaced Na+ in Na+-free solutions, and gluconate replaced Cl− in Cl−-free solutions. In some solutions we replaced 16 mm NaCl with 16 mm of n-butyric acid sodium salt (B-5887, Sigma). Ten to twenty oocytes were incubated at room temperature for ∼3 h in 250 μl of36Cl “loading solution”, which consisted of (in mm): 70 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 32 HEPES titrated with NaOH to pH 7.5;36Cl was present as 190 μCi/mmol of total Cl−. We then rapidly washed the oocytes five times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold HEPES flux solution (same as “loading solution,” but without 36Cl). The washed oocytes were transferred to one-half of a 1-ml equilibrium-dialysis chamber (BelArts Products, Pequannock, NJ) containing ∼0.5 ml of ice-cold HEPES flux solution. The other half of the dialysis chamber, modified to permit continuous inflow and outflow of solution, was placed open-side up. We added a small magnetic stirring flea, covered the opening with a nylon mesh membrane (which permits free exchange of solution between the two chamber halves), and lightly coated the open edges of the chamber half with silicon stopcock grease (High Vacuum Grease, Dow-Corning, Midland, MI), which acted as a gasket when the two chamber halves were joined and placed oocyte-side up on a magnetic stirring plate. We flowed ice-cold HEPES flux solution at 8 ml/min for 2 min to wash out extracellular 36Cl and then flowed room temperature solution at 3 ml/min for 4 min before beginning to collect samples of the chamber effluent at 3 ml/min every 3 min. Experiments with dye indicated that the time to exchange 95% of the fluid in the upper (i.e. oocyte) chamber half was ∼2 min. All samples were collected directly into plastic scintillation vials, to which we later added 9 ml of Ultima Gold™ liquid scintillation counting mixture (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). At the end of the experiment, the chamber was rapidly taken apart, the oocytes were transferred to 150 μl of a 10% SDS solution in 1 n NaOH for digestion, and a 50-μl aliquot of the digest was prepared for liquid scintillation counting. We calculated the initial36Cl content of the oocytes and the fractional rate of36Cl loss during each sampling period in the experiment. The CO2/HCO 3− flux solution used in the 36Cl flux experiments was the same as the HEPES flux solution, except that 33 mmHCO 3− replaced 33 mmCl−, and the solution was equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% O2. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was judged from unpaired Student'st tests. Querying with the sequence of the cDNA encoding salamander NBCe1 (12Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), we searched the GenBankTM data base and found a human brain EST clone (accession number AA775966) that, at one end, was 53% identical to query. Sequencing this EST clone revealed a 2-kb open reading frame, representing the center of the full-length clone. We obtained the 5′-end by RACE on human brain RNA and the 3′-end by PCR on a human frontal-lobe cDNA library. We obtained the full-length clone, which encodes 1044 amino acids, by performing PCR on human brain cDNA, using primers designed to amplify the entire open reading frame as well as portions of the 5′- and 3′-UTRs. Fig.2 A compares the deduced amino acid sequence of NDCBE1 to electroneutral NBCn1 from rat (NBCn1-D; 73% identity) (10Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and to electrogenic NBCe1 from rat kidney (rkNBC; 50% identity) (32Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F425-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NDCBE1 has two consensus sites forN-glycosylation on the presumed 5,6 extracellular loop (residues 646–649/NHTL and 666–669/NLTV), 12 for protein kinase C, and one for protein kinase A (243–246/KKQS). Like NBCn1 (10Choi I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), NDCBE1 has one potential DIDS motif (33Kopito R.R. Lee B.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1918-1926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (813–816/KLKK), corresponding to the second of two similar motifs in electrogenic NBCs (12Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Fig.2 B summarizes the relationships among the primary structures of NDCBE1 and other members of the HCO 3− transporter superfamily. An NDCBE1 BAC clone produced clear FISH signals on a pair of chromosomes (not shown), which, on the basis of their size, morphology, and DAPI stain-banding pattern, we identified as chromosome 12. Cohybridization of this BAC clone with a chromosome-12 painting probe confirmed the identification (Fig.2 C). The BAC clone hybridized 22% of the distance from the centromere to the telomere of arm 12q, corresponding to band 12q13 (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, human NBCe1 (SLC4A5) maps (35Abuladze N. Lee I. Newman D. Hwang J. Boorer K. Pushkin A. Kurtz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17689-17695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) to chromosome 4q21, and human NBCn1 (SLC4A7) maps (36Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Lee I. Newman D. Hwang J. Kurtz I. Genomics. 1999; 57: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to 3p22. A Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues (Fig. 2 E) revealed a ∼12-kb transcript, with strong signals in brain and testis and a weaker signals in kidney > ovary. The weak ∼9.5-kb bands (pancreas > kidney) may represent NBCe1 (35Abuladze N. Lee I. Newman D. Hwang J. Boorer K. Pushkin A. Kurtz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17689-17695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 37Choi I. Romero M.F. Khandoudi N. Bril A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C576-C584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The very weak ∼7.5-kb band (testis) may represent the human ortholog of NBCn1 (38Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Lee I. Newman D. Hwang J. Kurtz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16569-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The bands at ∼6.3 kb (brain > testis > kidney), ∼4.2 kb (testis), and ∼3.3 kb (brain > testis) may represent alternative splicing of the NDCBE1 primary transcript or products of different but related genes. We found that the three bands that appear in the Northern blot of whole brain also are present in multiple brain regions (not shown), including cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla, thalamus, and hippocampus. However, NDCBE1 was notably absent from spinal cord. To determine the function of NDCBE1, we injected cRNA into oocytes and used microelectrodes to monitor pHi and membrane potential (Vm). In oocytes expressing NDCBE1 (Fig.3 A), extracellular 1.5% CO2, 10 mmHCO 3−elicited a rapid fall in pHi due to CO2 influx (39Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), followed by an increase due to HCO 3−uptake. Removing extracellular Na+ converted the pHi recovery to a very slow acidification, reflecting reversal of NDCBE1. In water-injected oocytes, 1.5% CO2, 10 mmHCO 3−caused the usual pHifall, followed by a long period of stability, with or without Na+ (not shown). Thus, NDCBE1 requires Na+. In oocytes expressing NDCBE1 (Fig.3 A), 1.5% CO2, 10 mmHCO 3−caused a small, slow depolarization (arrow), and removing Na+ caused a slight hyperpolarization (arrowhead), as observed in H2O-injected oocytes (not shown). In contrast, with oocytes expressing electrogenic NBCs, applying CO2/HCO 3−elicits a large and rapid hyperpolarization, whereas removing Na+ elicits a large and rapid depolarization (12Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Grichtchenko I.I. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Bevensee M.O. Schmitt B.M. Choi I. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C1200-C1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NDCBE1 is electroneutral. When we acidified NDCBE1-expressing oocytes with butyric acid, rather than CO2, pHifailed to recover in the presence of Na+ (Fig.3 B). However, after we removed the butyric acid and applied CO2/HCO 3−, pHiinitially recovered rapidly, even though pHi was substantially higher than in the presence of butyric acid. Thus, NDCBE1 requires HCO 3−. Applying 0.5 mm DIDS almost completely blocks the pHi recovery (Fig. 3 C). In six experiments, the inhibition averaged 95% ± 10%. Thus, NDCBE1 is DIDS sensitive. When we introduced 5% CO2, 33 mmHCO 3−(pH 7.50) to NDCBE1-expressing oocytes, the 36Cl efflux increased more than 3-fold (Fig.3 D). The slow decline in 36Cl efflux probably reflects a NDCBE1-mediated increase in pHi, [HCO 3−]i and [Na+]i. These changes were absent in oocytes injected with water, rather than NDCBE1 cRNA. Moreover, in NDCBE1-expressing oocytes, the transition from HEPES to CO2/HCO 3−did not affect36Cl efflux in either the absence of Na+ or presence of 0.5 mm DIDS. Thus, while NDCBE1 is mediating Na+-dependent HCO 3−uptake, it also mediates a Cl− efflux with the properties expected of a Na+-driven Cl-HCO3 exchanger. To determine whether NDCBE1 transports Na+, we used Na+-sensitive microelectrodes to monitor [Na+]i. In an oocyte-expressing NDCBE1, extracellular 5% CO2, 33 mmHCO 3−caused [Na+]i to increase (Fig. 3 E). The mean rate of this [Na+]i increase was substantially higher than in the presence of DIDS or in water-injected oocytes (Fig.3 F). The average, DIDS-sensitive d[Na+]i/dt was 1.01 μms−1. In parallel experiments (not shown), we determined dpHi/dt under identical conditions, and computed the HCO 3−pseudo-flux (Fig.3 F), the DIDS-sensitive component of which averaged 2.19 μm s−1. We already knew that the squid axon's Na+-driven Cl-HCO3exchanger is very difficult to reverse (3Boron W.F. Russell J.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 373-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), consistent with the slow pHi decrease in 0-Na+ in Fig.4 A. We took two steps in an attempt to speed the reversed NDCBE1. First, we coexpressed ENaC Na+ channels to increase [Na+]i. Second, we exposed the oocyte to 20% CO2 to increase [HCO 3−]i. Removing Na+ reversed NDCBE1, causing pHi to decline. However, removing extracellular Cl− reversibly blocked this decline (Fig. 4 A) and caused a small hyperpolarization, as in water-injected oocytes (not shown). In water-injected oocytes (Fig. 4 B), Na+ removal blocked a very slow pHi recovery (probably due to endogenous Na-H exchange at very low pHi), but Cl− removal had no effect on the pHi trajectory. Thus, the reversed NDCBE1 requires external Cl−, as expected of a Na+-driven Cl-HCO3 exchanger. After we submitted our NDCBE1 sequence to GenBankTM, two other groups (41Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 42Amlal H. Burnham C.E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F903-F913PubMed Google Scholar) published partial sequences of NDCBE1, one a 2-kb fragment referred to as “NBC-3” (42Amlal H. Burnham C.E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F903-F913PubMed Google Scholar). After we submitted our paper, a paper appeared by Wang et al. (43Wang C.Z. Yano H. Nagashima K. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35486-35490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), who cloned from mouse insulinoma cells a cDNA named NCBE, 71% identical on the amino acid level to NDCBE1. Mouse NCBE's 5.5-kb transcript, like the transcripts of human NDCBE1, is robustly expressed in cerebrum and cerebellum. However, mouse NCBE mRNA is only weakly present in testis. The function of mouse NCBE is unclear. It mediates a 22Na influx that largely depends on extracellular [Cl−]. In addition, oocytes expressing this mouse clone mediate a 36Cl efflux that is only partially external Na+-dependent or DIDS-sensitive. Moreover, because no 36Cl-efflux data are available from water-injected oocytes, it is impossible to know whether the 36Cl-efflux data represent NCBE activity. Finally, no electrical data are available. Human NDCBE1 is functionally similar to Drosophila NDAE1 (13Romero M.F. Henry D. Nelson S. Harte P.J. Dillon A.K. Sciortino C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24552-24559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in that both exchange extracellular Na+ and “base” for intracellular Cl−. However, human NDCBE1 is strictly HCO 3−-dependent, whereasDrosophila NDAE1 apparently transports OH− in the absence of HCO 3−. Although CO2/HCO 3−enhances pHi changes, it is not clear that Drosophila NDAE1 can transport HCO 3−. The CO2/HCO 3−could act strictly as a buffer, dissipating OH− unstirred layers. Another difference is that expression of Drosophila NDAE1 in oocytes is associated with a Cl− current, as well as an inward current caused by applying CO2/HCO 3−. On the other hand, in oocytes expressing human NDCBE1, the V mchanges caused by altering [HCO 3−]o or [Cl−]o are no different than in water-injected oocytes. Because Drosophila NDAE1 and human NDCBE1 come from distantly related phyla and not closely related in terms of deduced amino acid sequence (47% identity), one must keep open the possibility that, although they appear superficially similar in some respects,Drosophila NDAE1 and human NDCBE1 may function by different molecular mechanisms (Fig. 1 A). The ratio of net HCO 3−and Na+ fluxes mediated by NDCBE1 was (2.19 μms−1)/(1.01 μms−1), or 2.17, consistent with the 2:1 stoichiometry expected of a Na+-driven Cl-HCO3exchanger. Because NDCBE1 is electroneutral, we presume that the net Cl− efflux is the same as the net Na+ influx (Fig. 1 A). However, it was impractical to measure the net Cl− efflux directly with ion-sensitive microelectrodes, because [Cl−]i is too high relative to NDBCE1 expression. However, we can calculate the unidirectional Cl− efflux from the DIDS-sensitive component of the rate constant for 36Cl efflux in NDCBE1-expressing oocytes and the resting [Cl−]i of NDAE-expressing oocytes (13Romero M.F. Henry D. Nelson S. Harte P.J. Dillon A.K. Sciortino C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24552-24559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar): 0.00025 s−1 × 29.5 mm = 7.4 μm s−1. This unidirectional flux is ∼7.3-fold higher than the expected net flux, suggesting that NDCBE1 mediates substantial Cl-Cl exchange in parallel with Na+-driven Cl-HCO3 exchange. Indeed, the unidirectional Cl− efflux from barnacle muscle fibers is also much higher than the net HCO 3−efflux mediated by the endogenous Na+-driven Cl-HCO3 exchanger (44Boron W.F. Russell J.M. Brodwick M.S. Keifer D.W. Roos A. Nature. 1978; 276: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have now cloned the electroneutral Na+-driven Cl-HCO3 exchanger, the first transporter shown to regulate pHi in any cell. The heavy expression of the NDCBE1 transcript in multiple brain regions, including hippocampus, suggests that NDCBE1 plays a major role in pHi regulation in human neurons. In the rat, functional data show that the Na+-driven Cl-HCO3 exchanger is a key pHi regulator in pyramidal neurons from the hippocampal CA1 region (14Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1994; 475: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). pHi is critically important for neuronal function because pHi changes substantially modulate the activity of a variety of CNS channels (45–57). Low pHi inhibits (and/or high pHi stimulates) spontaneous firing in neurons (16Bonnet U. Leniger T. Wiemann M. Brain Res. 2000; 872: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 58Bonnet U. Wiemann M. Brain Res. 1999; 840: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 59Meyer T.M. Munsch T. Pape H.C. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), membrane excitability (60Church J. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1992; 455: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and epileptiform activity (61Xiong Z.Q. Saggau P. Stringer J.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1290-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pHiis important for CNS processes other than excitability. For example, neurite formation (62Kostenko M.A. Musienko V.S. Smolikhina T.I. Brain Res. 1983; 276: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) requires HCO 3−. Thus, NDCBE1 is in a position to influence a wide range of neuronal behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1593526268,"The GCN4 motif, a cis-element that is highly conserved in the promoters of cereal seed storage protein genes, plays a central role in controlling endosperm-specific expression. This motif is the recognition site for a basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor that belongs to the group of maize Opaque-2 (O2)-like proteins. Five different basic leucine zipper cDNA clones, designated RISBZ1–5, have been isolated from a rice seed cDNA library. The predicted gene products can be divided into two groups based on their amino acid sequences. Although all the RISBZ proteins are able to interact with the GCN4 motif, only RISBZ1 is capable of activating (more than 100-fold expression) the expression of a reporter gene under a minimal promoter fused to a pentamer of the GCN4 motif. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain revealed that the proline-rich N-terminal domain (27 amino acids in length) is responsible for transactivation. The RISBZ1 protein is capable of forming homodimers as well as heterodimers with other RISBZ subunit proteins. RISBZ1 gene expression is restricted to the seed, where it precedes the expression of storage protein genes. When the RISBZ1 promoter was transcriptionally fused to the β-glucuronidase reporter gene and the chimeric gene was introduced into rice, the β-glucuronidase gene is specifically expressed in aleurone and subaleurone layer of the developing endosperm. These findings suggest that the specific expression of transcriptional activator RISBZ1 gene may determine the endosperm specificity of the storage protein genes.

Regulated gene expression is mediated by the combinatorial interactions of multiple cis-elements in the gene's promoter. Specific binding of transcriptional factors to the cognatecis-elements constitute a crucial step in transcription initiation and, in turn, on the spatial and temporal expression of genes. Seed storage protein genes provide a model system for the study on the regulatory mechanisms of plant genes (1Goldberg R.B. de Paiva G. Yadegari R. Science. 1994; 266: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), since their expression is restricted to a specific tissue and stage during seed development. These specific temporal and spatial expression patterns may be explained as the result of regulatory assemblies of several transcriptional activators that recognize the cis-elements implicated in seed-specific expression. Therefore, to understand such molecular mechanisms, characterization of cis-elements and transcription factors has been performed on many storage protein genes of several crop plants (2Thomas T.L. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 3Morton R.L. Quiggin D. Higgins T.J.V. Kigel J. Galli G. Seed Development and Germination. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 103-138Google Scholar). Despite numerous studies, the mechanism by which these genes are regulated are poorly understood, since many of the essential cis-elements have not been identified. This is especially true in the case of monocot plants, where many of the promoter analyses of cereal storage protein genes have carried out by transient assays using particle bombardment or heterologous transgenic tobacco system (4Müller M.

Dissection analyses of promoter using homologous stable transgenic plant have been carried out only on glutelin genes of the rice (7Zheng Z. Kawagoe Y. Xiao S. Li Z. Okita T. Hau T.L. Lin A. Murai N. Plant J. 1993; 4: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Wu C.Y. Washida H. Onodera Y. Harada K. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 2000; 23: 415-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endosperm-specific expression of cereal storage protein genes is regulated by the combinatorial interactions of severalcis-elements (3Morton R.L. Quiggin D. Higgins T.J.V. Kigel J. Galli G. Seed Development and Germination. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 103-138Google Scholar). Prolamin box (TGTAAAG), GCN4 motif (TGA(G/C)TCA), AACA motif (AACAAAA), and ACGT motif, which are conserved in many promoters of cereal seed storage protein genes, have been characterized as cis-elements involved in endosperm-specific expression by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments (3Morton R.L. Quiggin D. Higgins T.J.V. Kigel J. Galli G. Seed Development and Germination. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 103-138Google Scholar). The GCN4 motif is widely distributed in many promoters of not only seed storage protein genes but also genes that code for metabolic enzymes (4Müller M. Knudsen S. Plant J. 1993; 6: 343-355Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It has been recently demonstrated that it acts as a key element controlling the endosperm-specific expression. Multimers of the rice glutelin GCN4 motif can direct endosperm-specific expression in stable transgenic rice. In contrast, deletion or base substitution of the GCN4 motif in the rice glutelin promoter reduces promoter activity and alters gene expression pattern (8Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The GCN4 motif is often linked together with the prolamin box (TGTAAAG), which are separated by a few nucleotides. The two motifs collectively constitute the so called bifactorial endosperm box found in nearly all cereal prolamin genes such as wheat glutenin, barley hordein, rye secalin, sorghum kafirin, and Coix coixin (4Müller M. Knudsen S. Plant J. 1993; 6: 343-355Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Holdsworth M.J. Munoz-Blanco J. Hammond-Kosack M. Colot V. Schuch W. Bevan M.W. Plant Mol.

A. 1997; 94: 7685-7690Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In most rice glutelin genes, these two motifs are also associated with the AACA motif (12Takaiwa F. Yamanouchi U. Yoshihara T. Washida H. Tanabe F. Kato A. Yamada K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Gain-of-function experiments showed that combinations of two motifs (GCN4 motif and prolamin box, GCN4 motif and AACA motif) are not sufficient to confer endosperm-specific expression, suggesting that participation of additional element is required to form a functional complex of trans-acting factors (6Marzabal P.M. Busk P.K. Ludevid M.D. Torrent M. Plant J. 1998; 16: 41-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yoshihara T. Washida H. Takaiwa F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has been recently demonstrated in the rice glutelin GluB-1 gene that at least three cis-elements containing the GCN4, ACGT, and AACA motifs within the −197 bp1 proximal promoter are required as minimal elements to direct endosperm-specific expression (8Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Wu C.Y. Washida H. Onodera Y. Harada K. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 2000; 23: 415-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maize Opaque-2 (O2) is an endosperm-specific transcription factor belonging to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family that has been shown to bind to the ACGT motif of maize 22-kDa α-zein promoter and activates transcription (14Schmidt R.J. Ketudat M. Aukerman M.J. Hoschek G. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It has been also reported to be involved in activation of endosperm-specific transcription of b32 ribosome-inactivating protein gene via a distinctcis-sequence (G(a/t)TGAPyPuTGPu) (15Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Fonzo N.D. Hartings H. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), thus indicating that the O2 has broad binding specificity. The GCN4 motif has been reported to be recognized by the O2, resulting in the activation of transcription (8Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Holdsworth M.J. Munoz-Blanco J. Hammond-Kosack M. Colot V. Schuch W. Bevan M.W. Plant Mol.

Bevan M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and maize γ-zein genes (6Marzabal P.M. Busk P.K. Ludevid M.D. Torrent M. Plant J. 1998; 16: 41-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in developing endosperm revealed that the region covering the GCN4 motif and prolamin box are occupied by nuclear proteins from maturing seeds. In vitro DNase I footprinting with nuclear proteins from rice maturing seeds and GST-O2 fusion protein also showed that the sequence covering the GCN4 motif in the promoter of glutelin genes is specifically protected from DNase I digestion (8Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Kim S.Y. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that O2-like transcription factor may exist and participate in controlling the endosperm-specific expression of many storage protein genes in cereal seed through the GCN4 motif. The cDNA clones encoding transcription factor recognizing the GCN4 motif have been recently isolated and characterized in wheat (5Albani D. Hammond-Kosack M.C.U. Smith C. Conlan S. Colot V. Holdsworth M. Bevan M. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 171-184PubMed Google Scholar) and barley (18Vicente-Carbajos J. Onate L. Lara P. Diaz I. Carbonero P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9175-9182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These transcription factors, designated SPA, BLZ1, and BLZ2, transcriptionally activate expression of the storage protein genes by interacting with the GCN4 motif in the wheat low molecular weight glutenin and barley B1-hordein promoters. It is interesting to note that they are expressed in seed-specific manner. cDNA clones encoding primary sequences showing high homology to the basic domain of O2 have been also isolated from rice (20Izawa T. Foster R. Nakajima M. Shimamoto K. Chua N.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1277-1287PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nakase M. Aoki N. Matsuda T. Adachi T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although it has not yet been examined whether they are involved in transcriptional activation of storage protein genes through the GCN4 motif. The RITA-1gene is highly expressed in aleurone and endosperm tissue during seed maturation (20Izawa T. Foster R. Nakajima M. Shimamoto K. Chua N.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1277-1287PubMed Google Scholar). The REB cDNA, which shares high homology to maize Opaque-2 heterodimerizing protein (OHP) (22)and barley BLZ1(18), specifically binds to the GCCACGT(c/a)AG sequence, designated G/C and A/G hybrid box, in the α-globulin promoter (21Nakase M. Aoki N. Matsuda T. Adachi T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that maize O2, barley BLZ2, and wheat SPA interact in vitro with another endosperm-specific transcription factor of the Dof class containing a single highly conserved zinc finger DNA binding domain that recognizes the prolamin box motif (11Vicente-Carbajosa J. Moose S.P. Parsons R.L. Schmidt R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7685-7690Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 23Mena M. Vicente-Carbajosa J. Schmidt R.J. Carbonero P.

Such an interaction has been suggested by thein vivo footprinting of low molecular weight glutelin promoter and maize γ-zein promoter (6Marzabal P.M. Busk P.K. Ludevid M.D. Torrent M. Plant J. 1998; 16: 41-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Conlan R.S. Hammond-Kosack M. Bevan M. Plant J. 1999; 19: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this paper, we screened for cDNA clones coding for bZIP transcription factors from rice seed cDNA library to determine thetrans-factors responsible for transcriptional activation of storage protein genes through the GCN4 motif. Five types of bZIP proteins were isolated and characterized, two of which are completely identical with the RITA-1 (20Izawa T. Foster R. Nakajima M. Shimamoto K. Chua N.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1277-1287PubMed Google Scholar) and REB (21Nakase M. Aoki N. Matsuda T. Adachi T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) transcription factors. All of the transcription factors are able to bind to the GCN4 motif in the sequence-specific manner, but only RISBZ1 exhibits high levels of transcriptional activation through the GCN4 motif using transient expression assays. The role of RISBZ1 as an important transcriptional factor in endosperm-specific regulation of storage protein genes is further supported by the analyses of stable transgenic rice containing chimeric genes consisting of the RISBZ1 promoter and GUS reporter gene. We also show that the N-terminal proline-rich domain of RISBZ1 is required for transcriptional transactivation. Rice (Oryza sativacv. Mangetsumochi) seeds were germinated in tap water, and 14-day-old leaves and roots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until used. Maturing seeds were harvested from rice grown in the field. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from maturing rice seeds harvested 6–16 days after flowering (DAF), as described previously (25Takaiwa F. Kikuchi S. Oono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 15-22Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized for 1 h at 42 °C with SuperScript™ RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using oligo(dT)17as a primer. This cDNA was used as the initial template in a PCR using a forward primer (TCCAA(C/T)(A/C)GIGA(A/G)(A/T)CIGC) and a reverse primer (GTCCTC(C/T)GCCATCTTCACCTT), sequences conserved in the basic domain of bZIP transcription factors expressed in cereal seeds. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 5 min, followed by three cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 40 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C and then 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. Amplified fragments were inserted into the TA cloning vector (pCR™ 2.1; Invitrogen) and sequences determined by a ABI Prism™ dye terminator cycle sequencing kit using the ABI Prism™ 310 genetic analyzer (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequence analyses and data bank searches were carried out using GENETYX (Software Development Co., Ltd.) and the BLAST algorithms, respectively. Rice cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of maturing seed (6–16 days after flowering) by ZAP cDNA® synthesis kit (Stratagene) were screened by five types of PCR fragments under high stringent condition. These DNA fragments were labeled by Megaprime™ DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prehybridization was carried out at 42 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed twice at 55 °C in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and twice at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. To determine the genomic sequence coding for full length of RISBZ1 cDNA region, four primers were devised based on RISBZ1 cDNA sequence. The primers (RIS1f, 5′-ATGGGTTGCGTAGCCGTAGCT-3′; RELr5, 5′-TTGCTTGGCATGAGCATCTGT-3′) were used to amplify the 5′ portion of the exon/intron region. Two other primers (RELf2, 5′-GAGGATCAGGCCCATAT-3′; RIS1r, 5′-TCGCTATATTAAGGGAGACCA-3′) were used for amplification of the 3′ portion of the gene. Amplification reactions were performed using Takara LA Taq (Takara) for 30 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, at 56 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 5 min after incubation at 94 °C for 5 min. The promoter region of RISBZ1 gene was amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR according to the method of Liuet al. (26Liu Y.-G. Mitsukawa N. Oosumi T. Whittier R.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Three oligonucleotides (tail-1, 5′-TGCTCCATTGCGCTCTCGGACGAG; tail-2, ATGAATTCGCGAGGGGTTTTCGA; tail-3, GTTTGGGAGAAATTCGATCAAATGC) complementary to the sense strand of 5′-untranslated region, were used as the specific primers. Total RNA from different organs (roots and seedlings) and developing seeds (from 5 to 30 DAF) was isolated as described (25Takaiwa F. Kikuchi S. Oono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 15-22Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Blots were probed using cDNA-specific region spanning from downstream of the leucine zipper region to 3′-untranslated regions of individual RISBZ cDNA clones. Hybridization was carried out at 45 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 5× Denhardt's solution, and then filters were washed four times at room temperature in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and twice at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 30 min each. Primer extension analysis was carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboraory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.79-7.83Google Scholar). A 30-mer antisense oligonucleotide (ATGGTATGGTGTTCCTAGCACAGGTGTAGC) was labeled at the 5′ end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then used as a primer for a reverse transcriptase reaction with poly(A)+ RNA using a SuperScript™ RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transgenic rice plants (O. sativa cv. Kitaake) were generated byAgrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation as described previously (28Goto F Yoshihara T. Shigemoto N. Toki S. Takaiwa F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of theRISBZ1 gene, located between positions −1674 and +4 and between positions −1674 and +213, were amplified by PCR using a forward and a reverse primers containing overhanging PstI and BamHI recognition sites, respectively. The PCR fragments were digested with PstI and BamHI and then introduced into the corresponding sites of pBI 201. After digestion with PstI and SacI, the chimeric genes composed of RISBZ1 promoter and GUS reporter gene was cloned into theSse8387I and SacI sites of the binary vector p8C-Hm containing CaMV 35 S promoter/hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. The coding sequences for the five RISBZ cDNAs were amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers that yielded the following restriction sites at the termini: RISBZ1,BamHI-blunt end; RISBZ2, BamHI-XhoI; RISBZ3, BamHI-SalI; RISBZ4,BamHI-SalI; and RISBZ5,BamHI-XhoI, respectively. After digestion, these cDNAs were inserted into the corresponding sites of pGEX- 4T-3 GST fusion expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotch). The GST-RISBZ fusion proteins were expressed and isolated as described (29Suzuki A. Wu C.-Y. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After purification by affinity chromatography, GST fusion proteins were dialyzed overnight against 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. A 21-base complementary single-stranded oligonucleotide from −175 to −155 containing an additional TCGA at the 5′ end was synthesized and annealed. These probes were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by fill-in reaction with Klenow fragment and fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide native gel. For the mutant competitors (M1–M7), 21-bp complementary oligonucleotides with successive mutations by three bases were synthesized and annealed. EMSAs were performed by the addition of GST-RISBZ1 fusion protein as described previously (8Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 29Suzuki A. Wu C.-Y. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).The radioactive probe was incubated with 0.5 μg of GST-RISBZ1 fusion proteins in binding buffer for 20 min at room temperature. For competition assays, 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNAs were added to the binding reaction. The mixture was loaded onto 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE (1×: 89 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) buffer at room temperature. Methylation interference experiments were carried out as described by Weinbergeret al. (30Weinberger J. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1986; 322: 846-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region between −245 and +18 was digested with SalI and BamHI and then end-labeled by fill-in reaction with Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dCTP, and then methylated by dimethylsulfate. This fragment was incubated with the GST-RISBZ1 fusion protein and fractionated by electrophoresis on 5% native acrylamide gel. After free and protein-bound DNA fragments were purified by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography, the fragments were electrophoresed on a 6% DNA sequencing gel containing 7 m urea in parallel with a DNA sequencing ladder. Full-length coding region and truncated cDNAs covering the basic domain of RISBZ1, RISBZ2, and RISBZ3 were amplified by PCR using a forward primer containing a 5′NcoI site and a reverse primer containing a termination codon and BamHI site. After digestion with NcoI and BamHI, the amplified DNA fragments were inserted into a pET-8c vector (Novagen). Translation products were prepared by coupledin vitro transcription/translation system (TNT®coupled wheat germ extract system, Promega) according to the manufactururer's instructions and used for gel mobility shift assays. One microgram of amplified DNA was used to produce full-length RISBZ proteins and truncated RISBZ proteins. For EMSA, 4 μl of the in vitro translation products were used in the binding reactions. A progressive deletion series of the RISBZ1 protein from the N terminus was generated by PCR-based construction. Forward primers corresponding to positions 41, 81, 121, 161, 201, and 235 residues from the N terminus and a reverse primer corresponding to the C terminus were used for the PCR. These primers contained an overhanging NcoI (to restore the AUG initiation codon) and BamHI site at the 5′ ends. After digestion with NcoI and BamHI, PCR fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Resulting DNA fragments were cloned in pRT100 (31Töpfer R. Matzeit V. Gronenborn B. Schell J. Steinbiss H.-H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To construct fusion plasmids with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (positions 1–147), various N-terminal regions of the RISBZ1 and RISBZ2 proteins were amplified by PCR withPfu Taq polymerase (Stratagene) using a forward primer and the reverse primer containing a BamHI site and a termination codon + SacI site at the 5′ ends, respectively. PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and SacI and then purified by 2% agarose gel. These fragments were fused in-frame downstream of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the p35S-564 vector digested with the same restriction enzymes. Introduction of site-directed mutations in the N-terminal region of the RISBZ1 was using a PCR-mediated mutagenesis technique (32Mikaelian I. Sergeant A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 376Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). After confirmation by DNA sequencing, the region between amino acid positions 1 and 57 were amplified by PCR and inserted downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain. 1 × 21-bp, 3 × 21-bp, 5 × 21-bp normal GCN4 and 3 × 21-bp mutant GCN4 motif/GUS reporter genes were constructed as described (8Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For construction of monomer and tetramer of 12 bp of normal GCN4 (GCTGAGTCATGA) and mutant GCN4 (GCTtccTCATGA), double-stranded oligonucleotides were generated by annealing the 12- and 48-base complementary oligonucleotide pairs containing the sticky ACGT sequence at the 5′ end of the sense strand, respectively. These double-stranded oligonucleotides were inserted into the SalI and StuI sites of −46 CaMV/GUS reporter gene. Transient expression in rice callus protoplasts was performed by electroporation as described previously (8Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). GUS activities were measured by fluorometric quantification of 4-methylumbelliferone produced from the glucuronide precursor according to Jefferson (33Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford method using a Bio-Rad kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Histochemical analysis of GUS gene expression was carried out as described previously (8Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Two degenerate primers, designed based on the highly conserved amino acid sequences, SNRESA and KVKMAED of the basic region of various O2-like bZIP transcription factors, were used for reverse-PCR using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from developing seeds. The resultant PCR products were cloned into TA cloning vector (pCR™ 2.1), and insert sequences of more than 50 TA clones were determined. Based on this analysis the amplified fragments, 213 bp long, could be classified into at least five types. Two nucleotide sequences were almost identical to those of the basic region of rice RITA-1 (20Izawa T. Foster R. Nakajima M. Shimamoto K. Chua N.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1277-1287PubMed Google Scholar) and REB cDNAs (21Nakase M. Aoki N. Matsuda T. Adachi T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The five inserts were then used as probes for screening a cDNA library prepared from rice maturing seeds to obtain full-length cDNA sequences. The screening was carried out under high stringency conditions to isolate the cDNA clones corresponding to each of cDNA fragments used as a probe. These cDNAs were designated as RISBZ (riceseed b-Zipper) 1, RISBZ2, RISBZ3, RISBZ4, and RISBZ5, respectively, according to degrees of their sequence homology. The sequences of the full-length RISBZ2 and RISBZ3 cDNAs are identical to REB and RITA1 cDNAs isolated from seed and leaf cDNA libraries, respectively (20Izawa T. Foster R. Nakajima M. Shimamoto K. Chua N.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1277-1287PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nakase M. Aoki N. Matsuda T. Adachi T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Three RISBZ cDNAs, RISBZ1, RISBZ4, and RISBZ5, were characterized in detail. RISBZ1 cDNA is 1742 bp long, excluding the poly(A) tail, and contains an open reading frame encoding a potential protein of 436 amino acids with a molecular mass of 46491 Da. RISBZ4 and RISBZ5 have open reading frames, which encode 278 and 295 amino acid residues, respectively. The deduced molecular mass of the RISBZ4 and RISBZ5 are 29,383 and 31,925 Da. The primary sequence deduced from the RISBZ1 cDNA is closely related to the rice REB (21Nakase M. Aoki N. Matsuda T. Adachi T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), maize OHP1 and OHP2 (22Pysh L.D. Aukerman M.J. Schmidt R.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and barley BLZ1 (18Vicente-Carbajos J. Onate L. Lara P. Diaz I. Carbonero P.

https://openalex.org/W1971005452,"Glucosinolates are natural plant products that have received rising attention due to their role in interactions between pests and crop plants and as chemical protectors against cancer. Glucosinolates are derived from amino acids and have aldoximes as intermediates. We report that cytochrome P450 CYP79F1 catalyzes aldoxime formation in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates inArabidopsis thaliana. Using recombinant CYP79F1 functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, we show that both dihomomethionine and trihomomethionine are metabolized by CYP79F1 resulting in the formation of 5-methylthiopentanaldoxime and 6-methylthiohexanaldoxime, respectively. 5-methylthiopentanaldoxime is the precursor of the major glucosinolates in leaves of A. thaliana, i.e.4-methylthiobutylglucosinolate and 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate, and a variety of other glucosinolates in Brassica sp. Transgenic A. thaliana with cosuppression of CYP79F1 have a reduced content of aliphatic glucosinolates and a highly increased level of dihomomethionine and trihomomethionine. The transgenic plants have a morphological phenotype showing loss of apical dominance and formation of multiple axillary shoots. Our data provide the first evidence that a cytochrome P450 catalyzes theN-hydroxylation of chain-elongated methionine homologues to the corresponding aldoximes in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates. Glucosinolates are natural plant products that have received rising attention due to their role in interactions between pests and crop plants and as chemical protectors against cancer. Glucosinolates are derived from amino acids and have aldoximes as intermediates. We report that cytochrome P450 CYP79F1 catalyzes aldoxime formation in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates inArabidopsis thaliana. Using recombinant CYP79F1 functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, we show that both dihomomethionine and trihomomethionine are metabolized by CYP79F1 resulting in the formation of 5-methylthiopentanaldoxime and 6-methylthiohexanaldoxime, respectively. 5-methylthiopentanaldoxime is the precursor of the major glucosinolates in leaves of A. thaliana, i.e.4-methylthiobutylglucosinolate and 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate, and a variety of other glucosinolates in Brassica sp. Transgenic A. thaliana with cosuppression of CYP79F1 have a reduced content of aliphatic glucosinolates and a highly increased level of dihomomethionine and trihomomethionine. The transgenic plants have a morphological phenotype showing loss of apical dominance and formation of multiple axillary shoots. Our data provide the first evidence that a cytochrome P450 catalyzes theN-hydroxylation of chain-elongated methionine homologues to the corresponding aldoximes in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates. expressed sequence tag reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry cauliflower mosaic virus 35S high pressure liquid chromatography Glucosinolates are amino acid-derived secondary plant products containing a sulfate and a thioglucose moiety. They are found in the order Capparales, which includes the economically important oilseed rape, Brassica vegetables, and the model plantArabidopsis thaliana L. Upon tissue damage, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by endogenous thioglucosidases (myrosinases) to produce a variety of degradation products, typically isothiocyanates, thiocyanates, and nitriles, which have a wide range of biological effects (1Fenwick G.R. Heaney R.K. Mullin J. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1983; 18: 123-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar, 2Chew F.S. Cutler H.G. Biologically Active Natural Products. American Chemical Society, Washington, DC1988: 155-181Google Scholar). Generally, the glucosinolate/myrosinase system is believed to be involved in plant defense. In addition, it has been shown that glucosinolates or rather the isothiocyanates, particularly sulforaphane, the isothiocyanate of 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate, have anticarcinogenic properties (3Zhang Y.

A. 1997; 94: 10367-10372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). There is a rising interest in being able to control the level of specific glucosinolates in crops to improve nutritional value and pest resistance. Glucosinolates are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indole glucosinolates, depending on whether they are derived from aliphatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine, or tryptophan (for review, see Ref. 5Halkier B.A. Ikan R. Naturally Occurring Glycosides: Chemistry, Distribution and Biological Properties. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1999: 193-223Google Scholar). The amino acid often undergoes a series of chain elongations prior to entering the biosynthetic pathway, and the glucosinolate product is often subject to secondary modifications such as hydroxylations, methylations, and oxidations giving rise to the structural diversity of glucosinolates. Biosynthetic intermediates common to all glucosinolates are aldoximes, thiohydroximates, and desulfoglucosinolates. The glucosinolates found in A. thaliana ecotype Columbia are derived from tryptophan, several chain-elongated methionine homologues, chain-elongated phenylalanine (6Hogge L.R. Reed D.W. Underhill E.W. Haughn G.W. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 26: 551-556Google Scholar), and phenylalanine (7Wittstock U. Halkier B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14659-14666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, the dihomomethionine-derived glucosinolates 4-methylthiobutylglucosinolate and 4-methylsulfinylglucosinolate account for more than 50% of the total glucosinolate content in the rosette leaves of A. thaliana(8Haughn G.W. Davin L. Giblin M. Underhill E.W. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A key step in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates is theN-hydroxylation of the precursor amino acids to the corresponding aldoximes. In the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides, a group of natural plant products closely related to glucosinolates, cytochromes P450 belonging to the CYP79 family catalyze the conversion of amino acids to aldoximes (9Halkier B.A. Nielsen H.N. Koch B. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Andersen M.D. Busk P.K. Svendsen I. Møller B.L. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1311-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The nature of the enzymes catalyzing the formation of aldoximes in glucosinolate biosynthesis has been discussed controversially (12Du L. Halkier B.A. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 425-431Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been provided for the involvement of CYP79 homologues in the biosynthesis of aromatic (7Wittstock U. Halkier B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14659-14666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and indole glucosinolates (13Hull A.K. Vij R. Celenza J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Regarding the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates, extensive biochemical studies with preparations of Brassica sp. and chain-elongated methionine homologues as substrates have suggested that aldoxime formation from these amino acids is not catalyzed by cytochromes P450, but by flavin-dependent monooxygenases (15Bennett R. Donald A. Dawson G.W. Hick A.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Bennett R. Ludwig-Müller J. Kiddle G. Hilgenberg W. Wallsgrove R.M.

In the present paper, we report the identification of a cytochrome P450 of the CYP79 family, CYP79F1, which catalyzes the conversion of dihomomethionine and trihomomethionine to 5-methylthiopentanaldoxime and 6-methylthiohexanaldoxime, respectively. The reduced levels of aliphatic glucosinolates and the accumulation of the chain-elongated precursor amino acids dihomomethionine and trihomomethionine in transgenic A. thaliana with CYP79F1 cosuppression is consistent with the involvement of CYP79F1 in the biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates. A. thaliana ecotype Columbia was used for all experiments. The plants were grown in a controlled-environment Arabidopsis Chamber (Ar-60 I, Percival, Boone, IA) at a photosynthetic flux of 100–200 μmol photons m−2 s−1, 20 °C, and 70% humidity. Unless otherwise stated, the photoperiod was 12-h light, 12-h dark. The expression construct was derived from the EST1 ATTS5112 (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Columbus, OH), which contains the full-length sequence of CYP79F1. The CYP79F1coding region was amplified from the EST by PCR with primer 1 (sense direction; 5′-CTCTAGATTCGAACATATGGCTAGCTTTACAACATCATTACC) and primer 2 (antisense direction; 5′-CGGGATCCTTAAGGACGGAACTTTGGATA). Primer 1 introduces an XbaI site upstream of the start codon and anNdeI restriction site at the start codon. To optimize the construct for E. coli expression (18Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) primer 1 changes the second codon from ATG to GCT and introduces a silent mutation in codon 5. Primer 2 introduces a BamHI restriction site immediately after the stop codon. The PCR reaction was set up in a total volume of 50 μl in Pwo polymerase PCR buffer with 2 mmMgSO4 using 2.5 units of Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1 μg of template DNA, 200 μmdNTPs, and 50 pmol of each primer. After incubation of the reaction at 94 °C for 5 min, 20 PCR cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C were run. The PCR fragment was digested with XbaI and BamHI and ligated into anXbaI/BamHI-digested pBluescript II SK (Stratagene). The cDNA was sequenced to exclude PCR errors and transferred from pBluescript II SK to anNdeI/BamHI-digested pSP19g10L expression vector (18Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Sequencing was performed on an ALF-Express (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Thermo Sequence Fluorescent-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (7-deaza-dGTP) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequence computer analysis was done with programs of the GCG Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package. The GAP program was used with a gap creation penalty of eight and a gap extension penalty of two to compare pairs of sequences. E. coli cells of strain JM109 (Stratagene) and strain C43(DE3) (19Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) transformed with the expression construct were grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin and used to inoculate 40 ml of modified TB medium containing 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin, 1 mm thiamine, 75 μg ml−1 δ-aminolevulinic acid, 1 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol, and 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The cultures were grown at 28 °C for 60 h at 125 rpm. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in buffer composed of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m sucrose, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 100 μg ml−1. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, Mg(OAc)2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. Spheroplasts were pelleted, resuspended in 3.2 ml of buffer composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 14 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 60 mm KOAc, pH 7.4, and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. After DNase treatment, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 30%. Temperature-induced Triton X-114 phase partitioning resulted in the formation of a detergent-rich phase containing the majority of the cytochrome P450 and a detergent-poor phase (9Halkier B.A. Nielsen H.N. Koch B. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Functional expression of CYP79F1 was monitored by Fe2+·CO versusFe2+ difference spectroscopy (20Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) performed on an SLM Aminco DW-2000 TM spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) using 10 μl of Triton X-114-rich phase in 990 μl of buffer containing 50 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and a few grains of sodium dithionite. The amount of functionalCYP79F1 was estimated based on an absorption coefficient of 91 liters mmol−1 cm−1. The activity of CYP79F1 was measured in E. coli spheroplasts reconstituted with NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase purified from Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench as described earlier (21Sibbesen O. Koch B. Halkier B.A. Møller B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3506-3511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In a typical enzyme assay, 5 μl of spheroplasts and 4 μl of NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase (equivalent to 0.04 units defined as 1 μmol of cytochromec/min) were incubated with substrate in buffer containing 30 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 3 mm NADPH, 3 mm reduced glutathione, 0.042% Tween 80, 1 mg ml−1l-α-dilauroylphosphatidylcholine in a total volume of 30 μl. Reaction mixtures containing spheroplasts ofE. coli C43(DE3) transformed with empty vector were used as controls in all assays. 3.3 μml-[U-14C]phenylalanine (453 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 3.7 μml-[U-14C]tyrosine (449 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.1 mml-[methyl-14C]methionine (56 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 24 μm-l-[side chain-3-14C]tryptophan (56.5 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were tested as potential substrates. After incubation at 28 °C for 1 h, half of the reaction mixture was analyzed by TLC on Silica Gel 60 F254 sheets (Merck) using toluene/ethyl acetate 5:1 (v/v) as eluent. Radiolabeled bands were visualized and quantified by STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For GC-MS analysis, 450 μl of reaction mixture containing 3.3 mml-methionine (Sigma), 3.3 mmdl-dihomomethionine or 3.3 mmdl-trihomomethionine, respectively, were incubated for 4 h at 25 °C and extracted with a total volume of 600 μl CHCl3. The organic phase was collected and evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 15 μl of CHCl3 and analyzed by GC-MS. GC-MS analysis was performed on an HP5890 Series II gas chromatograph directly coupled to a Jeol JMS-AX505W mass spectrometer. An SGE column (BPX5, 25 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-μm film thickness) was used (head pressure, 100-kPa, splitless injection). The oven temperature program was as follows: 80 °C for 3 min, 80 to 180 °C at 5 °C/min, 180 to 300 °C at 20 °C/min, 300 °C for 10 min. The ion source was run in EI mode (70 eV) at 200 °C. The retention times of the E- and Z-isomer of authentic 5-methylthiopentanaldoxime were 14.3 and 14.8 min. The two isomers had identical fragmentation patterns withm/z 130, 129, 113, 82, 61, and 55 as the most prominent peaks. The retention times of the E- andZ-isomer of authentic 6-methylthiohexanaldoxime were 17.1 and 17.6 min. The two isomers had identical fragmentation patterns withm/z 144, 143, 98, 96, 69, 61, and 55 as the most prominent peaks. dl-Dihomomethionine,dl-trihomomethionine, 5-methylthiopentanaldoxime, and 6-methylthiohexanaldoxime were synthesized as described previously (22Dawson G.W. Hick A.J. Bennett R.N. Donald A. Pickett J.A. Wallsgrove R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27154-27159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and authenticated by NMR spectroscopy. For kinetic measurements of the conversion ofdl-dihomomethionine and dl-trihomomethionine to the respective aldoximes by CYP79F1, enzymatic reactions were made essentially as described above. 5 nmol of phenylacetaldoxime was added to the reaction mixtures as internal standard. Product formation was determined after 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 70, and 120 min of incubation and quantified based on authentic standards. The reaction mixtures were extracted with a total volume of 600 μl of CHCl3. The organic phase was collected and evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in 15 μl of 50% ethanol and analyzed by LC-MS. LC-MS was done on an HP1100 LC coupled to a Bruker Esquire-LC ion trap mass spectrometer. The LC was performed on a C18 column (Chrompack Inertsil 3 ODS-3 S15 × 3 COL CP 29126) using mixtures of water (A) and acetonitrile (Fischer, “Far UV grade”) (B) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1. The elution program was as follows: 30% B (2 min), linear gradient 30–70% B (28 min), then linear gradient 70–100% (5 min). The electrospray ionization was done in positive ion mode. Each of the three aldoximes gave nicely separated peaks for the E- andZ-forms. The 210-nm UV trace was detected by the diode array detector and used for quantitation with the genuine software. To construct plants, which express the CYP79F1 cDNA under control of the CaMV35S promoter (35S:CYP79F1 plants), the CYP79F1 cDNA was PCR-amplified from the EST ATTS5112 (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center) using primer 3 (sense direction; 5′-AACTGCAGCATGATGAGCTTTACCACATC) and primer 4 (antisense direction; 5′-CGGGATCCTTAATGGTGGTGATGAGGACGGAACTTTGGATAA). Primer 3 is tailed with a PstI restriction site. Primer 4 introduces four codons coding for His before the stop codon and a BamHI restriction site after the stop codon. The PCR fragment containing theCYP79F1 cDNA was digested with PstI andBamHI, ligated into aPstI/BamHI-digested pBluescript II SK and sequenced to exclude PCR errors. The CYP79F1 cDNA was placed under control of the CaMV35S promoter by ligation into aPstI/BamHI-digested pSP48 (Danisco Biotechnology, Denmark). The expression cassette was excised by XbaI digestion and transferred to pPZP111 (23Hajdukiewicz P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 (24Zambryski P. Genetello C. Leemans J. Van Montagu M. Schell J. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) transformed with this construct was used for plant transformation by floral dip (25Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 0.005% Silwet L-77 and 5% sucrose in 10 mm MgCl2. Seeds were germinated on MS medium supplemented with 50 μg ml−1kanamycin, 2% sucrose, and 0.9% agar. Transformants were selected after 2 weeks and transferred to soil. Seeds of these plants were harvested, and kanamycin-resistant T2 plants were selected on the same medium. The procedure was repeated to obtain T3plants. The analysis was performed with tissue harvested from 9-week-old primary transformants and 7-week-old T3 plants. Simultaneously grown wild-type plants of the same ages were used as controls. The tissue (two to three rosette leaves from each plant) was freeze-dried for 48 h. Glucosinolates were analyzed as desulfoglucosinolates as follows: 3.5 ml of boiling 70% (v/v) methanol were added to 20 mg of freeze-dried material, 75 μl of internal standard (0.52 mm p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate; Bioraf, Denmark) were added, and the sample was incubated in a boiling water bath for 4 min. Plant material was pelleted, and the pellet was re-extracted with 3.5 ml of 70% (v/v) methanol and centrifuged. The supernatants were pooled and analyzed by HPLC after sulfatase treatment as described previously (7Wittstock U. Halkier B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14659-14666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The assignment of peaks was based on retention times, and UV spectra were compared with standard compounds. Glucosinolates were quantified in relation to the internal standard and by use of response factors (8Haughn G.W. Davin L. Giblin M. Underhill E.W. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Buchner R. Wathelet J.P. Glucosinolates in Rapeseed: Analytical Aspects. Martinus Nijhoff Publisher, Boston1987: 155-181Google Scholar). Rosette leaves of 7-week-old plants (250 mg from each plant) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized using mortar and pestle. The tissue was extracted in 2.5 ml of 80% methanol. The plant material was pelleted (20,000 × g, 10 min) and re-extracted in 2.5 ml of 80% methanol. The methanol phases were combined and dried in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in 100 μl of water. The individual protein amino acids in the sample were identified and quantified on an Ultropac 8 Resin reverse phase HPLC column (200 × 4.6 mm) on a Biochrom 20 amino acid analyzer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer. The elution program was modified to identify and quantify the chain-elongated homologues of methionine, dihomomethionine, and trihomomethionine. Each plant was analyzed in triplicate. For quantification of dihomomethionine in the plant material, the sample was subjected to two elution programs. Program 1 was as follows: 53 °C for 7 min, buffer A; 50 °C for 35 min, buffer A; 95 °C for 34 min, buffer A. Program 2 was as follows: 53 °C for 7 min, buffer A; 58 °C for 12 min, buffer B; 95 °C for 25 min, buffer C. Buffer A was 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 3.25, buffer B was 0.2 m sodium citrate, pH 4.25, and buffer C was 1.2m sodium citrate, pH 6.25. In program 1, phenylalanine and dihomomethionine coeluted at 63.6 min. In program 2, tyrosine and dihomomethionine coeluted at 25.3 min. Dihomomethionine was quantified as the difference between the peak area corresponding to phenylalanine and dihomomethionine in program 1 and the peak area corresponding to phenylalanine in program 2, and as the difference between the peak area corresponding to tyrosine and dihomomethionine in program 2 and the peak area corresponding to tyrosine in program 1. The response factor for dihomomethionine was determined using an authentic standard. For quantification of trihomomethionine in the plant material, the sample was subjected to program 3, which was as follows: 53 °C for 7 min, buffer A; 58 °C for 5 min, buffer B; 95 °C for 7 min, buffer B; 95 °C for 25 min, buffer C. Trihomomethionine eluted at 29.0 min and was quantified as the peak area using a response factor determined with an authentic standard. RNA was synthesized from pBluescript II SK vector (Stratagene) linearized by digestion withScaI. The synthesis reaction was set up in a total volume of 100 μl in Transcription Optimized buffer (Promega) supplemented with 500 μm rNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 units of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), 3 μg of linearized pBluescript II SK, and 50 units of T3 RNA polymerase (Promega). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, 20 units of RNase-free DNase was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for another 1 h. Following phenol-CHCl3 extraction and precipitation with ethanol (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 2.1.1-2.1.3Google Scholar), the RNA was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The control RNA was used to check for inhibition of RT reactions by components of RNA preparations obtained from different plant tissues. To study the expression pattern of CYP79F1 in wild-type A. thaliana, the following tissues were investigated: 1) total plant tissue of 4-week-old plants (grown in 8-h light/16-h dark); 2) rosette leaves (without petioles) and 3) above-ground parts of 5-week-old plants (before onset of floral transition; grown at 8-h light/16-h dark); 4) rosette leaves (without petioles); and 5) cauline leaves of flowering plants (9 weeks old; grown at 12-h light/12-h dark to induce flowering). To study transcript levels in 35S:CYP79F1 plants, rosette leaves of 7-week-old 35S:CYP79F1 plants and of simultaneously grown 7-week-old wild-type plants were analyzed. Total RNA was isolated from plant tissue using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and used to synthesize first-strand cDNA. To ensure linearity of the RT-PCR, first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed on 1, 0.3, and 0.1 μg of each pool of RNA. The cDNA was synthesized in First Strand buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.5 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 ng of random hexamers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 3 pg of control RNA (internal standard), and 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 27 °C for 10 min followed by incubation at 42 °C for 50 min and inactivation at 95 °C for 5 min. The RT reactions were purified by means of a PCR purification kit (Qiagen; elution with 50 μl of 1 mm Tris buffer, pH 8). 2 μl of the purified RT reactions was subjected to PCR. The PCR reactions were set up in a total volume of 50 μl in PCR buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 200 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 pmol of sense primer, 50 pmol of antisense primer, and 2.5 units of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR program was as follows: 2 min at 94 °C, 23–37 cycles (depending on transcript as specified below) of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 53–57 °C (depending on transcript as specified below), 50 s at 72 °C. The following primers and specific conditions were used: for CYP79F1primer 5 (sense direction; 5′-AAAGCTCAATGCGTAGAAT) and primer 6 (antisense direction; 5′-TTTTTAGACACCATCTTGTTTTCTTCTTC) with 53 °C and 32 cycles, for CYP79F2 primer 7 (sense direction; 5′-AAAGCTCAATGCGTCGAAT) and primer 8 (antisense direction; 5′-GCGTCGAAACACATCACAGAG) with 53 °C and 37 cycles, forCYP79B2 primer 9 (sense direction; 5′-AGACGAACAAGGCAACCCA) and primer 10 (antisense direction; 5′-TCATAAAATATATACGGCGTCG) with 53 °C and 34 cycles, for CYP79B3 primer 11 (sense direction; 5′-GGACGAAGCTGGCCAGCCT) and primer 12 (antisense direction; 5′-TCCTCGCCGTACGTCACCG) with 55 °C and 32 cycles, foractin1 primer 13 (sense direction; 5′-TGGAACTGGAATGGTTAAGGCTGG) and primer 14 (antisense direction; 5′-TCTCCAGAGTCGAGCACAATACCG) with 57 °C and 23 cycles, for control RNA (internal standard) primer 15 (sense direction; 5′-TGTAGCGGCGCATTAAGC) and primer 16 (antisense direction; 5′-CAAAAGAATAGACCGAGATAGGG) with 57 °C and 32 cycles. 10 μl of the PCR reactions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. Bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and quantified on a Gel Doc 2000 Transilluminator (Bio-Rad). Primers and PCR conditions were optimized to ensure amplification of the specific cDNAs. No PCR products from genomic DNA were obtained. PCR analysis of the internal standard showed that the RT reactions ran with the same efficiency in samples prepared with different amounts of RNA isolated from different plant tissues. Cytochromes P450 of the CYP79 family have previously been shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. CYP79F1 is one of severalCYP79 homologues identified in the genome of A. thaliana. The deduced amino acid sequence of CYP79F1has 88% identity with the deduced amino acid sequence ofCYP79F2 and 39–46% identity with other CYP79homologues from glucosinolate and cyanogenic glucoside-containing species. A full-length EST of CYP79F1 (ATTS5112) was identified by a data base search. The cDNA obtained from the EST clone was used for expression of CYP79F1 in E. coli using the vector pSP19g10L, which is optimized for expression of cytochromes P450 (18Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The CYP79F1 expression construct was transformed into two different E. coli strains, C43(DE3) and JM109. A CO difference spectrum with the characteristic peak at 450 nm was obtained for CYP79F1 expressed in strain C43(DE3), indicating the presence of functional cytochrome P450 (Fig. 1). Based on the peak at 450 nm, the expression level of CYP79F1 inE. coli C43(DE3) was estimated to be 110 nmol of cytochrome P450 (liters of culture)−1. A peak at 418 nm was detected in all preparations independent of whether E. coliwas transformed with a cytochrome P450 expression construct or the empty vector. The origin of the peak at 418 nm is unknown, but could possibly be derived from endogenous heme proteins (28Porter T.D. Larson J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The absence of a peak at 450 nm in the CO difference spectrum obtained with a preparation of E. coli strain JM109 harboring the CYP79F1 expression construct indicates low expression level or failure of expression of functional protein. Recombinant CYP79F1 was therefore obtained by use of strain C43(DE3) for all further experiments. To identify substrates of CYP79F1, activity measurements were carried out using spheroplasts of E. coli C43(DE3) reconstituted with NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase from S. bicolor. When the reaction mixture containing CYP79F1 was incubated withdl-dihomomethionine, two compounds, which were not present in the control reactions, were detected by GC-MS (Fig.2). The retention times and the mass spectral fragmentation patterns of these compounds were identical with those of the E/Z-isomers of the authentic standard of 5-methylthiopentanaldoxime. Whendl-trihomomethionine was administered to the reaction mixture"

Alternatively, nontoxic levels of ROS like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can mediate the transmission of many intracellular signals, including those involved in growth and transformation. To identify pathways downstream of endogenous cellular H2O2 production, the response of Rat-1 fibroblasts exhibiting differential HER-2/Neu receptor tyrosine kinase activity to removal of physiological H2O2 concentrations was investigated. The proliferation of all cells was abolished by addition of the H2O2 scavenger catalase to the culture medium. HER-2/Neu activity was not significantly affected by catalase treatment, suggesting that the target(s) of the H2O2 signal lie downstream of the receptor in our model. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was blocked by catalase in fibroblasts expressing wild type Neu, however such a response did not occur in cells possessing activated mutant Neu. This indicates that the ERK1/2 response contributes little to the growth inhibition observed. By contrast, JNK1 activity increased following the addition of catalase or H2O2, regardless of Neu activity or level of cell transformation. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was induced by H2O2 but not by catalase.

Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Jun/AP-1 transcription factors by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) members of the SAPKs has been shown to induce apoptosis in several cell types (3Leppä S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). This signal is in contrast to the other characterized roles of c-Jun/AP-1 activity in survival and growth. For example, Jun proteins associate with Nrf 1 and 2 transcription factors to up-regulate the antioxidant/electrophile response element-mediated gene expression as a defense against oxidative stress (4Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Similarly, NF-κB was originally identified as a mediator of tumor necrosis factor α- and ROS-induced apoptosis but more recently has also been characterized as part of a survival response by stimulating antioxidant response element-regulated and anti-apoptotic protein expression (5Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 6Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Indeed, ROS, like H2O2, are associated with the regulation of multiple cellular processes via interaction with proteins and lipid species (7Burdon R.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the idea that ROS are required “cofactors” in the regulation of many intracellular signal transduction cascades. Addition of micromolar concentrations of H2O2 to cells in vitro can activate plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor/ErbB-1 (8Gamou S. Shimizu N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (9Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.-X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The p21 Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, a key growth signal linking membrane receptors to the nucleus, is also stimulated by oxidative stimuli such as H2O2 (11Guyton K.Z. Liu Y.

Rapid induction of cellular H2O2 generation has been observed to follow the addition of a variety of peptide growth factors to cells, suggesting an autocrine and/or paracrine role for ROS in growth signaling (13Bae Y.S.

The specific molecular targets that are critical for H2O2-mediated mitogenesis have yet to be determined; the importance of a given pathway is also dependent on factors such as cell type, environment, and level of differentiation.It follows that the deregulation of ROS levels may be a key factor in neoplasia. Elevations in O⨪2 and H2O2are seen in some human tumor cell lines (16Szatrowski T.P. Nathan C.F. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 794-798PubMed Google Scholar), and their production from mitochondrial and plasma membrane sources appears to be a requirement of tumor viability and growth (17Oberley T.D. Oberley L.W. Histol. Histopathol. 1997; 12: 525-535PubMed Google Scholar, 18Del Bello B. Paolicchi A. Comporti M. Pompella A. Maellaro E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mitochondria-localized manganese-containing superoxide dismutase is proposed to act as a both an inhibitor (19Li J.-J. Oberley L.W. St. Clair D.K. Ridnour L.A. Oberley T.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1989-2000PubMed Google Scholar) and activator (20Wenk J. Brenneisen P. Wlaschek M. Poswig A. Briviba K. Oberley T.D. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25869-25876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) of growth and transformation. A higher oxidative capacity of cancer cells may also accompany an increase in resistance to ROS stress, which could in turn affect drug resistance. For instance, resistance to H2O2stress by the acquired up-regulation of catalase activity and glutathione levels was shown to be crucial for maintenance of cell viability as well as resistance to cisplatin treatment (21Spitz D.R. Phillips J.W. Adams D.T. Sherman C.M. Deen D.F. Li G.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In theory, the oxidative stress response may be shifted from growth arrest and death to proliferation and transformation for cells exhibiting defects in growth pathway regulation and the apoptotic program (22Ishikawa Y. Kitamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). If the H2O2 signal is involved in these processes, they should be inhibited by its removal from the cellular environment.In the present study the requirement of low levels of H2O2 for Rat-1 fibroblast proliferation was investigated. The effects on defined growth- and stress-associated signaling pathways, produced by the scavenging of physiological H2O2 levels from the extracellular environment, were assessed. Rat-1 clones exhibiting differential growth and transformation properties resulting from specific alterations of the HER-2/Neu receptor were utilized as a model for the responses to removal of the H2O2 stimulus (23Siegel P.M. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8878-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Multiple signals downstream of Neu are implicated in oncogenesis, and Neu overexpression and/or activating mutation is observed in 25–30% of human breast and ovarian cancers (for review see Ref. 25Reese D.M. Slamon D.J. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The activities of the Neu receptor, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) MAPK and JNK1 effector pathways were studied after the addition of the H2O2 scavenger catalase. All Rat-1 clones displayed comparable sensitivities to growth inhibition by this treatment regardless of the level of Neu activity. It was found that scavenging of H2O2 caused stable inhibition of the ERK1/2 signal, transient induction of the JNK1 pathway, and no effect on p38 MAPK. Constitutive Neu activation could rescue the catalase-mediated block of ERK1/2 activity while only slightly increasing resistance to growth inhibition. Therefore, these results indicate that removal of extracellular H2O2 can both down-regulate growth signals and activate stress-associated signals, however, the stress response appears to play a larger role in the anti-proliferative effects observed.DISCUSSIONThis is the first report describing the effects of the removal of endogenously produced H2O2 upon specific mitogenic and stress-responsive signaling pathways. To remove H2O2 from the cellular environment, a catalase preparation was directly added to the culture media. This strategy was adopted so that the molecular signaling responses observed could be attributed to changes in H2O2 status at the plasma membrane. One potential problem with this approach is enzyme purity, raising concerns that the effects observed could result from contaminants. To address this issue, we compared the effects of catalase to heat-inactivated catalase in all experiments. Incubation with the heat-inactivated solution did not affect cell viability and growth, nor did it affect Neu receptor or ERK activities. JNK1 activity did increase upon the addition of heat-inactivated catalase, but at a 2- to 3-fold lower level than that observed after treatment with active catalase. A comparable A. niger catalase preparation markedly reduced extracellular H2O2 levels, whereas heat inactivation of this treatment blocked the effect. In addition, catalase-induced growth inhibition was rescued upon cotreatment of cells with H2O2-generating glucose oxidase. The levels of glucose oxidase activity required for this rescue were cytotoxic if added alone, indicating that the two enzymes are inversely affecting H2O2 levels. These results provide evidence that the responses to the catalase preparation used specifically reflect its H2O2scavenging activity. It is likely that changes in the concentration of extracellular H2O2 will in turn affect intracellular redox status, because H2O2 can freely diffuse across cell membranes. Therefore, the effects of the catalase treatment used here are best described as a response to the alteration of the “pericellular” redox environment, which is both outside and inside of the plasma membrane. Certainly the fact, that Neu receptor activity was not greatly changed by the addition of catalase to cell cultures whereas various MAPK signaling cascades were, indicates that direct manipulation of intracellular signals by this type of treatment occur.One such affected signal was the ERK1/2 pathway. The inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation observed with catalase addition (and up-regulation observed with H2O2) to Rat-1NeuN cells agrees with the previous findings that demonstrate the responsiveness of the MAPK cascade to H2O2 (11Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar,12Zhang J. Jin N. Liu Y. Rhoades R.A. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of the Neu receptor in Rat-1 Neu8142 cells induced basal ERK1/2 activity and protected it from catalase-induced inhibition. Neu interacts with several signaling cascades, including the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway, important in ERK1/2 regulation (25Reese D.M. Slamon D.J. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The rescue of ERK phosphorylation was accompanied by only a slight increase in resistance of fibroblasts to growth inhibition by catalase. This result indicates that, although contributing to the cellular responses observed, ERK1/2 signal down-regulation is not critical for them.Unlike the ERK response, the stress-activated JNK1 signal was rapidly and transiently induced by treatments that both increased and decreased H2O2 in Rat-1NeuN and Rat-1Neu8142 lines. JNK1 is known to be responsive to oxidative stress (2Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 32Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), but our findings suggest an additional role for this signal in response to an antioxidant. Rac1 and Cdc42, members of the Rho family of small GTPases involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation and cell transformation, have been shown to activate the JNKs through interaction with p21-activated kinase (33Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 34Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, Rac1 is a cytoplasmic component of the plasma membrane-localized NAD(P)H oxidase complex that directs the extracellular generation of O⨪2 and its dismutase product H2O2 (35Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the function of this complex appears to be essential not only for ROS generation but also for cell survival and growth (15Patterson C. Ruef J. Madamanchi N.R. Barry-Lane P. Hu Z. Horaist C. Ballinger C.A. Brasier A.R. Bode C. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19814-19822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 36Shin E.A. Kim K.H. Han S.I. Ha K.S. Kim J.-H. Kang K.I. Kim H.D. Kang H.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It follows that Rac may stimulate the JNK pathway through p21-activated kinase as well as H2O2 production.Because our data demonstrate MAPK inhibition and SAPK activation after catalase treatment, it could be that loss of the H2O2 stimulus blocks the Ras pathway while inducing other JNK-dependent signals like phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and Rac. Recent evidence suggests that PI3K can play dual roles: the survival-promoting PI3K target Akt kinase (protein kinase B) was shown to phosphorylate Rac1 at serine 71 and abolish its GTPase activity (37Kwon T. Kwon D.Y. Chun J. Kim J.H. Kang S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 423-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Treatment of our Rat-1 fibroblast lines with a 5 μm concentration of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (38Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inhibited cell proliferation to a comparable extent regardless of HER-2/Neu activity levels (not shown). Thus, changes to the PI3K/Akt signal might contribute to the catalase-induced effects upon JNK1 observed; however, this remains to be determined.The role of JNK in cell cycle control is not known. c-Jun contributes to a number of contrasting biological processes as part of the AP-1 transcriptional complex (3Leppä S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The degree of SAPK activity balanced with other AP-1-inducing signals such as the ERKs could decide which process is followed. In our system, ERK inhibition and JNK activation are observed with cell growth arrest. Studies by Wisdom et al.(31Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) demonstrate that JNK-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun is specific for stress responses only, whereas c-Jun involvement in cell cycle progression is triggered by other factors. Another report indicates that the JNK signal can prolong the cell cycle at S and G2/M phases in a p53-independent manner (39Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), however, the mechanisms underlying this effect have yet to be elucidated. Indeed, we observed an increase of the proportion of cells in S and G2phases after incubation with catalase (results not shown). Because cells remain trapped in the late stages of the cell cycle, apoptosis may then be triggered by a “mitotic crisis.”In conclusion, this work demonstrates that H2O2regulates components of various MAPK cascades to allow for the efficient growth of cultured Rat-1 fibroblasts. ERK1/2 activities are induced upon the addition of H2O2 and inhibited by its removal. Expression of constitutively activated Neu receptor reversed this inhibition but had little effect on the catalase-induced block of proliferation. However, the stress-activated JNK1 pathway was induced by both the addition and removal of the H2O2 signal, regardless of Neu status. Another stress signal, the p38 MAPK pathway, was activated by toxic levels of H2O2 but not by its removal, indicating that the JNK1 response might be specific. A discreet range of JNK activation may act as a cell sensor of oxidative and reducing stresses, leading to a response of growth arrest and death. Oxidative stress is known to induce the cellular apoptotic program by the activation of defined ROS1-responsive signals: the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways ((1), for review see Ref. 2Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Jun/AP-1 transcription factors by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) members of the SAPKs has been shown to induce apoptosis in several cell types (3Leppä S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). This signal is in contrast to the other characterized roles of c-Jun/AP-1 activity in survival and growth. For example, Jun proteins associate with Nrf 1 and 2 transcription factors to up-regulate the antioxidant/electrophile response element-mediated gene expression as a defense against oxidative stress (4Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Similarly, NF-κB was originally identified as a mediator of tumor necrosis factor α- and ROS-induced apoptosis but more recently has also been characterized as part of a survival response by stimulating antioxidant response element-regulated and anti-apoptotic protein expression (5Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 6Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar).

In theory, the oxidative stress response may be shifted from growth arrest and death to proliferation and transformation for cells exhibiting defects in growth pathway regulation and the apoptotic program (22Ishikawa Y. Kitamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). If the H2O2 signal is involved in these processes, they should be inhibited by its removal from the cellular environment. In the present study the requirement of low levels of H2O2 for Rat-1 fibroblast proliferation was investigated. The effects on defined growth- and stress-associated signaling pathways, produced by the scavenging of physiological H2O2 levels from the extracellular environment, were assessed. Rat-1 clones exhibiting differential growth and transformation properties resulting from specific alterations of the HER-2/Neu receptor were utilized as a model for the responses to removal of the H2O2 stimulus (23Siegel P.M. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8878-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Dankort D.L. Wang Z. Blackmore V. Moran M.F. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5410-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Multiple signals downstream of Neu are implicated in oncogenesis, and Neu overexpression and/or activating mutation is observed in 25–30% of human breast and ovarian cancers (for review see Ref. 25Reese D.M. Slamon D.J. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The activities of the Neu receptor, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) MAPK and JNK1 effector pathways were studied after the addition of the H2O2 scavenger catalase. All Rat-1 clones displayed comparable sensitivities to growth inhibition by this treatment regardless of the level of Neu activity. It was found that scavenging of H2O2 caused stable inhibition of the ERK1/2 signal, transient induction of the JNK1 pathway, and no effect on p38 MAPK. Constitutive Neu activation could rescue the catalase-mediated block of ERK1/2 activity while only slightly increasing resistance to growth inhibition. Therefore, these results indicate that removal of extracellular H2O2 can both down-regulate growth signals and activate stress-associated signals, however, the stress response appears to play a larger role in the anti-proliferative effects observed. DISCUSSIONThis is the first report describing the effects of the removal of endogenously produced H2O2 upon specific mitogenic and stress-responsive signaling pathways. To remove H2O2 from the cellular environment, a catalase preparation was directly added to the culture media. This strategy was adopted so that the molecular signaling responses observed could be attributed to changes in H2O2 status at the plasma membrane. One potential problem with this approach is enzyme purity, raising concerns that the effects observed could result from contaminants. To address this issue, we compared the effects of catalase to heat-inactivated catalase in all experiments. Incubation with the heat-inactivated solution did not affect cell viability and growth, nor did it affect Neu receptor or ERK activities. JNK1 activity did increase upon the addition of heat-inactivated catalase, but at a 2- to 3-fold lower level than that observed after treatment with active catalase. A comparable A. niger catalase preparation markedly reduced extracellular H2O2 levels, whereas heat inactivation of this treatment blocked the effect. In addition, catalase-induced growth inhibition was rescued upon cotreatment of cells with H2O2-generating glucose oxidase. The levels of glucose oxidase activity required for this rescue were cytotoxic if added alone, indicating that the two enzymes are inversely affecting H2O2 levels. These results provide evidence that the responses to the catalase preparation used specifically reflect its H2O2scavenging activity. It is likely that changes in the concentration of extracellular H2O2 will in turn affect intracellular redox status, because H2O2 can freely diffuse across cell membranes. Therefore, the effects of the catalase treatment used here are best described as a response to the alteration of the “pericellular” redox environment, which is both outside and inside of the plasma membrane. Certainly the fact, that Neu receptor activity was not greatly changed by the addition of catalase to cell cultures whereas various MAPK signaling cascades were, indicates that direct manipulation of intracellular signals by this type of treatment occur.One such affected signal was the ERK1/2 pathway. The inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation observed with catalase addition (and up-regulation observed with H2O2) to Rat-1NeuN cells agrees with the previous findings that demonstrate the responsiveness of the MAPK cascade to H2O2 (11Guyton K.Z.

Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of the Neu receptor in Rat-1 Neu8142 cells induced basal ERK1/2 activity and protected it from catalase-induced inhibition. Neu interacts with several signaling cascades, including the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway, important in ERK1/2 regulation (25Reese D.M. Slamon D.J. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The rescue of ERK phosphorylation was accompanied by only a slight increase in resistance of fibroblasts to growth inhibition by catalase. This result indicates that, although contributing to the cellular responses observed, ERK1/2 signal down-regulation is not critical for them.Unlike the ERK response, the stress-activated JNK1 signal was rapidly and transiently induced by treatments that both increased and decreased H2O2 in Rat-1NeuN and Rat-1Neu8142 lines. JNK1 is known to be responsive to oxidative stress (2Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 32Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), but our findings suggest an additional role for this signal in response to an antioxidant. Rac1 and Cdc42, members of the Rho family of small GTPases involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation and cell transformation, have been shown to activate the JNKs through interaction with p21-activated kinase (33Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 34Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, Rac1 is a cytoplasmic component of the plasma membrane-localized NAD(P)H oxidase complex that directs the extracellular generation of O⨪2 and its dismutase product H2O2 (35Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the function of this complex appears to be essential not only for ROS generation but also for cell survival and growth (15Patterson C. Ruef J. Madamanchi N.R. Barry-Lane P. Hu Z.

Ha K.S. Kim J.-H. Kang K.I. Kim H.D. Kang H.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It follows that Rac may stimulate the JNK pathway through p21-activated kinase as well as H2O2 production.Because our data demonstrate MAPK inhibition and SAPK activation after catalase treatment, it could be that loss of the H2O2 stimulus blocks the Ras pathway while inducing other JNK-dependent signals like phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and Rac. Recent evidence suggests that PI3K can play dual roles: the survival-promoting PI3K target Akt kinase (protein kinase B) was shown to phosphorylate Rac1 at serine 71 and abolish its GTPase activity (37Kwon T. Kwon D.Y. Chun J. Kim J.H. Kang S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 423-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Treatment of our Rat-1 fibroblast lines with a 5 μm concentration of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (38Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inhibited cell proliferation to a comparable extent regardless of HER-2/Neu activity levels (not shown). Thus, changes to the PI3K/Akt signal might contribute to the catalase-induced effects upon JNK1 observed; however, this remains to be determined.The role of JNK in cell cycle control is not known. c-Jun contributes to a number of contrasting biological processes as part of the AP-1 transcriptional complex (3Leppä S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The degree of SAPK activity balanced with other AP-1-inducing signals such as the ERKs could decide which process is followed. In our system, ERK inhibition and JNK activation are observed with cell growth arrest. Studies by Wisdom et al.(31Wisdom R. Johnson R.S. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) demonstrate that JNK-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun is specific for stress responses only, whereas c-Jun involvement in cell cycle progression is triggered by other factors. Another report indicates that the JNK signal can prolong the cell cycle at S and G2/M phases in a p53-independent manner (39Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), however, the mechanisms underlying this effect have yet to be elucidated. Indeed, we observed an increase of the proportion of cells in S and G2phases after incubation with catalase (results not shown). Because cells remain trapped in the late stages of the cell cycle, apoptosis may then be triggered by a “mitotic crisis.”In conclusion, this work demonstrates that H2O2regulates components of various MAPK cascades to allow for the efficient growth of cultured Rat-1 fibroblasts. ERK1/2 activities are induced upon the addition of H2O2 and inhibited by its removal. Expression of constitutively activated Neu receptor reversed this inhibition but had little effect on the catalase-induced block of proliferation. However, the stress-activated JNK1 pathway was induced by both the addition and removal of the H2O2 signal, regardless of Neu status. Another stress signal, the p38 MAPK pathway, was activated by toxic levels of H2O2 but not by its removal, indicating that the JNK1 response might be specific. A discreet range of JNK activation may act as a cell sensor of oxidative and reducing stresses, leading to a response of growth arrest and death.

Their metabolism to the triphosphate form is central to their chemotherapeutic efficacy. Although the nucleoside kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of these compounds have been well described, the nucleotidases that may mediate drug resistance through dephosphorylation remain obscure. We have cloned and characterized a novel human cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase (cN-I) that potentially may have an important role in nucleoside analog metabolism. It is expressed at a high level in skeletal and heart muscle, at an intermediate level in pancreas and brain, and at a low level in kidney, testis, and uterus. The recombinant cN-I showed high affinity toward dCMP and lower affinity toward AMP and IMP. ADP was necessary for maximal catalytic activity. Expression of cN-I in Jurkat and HEK 293 cells conferred resistance to 2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine, with a 49-fold increase in the IC50 in HEK 293 and a greater than 400-fold increase in the IC50 in Jurkat cells. Expression of cN-I also conferred a 22-fold increase in the IC50 to 2′,3′-difluorodeoxycytidine in HEK 293 cells and an 82-fold increase in the IC50 to 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine in Jurkat cells. These data indicate that cN-I may play an important role in the regulation of physiological pyrimidine nucleotide pools and may also alter the therapeutic efficacy of certain nucleoside analogs.AF331801 Nucleoside analogs are important in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, and viral infections.

These compounds are taken up by cells through nucleoside transporters in the cell membrane or, in the case of more lipophilic drugs, through diffusion (1Cass C.E. Georgopapadaku N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Therapy. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 403-451Google Scholar, 2Plagemann P.G.W. Wohlhuter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys.

Once in the cytoplasm, the nucleoside analogs are substrates for phosphorylation by the nucleoside kinases of the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway (reviewed in Ref. 4Arner E.S. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The enzyme 2′-deoxycytidine kinase phosphorylates dAdo, dCyd, and dGuo as well as the analogs AraC,1dFdC, and CdA, whereas thymidine kinase 1 phosphorylates dThd and dUrd as well as the analogs d4T and 5-FU. Phosphorylation to the monophosphate form is considered the rate-limiting step of activation of nucleoside analogs (4Arner E.S. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Nucleoside analog monophosphates are rapidly phosphorylated to their triphosphate forms, which are believed to mediate their cytotoxic activities by several different mechanisms (reviewed in Ref. 5Grant S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 197-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, they can be directly incorporated into DNA, leading to chain termination, or they can inhibit DNA synthesis by direct inhibition of DNA polymerase. It has recently been demonstrated that certain of these metabolites, including CdATP, AraATP, and F-AraATP, can induce apoptosis in nonproliferating cells by interacting with cytochromec and apoptosis protein-activating factor-1 (APAF-1) to cleave and activate the caspases responsible for the induction of apoptosis (6Leoni L.M. Chao Q. Cottam H.B. Genini D. Rosenbach M. Carrera C.J. Budihardjo I. Wang X. Carson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9567-9571Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Genini D.

In contrast, the triphosphates of antiretroviral compounds, such as 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC) and d4T, inhibit the reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus through chain termination. Cytotoxicity can occur when these compounds are incorporated into nuclear or mitochondrial DNA (reviewed in Ref.8Lewis W. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Resistance to nucleoside analogs is a significant clinical problem and can be caused by a number of factors affecting the metabolism of the drugs, including decreased numbers of nucleoside transporters, increased deamination of cytidine and adenosine analogs, loss of expression of activating kinases, modulation of the downstream apoptotic machinery, and increased activity of nucleotidases that catalyze the conversion of nucleotides back to nucleosides (reviewed in Ref. 5Grant S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 197-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-nucleotidases oppose the action of nucleoside kinases by dephosphorylating the monophosphate form of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs and, therefore, are likely to be important in determining the sizes and turnover rates of the deoxyribonucleotide pools. Thus, 5′-nucleotidases that catabolize the monophosphates of nucleoside analogs used in the clinic will lower their clinical efficacy. To date, the substrate specificity of the cytosolic nucleotidases responsible for dephosphorylation and inactivation of nucleoside monophosphates has not been well defined. Among several potentially important 5′-nucleotidases, only human cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II) has been studied in detail. cN-II is a 65-kDa protein that is strongly activated by ATP and prefers IMP to AMP as a substrate (9Oka J.

This 5′-nucleotidase is activated by ADP and prefers AMP to IMP as a substrate (20Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although recent kinetic data suggest that cN-I may participate in deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate catabolism (17Garvey E.P. Lowen G.T. Almond M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9043-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the role of this enzyme in nucleoside analog resistance has never been examined. Thus we hypothesize that cN-I might play a role in dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates and in inactivation of nucleoside analogs. To determine the role of the human cN-I enzyme in normal nucleotide metabolism as well as in drug resistance, we have cloned the human cN-I cDNA, defined the substrate specificity of the recombinant cN-I protein, and investigated the role of this enzyme in nucleoside analog resistance. AraC, ddC, CdA, F-AraA, 5-FU, d4T, and AraCMP were purchased from Sigma. CdAMP was manufactured by Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). Compound 506U (AraG prodrug) was obtained from Glaxo-Wellcome (Research Triangle Park, NC), dFdC was a gift from Lilly, and F-AraAMP was obtained from Berlex (Richmond, CA). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using human heart poly(A) mRNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Primers were designed to overlap the 5′ (TAAGCTTGGTACCATGGAACCTGGGCAGCCCCGGGAGCCCCAG) and 3′ (CTACTGTGCAGATGGGGCCTGCTTTGC) ends of the cDNA-coding region. The reverse transcription reaction was performed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcription (Promega, Madison, WI), the PCR reaction was performed with Pfu Turbo (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a buffer containing 10% Me2SO followed by 10 cycles withTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) to enable cloning into the TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and individual clones were sequenced. Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRI REAGENT (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Fifteen μg of total RNA was loaded on each lane and separated in 1% agarose, 100 mm MOPS buffer, and 2.0 m formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, UV-cross-linked, and baked at 80 °C for 1 h. Blots were prehybridized in 1% SDS, 0.1 mNaCl at room temperature for 1 h and at 42 °C in High Efficiency Hybridization System containing 50% formamide (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) for 1 h. The32P-labeled 671-base pair probe (extending from base pair 437 to base pair 1107 of the cN-I cDNA sequence) was then added and hybridized overnight at 42 °C. The blots were washed for 30 min at 55 °C and for 30 min at 60 °C in 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.2% SDS and autoradiographed. The 32P-labeled β-actin probe was hybridized as described above and washed twice for 15 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS and twice for 20 min at 50 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. cN-I was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies) according to the product protocol. Briefly, the cN-I construct was subcloned into the PDR120 transfer vector and transfected into DH10Bac cells. Bacmid was isolated from DH10Bac bacterial colonies, and baculovirus was produced by infecting Sf9 cells with bacmid DNA and harvesting virus from the media after cell lysis. For protein purification, Sf9 cells were collected 4 days after infection, pelleted, and frozen at −80 °C. Recombinant human cN-I was purified using a modification of previously published protocols for purification of the rabbit enzyme (16Yamazaki Y. Truong V.L. Lowenstein J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Garvey E.P. Lowen G.T. Almond M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9043-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells (7.7 g) were resuspended in 40 ml of extraction buffer containing 40 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.0, 15% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmbenzamidine, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were homogenized 3 × 10 s with a tissue homogenizer (Tekmar Tissumizer, Cincinnati, OH) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C to pellet membranes. The pellet was re-homogenized, and the supernatants were combined. cN-I was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate, and the resulting pellet was solubilized in 2 ml of extraction buffer and dialyzed against 3 changes of buffer A (40 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.0, 15% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm MgCl2) overnight. After dialysis the sample was rehomogenized in 11 ml of buffer A and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 g of wet Whatman P11-cellulose phosphate (Whatman, Kent, ME). The phosphocellulose was centrifuged to remove unbound proteins, resuspended in buffer A, and transferred into a column. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with 100 ml each of 0.25m NaCl, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.6 m NaCl, and 2 m NaCl/2.1 mm sodium phosphate. Fractions containing cN-I activity were eluted at 0.25 m NaCl and were further concentrated to ∼15 ml using an Ultrafree-15 filter with 30-kDa cut-off range (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The sample was dialyzed overnight against buffer A and run on a DEAE-Sepharose column with buffer A adjusted to pH 7.5. The column was washed, and proteins were eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient in buffer A. The fractions containing cN-I activity were concentrated to ∼1 ml by spinning through an Ultrafree-15 filter unit with a Biomax-30 membrane (Millipore). The sample was then run on a Sephacryl S-300 column (1.6 × 90 cm) with buffer A, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm KCl. The fractions with cN-I activity were dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 50% glycerol, and bovine serum albumin was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Aliquots of enzyme were stored at −80 °C until use. Enzyme assays were performed in 50 mmTris, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm AMPCP, and 1 mm ADP, with various concentrations of substrate. When AMP and IMP were used as substrates, 22 nCi of 14C-labeled compounds were used in a 20-μl reaction volume. Alternatively,14C-labeled dCMP was used in an amount of 5.5 nCi in a 20-μl reaction volume. Enzyme concentrations were 69 pg/μl when assayed with dCMP, 552 pg/μl when assayed with AMP and 1.38 ng/μl when assayed with IMP. Enzymatic reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, run at 37 °C, and stopped by heating at 85 °C for 2 min. Reaction rates were determined to be linear within the protein concentrations and incubation times used. Fifteen μl of each sample was spotted onto cellulose chromatography sheets with fluorescent indicators (Kodachrome, Eastman Kodak Co. and Analtech, Newark, DE), and thin layer chromatography was performed in a solvent containing 60% butanol, 20% methanol, 19% dH2O, and 1% ammonia. Bands were visualized under UV light, and spots corresponding to the nucleoside products were cut out and counted on a Packard scintillation counter. Specific activity was expressed as μmol/min/mg of substrate. The substrate saturation curves were obtained within 5 μm to 60 mm concentrations, and the effect of ADP, ATP, and GTP (activator saturation curves) was tested within concentrations ranging from 20 μm to 4 mm. Data was graphed using SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL), and kinetic parameters were derived using either nonlinear regression (three parametric Hill equation) or linear regression (Hanes equation) procedures as previously described (10Spychala J. Madrid-Marina V. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18759-18765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Marszalek J. Kostrowicki J. Spychala J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 5: 239-240PubMed Google Scholar). Colorimetric assays were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm AMPCP, 1 mm ADP, and 5 mm each substrate. cN-I (34.5 ng/reaction) was incubated in 50 μl final volume for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 1 ml of Chen reagent as previously described (22Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5835) Google Scholar). With F-AraAMP and AraCMP, incubation time was increased to 40 min, and the concentration of cN-I was 10 times higher. For the inhibition experiments, the buffer included 5 mm AMP and 1 mm competing nucleoside analog monophosphate with a 10 min incubation and 34.5 ng of cN-I. Sf9 cells were maintained in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1.8 mm l-glutamine (Life Technologies). HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media was supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (Lineberger Cancer Research Center Tissue Culture Facility, University of North Carolina). Transfected HEK 293 and Jurkat E6–1 cells were maintained in the presence of G418 (Life Technologies). The cN-I cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector that contains a pCMV promoter (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). HEK 293 cells were transfected using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and Jurkat E6–1 cells were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. The transfected cells were selected in increasing concentrations of G418, up to 750 μg/ml for HEK 293 cells and up to 1 mg/ml for Jurkat cells. An empty pcDNA3 vector was used as a control for both cell lines. Individual clones were selected by serial dilution of cells transfected with the cN-I construct in 96-well plates. Colonies grown from single cells were tested to determine cN-I activity, and cells were maintained in the presence of G418. Due to low transfection efficiency, the Jurkat cells were pre-selected with 0.5 μm CdA for 2 days before the serial dilutions. A synthetic acetylated peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 16 amino acids of cN-I (acetyl-CQTPRRTAPAKQAPSAQ-OH) was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin at the peptide synthesis facility at University of North Carolina. The peptide was used to produce rabbit polyclonal antisera to cN-I by Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). Antibody was purified on a Sulfolink column (Pierce) coupled to the original antigen peptide conjugated to bovine serum albumin, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blots, proteins (50 μg) were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent. Western blots were performed with cN-I antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 followed by horseradish peroxide-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1:5000. Bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine whether overexpression of cN-I affects the IC50 for various nucleoside analogs, HEK 293 and Jurkat E6–1 parental, pCDNA3-transfected and cN-I-transfected cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 103cells/well for the HEK 293 cells and 2 × 104cells/well for the Jurkat E6–1 cells. The cells were treated with concentrations of nucleoside analogs between 1 nm and 10 mm depending on the toxicity of the drug. Cells were incubated in 96-well plates in the presence of drug for 4 days. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were performed as previously described (23Hapke D.M. Stegmann A.P.A. Mitchell B.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar) to determine relative cell viability, with the absorbance measured at 595 nm. A FASTA search performed with the cDNA sequence of the pigeon cN-I enzyme (24Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) identified the human cN-I gene (GenBankTM accession number: AL035404.20). Sequence analysis identified six exons with an open reading frame of 1107 bases localized on human chromosome 1 p33-p34.3. Reverse transcription-PCR using human heart poly(A) mRNA as a template produced the expected 1107-base pair cDNA. An A to G base change at position +729 in the cDNA sequence and 75,616 in the GenBankTM sequence was found in all sequenced PCR products from several different reactions and is therefore unlikely to be a PCR-related mutation. The base change does not affect the amino acid sequence. This sequence was scanned against the GenBankTMdata base and was significantly related to three other sequences: (AL033526.24, a fragment of AL035404.20 containing exons 4–6 of the cN-I enzyme; AJ131243.1, Columba livia (pigeon) mRNA for cN-I, with 82% identity to the human sequence (24Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17789-17793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); and AB045992.1,Macaca fascicularis (macaque primate) brain cDNA, containing a stretch of 135 amino acids that is 97% identical to the first exon of human cN-I. The human cN-I cDNA encodes a 368 amino acid protein of 47.7 kDa that has 83% identity to the 40-kDa protein of the cloned pigeon cN-I enzyme. The human cN-I amino acid sequence was scanned against the GenBankTM data base and, in addition to pigeon cN-I, was significantly related to Xylella fastidiosa (proteobacteria) 5′-nucleotidase F82601 (25Simpson A.J. Reinach F.C. Arruda P. et al.Nature. 2000; 406: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). An alignment of the human, pigeon, andX. fastidiosa cN-I amino acid sequences is shown in Fig.1. All three cN-I sequences contain a conserved classic Walker B motif (R/K)X1–4GX2–4φXφ2(D/E) (φ is a hydrophobic amino acid) (26Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) at amino acids 220 to 233. The Walker B motif is found in many ATP-binding proteins and may serve as part of the nucleotide binding pocket (26Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). All three cN-I sequences also contain a conserved kinase-2 motif near the C terminus, IFFDD (at amino acids 338 to 342 on the alignment). Although the sequences of kinase-2 domains are highly variable, they usually consist of four hydrophobic residues followed by an aspartate that interacts with Mg2+, Ca2+, or other divalent metal ions (26Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Mg2+ is necessary for cN-I activity (16Yamazaki Y. Truong V.L. Lowenstein J.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Darvish A. Metting P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1528-H1534PubMed Google Scholar, 19Skladanowski A.C. Smolenski R.T.

J. 1990; 268: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and this conserved domain may be essential for enzyme function. There are several additional putative nucleotide binding domains that are conserved only in the human and pigeon cN-I enzymes: two kinase-2 domains are located at amino acids 31–35 and 313–317, and a putative kinase 3a domain (26Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) is located at amino acids 299–304. Three putative nucleoside monophosphate binding motifs (NMP-2), which may bind the pentose sugar (26Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), are located at amino acids 68–73, 177–182, and 313–318 on the alignment. Neither 5′-nucleotidase signature 1 nor signature 2 (PROSITE), derived from conserved ecto-5′-nucleotidase domains, was found in the cN-I sequence. Northern blot analysis was performed on two human tissue blots (CLONTECH) to determine the tissue-specific expression of cN-I. Data presented in Fig.2 show that skeletal muscle expressed a very high level of the ∼10-kilobase cN-I transcript, whereas a lower level of expression was found in heart, brain, and pancreas. Upon overexposure, expression could also be seen in kidney, testis, and uterus. Recombinant human cN-I expressed in Sf9 insect cells was purified from cell supernatants by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by phosphocellulose chromatography, DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 3). This purification procedure yielded a protein that was ∼90% pure and had a specific activity of 14.4 μmol/min/mg when assayed with 200 μm dCMP and 1 mm ADP. The relative Vmaxand apparent Km values for AMP, dCMP, and IMP were determined in both the presence and absence of ADP as an activator. Table I summarizes the data and shows that the enzyme exhibited the highest Vmax in the presence of AMP, followed by IMP and dCMP. On the other hand, the highest substrate affinity was obtained for dCMP. The high ratio ofVmax/Km for dCMP demonstrated that it was the most efficient substrate for human recombinant cN-I.Table ISubstrate specificity of recombinant human cN-ISubstrateADPVmaxRelativeVmaxApparentKmVmax/KmHill coefficientmmμmol/mg/min%mmAMP1*364.5 ± 17.11001.87 ± 0.23531.25 ± 0.1307.7 ± 0.822.96 ± 0.072.62 ± 0.46dCMP149.5 ± 0.1140.012 ± 0.00111331.40 ± 0.01018.1 ± 0.650.193 ± 0.0082.74 ± 0.06IMP1*155.0 ± 11.0432.47 ± 0.62171.00 ± 0.10033.2 ± 2.6912.11 ± 1.002.69 ± 0.18The Vmax and apparent Km of cN-I for AMP, IMP, and dCMP were determined by varying the concentration of substrate both in the presence and absence of ADP as an activator.

Experimental values are shown ± S.E. for two or three (*) experiments. ADP was required for the full activity of recombinant human cN-I. ADP both increased the Vmax and decreased theKm for all three substrates (Table I). The Hill coefficient in the presence of ADP was close to 1 for all three substrates, whereas in the absence of ADP, it increased to 2.6 or 2.7 (Table I). Such kinetic behavior suggests that ADP functions as an allosteric activator of cN-I. When cN-I activity was measured at increasing ADP concentrations (from 20 μm to 2 mm) and at a fixed concentration of dCMP, half-maximal activity (A0.5) was reached at a concentration of 89 μm (Fig. 4 and TableII). The steep initial slope of the curve indicates that ADP at concentrations below 200 μm is a critical physiological regulator of cN-I activity. GTP also served as an activator for cN-I, although not as strong as ADP, and there was only slight activation by ATP (Fig. 4 and Table II).Table IIActivation of cN-I by ADP, ATP, and GTPActivatorVmaxA0.5μmol/mg/minμmADP40.6 ± 3.689 ± 11ATP5.6 ± 0.5122 ± 14GTP15.1 ± 1.533 ± 1The specific activity of cN-I was measured at varying concentrations of ADP, ATP, and GTP and a fixed concentration (20 μm) of dCMP substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2102299011,"C to U editing of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA involves the interaction of a multicomponent editing enzyme complex with a requisite RNA sequence embedded within an AU-rich context. This enzyme complex includes apobec-1, an RNA-specific cytidine deaminase, and apobec-1 complementation factor (ACF), a novel 65-kDa RNA-binding protein, that together represent the minimal core of the editing enzyme complex. The precise composition of the holo-enzyme, however, remains unknown. We have previously isolated an enriched fraction of S100 extracts, prepared from chicken intestinal cells, that displays apoB RNA binding and which, following supplementation with apobec-1, permits efficient C to U editing. Peptide sequencing of this most active fraction reveals the presence of ACF as well as GRY-RBP, an RNA-binding protein with ∼50% homology to ACF. GRY-RBP was independently isolated from a two-hybrid screen of chicken intestinal cDNA. GRY-RBP binds to ACF, to apobec-1, and also binds apoB RNA. Experiments using recombinant proteins demonstrate that GRY-RBP binds to ACF and inhibits both the binding of ACF to apoB RNA and C to U RNA editing. This competitive inhibition is rescued by addition of ACF, suggesting that GRY-RBP binds to and sequesters ACF. As further evidence of the role of GRY-RBP, rat hepatoma cells treated with an antisense oligonucleotide to GRY-RBP demonstrated an increase in C to U editing of endogenous apoB RNA. ACF and GRY-RBP colocalize in the nucleus of transfected cells and, in cotransfection experiments with apobec-1, each appears to colocalize in a predominantly nuclear distribution. Taken together, the results indicate that GRY-RBP is a member of the ACF gene family that may function to modulate C to U RNA editing through binding either to ACF or to apobec-1 or, alternatively, to the target RNA itself."

https://openalex.org/W1999761134,"<i>Escherichia coli</i> α-hemolysin (HlyA) can lyse both red blood cells (RBC) and liposomes. However, the cells are lysed at HlyA concentrations 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than liposomes (large unilamellar vesicles). Treatment of RBC with trypsin, but not with chymotrypsin, reduces the sensitivity of RBC toward HlyA to the level of the liposomes. Since glycophorin, one of the main proteins in the RBC surface, can be hydrolyzed by trypsin much more readily than by chymotrypsin, the possibility was tested of a specific binding of HlyA to glycophorin. With this purpose, a number of experiments were performed. (<i>a</i>) HlyA was preincubated with purified glycophorin, after which it was found to be inactive against both RBC and liposomes. (<i>b</i>) Treatment of RBC with an anti-glycophorin antibody protected the cells against HlyA lysis. (<i>c</i>) Immobilized HlyA was able to bind glycophorin present in a detergent lysate of RBC ghosts. (<i>d</i>) Incorporation of glycophorin into pure phosphatidylcholine liposomes increased notoriously the sensitivity of the vesicles toward HlyA. (<i>e</i>) Treatment of the glycophorin-containing liposomes with trypsin reverted the vesicles to their original low sensitivity. The above results are interpreted in terms of glycophorin acting as a receptor for HlyA in RBC. The binding constant of HlyA for glycophorin was estimated, in RBC at sublytic HlyA concentrations, to be 1.5 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>m."

The heat shock cognate 70-kDa protein (Hsc70) has been demonstrated to interact with the cytosolic domain of the TfR and could thus trigger the receptor toward this secretion pathway. We investigated the characteristics of the interaction between Hsc70 and the TfR in exosomes with an in vitro binding assay using TfR immobilized on Sepharose beads and purified Hsc70. The results show that Hsc70 binds to exosomal TfR with characteristics expected of a chaperone/peptide interaction. We demonstrated that heat-denatured luciferase competed for in vitro binding, dependent on the nucleotide bound to Hsc70, and that this interaction activates the ATPase activity of Hsc70. Moreover, we used immunosuppressive agents that interact with Hsc70, thus decreasing Hsc70 binding to TfR in ourin vitro binding assay and enabling us to assess the role of this interaction in vivo during reticulocyte maturation.

Moreover, we used immunosuppressive agents that interact with Hsc70, thus decreasing Hsc70 binding to TfR in ourin vitro binding assay and enabling us to assess the role of this interaction in vivo during reticulocyte maturation. transferrin receptor deoxyspergualin phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) N-ethylmaleimide polyvinylidene difluoride Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles secreted in the extracellular medium by hematopoietic cells, such as reticulocytes (1Johnstone R.M. Adam M. Hammond J.R. Orr L. Turbide C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9412-9420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), B lymphocytes (2Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leidendekker R. Harding C.V. Meleif C.J.M. Geuze H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar), or dendritic cells (3Théry C. Regnault A. Garin J. Wolfers J. Zitvogel L. Ricciardi- Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Amigorena S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). These vesicles are formed by membrane budding into the lumen of an endocytic compartment, leading to the formation of multivesicular intracellular structures. Fusion of these multivesicular structures with the plasma membrane leads to the release of internal vesicles (exosomes) into the medium (4Pan B.-T. Teng K. Wu C. Adam M. Johnstone R., M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The protein composition of exosomes depends on the cell type. Some membrane proteins become enriched in exosomes, whereas others are excluded. For example, the transferrin receptor (TfR)1 is a major protein of exosomes secreted by reticulocytes, leading to the complete loss of TfR from maturing reticulocytes, whereas no anion transporter is lost during maturation into erythrocytes. By contrast, TfR is absent from the surface of exosomes secreted by B lymphocytes, which instead are enriched with major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (2Raposo G. Nijman H.W. Stoorvogel W. Leidendekker R. Harding C.V. Meleif C.J.M. Geuze H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the process of protein sorting into exosomes is yet not known. However, it seems specifically related to the particular cell involved because TfR is a major actor in reticulocyte and prereticulocyte function and major histocompatibility complex class II is essential in B lymphocyte physiology. In reticulocyte exosomes, another protein is enriched in a stoichiometric ratio with TfR. This protein has been identified as clathrin uncoating ATPase, (also known as the heat shock cognate 70-kDa protein (Hsc70) (5Davis J.Q. Dansereau D. Johnstone R.M. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15368-15371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein has been shown to interact with the cytosolic domain of the TfR (6Mathew A. Bell A. Johnstone R.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and this interaction was suggested to induce sorting of the receptors into exosomes. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that Hsc70 is also present in exosomes secreted by dendritic cells (3Théry C. Regnault A. Garin J. Wolfers J. Zitvogel L. Ricciardi- Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Amigorena S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) and thus may be a general marker of exosome formation. Interestingly, however, clustering of TfRs on the reticulocyte cell surface by using antibodies or lectins was shown to induce receptor sorting into exosomes (7Vidal M. Mangeat P. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations demonstrated that protein sorting into exosomes is not necessarily induced by cytosolic sorting machinery. The fact that glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins such as acetylcholinesterase, CD55, CD58, and CD59 are enriched in reticulocyte exosomes (1Johnstone R.M. Adam M. Hammond J.R. Orr L. Turbide C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9412-9420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rabesandratana H. Toutant J.P. Reggio H. Vidal M. Blood. 1998; 91: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas they do not cross the plasma membrane, supports the idea that protein sorting into exosomes may occur in the absence of a cytoplasmic domain. The proposal that protein aggregation may be the signal triggering molecules toward the exosome pathway could account for these observations. For example, Hsc70 could interact with proteins following partial unfolding of the cytoplasmic domain. If TfR were to unfold, Hsc70 would become associated with the TfR without participating further in the sorting process. It is known that, besides its role in clathrin uncoating of coated vesicles through interaction with auxilin (9Barouch W. Prasad K. Greene L. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Hsc70 has general chaperone properties and is involved in protein folding and unfolding (10Strickland E. Qu B.H. Millen L. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25421-25424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Previous studies have described the general characteristics of the Hsp70 class of molecular chaperones in binding to peptides (11Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsc70 binds preferentially to hydrophobic sequences containing basic amino acids. The ADP-bound form of Hsp70 has a high affinity for peptides, whereas the ATP form has a lower affinity, thus resulting in dissociation (12Palleros D.R. Shi L. Reid K.L. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13107-13114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we carried out an in vitro binding assay to study characteristics of the interaction between Hsc70 and TfR. Our results demonstrate that Hsc70 binds to exosomal TfR with the characteristics expected of a chaperone/peptide interaction. We used deoxyspergualin (DSG) and LF15-0195, two immunosuppressive agents that interact with Hsc70 (13Nadeau K. Nadler S.G. Saulnier M. Tepper M.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Komesli S. Dumas C. Dutartre P. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1999; 21: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Both compounds diminished the interaction between Hsc70 and TfR in our in vitro binding assay. Both induced an increase in TfR release in exosomes when added during in vitro maturation of reticulocytes. These data demonstrate that TfR aggregation instead of Hsc70 binding may be the signal targeting TfR molecules toward the exosome pathway. Rat monoclonal antibody raised against Hsc70 (SPA-815) and mouse monoclonal antibody raised against rat TfR (CL-071AP) were from StressGen (Victoria, Canada) and Cedarlane (Hornby, Canada), respectively. A mouse anti-Na+/K+-ATPase was kindly provided by Dr. R. Blostein (Montreal General Hospital Research Institute, Montreal, Canada). An antibody against a known peptide sequence corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of the human transferrin receptor was kindly provided by Dr. I. S. Trowbridge (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG were both obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Protein A-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ATP-agarose gel was from Sigma. Recombinant firefly Luciferase was purchased fromPromega France (Charbonnieres, France). Thin layer chromatography plates (polyethylenimine-cellulose) were purchased from Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany). [α-32P]ATP and Na125I were obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Orsay, France). [3H]Nitrobenzylthioinosine was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). DSG and methyl-DSG were provided by Nippon Kayaku Co (Tokyo, Japan), and LF15-0195 was from Laboratoires Fournier (Daix, France). Reticulocyte-enriched blood was obtained from phenylhydrazine-treated rats (7Vidal M. Mangeat P. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or from phlebotomized sheep (6Mathew A. Bell A. Johnstone R.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Exosomes were collected by sequential centrifugations from the supernatant of reticulocyte subcultures as previously described (1Johnstone R.M. Adam M. Hammond J.R. Orr L. Turbide C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9412-9420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, blood samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove plasma and the buffy coat. After three washes with Hanks' buffer, the cells (3% final packed cell volume) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 mm adenosine, 10 mm inosine, 5 mmglutamine (plus 3% (v/v) fetal calf serum in the case of rat reticulocytes). To assess the effect of DSG and LF15-0195 on exosome formation, the compounds were added during the in vitromaturation of reticulocytes. After the indicated times at 37 °C in a O2/CO2 incubator, the cells were pelleted, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 ×g to remove mitochondria and cellular fragments. The supernatants were ultracentrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 ×g, and the vesicle pellets were either analyzed for specific protein content by Western blotting or for [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine binding (1Johnstone R.M. Adam M. Hammond J.R. Orr L. Turbide C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9412-9420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or were solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and the cleared supernatants were used for TfR immunoprecipitation (see below). The protocol described in Ref. 15Ziemienowicz A. Zylicz M. Floth C. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15479-15484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar was adapted for the isolation of Hsc70 from rat brains. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Four rat brains were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 50 ml of buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.3, 15 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm sodium bisulfite, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm PMSF) containing 50 mm KCl, and loaded onto a 25-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 750 ml of buffer B containing 50 mm KCl. Elution was performed with a 200-ml gradient from 50 to 600 mm KCl in buffer B. Fractions containing Hsc70 (detected by Western blotting) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer C (10 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm PMSF), and loaded onto a 5 ml ATP-agarose column equilibrated with buffer C. The column was sequentially washed with 25 ml of buffer C, 25 ml of buffer C containing 500 mm KCl, 25 ml of buffer C, 25 ml of buffer C containing 1 mm GTP (to elute GTP binding proteins), and 25 ml of buffer C. Finally, the Hsc70 protein was eluted with 50 ml of buffer C containing 4 mm ATP. Fractions containing Hsc70 protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm PMSF). Purified Hsc70 was freed from ATP using a Sephadex-G25 spin column equilibrated in buffer E (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl) containing 0.1 mmEDTA and then dialyzed for 48 h against the same buffer. The concentration of Hsc70 purified was 0.3 mg of protein/ml. Radioiodination of Hsc70 was carried out using Iodo-Gen reagent (16Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed with exosomes (0.4 mg of protein/ml) solubilized in 40 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 3 μg of anti-TfR. The antigen-antibody complex was precipitated with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by centrifugation for 2 min at 400 × g and washed five times with 1 ml of TG buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Determination of purified Hsc70 association with immobilized TfR was carried out by adding 3 μg of Hsc70 with the beads. The samples were then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking every 5 min, followed by seven washes with TG buffer. Samples were denatured for 5 min at 90 °C with Laemmli loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Copelleting of Hsc70 with TfR was determined by Western blot and quantified using ImageQuaNT software. Where indicated, purified Hsc70 was incubated with 5 mm of different nucleotides (ADP, ATPγS) or pretreated with 10 mm of DSG or LF15-0195. In the case of Hsc70 pretreated with DSG or LF-15, all washes were carried out using TG buffer without Nonidet-P40. Purified nucleotide-free Hsc70 was preincubated with or without MgATP (5 mm) at 4 °C for 30 min. NEM (2.5 mm) was then incubated for 2 h with ATP-bound and ATP-free Hsc70 at 30 °C before adding 5 mm dithiothreitol (10 min at 4 °C) to inactivate residual NEM. Incubation at 4 °C was continued for 30 min with the addition of MgATP (5 mm) to the ATP-free Hsc70 sample. NEM-treated Hsc70 was then added to immobilized TfR, and Hsc70 copelleting was determined as described above. Recombinant firefly luciferase (58 μm) was incubated in buffer E (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing the indicated combinations of proteins (2.6 μm Hsc70 and 2.6 μmtransferrin) for 10 min at 4 or 42 °C. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged in an air-driven ultracentrifuge (Beckman Airfuge with 18° A-100 rotor) at 5 p.s.i. for 10 min. Supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. ATPase assay was performed as described (18Sadis S. Hightower L.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9406-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,19Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 71: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (281) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The assay was carried out in buffer F (20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NH4SO4) at 30 °C for 1 h. [α-32P]ATP (10 μCi) was diluted in 25 μl of a 50 μm solution of ATP (8 μCi/μmol ATP) was aliquoted to achieve 3.8 μCi/6 μg of purified Hsc70. Incubation was conducted for 40 min at 30 °C. The sample was applied to a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 spin column. 32P-Labeled nucleotide·Hsc70 complex was recovered by centrifugation and added to immobilized TfR for 2 h at 30 °C. As control, 0.4 μCi of [α-32P]ATP was added along with 100 μg of adenosine 5′-triphosphatase (Sigma), 9 μl of buffer F, and protein A-Sepharose beads incubated with 400 μg of exosomal proteins and anti-TfR antibody. Aliquots were spotted on thin layer chromatography plates (polyethylenimine-cellulose) and developed using 0.4 m NH4HCO3buffer. [α-32P]ADP and [α-32P]ATP were visualized by autoradiography. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore), unless otherwise specified, as described by Towbin et al. (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) procedure. Association of Hsc70 with exosomal TfR has been demonstrated by chemical cross-linking, coimmunoprecipitation, and immobilization experiments (6Mathew A. Bell A. Johnstone R.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To further characterize this association, we developed a binding assay using Hsc70 purified from rat brain and TfR immunoprecipitated from rat exosomes. As shown in Fig.2 A, a single band of ∼70 kDa was obtained by Coomassie staining (lane 2), and recognized by an anti-Hsc70 antibody (lane 3). TfR was immunoprecipitated from rat reticulocyte exosomes using a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of the receptor. As shown in Fig. 2 A (lane 5), a band with a molecular mass (about 94 kDa) corresponding to the TfR monomer, was detected by Western blot after immunoprecipitation. Note that a band with a lower molecular mass (approximately 85 kDa) was also detected on the membrane, corresponding to the soluble fragment of a cleaved receptor already described (21Johnstone R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Baynes R.D. Shih Y.J. Hudson B.G. Cook J.D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 407-414PubMed Google Scholar). TfR immobilized on protein A-Sepharose was then used to characterize binding of purified Hsc70. As highlighted by the Western blot in Fig. 2 A (lane 7), after incubation of the purified chaperone with immobilized TfR and several washes, Hsc70 was found to be associated with the TfR-Sepharose beads. Protein A-Sepharose incubated with Hsc70 without immobilized TfR did not result in any chaperone copelleting (Fig.2 A, lanes 4 and 6). To confirm the specificity of the association between TfR and Hsc70, we examined whether increasing amounts of TfR would bring down an increasing amount of Hsc70. As shown in Fig. 2 B, there was an increase in the amount of Hsc70 brought down by the TfR immobilized on Sepharose beads. Quantification of TfR and Hsc70 Western blots was done for each lane, and the ratio (Hsc70/TfR) gave similar values. Contrary to other members of the Hsp70 protein family, Hsc70 is constitutively expressed in almost all living cells. One of its best known roles in cell physiology is to remove clathrin triskelions from coated vesicles and to provide recycled components for the formation of nascent coated pits (23Chappel T.G. Welch W.J. Schlossman D.M. Palter K.B. Schlesinger M.J. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1986; 45: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Hsc70 is also involved in other cellular functions that require binding to partially unfolded proteins during synthesis or en route to degradation. The fate of the proteins can then vary. For example, the chaperone can prevent aggregation of a misfolded protein as well as assist its refolding with cochaperones (24Lüders J. Demand J. Papp O. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14817-14823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), or it may target some cytosolic proteins to lysosomes (25Chiang H.-L. Terlecky S., R. Plant C., P. Dice J., F. Science. 1989; 246: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of purified Hsc70 was assessed by measuring its binding to heat-denatured firefly luciferase (26Chamberlain L. Burgoyne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31420-31426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Luciferase unfolding was obtained by 10 min of incubation at 42 °C. This led to protein aggregation and was followed by pelleting during centrifugation (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1 versus 2). However, when Hsc70 was present during incubation at 42 °C, luciferase aggregation and pelleting was prevented. The addition of transferrin instead of Hsc70 had no effect (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and4), and luciferase was removed from the supernatant. If Hsc70 is limiting and binds to exosomal TfR via its chaperone capacity, the addition of denatured luciferase could compete with the Hsc70-bound TfR and lower the amount of Hsc70 associated with Sepharose-immobilized TfR. As shown in Fig. 3 B, incubation in the presence of heat-denatured luciferase significantly decreased Hsc70 binding to TfR, whereas the addition of native luciferase did not significantly affect Hsc70/TfR binding. The minor effect of native luciferase could be the result of a partial unfolding of luciferase during the 1-h incubation at 30 °C, as suggested by the lower luciferase activity (not shown). Note that although aggregation and pellet formation of heat-denatured luciferase were prevented by the addition of Hsc70, the latter could not bring about protein refolding, as measured by restoration of its enzymatic activity (not shown). The Hsp70 family binds peptides under regulation by ATP binding and hydrolysis. The ADP-bound form of Hsc70 binds peptides with high affinity and has a slow rate of substrate release, whereas the ATP-bound form is more prone to peptide release. Moreover, the complex between Hsc70 and the nucleotide (ATP or ADP) is very stable, and when purified from a cell homogenate, special methods are required to obtain nucleotide-free Hsc70 (27Gao B. Emoto Y. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8507-8513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Liu Q. Levy E.J. Chirico W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29937-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To study the effects of added nucleotides, we thus generated nucleotide-free chaperone, loaded it with ADP or ATPγS, and assessed binding of the two forms to exosomal TfR. As shown in Fig. 4 A, more ADP-bound Hsc70 than ATPγS-bound Hsc70 was retained by TfR immobilized on Sepharose beads. Western blot quantification indicated that about three times more of the ADP form was associated with the TfR-bead pellet than the ATPγS bound form. These data are all consistent with chaperone behavior. Ssa1p, the predominant yeast cytosolic Hsp70, was demonstrated to be inactivated by NEM when in the nucleotide-free form but not when bound to nucleotides (28Liu Q. Levy E.J. Chirico W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29937-29944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was suggested that NEM modification may disrupt the conformation of Ssa1p or interfere with nucleotide binding. To assess the effect of NEM in this system, nucleotide-free or ATP-bound Hsc70 were treated with NEM followed by binding to exosomal TfR. As shown in Fig. 4 B, Hsc70 binding to TfR immobilized on Sepharose beads was significantly decreased by NEM treatment of the nucleotide-free Hsc70 (about 40% of control) (Fig. 4 B,lane 3), whereas the nucleotide loaded form (lane 2) was much less affected by NEM treatment (about 70% of control). This suggests that, like Ssa1p, NEM treatment of nucleotide-free Hsc70 affects its activity and that the nucleotide-bound chaperone is protected from modification by NEM. To further assess the characteristics of Hsc70 association with exosomal TfR, the ATPase activity of Hsc70 upon substrate binding was investigated. It has been shown that binding of peptide substrates to Hsp70 homologs such as DnaK from Escherichia coli (29McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) or Ssa1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (30Ziegelhoffer T. Lopez-Buesa P. Craig E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10412-10419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) stimulate ATPase activity of chaperone proteins. As shown in Fig.5, two radioactive spots appeared (lane 8) when a purified [α-32P]ATP·Hsc70 complex was added to TfR immobilized on Sepharose beads followed by 2 h of incubation at 30 °C and polyethylenimine-cellulose chromatography. The reaction mixture at t0 gave only one radioactive spot (lane 7). Migration comparison with unlabeled nucleotides identified the spots as ADP and ATP, as indicated. Spots corresponding to AMP, ADP, and ATP were also obtained by incubation of [α-32P]ATP with excess porcine brain ATPase (lanes 3 and 4). Neither spontaneous (lanes 1 and 2) nor immobilized-TfR induced (lanes 5 and 6) [α-32P]ATP hydrolysis was found during the incubation period. The nucleotide hydrolysis induced by binding of ATP·Hsc70 to exosomal TfR thus confirmed that the interaction between the two proteins was that expected of an interaction with a chaperone. One way to interfere with the interaction of Hsc70/TfRin vitro is, as described above, to add a competitor for the interaction using an unfolded target protein. Another possibility is to use agents capable of interfering with normal functioning of the chaperone, such as the immunosuppressant DSG (31Nadler S.G. Tepper M.A. Schacter B. Mazzucco C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) or analogs like methyl-DSG and LF15-0195 (14Komesli S. Dumas C. Dutartre P. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1999; 21: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Although the mechanism of action is still poorly understood, DSG binds Hsc70 with aKd in the micromolar range (13Nadeau K. Nadler S.G. Saulnier M. Tepper M.A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that Hsc70 may be a target for the immunosuppressive action of DSG in vivo. First we assessed the effect of the compounds on in vitrointeraction between Hsc70 and exosomal TfR. Purified Hsc70 was preincubated with or without DSG or LF15-0195 before using it forin vitro binding to TfR. As shown in Fig.6, preincubation of both immunosuppressive agents with the chaperone decreased its association with immobilized TfR. Radiolabeled Hsc70 was used in the binding assay to improve the quantification. As shown in Fig. 6, the data in both assays gave similar values. To improve our understanding of the nature and role of the Hsc70/TfR interaction during reticulocyte maturation, we took advantage of the inhibition of Hsc70 binding to TfR by DSG. DSG is transported across the plasma membrane and accumulates in the cell cytoplasm (32Cleaveland J.S. Nadler S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We were thus able to assess the consequences of decreasing Hsc70/TfR interaction during exosome formation. The immunosuppressive agents were added during in vitro maturation of reticulocytes, and the time course of exosome release was monitored after the addition of the immunosuppressive compounds. Reticulocytes from phlebotomized sheep that were cultured in vitro for 3–4 h or for up to 2 days, in the presence of DSG or methyl-DSG, showed an increase in the amount of TfR released via exosomes (Table I and Fig.7). Although the extent of increase was variable, the direction of the response was consistent. Immunoblotting for Hsc70 from exosomes did not show a comparable quantitative increase in the presence of DSG. Similar results with DSG and LF15-0195 were obtained using rat reticulocytes from animals treated with phenylhydrazine (not shown). This increase of TfR release in exosomes in response to the immunosuppressive agents in two different species argues against a possible fortuitous event.Table IDSG increases release of exosomal TfRConditionsTime of incubationAOD unitshper 30 μl cell equivalentControl44.0 (± 0.2,n = 3)+40 μg/ml DSG44.7 (± 0.2, n= 3)+40 μg/ml MeDSG47.5 (± 0.2, n = 3)Control162.2 (± 0.2, n = 3)+100 μg/ml DSG163.2 (± 0.1, n = 3)+100 μg/ml MeDSG163.3 (± 0.3, n = 3)Control40.05 (n = 1)+20 μg/ml DSG41.0 (n = 1)+20 μg MeDSG40.2 (n = 1)Sheep reticulocytes enriched to contain at least 80% reticulocytes were incubated as described for the times indicated.

A combination of HSP70 and HAP1 also caused a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of a DNA fragment containing an apurinic/apyrimidinic site. The functional consequence of the HSP70/HAP1 interaction was a 10–100-fold enhancement of endonuclease activity at abasic sites. The physical and functional interaction between HSP70 and HAP1 did not require the addition of ATP.

A T4 whose gene 43 has been mutationally inactivated can be replicated by a cognate RB69 gp43 encoded by a recombinant plasmid in T4-infected Escherichia coli. We used this phage-plasmid complementation assay to obtain rapid and sensitive measurements of the mutational specificities of mutator derivatives of the RB69 enzyme. RB69 gp43s lacking proofreading function (Exo− enzymes) and/or substituted with alanine, serine, or threonine at the conserved polymerase function residue Tyr567(PolY567(A/S/T) enzymes) were examined for their effects on the reversion of specific mutations in the T4 rII gene and on forward mutation in the T4 rI gene. The results reveal that Tyr567 is a key determinant of the fidelity of base selection and that the Pol and Exo functions are strongly coupled in this B family enzyme. In vitro assays show that the PolY567A Exo− enzyme generates mispairs more frequently but extends them less efficiently than does a Pol+ Exo− enzyme. Other replicative DNA polymerases may control fidelity by strategies similar to those used by RB69 gp43."

Mn2+activates the catalytic domain of α3GT (α3GTcd), but the affinity reported for this ion is very low relative to physiological levels. Enzyme activity over a wide range of metal ion concentrations indicates a dependence on Mn2+ binding to two sites. At physiological metal ion concentrations, Zn2+ gives higher levels of activity and may be the natural cofactor. To determine the role of the cation, metal activation was perturbed by substituting Co2+and Zn2+ for Mn2+ and by mutagenesis of a conserved D149VD151 sequence motif that is considered to act in cation binding in many glycosyltransferases. The aspartates of this motif were found to be essential for activity, and the kinetic properties of a Val150 to Ala mutant with reduced activity were determined. The results indicate that the cofactor is involved in binding UDP-galactose and has a crucial influence on catalytic efficiency for galactose transfer and for the low endogenous UDP-galactose hydrolase activity. It may therefore interact with one or more phosphates of UDP-galactose in the Michaelis complex and in the transition state for cleavage of the UDP to galactose bond.

Only a few subgroups of glycosyltransferases that function in the processing of glycoproteins and glycolipids show global homology in primary structure. At present, a 2.4-Å structure of the catalytic domain of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase I is the only reported three-dimensional structure of an enzyme of this type (11Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). α1,3-GT is homologous to histo blood group glycosyltransferases A and B and to Forssman glycolipid synthase but is not significantly similar in overall sequence to β-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (12Yamamoto F-I.

Sci. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these and other divalent cation-dependent glycosyltransferases share a DXD sequence motif that is thought to represent at least part of a cation binding site (14Breton C. Bettler E.

Recombinant forms of bovine and other α3GTs have been previously expressed (18Henion T.R. Macher B.A. Anaraki F. Galili U. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Joziasse D.H. Shaper N.L. Salyer L.S. Van den Eijnden D.H. Van der Spoel A.C. Shaper J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); the cytosolic and transmembrane domains together with a 67-residue stem can be deleted to produce a fully active soluble enzyme (18Henion T.R. Macher B.A. Anaraki F. Galili U. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have described the use of a bacterially expressed soluble form of the catalytic domain of bovine α3GT (residues 80–367; α3GTcd) for the enzymatic production of substantial amounts of α-Gal-containing oligosaccharides (20Fang J. Li J. Chen X. Zhang Y. Wang J. Guo Z. Zhang W., Yu, L. Brew K. Wang P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6635-6638Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the role of the metal cofactor in the catalytic mechanism using the recombinant enzyme. Like many other glycoprotein glycosyltransferases, α3GTcd requires a divalent cation for activity that has been thought to be Mn2+ (1Van den Eijnden D.H. Blanken W.M. Winterwerp H. Schiphorst W.E.C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Blanken W.M. Van den Eijnden D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12927-12934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the reported affinity of the enzyme for this ion (K d of 6 mm) exceeds the physiological concentration of Mn2+ by about 3 orders of magnitude, raising questions about the cation dependence in vivo. Studies of metal activation over a wide concentration range reveal a high affinity binding site for Mn2+ and other metals, including Zn2+, which is present at higher levels in biological systems. Glycosyltransferases that, like α3GT, catalyze “retaining” reactions are expected to utilize double displacement mechanisms in which the UDP to galactose bond is cleaved, with formation of an intermediate before transfer of galactose to an acceptor. The mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by α3GTcd is sequential, UDP not being released before the completion of catalysis. However, a low level of UDP-galactose hydrolytic activity indicates that the UDP to galactose bond can be cleaved in the absence of a carbohydrate acceptor, possibly via formation of an oxycarbenium intermediate. The properties of α3GT activated by different metal ions and a mutant with a substitution in a metal binding sequence motif indicate a role for the metal ion in UDP-galactose binding and catalysis. The expression plasmid was generated from a cDNA of bovine α1,3-GT in pSV-SPORT vector provided by Dr. L. Inverardi, Diabetics Research, Cell Transplant Center, University of Miami School of Medicine. This clone had a deletion corresponding to Tyr-64 to Phe-95 that included a 15-residue sequence previously reported to be essential for enzyme activity. The region required for activity was restored by polymerase chain reaction using the primers designated “extension” and “BGT-C.” The product was gel-purified and used as a template in a second amplification using primers BE80GT-N and BGT-C as follows. Extension (coding), GAAAGCAAGCTTAAGCTATCGGACTGGTTCAACCCATTTAAACGC; BE80GT-N (coding), CGAATATCATATGGAAAGCAAGCTTAAGCTATCG; BGT-C (complementary), CGCGGATCCCAAAGTCAGACATTA-TTTCTAACCAC. The product from the second polymerase chain reaction was directly used for TA cloning. Positive colonies were isolated and screened by restriction mapping with NdeI and BamHI. A clone with the appropriate insert was selected and digested with the same restriction enzymes. The insert was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into a preparation of pET15b vector that had been previously cleaved with NdeI and BamHI. The product was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells, and plasmids were prepared and characterized by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET15b rαGT were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin with rapid shaking (250rpm) at 37 °C. When the A 600 nm of the culture reached 0.8–1.0, isopropyl-1-thio-β-S-galactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 0.4 mm to induce expression of T7 RNA polymerase and recombinant α3GTcd. The cultures were then incubated at 27 °C for 20 h with slow shaking (200 rpm) and harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 20 min. Bacteria were washed with washing buffer (20% sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and lysed using a French pressure cell. The soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a to Ni2+ column at 4 °C, and the column was subsequently washed with 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 5 mmimidazole and 0.5 m NaCl followed by 6 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 60 mmimidazole and 0.5 m NaCl. The enzyme was finally eluted with 6 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 500 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl. Purified recombinant α3GTcd was precipitated between 10 and 80% saturation with ammonium sulfate (can be stored in 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 50% glycerol at −20 °C for up to 6 months). Mutagenesis was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction megaprimer method (21Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications described previously (22Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Y. Malinovskii V.A. Fiedler T. Brew K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutant coding sequences were generated by amplifications using a T7 promoter and mutagenic and T7 terminator primers. The final product of amplification was cleaved usingNdeI and BamHI and cloned into a pET15b vector that had been previously treated with the same enzymes. Mutants were characterized by automated DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding sequence in the expression vector, and the proteins were expressed as described for the wild-type enzyme. α3GT assays typically included 2–4 μg/ml enzyme, 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, 10 mmlactose, 0.3 mm UDP-[3H]galactose (specific activity, 500 cpm/nmol), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and metal cation in a total volume of 100 μl and were incubated at 37 °C for 5–15 min. In steady-state kinetic studies, the concentrations of metal ion, lactose, and UDP-galactose were varied with other substrates and cofactors at fixed concentrations. Blanks were reactions from which the acceptor substrate is omitted. Studies at high enzyme concentrations indicated that the enzyme has a low level of UDP-galactose hydrolase activity, which contributes to the backgrounds measured in this way; however, because hydrolase activity is only 0.25% of the transferase activity, the effects of the hydrolase activity on the calculated transferase activities is insignificant. Assays were terminated by adding ice-cold 0.1 m EDTA (100 μl). The reaction mixture was then applied to a 2-ml AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) column, and the radioactive product was eluted with 0.5 ml followed by 1 ml of water. The eluate was collected in a plastic vial, mixed with 10 ml of EcoLume (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA), and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LKB). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of 1 μmol of galactose from UDP-galactose to lactose/min at 37 °C. Conditions were chosen so that <25% of the radioactivity from the UDP-[3H]galactose was incorporated into product in most experiments. Kinetic data were analyzed by fitting to appropriate rate equations using the curvefitter program of SigmaPlot™. For metal activation studies, data were fitted to equations describing activation through binding to a single metal binding site (Equation 1) or activation to V 1 by binding to site 1 with affinity K 1 and to V 2 by additional binding to site 2 with a K d ofK 2 (Equation 2). v=V×[M]/(Kd+[M])Equation 1 v=(V1×K2×[M]+V2×[M]2)/(K1×K2+K2×[M]+[M]2)Equation 2 Data from studies in which the two substrates are varied were fitted to equations for a symmetrical sequential initial velocity pattern associated (3Galili U.

Twenty spectra were scanned for each sample at a speed of 100 nm/min, averaged, and smoothed. Near UV CD spectra (250–320 nm) were determined using a cell with a path length of 1 cm, and far UV spectra (200–250 nm) were determined using a cell with a path length of 0.1 cm. Proteins were dissolved in 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, containing 50% glycerol at concentrations between 0.15 and 0.5 mg/ml. Far UV CD data were analyzed to estimate secondary structure composition using the k2d neural network program (24Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). α3GTcd (residues 80–367 of bovine α1,3GT) was expressed cytoplasmically in E. coli as a soluble active enzyme and was purified, reproducibly, in yields of more than 7 mg/liter bacterial culture. Active enzyme is also produced by expression at 37 °C, but the yield is lower by about 20% than at 27 °C. The enzyme migrates as a single component on SDS gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of 36,000 (data not shown). After precipitation between 10 and 80% saturation with ammonium sulfate, α3GTcd is soluble at concentrations of up to 7.5 mg/ml in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, containing 50% (v/v) glycerol. A form of α3GTcd with an additional N-terminal truncation of six residues was also expressed. In this case, when the expression was at 27 °C, a similar yield was obtained, but at 37 °C, essentially no active enzyme was produced. Steady state kinetic studies with the purified smaller enzyme, in which the concentrations of UDP-galactose or lactose were varied at a fixed concentration of the second substrate at 10 mm Mn2+, showed that the apparentK m and Vm values were closely similar to those of the larger enzyme (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the near and far UV CD spectra of α3GTcd. CD spectra have not been previously reported for either natural or recombinant forms of this enzyme. The near UV spectrum has a similar magnitude to those of other proteins and can be expected to be that of the correctly folded catalytic domain. The far UV CD spectrum was analyzed using the k2d neural network program to give estimates of 28% α helix and 38% β sheet; the predicted spectrum from the analysis is a reasonable fit to the experimental data (Fig. 2). The secondary structure predicted from the sequence from a consensus of the PREDATOR (25Frishman D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 26Frishman D.

Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar), and Quadratic Logistic (28Di Francesco V. Garnier J. Munson P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) methods is 27% α helix and 18% β sheet. Differences in the β sheet content obtained from these analyses may reflect the inaccuracy of β-structure predictions from far UV CD spectra resulting from the relatively weak ellipticity of β sheets compared with α helices as well as the inherent limitations of sequence-based secondary structure predictions. The predictions are similar to the secondary structure composition of the β-1,4-GT catalytic domain: 25% helix, 20% β sheet (11Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The form of αGTcd with the additional six-residue truncation had CD spectra closely similar to those of the larger enzyme. As previously reported for natural α3GT, the bacterially expressed enzyme is inactive in the absence of metal ions and is strongly activated by Mn2+. Activity measurements in the presence of other metal ions at concentrations of 10 mm and in the absence of Mn2+ indicated that Co2+ and Fe2+also activate the enzyme but Zn2+, Ca2+, and Mg2 do not. Detailed studies with Fe2+ were not performed because of its tendency to oxidize in the assay system, but the kinetic properties of the Co2+-activated enzyme were characterized in detail (see below and TableI). Enzyme activities at Mn2+concentrations from 10 μm to 15 mm at fixed concentrations of lactose (10 mm) and UDP-galactose (0.3 mm) did not fit well to a rate equation describing the dependence of activity on metal binding to a single site, giving residuals that vary systematically with log[Mn2+]. However, the rate equation for a two-site model of metal activation gave a better fit (Fig. 3 B). The results of this analysis indicate that α3GTcd is activated by binding of Mn2+ to a high affinity site with an apparentK d value of 80 ± 20 μm; additional binding to a second site with an apparentK d of 2.3 ± 0.5 mm gives a 6-fold higher maximum activity at the substrate concentrations used in these assays.Table IKinetic parameters of wild-type α3GTcd with different metal cofactors and the V150A mutantEnzymeWild typeWild typeWild typeV150AMetal activatorMn2+Co2+Zn2+Mn2+Transferase activityk cat(s−1)6.4 ± 0.73.8 ± 0.50.72 ± 0.063.0 ± 0.3K a(mm)0.43 ± 0.070.83 ± 0.310.80 ± 0.202.6 ± 0.5K ia(mm)0.14 ± 0.031.5 ± 0.51.4 ± 0.61.0 ± 0.45K b(mm)1-aLactose was used as acceptor substrate in these experiments.19.9 ± 3.412.1 ± 3.54.8 ± 1.030.5 ± 6.5K ib1-aLactose was used as acceptor substrate in these experiments.6.5 ± 1.821.9 ± 12.68.4 ± 4.511.7 ± 6.2k cat/K ia ×K b × 10−6(s−1 · m−2)2.3 ± 0.70.21 ± 0.110.11 ± 0.050.10 ± 0.05Hydrolase activityk cat × 103 (s−1)16 ± 1.412.2 ± 0.47.9 ± 0.14.8 ± 0.7K a (mm)0.103 ± 0.0010.51 ± 0.041.0 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.3k cat/K m(s−1 · m−1)155 ± 1323.9 ± 2.77.9 ± 1.64.8 ± 1.61-a Lactose was used as acceptor substrate in these experiments. Open table in a new tab This result led us to re-investigate the effects of other metal ions over a broader range of concentrations (10–10,000 μm). Although no activity was observed with Ca2+ or Mg2+ at any concentration, Zn2+ was found to activate up to a concentration of 500 μm and to progressively inhibit at higher concentrations. In the lower concentration range, Zn2+ produces a similar level of activity to Mn2+ and is more effective than Co2+ (Fig. 3). The data obtained with Zn2+ do not fit well to an equation describing activation by binding to a high affinity site and inhibition resulting from binding to a second lower affinity site, and the line through these data in Fig. 3 Awas generated by a nonlinear spline method. Inhibition by Zn2+ may result from multisite binding and/or denaturation at higher concentrations. The activity profile with Co2+fits well to the equation for single-site activation with aK d of 4.8 ± 0.5 mm and a lower maximum activity than for Mn2+. It is possible that this cation also binds to two sites, but that the enzyme form with a single metal ion bound to the high affinity site is inactive or has extremely low activity. The apparent binding constants for activation by different cations derived from these studies with fixed substrate concentrations are summarized in TableII.Table IIMetal ion activation of wild-type α3GTcd and the V150A mutantMetalParameter (app)2-aApparent (app) values determined at fixed concentrations of donor and acceptor substrates.UnitsWild typeV150AMn2+K d1μm80 ± 20ND2-bND, not detected; i.e., enzyme activity showed dependence on metal binding to a single site.Kd2mm2.3 ± 0.54.7 ± 0.5Vm1μmol/mg · min0.91 ± 0.16NDVm2μmol/mg · min3.05 ± 0.062.6 ± 0.1Zn2+Kdμm58 ± 5267 ± 37Vmμmol/mg · min0.75 ± 0.020.32 ± 0.02Co2+Kdmm4.8 ± 0.59.4 ± 4.2Vmμmol/mg · min1.3 ± 0.10.04 ± 0.008The values for the parameters for Zn2+ were obtained by fitting the data for the lower activating concentration range (≤300 μm).2-a Apparent (app) values determined at fixed concentrations of donor and acceptor substrates.2-b ND, not detected; i.e., enzyme activity showed dependence on metal binding to a single site. Open table in a new tab The values for the parameters for Zn2+ were obtained by fitting the data for the lower activating concentration range (≤300 μm). To determine whether α3GT, when partially activated by Mn2+ binding to the high affinity site, can be further activated by a different metal binding to a second lower affinity second site, different metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Te3+, and Eu3+) were added at concentrations of 10 mmin the presence of 80 μm Mn2+. None enhanced the activity. In the enzyme activated by 10 mmMn2+, Cu2+ or Eu3+ were found to strongly inhibit activity at micromolar concentrations, indicating that they bind to a high affinity cation binding site(s). Because Eu3+ is a very potent inhibitor, it was further characterized and found to be a mixed inhibitor with respect to Mn2+ (0.5–6 mm) with a small intercept effect and large slope effect in a double reciprocal plot (Fig.4). In contrast, Eu3+ is a competitive inhibitor against Co2+ (2.2 to 15 mm; data not shown). These results are consistent with the presence of two metal binding sites for Mn2+ and a single site for Eu3+; it appears also that a binding of Co2+ to a single site is required for catalysis. An apparent K i of 0.5 μm was calculated from the inhibitory activity against Co2+ andK ii and K is values for inhibition against Mn2+ were 11.3 ± 1.7 and 3.3 ± 0.7 μm, respectively. Bisubstrate reactions can utilize ping-pong (double displacement) or sequential mechanisms; these can be distinguished by steady state kinetic experiments in which acceptor and donor substrate concentrations are varied. Galactose transfer to lactose, lactosamine, and β-azido lactose was measured at UDP-galactose concentrations from 0.03 to 0.6 mm and different acceptor concentrations at a fixed 10 mmconcentration of MnCl2. The steady state kinetic parameters are summarized in Table III. In each case, the data fitted best to Equation 3, and in double-reciprocal plots for velocity and concentration of either substrate at a series of fixed concentrations of the second substrate, gave a family of intersecting lines (Fig. 5). In a double-displacement mechanism, K ia is zero (Equation4), and double-reciprocal plots produce families of parallel lines. These results indicate that the catalytic mechanism is sequential so that both substrates bind to the enzyme before any product is released (29Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd., London1995: 129-156Google Scholar). In a sequential mechanism, substrate binding can be random or ordered, and if ordered, acceptor binding can precede UDP-galactose binding or vice versa.Table IIIKinetic parameters for galactose transfer to different acceptors by α3GTcdAcceptorLactoseβ-Azido lactoseLactosaminek cat(s−1)6.4 ± 0.74.9 ± 0.33.8 ± 0.5K a(mm)0.43 ± 0.070.28 ± 0.030.52 ± 0.12K ia (mm)0.14 ± 0.030.25 ± 0.050.09 ± 0.03K b (mm)19.9 ± 3.42.3 ± 0.319.0 ± 4.2K ib(mm)6.5 ± 1.82.05 ± 0.533.3 ± 0.5k cat/K ia ×K b (s−1m−2)2.3 ± 0.7 × 1068.5 ± 2.0 × 1062.2 ± 0.9 × 106 Open table in a new tab UDP-galactose hydrolase activity was initially noticed in the form of high backgrounds (3H release from UDP-galactose in the absence of acceptor into a product that does not bind to the anion exchange resin) at higher enzyme concentrations. The activity increases linearly with enzyme concentration and time, up to 15 min. Hydrolase activity was characterized using a 10–20-fold higher concentration of enzyme than in standard assays; it is Mn2+-dependent (data not shown) and also displays saturation kinetics with varying concentrations of UDP-galactose (Fig. 6). Thek cat for hydrolysis is 0.25% of the corresponding transferase activity with lactose as acceptor. The hydrolytic activity of α3GTcd indicates that the enzyme binds the donor substrate and catalyzes cleavage of the bond between UDP and galactose in the absence of a carbohydrate acceptor. Although the enzyme complexes for the hydrolysis reaction may differ structurally from those for the transfer reaction, the hydrolase activity is inconsistent with a sequential mechanism with obligatory ordered binding of acceptor before donor substrate. The remaining alternative mechanisms are random sequential or ordered sequential binding of donor and acceptor. The kinetic parameters listed in Table III were calculated by fitting to Equation 3 designating UDP-galactose as substrate A and lactose as substrate B. The same rate equation applies to an ordered sequential mechanism and random equilibrium mechanism; the values forK ib = K ia ×K b/K a given in Tables I and IIIrepresent the K d of the enzyme-acceptor complex in the case of a random equilibrium mechanism. Because Mn2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ are active as cofactors for α3GTcd, the role of the metal ion can be investigated by determining the effects of substituting different metals on different kinetic parameters. The three metal ions were used at concentrations of 10 mm, 10 mm, and 300 μm, respectively, levels that gave"

Although proximal antigen-receptor signal transduction pathways are well defined, the precise nuclear factors targeted by these signals remained unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that tissue-restricted transcription factors including PU.1 and PU. 1 interaction partner (PIP) function synergistically with c-Fos plus c-Jun to stimulate the κE3′-enhancer in 3T3 cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the functional synergy between these factors is enhanced in response to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, in 3T3 cells, where the enhancer is inactive. However in S194 plasmacytoma cells, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase was able to stimulate the activity of PU.1 but unable to induce the κE3′-enhancer activity. We have found that Ras-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent externally regulated kinase, AKT, induces κE3′-enhancer activity in both pre-B and plasmacytoma cells. AKT stimulation of the κE3′-enhancer is primarily due to PU.1 induction and is independent of PU.1 interaction with PIP. Activation of AKT had no effect on the expression levels of PU.1 or its protein-protein interaction with PIP. Using a series of deletion constructs, we have determined that the PU.1 acid-rich (amino acids 33–74) transactivation domain is necessary for AKT-mediated induction. Substitution analyses within this region indicate that phosphorylation of Ser41 is necessary to respond to AKT. Consistent with these studies, ligation of antigen receptors in A20 B cells mimics AKT activation of PU.1. Taken together, these results provide evidence that PU.1 is induced by AKT signal in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner, leading to inducible or constitutive activation of its target genes. Signal transduction by the antigen receptor complexes is critical for developmental progression of B-lymphocytes, which are defined by assembly and sequential expression of immunoglobulin genes, which in turn are regulated by the enhancer elements.

Using a series of deletion constructs, we have determined that the PU.1 acid-rich (amino acids 33–74) transactivation domain is necessary for AKT-mediated induction. Substitution analyses within this region indicate that phosphorylation of Ser41 is necessary to respond to AKT. Consistent with these studies, ligation of antigen receptors in A20 B cells mimics AKT activation of PU.1. Taken together, these results provide evidence that PU.1 is induced by AKT signal in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner, leading to inducible or constitutive activation of its target genes.

BCR engagement rapidly induces an array of signal cascades, particularly the activity of three nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase families including members of Src (Lyn, Fyn, and Blk), ZAP-70 (Syk), and Tec (Btk) (6Kurosaki T.

Functional deficiencies in any one of these three family members of the protein-tyrosine kinase family result in defective or aberrant function and impaired development of B cells (10Turner M. Mee P.

Although various signal molecules have been shown to be necessary for proper development and function of B cells, the effects of these distinct signaling outputs on nuclear target molecules remain to be elucidated. In fact, gene-targeting studies indicate that the developmental progression of B cells is critically dependent on the activity of various transcription factors, which bind to promoter and enhancer elements of Ig genes (heavy and light chains), suggesting a link between the signal transduction and transcription factors during B-cell development (13Scott E.

The enhancer elements are not only implicated in regulation of the expression of Ig genes but are also involved in somatic rearrangement and hypermutation of the same genes (19Hiramatsu R. Akagi K.

In fact, disruptions with the κE3′-enhancer results in loss of tissue and developmental stage specific rearrangement of κ light chain genes (19Hiramatsu R. Akagi K. Matsuoka M. Sakumi K. Nakamura H. Kingsbury L. David C. Hardy R. Yamamura K. Sakano H. Cell. 1995; 83: 1113-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that transcriptional activity of the κE3′-enhancer is critically dependent on binding components of the κE3′-CRE (binds c-Fos, c-Jun, CREM, and ATF1), PU.1 plus PIP (binds PU.1 and PIP) and E2A (binds E12/47) sites. Mutation of any one of these binding sites greatly reduces enhancer activity (22Pongubala J.M.R. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M. McKercher S. Maki R. Atchison M. Mol. Cell.

A. 1997; 94: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among the core binding proteins, the expression of PU.1 and PIP is restricted to cells of hematopoietic lineages. Within the κE3′-enhancer, PU.1 recruits the binding of PIP, through protein-protein interaction to its adjacent DNA-binding site (22Pongubala J.M.R. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M. McKercher S. Maki R. Atchison M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 23Pongubala J.M.R. Van Beveren C. Nagulapalli S.K.M.J. McKercher S. Maki R. Atchison M. Science. 1993; 259: 1622-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The recruitment of PIP requires phosphorylation of PU.1 at the amino acid, Ser148. Mutation of this serine residue to alanine (S148A) prevents interaction of PU.1 with PIP as well as the binding of PIP to its adjacent DNA binding sequences. This phosphorylation-mediated interaction of PU.1 appears to induce a conformational change in PIP, thereby allowing it to recognize DNA-binding sequences (26Perkel J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 241-252PubMed Google Scholar). Similar protein-protein interaction between PU.1 and PIP has been detected in the Ig λ light chain enhancer and the CD20 promoter (27Brass A. Kehrli E. Eisenbeis C. Storb U. Singh H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2335-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 28Brass A.L. Zhu A.Q. Singh H.

Interestingly, PIP can bind independently to the interferon-stimulated response element, ISRE (30Matsuyama T. Grossman A. Mittrucker H. Siderovski D. Kiefer F. Kawakami T. Richardson C. Taniguchi T.

Genomics. 1996; 37: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies indicate that PU.1 is essential for development of both B cells and macrophages (13Scott E. Simon M. Anastasi J. Singh H. Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 14McKercher S. Torbett B. Anderson K. Henkel G. Vestal O. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A. Wu G. Paige C. Maki R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), whereas PIP function is necessary for maturation of B and T lymphocytes (34Mittrucker H.W. Matsuyama T. Grossman A. Kundig T. Potter J. Shahinian A. Wakeham A. Patterson B. Ohashi P. Mak T. Science. 1997; 275: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). PU.1−/− mutants completely lack both lymphoid and myeloid progenitors, whereas PIP−/− animals exhibit a block in peripheral maturation of B cells and fail to produce antibodies in response to antigenic stimulation. Similarly, T cells of the mutant animals (PIP−/−) lack proliferative and cytotoxic responses (34Mittrucker H.W. Matsuyama T. Grossman A. Kundig T. Potter J. Shahinian A. Wakeham A. Patterson B. Ohashi P. Mak T. Science. 1997; 275: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Our recent studies indicate that both PU.1 and PIP interact with additional factors and function synergistically within the κE3′-enhancer. Such factors include c-Fos plus c-Jun, which binds to the κE3′-CRE site, and E2A proteins (E12/E47), which binds to the E2A site (see Fig. 1). Through these interactions, PU.1 participates in the assembly of an enhanceosome, a higher order nucleoprotein complex (25Pongubala J.M.R. Atchison M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Despite the ability to interact with various transcription factors, PU.1 was found to be a weak transactivator. Studies of gene regulation have suggested that transcriptional activity of some factors requires phosphorylation-mediated modifications (35Hill C. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 36Marshall C. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar). For instance, phosphorylation of serine residues at positions 63 and 73 of c-Jun is important for its activity. These residues are rapidly phosphorylated in response to oncoproteins (v-Sis and Raf) or exposure to UV radiation (37Devary Y. Gottlieb R. Lau L. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), growth factors (38Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Derijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), or cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α) (39Westwick J.K. Bielawska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22689-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Both Ser63 and Ser73 of c-Jun are preferentially phosphorylated by JNK1, which is sequentially regulated as result of activation of the Ras-PI3K-responsive protein kinase, MEKK1. In fact, target disruption studies suggest that MEKK1 is essential for JNK activation (40Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5243-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility arose that externally regulated signals could play an important role in stimulation of Ig κE3′-enhancer activity. Therefore, we have focused on the role of the Ras-PI3K-dependent signal molecules, MEKK1 and AKT, on κE3′-enhancer activity and target sites within the enhancer in the current studies. Here we demonstrate that MEKK1 stimulates the synergy between PU.1 plus PIP and c-Fos plus c-Jun in 3T3 cells. In S194 plasmacytoma cells, where the κE3′-enhancer is active, MEKK1 weakly stimulated activity of the PU.1 plus PIP site but failed to induce enhancer activity. Interestingly, the PI3K-dependent signal molecule, AKT, stimulated activity of the PU.1 plus PIP site and induced κE3′-enhancer activity in both pre-B and plasmacytoma cells. Activation of the PU.1 plus PIP site in response to the AKT signal is higher when compared with the stimulation observed in the presence of MEKK1. Mutational analyses of the PU.1 plus PIP site indicated that PU.1 responds to the AKT signals, and this response is independent of its interaction with PIP, suggesting that AKT induction of the κE3′-enhancer is primarily due to PU.1 stimulation. By mutational analyses, we determined that AKT stimulation of PU.1 is mediated through the acid-rich (amino acids 33–74) region. Activation of PU.1 in response to AKT appears to be due to phosphorylation-mediated modifications within this region. Mutation of PU.1 serine 41 (which is phosphorylated in vivo) to alanine impaired PU.1 induction by AKT signal. Consistent with these studies, we found that cross-linking the BCR mimicked AKT activation of PU.1. These studies indicate that PU.1 serves as a target molecule for Ras-PI3K-mediated signals in B cells providing a role for PU.1 in B-cell proliferation and humoral immunity. Plasmid constructs containing the TK promoter driving the expression of the enhancer core, κE3′-CRE, PU.1/PIP, and E2A were previously described (41Pongubala J.M.R. Atchison M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutations of the PU.1 plus PIP binding sites were reported earlier (24Pongubala J.M.R. Atchison M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10304-10313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Wild type or deletion mutants of c-Fos and c-Jun expression plasmids were kindly supplied by Dr. Frank Rauscher (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). Plasmids expressing MEKKΔ, MEKKΔ (K432M) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA). The expression plasmids of AKT including HA-Wt AKT, HA-Myr AKT, and HA-Myr AKT (K−) and retroviral vectors, pBabe GFP and pBabe GFP Myr AKT were generously provided by Dr. Philip Tsichlis (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The reporter plasmid, pT81-Luc containing the minimal TK promoter driving expression of the luciferase gene was kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Tanen (Harvard University, Boston, MA). The pT81 Luc-M5.6 reporter plasmid containing the multimerized PU.1 binding site was constructed by transferring M5.6 from the TK-CAT plasmid by BamHI and HindIII digestion followed by cloning as a blunt end fragment into a blunt endHindIII site of pT81-Luc. The PU.1 deletion mutants, Δ2–30, Δ33–74, and Δ75–100 were constructed by isolating them from PURI plasmids (42Fisher R. Olson M. Pongubala J. Perkel J. Atchison M. Scott E. Simon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4347-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by EcoRI and ligating them into theEcoRI site of an expression plasmid pCB6+containing the CMV promoter (kindly supplied by Dr. Frank Rauscher, Wistar Institute, PA). The serine to alanine mutant S41A was isolated from Bluescript KS+ by EcoRI digest and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pCB6+ expression vector, whereas serine to alanine substitution mutants including S37A, S45A, S41A/S45A, and S37A/S41A/S45A were prepared by the overlap extension PCR method (43Ho S. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Two substitute mutant primers were generated for each desired amino acid, one on the top strand and one on the bottom strand. The sequences of the mutant primers were as follows: F37, 5′-GACTACTACGCCTTCGTGGGC-3′; R37, 5′-GCCCACGAAGGCGTAGTAGTC; F45, 5′-GATGGAGAAGCCCATAGCGAT; and R45, ATCGCTATGGGCTTCTCCATC. Two external primers containing EcoRI sites were also used, corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of PU.1. The sequence of 5′ and 3′ end primers of PU.1 were, 5′-GCGGAATTCAGCTGGATGTTACAGGCG-3′ and 5′-GCGGAATTCTCAGTGGGGCGGGAGGCG-3′, respectively. Typically, the first PCR amplification was carried out with each mutant primer and corresponding external primer to generate two DNA fragments, each with a newly substituted amino acid. The amplified fragments were gel purified and subjected to the second PCR reaction in the presence of 5′ and 3′ external primers of PU.1, and full-length cDNAs were generated. The amplified products were digested with EcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site of the pCB6+expression plasmid. Each PCR reaction was performed by using 2.5 units of Taq Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2.5 units of Taq Extender (Stratagene), a deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix in a final concentration of 0.25 mm, 10 ng of template DNA, and 250 ng of each primer. The wild type PU.1 cDNA was used as a template to generate the S37A and S45A mutants. The S41A/S45A mutant was generated using S45A mutant primers and a plasmid containing S41A mutant cDNA as a template. Subsequently, the PU.1 mutant containing serine to alanine mutations S37A/S41A/S45A was generated using S37A mutant primers and S41A/S45A PU.1 cDNA as a template during PCR amplification. DNA sequences of all inserts were determined to confirm the mutations and to verify that no new mutations were introduced by PCR. S1 94 plasmacytoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, henceforth known as Pen-Strep), whereas A20 B cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μmβ-mercaptoethanol and Penn Strep. 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and Pen-Strep. Transfections in S194 cells were performed by the DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) procedure (44Grosschedl R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1985; 41: 885-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Transfections contained 4–5 μg of reporter plasmid, 1 μg of β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (45Hall C. Jacob P. Ringold G. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar), and varying concentrations of MEKK1, AKT, or PU.1 expression plasmids. The maximum amount of DNA was kept between 6 and 7 μg during all transfections. 3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method of Graham and Van der Eb (46Graham F. Van der Eb A. Virol. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA per transfection in 3T3 cells varied between 16 and 21 μg. Both S194 and 3T3 cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed by freezing and thawing and the β-galatosidase activity was determined from each cellular extract. CAT assays were carried out according to Gorman et al. (47Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar) using normalized cell extracts. Transfections in A20 B cells were performed using FuGene-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 3 μg of pT81 Luc reporter alone or containing multimerized PU.1 binding site (pT81 Luc-M5.6) along with 1 μg of β-gal expression plasmid. Following transfection, cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with 5 μg/ml of F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA). To block AKT activation, cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 100 nm wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) prior to addition of antibodies for stimulation. After 36 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined by reading in a luminometer. The luciferase activities were corrected for transfection efficiency by using the β-galactosidase activities. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of PU.1 proteins was performed essentially as described previously (25Pongubala J.M.R. Atchison M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg of plasmid expressing either wild type or various PU.1 mutants. 24 h post-transfection, cells were pulsed with 0.2 mCi/ml35S-protein labeling mix (EXPRE35S35S Protein Labeling Mixl-35S-Met; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h and then chased with cold methionine (0.5 mm). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in a lysis buffer (containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and sonicated, and clear cellular lysates were collected following centrifugation. Cell lysates were normalized by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the labeled proteins. Approximately 10 × 106 cpm counts of each cell lysate were incubated with anti-PU.1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature, and the immune complexes were separated by protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The beads were washed three times with a RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL CA-630, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% aprotinin) and once with a high salt buffer (2m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1.0% IGEPAL CA-630, and 0.5% deoxycholate). The immune-complexes were eluted by boiling with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and subjected to autoradiography. 293T retroviral packaging cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and Pen-Strep. The 293T cells were transiently transfected at >50% confluence on 100-mm dishes with 5 μg of retroviral vector, pBabe GFP, or pBabe GFP-Myr AKT along with 5 μg of Ecotropic packaging vector by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described above. 36 h post-transfection, viral supernatants were collected and filtered, and the viral titers were determined by infecting 3T3 cells. 70Z/3 pre-B cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and Pen-Strep. Prior to retroviral infection, cells were washed and treated with DEAE-dextran (1 mg/ml) for 30 min and exposed to retroviral supernatants expressing GFP alone, or GFP-Myr AKT, for 4 h at 37 °C. Viral supernatants were removed, and cells were plated in regular growth medium. 36 h post-infection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mini-nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method described by Schreiber et al.(48Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed as previously described (41Pongubala J.M.R. Atchison M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA) for 5 min at room temperature. Approximately 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA containing the PU.1 plus PIP DNA-binding site (from the κE3′-enhancer) was then added to the binding reaction, and incubation was continued for an additional 25 min. The bound complexes were separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and exposed for autoradiography. Previous studies have demonstrated that the κE3′-enhancer requires multiple core binding proteins for its activity (25Pongubala J.M.R. Atchison M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such factors include c-Fos plus c-Jun, which binds to the κE3′-CRE site, PU.1 plus PIP, which bind to PU.1, and PIP sites and E2A proteins (E12/E47), which binds to the E2A site (Fig. 1). Cotransfection of the enhancer with either c-Fos plus c-Jun, PU.1 plus PIP, or E2A alone resulted in no enhancer activity in 3T3 cells. However, mixture of c-Fos, c-Jun, PU.1, and PIP caused a dramatic induction in enhance activity in 3T3 cells, where it is normally inactive. Removal of any one of these factors resulted in a loss of enhancer activity (25Pongubala J.M.R. Atchison M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation by c-Jun requires phosphorylation at serines 63 and 73.

Blumer K. Johnson G. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Because c-Jun is important for the activity of the κE3′-enhancer, we sought to determine the role of MEKK1 in functional synergy and enhancer activity. If MEKK1 is important to activity of the κE3′-enhancer, it should stimulate the enhancer when expressed along with PU.1 plus PIP and c-Fos plus c-Jun. To test this, transfections were carried out in 3T3 cells with a reporter plasmid containing the enhancer core fragment along with PU.1, PIP, c-Fos, and c-Jun either in the absence or presence of various concentrations of catalytically active MEKK1, MEKKΔ. Parallelly, transfections were carried out with the kinase inactive mutant, MEKKΔ (KM). Expression of MEKK1 caused a significant increase in the functional synergy between PU.1, PIP, c-Fos, and c-Jun and led to stimulation of activity of the enhancer in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, expression of MEKKΔ (KM) resulted in a loss of enhancer activity (Fig. 2). Because MEKK1 stim"

To gain insight into the physiological role of PARP-2 and to investigate mechanisms ofPARP-2 gene regulation, we cloned and characterized the murine PARP-2 gene. The PARP-2 gene consists of 16 exons and 15 introns spanning about 13 kilobase pairs. Interestingly, the PARP-2 gene lies head to head with the gene encoding the mouse RNase P RNA subunit.

At a site of breakage, the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1,1 113 kDa) catalyzes the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety from the respiratory coenzyme NAD+ to a limited number of protein acceptors involved in chromatin architecture (histones H1, H2B, lamin B, and high mobility group [HMG] proteins) or in DNA metabolism (DNA replication factors, topoisomerases including PARP-1) (1D'Amours D.

Auto- and heteromodification of these proteins are part of an obligatory step of a detection/signaling pathway leading ultimately to the resolution of strand interruptions. A variety of molecular and genetic approaches have been developed this last decade that define unambiguously a critical role of PARP-1 in the cell response to DNA damage and repair and in cell death during the inflammatory process (for review, see Shall and de Murcia (4Shall S. de Murcia G. Mutat. Res. 1999; 460: 1-15Crossref Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 5de Murcia G. Shall S. From DNA Damage and Stress Signalling to Cell Death: Poly ADP-ribosylation Reactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar)). Although it was assumed for many years that PARP activity was associated with a single protein (now termed PARP-1) displaying unique DNA damage detection properties, the recent discovery of four members of the PARP family has emphasized an unexpected complexity of poly(ADP-ribosylation) reactions in mammalian cells. We have recently cloned the cDNAs encoding human and murine PARP-2 (62 kDa), which catalyzes the formation of ADP-ribose polymers in a DNA damage-dependent manner (6Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Höger T. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Of the three other PARP homologues that have been cloned, two have been characterized as follows. (i) Tankyrase, a multi-functional protein of 142 kDa with regions of homology to ankyrins and to the PARP catalytic domain, binds to and negatively regulates TRF1, a factor involved in telomere maintenance (7Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar); (ii) VPARP, the 193-kDa Vault particle PARP, which contains a BRCT domain and regions similar to the inter-α-trypsin inhibitor protein and a central region homologous to the catalytic domain of PARP-1. It binds to and ADP-ribosylates the 100-kDa major Vault protein (MVP) (8Kickhoefer V.A. Siva A.C. Kedersha N.L. Inman E.M. Ruland C. Streuli M. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The third, PARP-3, a 61-kDa homologue has also recently been identified but needs to be further characterized (9Johansson M. Genomics. 1999; 57: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity of their catalytic domain, it is unclear whether all five PARP homologues serve similar or related functions in the cell (10Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 415-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PARP-1 and PARP-2 are clearly DNA damage-dependent enzymes, suggesting a possible functional redundancy. However, a possible role for the latter in the same base excision repair pathway as PARP-1 (11Dantzer F. de La Rubia G. Menissier de Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G. Schreiber V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) remains unknown. To elucidate the role of PARP-2 in these various processes and as an essential step toward the development of an animal model, we cloned the mouse genomic PARP-2 sequence and compared the structure of its promoter and gene to that of PARP-1. To our surprise, we found that the 5′ end of the PARP-2 gene lies within 113 and 152 base pairs of the 5′ end of the gene encoding the RNase P RNA in mouse and human, respectively. The elements responsible for the activity of this bi-directional promoter (RNase P RNA/PARP-2) encoding a class III and a class II gene, respectively, were subsequently determined. Although these transcriptional elements are shared because of the compactness of the promoter region, comparison of the expression of both RNase P RNA and mPARP-2 mRNA in mouse showed that the regulation of the expression of the two genes is not coordinated. The PARP-2 gene was isolated from a mouse genomic library (kindly provided by J. M. Garnier, IGBMC, Illkirch, France) constructed from mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells, strain SV129D). DNA was partially digested by MboI and inserted into the BamHI site of the λGEM12 vector. Screening of the library was performed using an 810-bp random-primed 32P-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to the 5′-most fragment of the mouse PARP-2 open reading frame extending from nucleotide 29 to nucleotide 838 (naturalEcoRI site). Nylon membrane replicas of about 1×106 plaques were prehybridized at 67 °C for 2 h in 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate), 1× Denhardt's solution, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out at 67 °C overnight under the same conditions. Membranes were washed for 10 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS followed by 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10–20 min at 65 °C and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C overnight. Positive plaques were isolated and rescreened using the same probe. After three rounds of screening, the DNA of eight purified positive recombinant phages was isolated and digested bySacI. The fragment order was analyzed by Southern blotting with the library-screening probe and with synthetic oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the PARP-2 cDNA. SacI-generated DNA fragments of interest were subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector and sequenced from both directions by the chain termination method (12Sanger F. Coulson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar) using T3 and T7 primers or internal PARP-2-specific oligonucleotides. Homology searches were performed by comparing the nucleotide query sequence against a nucleotide sequence data base using the NCBI program BLASTN (13Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58752) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons were performed using the collection of programs from the GCG package and from the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS, Sanger Center, UK). Potential transcriptional factor binding sites within the human and the mouse sequences were identified by searching against the TRANSFACT data base release 3.5 using the “tfscan” program (EMBOSS). Poly(A)+mRNA was purified from PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1−/− 3T3 cells using the messenger RNA isolation kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Total mouse tissue RNA was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Transcription start sites on the mouse and human PARP-2 genes were mapped by reverse transcriptase primer extension essentially as described (14Ausubuel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). A synthetic oligonucleotide (3′OH-ACCGCGGCGCCGCCGTCTCTAGTCCGA for mouse and 3′OH-ACCGCCGCGCCGCCGCTGCCTCGTGGCCG for the human) spanning the PARP-2-transcribed strand from positions +90 to +64 for the mouse and from positions +107 to +79 for the human mRNA was used as primer for the reverse transcriptase reaction. The reaction was carried out under standard conditions indicated by the enzyme supplier (Biolabs) but at two different temperatures, 10 min at 42 °C followed by a 10 min step at 50 °C. The same oligonucleotides were also used to sequence the mouse and human genomic regions cloned into a Bluescript vector (clones pBS-10G6 and pBS-hH1-P2, respectively). Reaction products were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide denaturating gel and autoradiographed overnight. A series of promoter deletion mutants of the mPARP-2 gene were generated spanning from −440 bp to −119 bp of the mouse transcription start site using PCR primers containing HindIII and BamHI restriction sites with clone 10G6 as template. All mutants shared the 3′-end primer (3′-AGCTTAGAATCTAAACCACAGACATcctagg-5′). The sequences of the 5′-end primer were as follows: pEGFP-RNAH1, 5′-aagcttCCAAGGATCTCGATCAAAAAGGAGGGC-3′; pEGFP-PromTATA, 5′-aagcttCCCACTTTTAGGGTGTAGACCGGCCGCCA-3′; pEGFP-PromTATA-Less, 5′-aagcttGGGTGTAGACCGGCCGCCACgaattcGGCTCGAAAGA-3′. DNA amplification was performed in 50-μl volumes containing 1× PCR buffer, MgCl2 (1.5 mm), dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (0.2 mm each), DNA primers at 10 μm, 20 ng of clone 10G6 as template, and Taq polymerase (5 units,Promega, Madison, WI). The PCR products were first cloned into the TA-cloning vector pCR2.1. The resulting recombinant vectors were digested with HindIII and BamHI. The inserts generated were subcloned into the plasmid pEGFP-1, which contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). To examine whether the mPARP-2 promoter allowed initiation of transcription in the reverse orientation, a DNA fragment generated by an EcoRI digestion of pCR2.1-PromTATA was subcloned into pEGFP-1 in the reverse orientation, giving pEGFP-PromTATAr. The Oct-1 binding site was mutated using PCR primers with the linearized pEGFP-PromTATA clone as template. Two PCR reactions were necessary to generate the mutant. The first reaction used a 5′ primer that overlapped the Oct-1 binding site and replaced the Oct-1 sequence with the sequence of the XhoI restriction site; its sequence was as follows: 5′- TCCCACAAAGCACAGCGCGTAtctcgagcGTGCTCTATCCCAGGCTC-3′. The 3′-end primer was the following: 3′-TCGCCGGACACGCTGAACTTGTGGCCGT-5′. The amplification product was used as a 3′-end primer in a second reaction with the following 5′-end primer: 5′-GGGTTTCGCCACCTCTGACTTGAGCGTCGA-3′. The 0.52-kb PCR product was digested with HindIII andBamHI then subcloned into a pEGFP-1 reporter plasmid giving pEGFP-PromTATA-ΔOct-1. To confirm that the PARP-2 and H1 RNA genes are localized on the same molecule of DNA, the region spanning from the H1 RNA gene to the first intron of the mPARP-2 gene in both mouse and human was amplified by PCR. To obtain the predicted 1121-bp DNA fragment in the mouse, primer m1 (5′-ACAGTGGGAGGGGGTTCATATCAT-3′), complementary to the mouse H1 RNA gene, and primer m2 (5′-AGACCACTTCATCATGGTCATCA-3′), complementary to the first intron of the mPARP-2 gene, were used with either the 10G6 clone or NIH/3T3 cell total DNA as template. In the human, the primers were h1 (5′-AATGGGCGGAGGAGAGTAGTCT-3′) and h2 (5′-GGTCACAGTAGGTGGCATCGTT-3′). The PCR reaction, using HeLa total DNA as template, generated the expected 691-bp DNA fragment. The presence of both genes on the amplified fragment was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Press C.S.H.L. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar) using 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific to each gene: mH1 (5′-AGTGGGCGGAGGAAGCTCATCA-3′) and mP2 (5′-CTCGCCTTCCAGAGCCTG-3′) for the H1 RNA and mPARP-2 genes, respectively, in the mouse and hH1 (5′-GGTACCTCAACCTCAGCCATTGA-3′) and hP2 (5′-TTCGAATTCCATGGCGGCGCG-3′) for the H1 RNA andmPARP-2 genes, respectively, in the human. HeLa and NIH/3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 and 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Twenty hours after plating, the cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (16Banerji J. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Cell. 1981; 27: 299-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) using 3 μg of supercoiled recombinant DNA per 35-mm dish. The medium was changed after 8 h and at 24 h, and transfection efficiency was determined using inverted fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 135). Cells were cotransfected at a 1:10 ratio with the control reporter vector pDSRed1-N1 (17Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar), which gave a red signal on fluorescence microscopy. In a second group, propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) was used to control for background fluorescence. Promoter analysis by flow cytometry was performed by recording green fluorescence intensity emitted by the transfected cells 36–48 h after transfection. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in 1× PBS, and then placed in ice until analysis by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson Co. FACScan™ flow cytometer). Data were acquired and analyzed using the program CellQuest™. Variations in the GFP reporter gene expression were controlled by dividing the arithmetic mean of GFP expression by the equivalent measure for RFP expression in the same cells. Whole cell extracts were prepared as previously described (18Baer M. Nilsen T.W. Costigan C. Altman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, after trypsinization, NIH/3T3 cells were concentrated by centrifugation and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. After one additional wash in 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, the cells were resuspended in one packed cell volume of the same buffer and allowed to swell for 10 min. After swelling, the cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization until most nuclei were broken. The homogenate was made 200 mm in KCl by the addition of 1 m KCl and further homogenized by 5 strokes of the Dounce homogenizer before centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was dialyzed for 4 h against 100 volumes of 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. After dialysis, the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the resultant supernatant was divided into aliquots of 150 μl and stored at −80 °C. Transcription reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl. The mixtures contained 15 μl of the whole cell extract, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm each ATP, UTP, and CTP, 50 μm GTP, 5 μCi of [α-32P] GTP, 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and DNA templates as indicated in the figure legends. After a 1-h incubation at 30 °C, reaction mixtures were diluted to 250 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS, digested with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 42 °C, and extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by an ethanol precipitation. Reaction products were analyzed on 8 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, labeled transcripts were visualized by autoradiography. Serial sections of a 15-day-post-coı̈tum mouse (10 μm) were made using a standard cryostat, collected on gelatin-coated slides, and stored at −80 °C. The murine PARP-2 probe corresponded to a cDNA fragment encoding residues 8–363. This fragment, cloned into pBluescript SK(+), was obtained by the screening of a 10-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library (6Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Höger T. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The antisense mPARP-2 probe was produced by linearization withXbaI and transcription using the T7 promoter, whereas the sense probe was produced by linearization with XhoI and transcription using the T3 promoter. The murine RNase P RNA antisense probe was generated by an EcoRI run off T3 in vitro transcription of a 261-bp SmaI-Eco RI DNA fragment from the genomic clone 10G6 (see “Results”) subcloned into pBluescript SK(+). The control sense RNase P RNA was produced by an SmaI run-off T7 in vitrotranscription of the same construction. In situhybridization was performed as described in Niederreither and Dollé (19Niederreither K. Dollé P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 89: 247-267PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure was for 1 week for RNase P RNA probe and 6 weeks for PARP-2 probe. A mouse genomic library was screened with a PARP-2 cDNA probe that spans the coding region from amino acids 11 to 281, including a major part of the DNA binding domain and its putative nuclear location signal and nearly half of the catalytic domain. After hydrolysis by SacI, DNAs from eight clones were mapped by Southern blot analysis using the screening probe and oligonucleotides derived from the PARP-2 cDNA sequence. Two overlapping positive genomic clones, phages 5 (15.7 kb) and 10 (14 kb), were chosen as they span the whole PARP-2 gene (Fig.1). SacI DNA fragments belonging to PARP-2, 10G6 (6 kb), 10G3 (3 kb) for phage 10 and 5G2.5 (2.5 kb), 5G5 (5 kb), 5G6.5 (6.5 kb) for phage 5 were subcloned into the pBluescript SK vector. Sequence determination and comparison with the previously established cDNA sequence (6Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Höger T. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) allowed us to position the introns and exons and to set up the gene structure. As shown in Fig. 1, the PARP-2gene (about 13 kb in length) comprises 16 exons, all of them shorter than 150 bp except exon 16, which is more than 260 bp long, and 15 introns with sizes varying from 80 bp (intron 10) to 3044 bp (intron 4) (Table I). The sequences at the exon/intron junctions were in very good agreement, 53–100% homology, with the consensus sequences (20Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2769) Google Scholar) around both splice donor and acceptor sites (Table I).Table IExon/intron organization of the mouse PARP-2 gene The PARP-2 protein has been postulated to be organized in three main modules based on their respective biochemical function (Fig.1). The first module, spanning from amino acids 1–65, contains the DNA binding domain as well as the nuclear targeting sequence (6Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S. Höger T. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The second module spans amino acids 65–198 and corresponds to domain E of PARP-1. The third domain (termed F in PARP-1) spans amino acids 199–559 and contains the catalytic site of the enzyme. The information we obtained on the genomic organization allowed a matching of these domains to specific groups of exons of the PARP-2 gene (Fig.1). The DNA binding domain/nuclear location signal domain (amino acids 1–65) predicted to be responsible for the specificity of PARP-2 function is encoded by exons 1 and 2. Exons 3–7 code for domain E, whose function is still unknown. Finally, the catalytic domain (amino acids 198–559 corresponding to domain F in PARP-1) contains the evolutionarily conserved PARP signature and is encoded by exons 8–16. Only one of the intron-exon junctions in the catalytic domain was found conserved between the PARP-1 and PARP-2 genes (21Huppi K. Bhatia K. Siwarski D. Klinman D. Cherney B. Smulson M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3387-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Berghammer H. Schweiger M. Auer B. Poirier G.M. Moreau P. ADP-ribosylation Reactions. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1992: 69-72Crossref Google Scholar). This is the junction between exon 7 and exon 8 in PARP-2, which is identical to the junction between exon 13 and exon 14 in PARP-1. In both cases, the limit between domains E and F is delineated by the same amino acid. This exon/intron boundary is also the only one conserved in the PARP-3 gene and is located between exons 3 and 4 (data not shown). The absence of conservation of the other intron/exon boundaries at least in the PARP genes already described, strongly suggests that these genes must have evolved independently. The surprising feature of the genomic structure of the PARP-2gene was its extreme proximity to the RNase P RNA (H1 RNA in human) gene. To exclude any possible cloning artifact, we verified the relative position of the two genes in both mouse and human genomes by two PCR experiments and a Southern blot analysis. Four specific oligonucleotides complementary to the PARP-2 and RNase P RNA genes were designed to amplify a DNA fragment that would contain the entire exon 1 of the PARP-2 gene and almost the whole RNase P RNA gene in both mouse and human as shown in Fig. 2 A. Both PCR products were of the expected sizes (1121 and 691 bp for the mouse and human, respectively) deduced from the genomic sequences shown on a 1.2% agarose gel (Fig. 2 B). Southern blot analysis was then performed to demonstrate the presence of both genes within the same DNA molecule. Radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes specific to sequences located within the mouse and human PARP-2 and RNase P RNA genes (mP2, mH1, hP2, and hH1, respectively) were hybridized to the PCR DNA fragments. Fig. 2 B shows that all four probes produced a strong signal, indicating the presence of the two genes within a single DNA fragment. This confirmed the gene structure described above as well as its conservation in both the mouse and human. As a first step toward the delineation of the promoter region of the mousePARP-2 gene, we determined the transcription start sites. Primer extension analyses were performed on poly (A)+mRNA purified from PARP-1+/+ and PARP-1−/− 3T3 total RNA and on total RNA isolated from mouse ovary and testis tissue (Fig. 3). In all cases, primer extensions clearly indicated that the mPARP-2 cDNA was transcribed from a unique transcription start site, a cytosine at −63 bp from the initiation of translation (Fig. 3 and4). Similar experiments were performed to determine the transcription start sites in the human PARP-2gene. It was located close to the mouse start site, but −78 bp from the initiation of translation (data not shown) (Fig. 4). The position of the initiation region was close to the most 5′-extending mouse and human PARP-2 cDNA originally isolated (6Amé J.C. Rolli V. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Apiou F. Decker P. Muller S.

In both cases, this region, which spans the 3′-end of the RNase P RNA gene to the first intron of the PARP-2 gene, has an identical organization. It displays a high level of sequence homology even in the nontranscribed 5′ regions of both genes, which correspond to their promoter region. As was noticed above, however, the striking feature of this promoter region was the short distance between the two genes. The intergenic distance between the PARP-2 and RNase P RNA start sites is 113 bp for the mouse and 152 bp for the human. This suggests that this DNA region originally described by Altmanet al. (18Baer M. Nilsen T.W. Costigan C. Altman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as the promoter for the human RNase P RNA gene (H1 RNA) could also be used for the transcription of thePARP-2 gene. As for the transcription of most of the small RNAs (U6, 7SK and 7SL, MRP RNAs), the transcription of the H1 RNA is achieved in vitro by the RNA polymerase III (18Baer M. Nilsen T.W. Costigan C.

Each protein is coded by a homologous family of multigenes. TPL-1 binds to Sepharose CL-4B and was eluted with buffer containing 0.4m GlcNAc. The deduced amino acid sequence of TPL-1 consisted of 232 amino acids with an N-glycosylation site, Asn-Gly-Ser at residues 74–76. It shares a 65% sequence identity and similar internal repeats of about 20 amino acid motifs with tachylectin-1. Tachylectin-1 was identified as a lipopolysaccharide-agarose binding nonglycosylated protein from the amebocytes of T. tridentatus. TPL-2 was eluted from the LPS-Sepharose CL-4B affinity column in buffer containing 0.4m GlcNAc and 2 m KCl. The deduced amino acid sequence of TPL-2 consisted of 128 amino acids with anN-glycosylation site, Asn-Cys-Thr, at positions 3–5. It shares an 80% sequence identity with tachylectin-3, isolated from the amebocytes of T. tridentatus. TPL-2 purified by LPS-affinity column from the plasma predominantly exists as a dimer of a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa. Tachylectin-3 is an intracellular nonglycosylated protein that also exists as a dimer in solution with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa. It recognizes Gram-negative bacteria through the 0-antigen of LPS. Western blot analyses showed that, in the plasma, TPL-1 and TPL-2 exist predominantly as oligomers with molecular masses above 60 kDa. They both bind to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and this binding is inhibited by GlcNAc. Possible binding site of TPL-1 and TPL-2 to the bacteria could be at the NAc moiety of GlcNAc-MurNAc of the peptidoglycan. The physiological function of TPL-1 and TPL-2 is most likely related to their ability to form a cluster of interlocking molecules to immobilize and entrap invading organisms.

Although a certain form of adaptive immunity is present in all vertebrates, the invertebrates have developed only the innate immune system that has been thought of as an evolutionary rudiment, whose only function is to limit infection until adaptive immune response is induced. Recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has the capacity to induce costimulatory signals necessary for the activation and differentiation of lymphocytes (1Fearon D.T. Locksley R.M. Science. 1996; 272: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 2Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This finding has renewed interest on the studies of invertebrate and vertebrate innate immunology. The innate immune system uses germline-encoded receptors for recognition of common antigens on the surface of microbial pathogens. This feature distinguishes the innate immune system found in invertebrates from the adaptive immune system of the vertebrates that possess a repertoire of specific antigen receptors and antibodies. The conserved constituents or patterns, displayed by microorganisms, are recognized by pattern recognition molecules or receptors (4Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). These patterns, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns, seem to be shared among groups of pathogens. The lipopolysaccharides (LPS)1 of Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid of Gram-positive bacteria, glycolipids of mycobacterium, and mannans of yeast are some examples. The innate defense system is designed to recognize those pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The horseshoe crab, an arthropod, has evolved only a nonclonal, or innate, defense system. The hemolymph and the hemocytes carry this defense system. Whereas the hemocytes, also named amebocytes, contain large and small granules that are filled with defense molecules, such as coagulation factors (5Muta T. Iwanaga S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 6Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Muta T. J. Biochem.

( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the hemoplymph contains three major proteins: hemocyanin, C-reactive proteins (CRPs), and α2-macroglobulin. Hemocyanin functions as an oxygen-carrying protein. CRPs are lectins that bind to phosphocholine of the pneumococcus C-polysaccharide (9Volanakis J.E. Kaplan M.H. Proc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1971; 136: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and to the chromatin of damaged cells (10Robey F.A. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 969-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2-Macroglobulin exhibits protease inhibitory activity with a broad specificity that can block the activities of proteases secreted from invading microorganisms (11Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Salvesen G. Fey G.H. Figler N.L. Gonias S.L. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10070-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TheLimulus CRPs, along with the C3 homologue, α2-macroglobulin, participate in a complement-like hemolytic activity in horseshoe crab hemolymph. Several lectins with a broad range of specificity have been identified in the amebocytes of horseshoe crab (12Liu T. Lin Y. Cislo T. Minetti C.A.S.A. Baba J.M.K. Liu T.Y. J. Biol.

These lectins have been proposed to function in concert to defend horseshoe crabs from invading pathogens. However, since these lectins are present mostly in the granules of the hemocytes, they are unlikely to be involved in the immediate-early response of host-pathogen interaction. The plasma of horseshoe crab also contains lectin-like innate defense molecules (14Gokudan S. Muta T. Tsuda R. Koori K. Kawahara T. Seki N. Mizunoe Y. Wai S.N. Iwanaga S. Kawabata S. Proc. Natl.

In the previous study from this laboratory, we described the isolation and characterization of proteins that bind to Sepharose CL-4B, lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia coli, and protein A of Staphylococcus aureus from the plasma ofTachypleus tridentatus (15Chiou S.T. Chen Y.W. Chen S.C. Chao C.F. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1630-1634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report biochemical characterization and cDNA cloning of two of the proteins, the Sepharose CL-4B-binding protein (TPL-1) and the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (TPL-2), which we believe are involved in the innate immunity of horseshoe crabs. E. coli O55:B5 LPS was purchased from Sigma. Sepharose CL-4B, CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B, molecular weight standards, and staphylococcal protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Trypsin and complete protease inhibitor tablets were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Streptavidin-agarose and EZ-Link NHC-LC-Biotin were from Pierce. All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. T. tridentatus were captured on the beaches of Quimoi Island, Taiwan. Horseshoe crabs were bled by cardiac puncture, and hemolymph was collected in a conical tube containing equal volume of chilled sterile 3% NaCl supplemented with 2 mm propranolol and protease inhibitor tablets (1 tablet/50 ml) to maintain the isotonic condition and to prevent the lysis of amebocyte (16Mürer E.H. Levin J. Holmer R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1975; 86: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The amebocytes were separated from plasma by centrifugation at 140 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new conical tube under sterile condition, filtered through a 0.2-μm pyrogen-free filter, and loaded immediately into column. LPS affinity resin was prepared by coupling LPS from E. coliO55:B5 with CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B according to the instruction of manufacturer with the ligand concentration of 2 × 10−6 mol/ml of drained gel by assuming the average molecular mass of LPS to be 5,000 daltons. Five hundred milliliters of filtered, protease inhibitor-supplemented hemolymph was passed sequentially through three 10 mm × 10-cm tandemly linked affinity columns, packed with Sepharose CL-4B, staphylococcal protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and LPS-Sepharose CL-4B, respectively. The columns were pre-equilibrated with initial buffer (10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2) and at the end of sample loading, washed with at least 10 column volumes of the initial buffer containing 1 m KCl until a steady base line was obtained. The columns were detached from each other. To recover TPL-1 from the Sepharose CL-4B, which served as the affinity matrix, the column was eluted with the initial buffer containing 0.4 m GlcNAc. To recover the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (TPL-2), the LPS column was eluted with the initial buffer containing 0.4 m GlcNac and 2m KCl. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the effluent fractions containing the adsorbed proteins to 50% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min and dissolved in initial buffer. The entire purification procedure was performed at 4 °C. High performance liquid chromatography was performed on an HP1100 (Hewlett-Packard) HPLC system with a C4 column (214TP54, Vydac) using a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min for protein and with a C18 column (218TP52, Vydac) using a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min for protease-digested peptides. The compositions of Buffer A and Buffer B were acetonitrile:water:trifluoroacetic acid at 10:90:0.1 and at 90:10:0.1, respectively. Proteins and peptides were eluted from columns with linear gradient of 0–100% Buffer B. Absorbency for proteins and peptides were monitored at 280 and 214 nm, respectively. Protein purified by HPLC was lyophilized and dissolved in 0.4 mNH4HCO3 containing 8 m urea. After reduction with dithiothreitol and S-alkylation with iodoacetamide, three volumes of distilled H2O were added. The protein was then digested with trypsin (E/S = 1/25, w/w) at 37 °C for 24 h. The peptides generated were separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described above using C18 column (218TP52, Vydac). Periodic acid-Schiff stain was performed to assay for glycoprotein. At the end of SDS-PAGE, gel was fixed with trichloroacetic acid, oxidized with periodic acid, followed by staining with Schiff's reagent and destaining with acetic acid as described (17Kapitany R.A. Zebrowski E.J. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Monosaccharide contents were analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectroscopy using the Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph, connected to a Hewlett-Packard 5973 mass selective detector. Samples for analysis were subjected to methanolysis, re-N-acetylation, and trimethylsilylation and dissolved in hexane prior to splitless injection into a HP-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, inner diameter, Hewlett-Packard). The column head pressure was maintained at around 8.2 p.s.i. to give a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min using helium as carrier gas. Oven temperature was held at 60 °C for 1 min, increased to 90 °C in 1 min, and then to 290 °C in 25 min. The trimethylsilyl derivatives were analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectroscopy on the Hewlett-Packard system using a temperature gradient of 60–140 °C at 25 °C/min, and then increased to 300 °C at 10 °C/min. Sequencing of samples recovered from the reverse-phase HPLC and from SDS-PAGE/electroblottings were performed on an ABI 492 Procise automatic protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The initial yield ranged from 10 to 20 pmol. The sequences were then analyzed by the GCG package (Genetics Computer Group Inc.). To raise antiserum against TPL-1 and TPL-2, proteins recovered from the eluate of Sepharose CL-4B and LPS-affinity column, respectively, were further purified by HPLC to obtain a 30-kDa TLP-1-species and a 36-kDa TLP-2-species, as judged by SDS-PAGE (15Chiou S.T. Chen Y.W. Chen S.C. Chao C.F. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1630-1634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Each of the purified protein was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into a female New Zealand White rabbit by the intrasplenitic route (18Hong T.H. Chen S.T. Tang T.K. Wang S.C. Chang T.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 21: 151-157Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Blood samples were collected after 4 weeks and subsequently every 7 days for the following 6–8 weeks (50 ml each time). Sera obtained were stored at −20 °C. TPL-1/TPL-2-specific IgGs were affinity-purified from immunized rabbit plasma by staphylococcal protein A column chromatography. Antibodies recovered were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (50% saturation) and used in the Western blot and immunoassay. The titer of the specific antibody was assayed by either immunoblotting or immunodiffusion. Proteins were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose using an electroblot apparatus (Hoefer TE70 semidry transfer unit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with constant current of 0.8 mA/cm2. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with specific antibody. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) in the second step and developed by the enhance chemiluminescence method (ECL system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-TPL-1 antibodies were biotinylated with EZ-Link NHS-Biotin (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. The biotinylated antibodies were incubated with strepavidin-agarose (Pierce), pretreated with 1% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C to block nonspecific binding. The gel (25 μl) was washed with the initial buffer, and incubated with horseshoe crab plasma (2 μg/50 μl) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with the initial buffer, the pellet was re-suspended in the nonreducing Laemmli SDS-PAGE buffer, boiled for 5 min and the supernatant (5 μl) was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-TPL-2 antiserum. To the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Greiner F-form), suspension of bacteria in a mixture of chloroform and ethanol 1:9 (v/v), were added (5 × 107 cells/well), and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of warm air (19Freudenberg M.A. Fomsgaard A. Mitov I. Calanos C. Infection. 1989; 17: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The concentration of bacteria in the culture was determined by measuring the scattered light of the culture at optical density of 600 nm with a spectrophotometer. The number of cells/ml was estimated assuming 0.1 opticl density unit is roughly equivalent to 108 cells/ml. The microplates with the adsorbed bacteria were washed with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline), and the unbound sites were blocked with 1% BSA dissolved in the wash buffer. A serially diluted TPL-1 or TPL-2 in diluent buffer (1% BSA in wash buffer) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, rabbit anti-TPL-1 or anti-TPL-2 antiserum were added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The antiserum against TPL-1 and TPL-2 used were preadsorbed with immobilized bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae R36A, E. coli Bos-12, or Vibrio parahaemoliticus) to minimize cross-reactivity with these bacteria. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with the wash buffer, 0.l ml of 0.1 mg/ml 3,3′,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) in substrate buffer was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for exactly 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.l ml of 2 mH2SO4 and the absorbency at 450 NM was read. Since 0.4 m GlcNAc and 0.4 m GlcNAc plus 2m KCl inhibit the binding of TPL-1 and TPl-2, respectively, to bacteria, these samples served as controls for the binding assay. Mass spectrometric analysis of HPLC-purified TPL-1 and TPL-2 was performed on a model DE-RP MALDI-TOF (PE Biosystems, Framingham, MA). All samples were dissolved in 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinipinic acid) at 10 mg/ml and analyzed in the positive ion mode. Tissues were obtained from an adult male of T. tridentatus. Immediately after dissection, the hepatopancreas, muscle, and hemocytes were excised and placed in liquid nitrogen. Total RNAs were prepared from hepatopancreas, using the RNAzol B kit (Biotex), and poly(A)+ RNAs were purified using QuickPrepR Micro mRNA purification kit with oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The first strand cDNA synthesis was primed with a hybrid oligo(dT) linker-primer and random primers and was transcribed using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The synthesized cDNA was used as a template in subsequent PCR. The primers were synthesized as follows: TPL-1, sense primer 5′-GA(A/G)TGGAC(A/C/G/T)CA(C/T)AT(A/C/T)AA(C/T)AA-3′ from EWTHING (residues 1–7) of N-terminal sequence and antisense primer 5′-TT(A/G)TC(A/C/G/T)GA(C/T)TG(C/T)TT(A/C/G/T)AG(A/G)TA(A/C/ G/T)CC-3′ from GYKQXDN (residues 195–201) of peptide tryp-2; TPL-2, sense primer 5′GA(A/G)GG(A/C/G/T)AA(A/G)(C/T)T(A/C/G/T)ATGAA(A/G)CA(C/T)CC-3′ from EGKLMKHP (residues 13–20) of N- terminal sequence and oligo(dT) as antisense primer. The PCR of cDNA template was performed in a Biometra personal cycler with the following program: cycle 1, 96 °C for 2 min; cycles 2–41, 96 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; cycle 42, 72 °C for 10 min. Amplified DNA fragments were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel, ligated into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and transformed into E. coli strain JM109 by the calcium chloride method. DNA sequence reaction was performed using the PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on an ABI 310 DNA sequencer, read automatically, and recorded using ABI Prism model version 2.1.1 software (PE Applied Biosystems). The sequences of 5′ end cDNA of TPL-1 and TPL-2 were determined by using the MARATHON cDNA cloning system (CLONTECH) with gene-specific primers (GSPs). For TPL-1, GSP1 was 5′GTATCC-AACTCCCATTACCATCCACTGG-3′ and GSP2 was 5′-GGTACACGGTCGCGTGCACCTGAAGATG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1063–1090 and 935–962, respectively; for TPL-2, GSP1 was 5′-AAATCACATTTACACAAGAGTTTCTCC-3′ and GSP2 was 5′-AAATATTTGATTGAATACATTCCCAGT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 446–474 and 418–444, respectively. The primers for 3′ RACE of TPL-1 were synthesized as follows: GSP1, 5′-ATATTTCGTCGACCCGTTGACGG-3′; GSP2, 5′-ATCTTTCGCTGCAAGAAACCTTGC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1276–1298 and 1390–1413, respectively. All the procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The amplified fragments representing overlapping 5′ and 3′ cDNA for TPL-1 and 5′ cDNA for TPL-2 were gel-purified and cloned as described previously (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 280Google Scholar). These cDNAs were subsequently ligated together to create full-length cDNAs. Genomic DNA was purified from hepatopancreas as described (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 280Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR were based on consensus amino acid sequences (residues 13–20 and 101–108) between TPL-2 and tachylectin-3 (21Inamori K. Saito T. Iwaki D. Nagira T. Iwanaga S. Arisaka F.

The PCR reaction was carried out under the following conditions: cycle 1, 96 °C for 2 min; cycles 2–4, 96 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; cycles 5–7, 96 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; cycles 8–41, 96 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; cycle 42, 72 °C for 15 min. The PCR product was gel-purified, cloned, and sequenced as described previously (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 280Google Scholar). By passing plasma of horseshoe crabs through tandemly linked affinity columns, two new lectins were purified and characterized: TPL-1, which binds to Sepharose CL-4B; and TPL-2, which binds to the LPS of E. coli. The use of Sepharose CL-4B as a “pre-column,” prior to the passage of plasma through the LPS-Sepaharose CL-4B, allowed the separation of TPL-1 from TPL-2. TPL-1 and TPL-2 could not be eluted from their respective affinity column with 2 m KCl, EDTA, galactose, or lactose. In the previous study, both proteins were eluted from the respective affinity column with buffer (10 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 4 murea or 2 m guanidium chloride (15Chiou S.T. Chen Y.W. Chen S.C. Chao C.F. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1630-1634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Proteins eluted with 4m urea or 2 m guanidium chloride gradually formed irreversible precipitate upon removal of the chaotropic agents. In the present study, 0.4 m GlcNAc was found effective in eluting TPL-1 from the Sepharose CL-4B column, while elution of TPL-2 from the LPS-affinity column required 2 m KCl in addition to 0.4 m GlcNAc. Proteins eluted with GlcNAc remain in solution after removal of GlcNAc and can be readsorbed to the affinity column. One passage of the plasma through the affinity columns depleted all of the proteins that bind to Sepharose CL-4B and LPS-columns. Subsequent to the elution of the columns with GlcNAc, insignificant amount of other proteins were eluted with 4 m urea or 2m guanidium chloride. The mechanism of the binding of TPL-1 to the Sepharose CL-4B and its elution by GlcNAc is not known. Sepharose is a polymerized form of agarose consisting of repeating unit of α-1,6-linkedd-galactose and an unusual 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose. Sepharose CL is prepared from Sepharose by reacting with 2,3-dibromopropanol under alkaline condition, resulting in cross-linkages between the 6-OH ofd-galactose of one chain and 2-OH of the 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose of the other chain, via 2-hydroxypropyl bridges (22Porath J. Janson J.-C. Laas T. J. Chromatogr. 1961; 60: 167-177Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Evidently, TPL-1 binds to this structure in a GlcNAc-dissociable manner. Tachylectin-2 was isolated from the amebocyte of horseshoe crabs by dextransulfate chromatography and shown to exhibit high affinity for both GlcNAc and GalNAc (23Okino S. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Tachylectin-P was puritfied from the perivitelline fluid of horseshoe crab by using an affinity column consisting of bovine submaxillary gland mucin attached to Sepharose 4B, and eluted from the column with GlcNAc (24Nagai T. Kawabata S. Shishikura F. Sugita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37673-37678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). From the plasma of horseshoe crabs, tachylectin 5A and 5B were purified, using an N-acetylated resin and elution of the proteins by GlcNAc (14Gokudan S. Muta T. Tsuda R. Koori K. Kawahara T. Seki N.

While exhibiting a common specificity of binding to theN-acetoamido moiety of hexoses, tachylectin-2, tachylectin-P, and tachylectin-5A/B do not share any sequence homology with each other. Whether these proteins would bind to unmodified Sepharose CL-4B like TPL-1, and be eluted from it by GlcNAc, is not known. TPL-2 can be eluted from the LPS-affinity column with buffer containing 0.1% LPS and 2 m KCl. However, the LPS-eluted TPL-2 could not be completely separated from LPS. GlcNAc is a component of the LPS used in the preparation of LPS-affinity column. Thus, GlcNAc.was used to elute LPS-binding protein. TPL-1 and TPL-2 isolated accounted for about 0.1% and 0.02–0.04%, respectively, of the total hemolymph proteins. Although the amount of TPL-1 remained fairly constant, the amount of TPL-2 decreased rapidly after the animals have been kept in captivity. On SDS-PAGE under nonreducing condition (Fig. 1 A,lane 1), TPL-1 showed two major bands at around 30 kDa, a band at around 52 kDa, two bands at around 66 kDa, and additional bands at over 100 kDa. Under reducing condition (Fig.1 B, lane 1), protein bands at 30, 52, and 66 kDa were detected. In Western blot analysis, antibodies raised against the 30-kDa TPL-1, reacted with these protein bands in nonreducing (Fig. 1 C, lane 3) and reducing (Fig. 1 C, lane 7) SDS-PAGE. Protein bands with even higher molecular masses (52 kDa and above) were detected in both the pre- and post-column plasma samples, under nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 C, lane 1, pre-column; lane 2, post-column) and reducing (Fig. 1 C, lane 5, pre-column;lane 6, post-column). TPL-2 did not react with anti-TPL-1 serum (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4 and8), validating the specificity of the antibodies. Previously (15Chiou S.T. Chen Y.W. Chen S.C. Chao C.F. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1630-1634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we described a protein band with a molecular mass of 40 kDa as the major protein eluted by 4 m urea from Sepharose CL-4B. With 0.4 m GlcNAc solution as eluent, the 40-kDa protein was not detected (Fig. 1, A (lane 1) and B (lane 1)). The 30-kDa protein (TPL-1) was shown to have identical amino-terminal sequence with the previously published sequence of GBP (15Chiou S.T. Chen Y.W. Chen S.C. Chao C.F. Liu T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1630-1634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The gene sequence data predicted 232 amino acid residues for TPL-1 (Fig. 2). The deduced amino acid sequence of TPL-1 shares a 65% identity to tachylectin-1 (TL-1) (25Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

Small amounts of Δ2E1 were also observed in mitochondria isolated from rat liver, indicating that this form of CYP2E1 is also present in vivo. In the present study the mitochondrial targeting signal was identified and characterized by the use of several NH2-terminally truncated and mutated forms of CYP2E1 that were expressed in the mouse H2.35 hepatoma cell line. Two potential mitochondrial targeting sequences were identified in the NH2 terminus of CYP2E1. Deletion of the first potential mitochondrial targeting sequence located between amino acids 50 and 65, as in Δ(2–64)2E1, still resulted in mitochondrial targeting and processing, but when, in addition to the first, the second potential mitochondrial targeting sequence located between amino acids 74 and 95 was also deleted, as in Δ(2–95)2E1, the mitochondrial targeting was abolished. Mutation of the four positively charged Arg and Lys residues present in this sequence to neutral Ala residues resulted in the abrogation of mitochondrial targeting. Deletion of a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids between residues 76 and 83 also abolished mitochondrial targeting and import. Once imported in the mitochondria, these constructs were further processed to the mature protein Δ2E1. It is concluded that mitochondrial targeting of CYP2E1 is mediated through a sequence located between residues 74 and 95 and that positively charged residues as well as a hydrophobic stretch present in the beginning of this sequence are essential for this process.

Many of the proteins that are destined for import into the mitochondrial matrix contain a signal sequence in their NH2 terminus that directs these proteins to the mitochondria (4Pfanner N. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R412-R415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), although these signal sequences are also found in the COOH terminus of the protein (5Pfanner N. Hoeben P.

Despite the fact that there is no general consensus for mitochondrial matrix targeting sequences, many of these sequences were demonstrated to be rich in positively charged and hydrophobic amino acid residues and usually are able to form an amphiphilic secondary structure (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial matrix targeting sequence initially interacts with the import receptor (Tom20) that is part of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM)1 complex present in the mitochondrial outer membrane (9Ramage L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The surface of Tom20, which is rich in negatively charged amino acid residues, is thought to recognize and bind the positively charged residues present in these signal sequences; however, additional binding forces such as hydrophobic interactions also play an important role (10Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). After binding, the protein is then allowed to cross the lipid bilayer through the general translocation pore formed by the TOM complex (11Komiya T. Rospert S. Koehler C. Looser R. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3886-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Proteins destined for the matrix are then transferred to the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex and translocated into the matrix space (12Bauer M.F. Sirrenberg C. Neupert W. Brunner M.

The NH2-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain of microsomal cytochrome P450s (P450s) was shown not only to be responsible for the cotranslational targeting in a signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent manner to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (16Sakaguchi M.

Not all P450 enzymes are retained in the ER membrane by the same mechanisms; as was recently demonstrated, CYP2C1 is retained by static retention preventing exit from the ER, while CYP2E1 is retained by a retrieval mechanism allowing it to be recycled back from post-ER compartments (20Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C.D. Kemper B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol.

In contrast to microsomal P450s, mitochondrial P450s are, like most of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins, posttranslationally targeted to mitochondria by means of their amphiphilic NH2-terminal signal sequence (22Ogishima T.

Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is the alcohol-inducible member of the P450 family and has been suggested to be involved in gluconeogenesis because of its ability to metabolize ketone bodies such as acetone (24Ronis M.J.J.

In addition, a wide variety of small hydrophobic xenobiotics including many well known carcinogenic and toxic compounds are metabolized by CYP2E1 (24Ronis M.J.J. Lindros K.O. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Ioannides C. Cytochromes P450 Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, Inc., New York1996: 211-239Google Scholar). CYP2E1 is also known for its ability to cause oxidative stress that could ultimately lead to apoptosis (26Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol.

Previously we reported that an NH2-terminally truncated form of CYP2E1 was specifically targeted to the mitochondria (34Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation of the NH2-terminally hydrophobic transmembrane domain of CYP2E1 resulted in the mitochondrial localization of the protein when these constructs were transiently expressed in a mouse hepatoma cell line. It was demonstrated that this mitochondrially localized form of CYP2E1 was a NH2-terminally truncated form of CYP2E1 of ∼40 kDa named Δ2E1, which was shown to be soluble, catalytically active, and localized inside the mitochondria. In addition, Δ2E1 was present in low levels in vivo in mitochondria isolated from rat liver. In the present investigation, the mitochondrial targeting sequence of CYP2E1 was identified by constructing several NH2-terminal deletion mutants of CYP2E1, which lacked one or both putative mitochondrial targeting sequences that are present in the NH2 terminus of CYP2E1. Moreover, the role of the positively charged and hydrophobic amino acid residues present in this sequence in the mitochondrial targeting was investigated by mutational analysis. The CYP2E1 cDNAs encoding the truncated CYP2E1 variants Δ(2–29)2E1, Δ(2–64)2E1, Δ(2–76)2E1, Δ(2–82)2E1, and Δ(2–95)2E1 2The numbering of the amino acids corresponds to that of the full-length CYP2E1. were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the appropriate sense primer containing an ATG codon, primers 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 1e, respectively (Table I); the wild-type antisense primer 2a; and CYP2E1 cDNA as a template. The RK→A cDNA containing the internal mutations R75A, R76A, K84A, and K87A and the K→A cDNA containing K84A and K87A were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the sense primers starting from position 193 (corresponding to amino acid position 65) that incorporated the mutations, primer 1f for RK→A and primer 1g for K→A, the wild-type antisense primer 2a, and CYP2E1 cDNA as a template. The resulting cDNAs were cloned between the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the mammalian pCMV5 expression vector. The constructs R75A and RR→AA were prepared as follows. The pCMV5 vector contains a uniqueBsgI restriction site located outside the cloning box, 235 bases 3′ of the XbaI site, and CYP2E1 cDNA also has a unique BsgI restriction site at position 213. The vector containing the insert Δ(2–29)2E1 was digested with BsgI, thereby cutting out the Δ(2–29)2E1 cDNA from position 127 until the BsgI site after the cloning box, thereby leaving the first 126 5′ bases of Δ(2–29)2E1 attached to the vector. The CYP2E1 cDNAs containing the mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the sense primer containing aBsgI site and the appropriate mutations, primer 1h for R75A and primer 1i for RR→AA, the antisense primer that anneals just after the BsgI site of the vector primer 2b, and pCMV-CYP2E1 as a template. The resulting cDNA fragments were cloned in between the two BsgI sites of pCMV5 vector still containing the cDNA coding for the first amino acids of the construct. The correct sequences of all inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the ABI PRISM® dye terminator cycle sequencing kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Table ISequences of the oligonucleotides used as polymerase chain reaction primersPrimerSequence 5′ to 3′1aGACGAATTCATGTGGAACCTGCCCCCAGGA1bGACGAATTCATGGGGCCAGTGTTCACACTGCAC1cGACGAATTCATGATCGTGGTCCTGCATGGCTAC1dGACGAATTCATGTACAAGGCTGTCAAGGAGGTG1eGACGAATTCATGGAGTTTTCTGGACGGGGGGAC1fGACGAATTCATGGGGCCAGTGTTCACACTGCACCTTGGCTCAGCCGCCATCGTGGTCCTGCATGGCTACGCCGCTGTCGCCGAGGTGCTACTGAACCAC1gGACGAATTCATGGGGCCAGTGTTCACACTGCACCTTGGCTCAAGGCGCATCGTGGTCCTGCATGGCTACGCC GCTGTCGCCGAGGTGCTACTGAACCAC1hAGCGCTTCGGGCCAGTGTTCACACTGCACCTTGGCTCAGCCCGCATCGTGGTCCTGCATGGC1iAGCGCTTCGGGCCAGTGTTCACACTGCACCTTGGCTCAGCCGCCATCGTGGTCCTGCATGGC2aGACTCTAGATCATGAACGGGGAATGAC2bTGTAATCCCAGCAATTTGGGAThe nucleotides coding for the bases that were mutated are represented in a boldface type, and the recognition sites for the restriction enzymes are depicted in italics.

After transfection, the H2.35 cells were fixed and processed for immunostaining as described (33Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. J. Biol.

Transfected proteins were detected by using CYP2E1-specific antibodies and visualized by anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies. Cells were double-immunostained by sequential incubation with CYP2E1-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies, which were visualized by anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies, followed by incubation with mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mHsp70)-specific monoclonal antibodies (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Goldon, CO), which were visualized by anti-mouse tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies. Cells were viewed under a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescent microscope equipped with a camera using the 60× oil immersion objective. The catalytic activity of several of the CYP2E1 variants was determined by monitoring the hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone (31Neve E.P.A. Eliasson E. Pronzato M.A. Albano E. Marinari U.

The post-nuclear supernatant of cells transfected with Δ(2–29)2E1, Δ(2–64)2E1, Δ(2–95)2E1, or empty plasmid was prepared, and organelles were disrupted by sonication (three bursts of 10 s with 30-s intervals) on ice. Mitochondria were isolated from cells transfected with empty plasmid or Δ(2–29)2E1 and disrupted by sonication as described previously (34Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture consisted of 250 μg of sonic disrupted post-nuclear supernatant or 100 μg of sonic disrupted mitochondria, 50 μm chlorzoxazone, a NADPH generating system (0.2 mm NADPH, 2.0 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 3 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 250 μl in the presence or absence of 1.0 nmol of adrenodoxin (Adx), 0.1 nmol of adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), kindly supplied by Prof. Rita Bernhardt (University of Saarbrücken, Germany). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of orthophosphoric acid, and samples were extracted and analyzed on an Varian ProStar HPLC system (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA) equipped with an amperometric detector (Bioanalytical Systems Inc, West Lafayette, IN). The mitochondrial targeting of a NH2-terminally truncated form of CYP2E1, Δ(2–29)2E1, was investigated by constructing several NH2-terminal deletion mutants of CYP2E1 (see Fig. 1). Examination of the first 100 amino acids of CYP2E1 revealed that there are two amino acid stretches that could serve as potential mitochondrial targeting signals (the underlined sequences shown in Fig. 1). Both these sequences are rich in positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids and are potentially able to form an amphiphilic secondary structure, features that are characteristic for a mitochondrial targeting signal. H2.35 cells transfected with Δ(2–29)2E1 were analyzed by Western blotting and a NH2-terminally truncated form of CYP2E1 of around 40 kDa named Δ2E1 (Fig. 2) was detected (34Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization by immunofluorescent microscopy confirmed the mitochondrial localization of Δ2E1 (Fig.3). Indeed, the staining pattern observed using CYP2E1-specific antibodies (Fig. 4,upper left panel) was identical to that observed using antibodies recognizing the mitochondrial protein, mHsp70 (Fig. 4, upper right panel). To identify the targeting sequence that was responsible for the mitochondrial targeting and import, two constructs were designed that lacked one or both potential targeting sequences. Δ(2–64)2E1, in which the first potential targeting signal (amino acids 51–64) was deleted, was transfected into H2.35 cells, which were analyzed by Western blotting. In addition to Δ2E1, a protein with the expected full length of the construct was observed (Fig. 2), and both these proteins were recovered in the mitochondrial fraction (data not shown). Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that cells transfected with Δ(2–64)2E1 displayed a similar staining pattern to that observed for Δ(2–29)2E1-transfected cells (Fig. 3) and was shown to colocalize with mHsp70 (Fig. 4), confirming its mitochondrial localization. These results clearly demonstrated that deletion of the first 64 amino acids of CYP2E1 did not affect the mitochondrial targeting and that the region between amino acids 51 and 64 was not responsible for directing Δ(2–29)2E1 to the mitochondria.Figure 3Subcellular localization of the NH2-terminally truncated and mutated CYP2E1 constructs assessed by immunofluorescent microscopy when expressed in H2.35 cells.

A protein with a slightly lower mobility than Δ2E1 was observed by Western blotting (Fig. 2), which corresponds to the expected full-length size of the construct. Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that Δ(2–95)2E1 was not associated with the mitochondria, but instead displayed a diffuse staining pattern throughout the whole cell, most likely representing a cytosolic localization of this protein (Fig. 3). These data demonstrated that the region between amino acids 74 and 95 was responsible for the mitochondrial targeting and that this region served as a mitochondrial targeting signal. Previously we showed that Δ2E1 was catalytically active in the presence of the mitochondrial electron carrier proteins Adx and AdR (34Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The post-nuclear supernatant of cells transfected with Δ(2–29)2E1, Δ(2–64)2E1, and Δ(2–95)2E1 was assayed for catalytic activity (Fig. 5 A). As expected, cells transfected with Δ(2–29)2E1 displayed catalytic activity in the presence of both Adx and AdR. Additionally, cells transfected with Δ(2–64)2E1 had significant chlorzoxazone hydroxylation activity with levels well over those of cells transfected with empty plasmid (mock). When incubated in the absence of Adx and AdR, no significant increase in catalytic activity was observed, indicating that these truncated CYP2E1 variants were not able to couple with the endogenous NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase. Despite the extensive deletion in Δ(2–95)2E1, some residual catalytic activity could still be detected, although the observed levels were very low. The expression levels of these three truncated proteins were found to be very similar (see Fig. 2), which indicated that only a part of the Δ(2–95)2E1 expressed was catalytically active. Mitochondria isolated from cells transfected with Δ(2–29)2E1 displayed a 3-fold increase in catalytic activity over mitochondria isolated from mock transfected cells (Fig. 5 B), indicating that the catalytic activity is associated with the mitochondria as was also previously reported (34Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The involvement of the positively charged residues that are present in the mitochondrial targeting sequence identified above, Arg at positions 75 and 76 and Lys at positions 84 and 87, was studied by mutating all four these residues to uncharged Ala residues, mutant RK→A. Western blotting revealed that only the full length of the construct was expressed in cells transfected with RK→A; no Δ2E1 protein could be observed (Fig. 2). The subcellular localization was shown to be similar to cells transfected with Δ(2–95)2E1, a diffuse staining pattern indicative of a cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3). This showed that together these four positively charged residues present in the mitochondrial targeting signal are essential for the mitochondrial targeting and subsequent import of this protein. In addition, the data hitherto presented demonstrate that, once the protein is imported into the mitochondria, the mitochondrial import signal is removed thus forming the mature protein Δ2E1. Mutation of only the two Lys residues to Ala (K→A) caused decreased, although significant mitochondrial import and processing (Fig. 2). Thus, most of the protein expressed was the full-length construct (unprocessed form), whereas a significantly smaller amount was found to be truncated to Δ2E1. When K→A-transfected cells were examined by immunofluorescent microscopy, two populations of staining patterns were observed (Fig. 3), some cells displayed typical mitochondrial staining, which was confirmed by colocalization with mHsp70 (Fig. 4), while others had a more diffuse staining pattern resembling the staining observed for RK→A. Mutation of only the two positive Arg residues to the uncharged Ala residues (RR→AA) had no effect on the mitochondrial localization of Δ(2–29)2E1 (Figs. 3 and 4). Unfortunately, because of the low levels of expression of RR→AA, analysis by Western blot proved to be difficult. These data indicated no absolute requirement for these two residues alone in the mitochondrial targeting. When Arg-75 was mutated to the hydrophobic residue Ile and Arg-76 mutated to Ala (RR→IA), a similar subcellular distribution as for RR→AA was observed. In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that these transfected cells expressed Δ2E1, indicating that mitochondrial targeting and import was not affected by these mutations (data not shown). Additionally, substitution of Arg-75 with Ala (R75A) had no effect on the mitochondrial targeting and processing, the transfected cells expressed Δ2E1 (Fig. 2) and displayed the typical mitochondrial staining pattern (Figs. 3 and 4). These results indicated that the two Arg residues at positions 75 and 76 alone were not essential for the mitochondrial targeting and import of Δ(2–29)2E1. Partial disruption of the mitochondrial targeting signal as in Δ(2–76)2E1 and Δ(2–82)2E1 resulted in low expression levels that were difficult to detect by Western blot analysis. The few transfected cells were, however, easily detected by immunofluorescent microscopy. Some of the cells transfected with Δ(2–76)2E1, in which the NH2 terminus including Arg-75 and Arg-76 was deleted, displayed the typical mitochondrial staining pattern, while others had a more diffuse staining pattern, a pattern similar to that observed for K→A-transfected cells (Figs. 3 and 4). This was in good agreement with the results obtained above, which showed that Arg-75 and Arg-76 had only a minor effect on mitochondrial targeting. Further disruption of the mitochondrial targeting signal as in Δ(2–82)2E1 resulted in the diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern in cells transfected with this construct, indicating that the hydrophobic region between amino acids 76 and 83 was essential for the mitochondrial targeting of Δ(2–29)2E1 (Fig. 3). The hydrophobic NH2 terminus of P450s is responsible for the cotranslational targeting of the protein to the membrane of the ER (16Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3361-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Monier S. Van, L.uc P. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Deletion of the hydrophobic ER targeting signal as in Δ(2–29)2E1 results in targeting of this truncated protein to the mitochondria (34Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study, it was demonstrated, by sequential deletion of the NH2 terminus and by mutational analysis, that the region between amino acids 74 and 95 is responsible for the mitochondrial targeting of CYP2E1. The presence of four positively charged amino acid residues as well as a stretch of hydrophobic residues at the beginning of this targeting sequence were shown to be essential for the mitochondrial targeting and import of Δ(2–29)2E1. Western blot analysis showed that Δ2E1 displayed a slightly higher mobility than Δ(2–95)2E1, suggesting that Δ2E1 is a NH2-terminally truncated form of CYP2E1 lacking approximately the first 100 amino acids. It is well known that many of the proteins that are targeted to mitochondria contain a mitochondrial targeting signal, also called a presequence, which is usually located at the NH2 terminus of the protein (1Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 2Mori M. Terada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Voos W.

Biol. 2000; 10: R412-R415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Attempts to define a general consensus sequence for these mitochondrial targeting signals have not resulted in a well defined motif as is known for proteins targeted to other intracellular organelles such as peroxisomes (35Hettema E.H. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or the endocytic compartment (36Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). General features valid for most of the mitochondrial targeting sequences are that they are usually rich in positively charged and hydrophobic amino acid residues, they do not contain any or very few negatively charged residues, and they have the potential to form an amphiphilic secondary structure (7von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Schleiff E. Heard T.S. Weiner H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is believed that the positively charged residues together with the hydrophobic residues are essential for binding to the negatively charged surface of the Tom20 receptor (10Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 11Komiya T. Rospert S. Koehler C. Looser R. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3886-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recently, however, NMR studies have shown that the initial interaction between the signal sequence of rat aldehyde dehydrogenase and the rat Tom20 receptor was entirely mediated by hydrophobic interactions (38Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The initial binding was shown not to be dependent on ionic interactions, thereby reducing the role for the positively charged residues of the presequence in the initial binding. This agreed well with the observation made in the present study; the hydrophobic region at the beginning of the mitochondrial targeting signal (amino acids 77–82) of CYP2E1 is essential for targeting to and import into the mitochondria. The positive charges of the presequence were shown to be important for transport across the mitochondrial outer and inner membrane by sequential binding to several components of the TOM and TIM complex (the “acid chain hypothesis”) (11Komiya T. Rospert S. Koehler C. Looser R. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3886-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Bauer M.F. Sirrenberg C. Neupert W. Brunner M.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and also are thought to be necessary for recognition by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (39Ito A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mutation of all four positively charged residues present in the mitochondrial targeting signal of CYP2E1 to uncharged Ala residues effectively prevented mitochondrial targeting and subsequent import as shown by both immunofluorescent microscopy and Western blot analysis. However, mutation of only one or both Arg residues at the beginning of this signal did not have any major effect on the mitochondrial targeting and import. Mutation of only the two Lys residues resulted in an intermediate result; although mitochondrial targeting and import was still observed, it was less efficient as compared with the construct Δ(2–64)2E1 where the two Lys residues were still present. Deletion of the NH2 terminus until just after the two Arg residues, as in Δ(2–76)2E1, still resulted in mitochondrial targeting, although less efficient, indicating that these Arg residues are not essential for mitochondrial targeting and import. These results implied that all four positively charged residues together are essential for mitochondrial targeting, and subsequent import and processing of Δ(2–29)2E1. The construct Δ(2–82)2E1, where, in addition to the two Arg residues, a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids was deleted, displayed a similar staining pattern as observed for Δ(2–95)2E1,i.e. a cytosolic localization. This strongly suggests that the hydrophobic region between Arg-76 and Lys-84 is critical for the mitochondrial targeting of Δ(2–29)2E1. Despite the fact that Δ(2–95)2E1 displayed catalytic activity, it was lower than that observed in cells transfected with Δ(2–29)2E1 and Δ(2–64)2E1, which expressed Δ2E1. In addition, it was further demonstrated that the catalytic activity is localized in the mitochondria. These data suggest that to efficiently assemble a catalytically active Δ2E1 the folding and processing machinery present in the mitochondrial matrix is required. It should, however, be emphasized that the observed activities as well as the protein expression levels are very low when compared with those observed for wild-type CYP2E1. The demonstration that the catalytic activity is associated with isolated mitochondria, together with the observation that all the mitochondrial localized CYP2E1 variants are processed to the mature Δ2E1, strongly indicates that Δ2E1 is present in the mitochondrial matrix. The results obtained in the present study allow the construction of a model that can explain the mitochondrial targeting of CYP2E1, where binding of the SRP and subsequently the cotranslational targeting pathway has been compromised by either deletion or mutation of the hydrophobic NH2-terminal transmembrane domain. The translation of CYP2E1 is normally initiated on ribosomes present in the cytosol and binding of the SRP to the hydrophobic NH2terminus arrests this translation as soon as the nascent chain emerges from the ribosome (16Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3361-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Monier S. Van, L.uc P. Kreibich G. Sabatini D.D. Adesnik M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 40Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Translation only commences when the arrested complex is properly docked to the translocation complex present in the membrane of the ER (40Walter P. Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Deletion or modification of the hydrophobic NH2 terminus of CYP2E1 compromises the binding of the SRP, resulting in the translation of the entire protein on the cytosolic ribosomes. After synthesis, these proteins are most likely bound by cytosolic chaperones, targeted to the mitochondria by the exposed mitochondrial targeting sequence located between residues 74 and 95. After interaction with the TOM and TIM complex, CYP2E1 is translocated into the matrix of the mitochondria were the presequence is removed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase resulting in the mature protein, Δ2E1. Analysis of the secondary structure of the region of CYP2E1 between amino acids 74 and 95 revealed that the region from 83 to 95 was able to form an α-helical structure, while the region from 76 to 80 preferentially forms a β-sheet. The presence of the α-helical part alone is not sufficient for targeting of Δ(2–29)2E1 to the mitochondria. Deletion of the hydrophobic part between residues 76 and 83 abolished the mitochondrial targeting as observed for Δ(2–82)2E1, emphasizing the importance of this hydrophobic stretch in the initial targeting and binding of the protein to the mitochondria. It can be suggested that, for the α-helical structure to bind to the hydrophobic groove present in the Tom20 receptor, an initial interaction of the hydrophobic residues located between residues 76 and 83 is necessary for the binding of the presequence to the mitochondrial import receptor. After proper binding of the presequence to Tom20, the presence of the positively charged amino acid residues becomes important for the actual translocation over the outer and inner membrane of the mitochondria and also for the interaction with the proteolytic and folding machinery in the mitochondrial matrix. A model has been proposed for the mitochondrial targeting of an NH2-terminally truncated form of CYP1A1 expressed in both β-naphthoflavone-induced rat liver and transiently in COS cells (41Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). By using an in vitro translation assay in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomes and isolated rat liver cytosolic proteins, it was suggested that up to 25% of the nascent chains were able to escape cotranslational insertion into the ER membrane. It was further suggested that these escaped chains were processed by a cytosolic endopeptidase, resulting in the exposure of a mitochondrial targeting signal that directed the truncated CYP1A1 to the mitochondria. Our data, however, do not support this hypothesis; previous results showed that, when wild-type CYP2E1 was transfected in H2.35 cells, no mitochondrially localized Δ2E1 could be detected, although the expression levels were significantly higher than for the constructs used in the present study (34Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Only removal, as in Δ(2–29)2E1, or modification, as in N++2E1, of the hydrophobic NH2-terminal transmembrane domain of CYP2E1 resulted in mitochondrial targeting. Small amounts of Δ2E1 were detected in isolated rat liver mitochondria suggesting that in vivo the fidelity of the SRP binding and cotranslational targeting pathway can be compromised. Cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of CYP2B1 at serine 128 was demonstrated to cause mitochondrial targeting of this phosphorylated protein (42Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Mullick J. Sepuri N.B. Otvos L. Pain D. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5494-5504Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It was shown by using an in vitro translation system that phosphorylation of CYP2B1 interfered with the binding of the SRP and subsequent insertion into the ER membrane. Additionally, CYP2E1 has a serine at position 129 that can be phosphorylated in a cAMP-dependent manner, a modification that has been proposed to be involved in the degradation process (43Eliasson E. Johansson I. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). No mitochondrial targeting could be observed when cells expressing wild-type CYP2E1 were treated with a stable cAMP analogue, indicating that for CYP2E1 phosphorylation does not seem to play a role in the mitochondrial targeting. 3E. P. A. Neve and M. Ingelman-Sundberg, unpublished observations. In conclusion, when SRP binding to the hydrophobic NH2-terminal transmembrane domain of CYP2E1 is compromised, protein translation is not arrested and the entire CYP2E1 protein is translated in the cytosol. A mitochondrial targeting signal located between amino acid residues 74 and 95 is being exposed, probably after binding of the translated CYP2E1 protein with cytosolic chaperones, and the protein is targeted to the mitochondria. The mitochondrial targeting and import of Δ(2–29)2E1 is strongly dependent on the presence of positively charged amino acid residues Arg-75 and Arg-76 and Lys-84 and Lys-87 and of a hydrophobic region between residues 76 and 82. After mitochondrial import the signal sequence of Δ(2–29)2E1 is removed in the mitochondrial matrix, thereby forming the mature soluble and catalytically active protein Δ2E1.

The Arc signal transduction system consists of the ArcB and ArcA proteins, a transmembrane sensor kinase and its cognate response regulator, respectively (5Iuchi S. Cameron D.C. Lin E.C. J.

In response to oxygen deficiency or redox change, ArcB autophosphorylates in an ATP-dependent manner and converts to phosphorylated ArcB (ArcB-P)1 via an intramolecular phospho-relay of His-292 → Asp-576 → His-717 (7Georgellis D.

Because the rate of chromosomal replication regulated mainly at the level of initiation is coupled to growth rate (13von Meyenburg, K., Hansen, F.

It is therefore probable that regulation of initiation occurs at oriC, theE. coli origin of chromosomal replication (14Oka A. Sugimoto K. Takanami M. Hirota Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This unique sequence, which is the highly conserved origin of Gram-negative bacteria (15Zyskind J.W. Cleary J.M. Brusilow W.S. Harding N.E. Smith D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), includes four DnaA boxes, AT-rich region containing three 13-mers, and an IHF binding site, all of which are required for proper chromosomal initiation of replication (16Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 521-533Google Scholar, 17Messer, W., Weigel, C., Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology, 2nd Ed., Neidhardt, F.

E., 2, 1996, 1579, 1601, American Society for Microbiology, Washington DC.Google Scholar). Binding of the initiator protein, DnaA, to the DnaA boxes leads to unwinding of the AT-rich regions and allows for the entry of DnaB helicase, a required step for subsequent initiation processes (18Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 19Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 54: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Opening of the AT-rich region is facilitated by the binding of IHF protein to the IHF site, thereby bending oriC (20Polaczek P. New Biol. 1990; 2: 265-271PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although IHF can be substituted by HU protein (21Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in vivo footprinting experiments suggest that IHF may play a role in determining the timing of chromosomal initiation during the cell cycle (22Cassler M.R. Grimwade J.E. Leonard A.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5833-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here we report that the binding of ArcA-P, phosphorylated by ArcB, tooriC results in the inhibition of chromosomal initiation. This result suggests that the Arc two-component signal transduction system plays a role in the regulation of chromosomal initiation atoriC in response to oxygen deficiency.

For the construction of pBADarcA and pBADarcB, coding regions of arcA containing the whole polypeptide and arcB containing from the amino acid residue 129 to the stop codon were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the EcoRI/HindIII site of pBAD18 (32Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3959) Google Scholar) and the KpnI/XbaI site of pBAD24 (32Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3959) Google Scholar), respectively. E. colistrain MC1061 harboring either pBADarcA or pBADarcB was grown in LB media to an OD at 595 nm of 0.5 followed by the addition of l(+)-arabinose to a concentration of 0.2% to induce overproduction of the proteins. 2 h after induction, cells were harvested, resuspended in cell resuspension buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) to an OD at 595 nm of 200 and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysis and ammonium sulfate precipitation were performed as previously described (33Hwang D.S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10625-10632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 0.37 g/ml ammonium sulfate instead of 0.28 g/ml was used. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2.86 mm2-mercaptoethanol), which was used throughout the purification procedure. Subsequently, the activities of ArcA and ArcB were determined by transphosphorylation reactions as described below. The resuspended ammonium sulfate-precipitated pellet containing ArcA protein was dialyzed to the conductivity equivalent of 50 mm KCl then subjected to FastQ column chromatography (60 ml of bed volume, Sigma) using 600 ml of a linear gradient ranging from 50 mm to 1 m KCl in buffer A. The fractions containing ArcA were pooled and dialyzed to the conductivity equivalent of 50 mm KCl then loaded onto a heparin-agarose column (12 ml of bed volume, Sigma). A 120-ml gradient ranging from 50 mm to 1 m KCl in buffer A was used for protein elution, with ArcA eluting at ∼150 mm KCl. The fractions containing ArcA were pooled, diluted with buffer A to the conductivity equivalent of 50 mm KCl, and loaded onto a FastS column (4 ml of bed volume, Sigma). The fractions containing ArcA were pooled, diluted to the conductivity equivalent of 50 mm KCl with buffer A, and subjected to Cibacron Blue column chromatography (2.5 ml of bed volume, Sigma). A 25-ml gradient ranging from 50 mmto 2 m KCl in buffer A was run over the column, yielding near homogeneous ArcA, which eluted at ∼0.5 m KCl. About 17 mg of ArcA protein was obtained from 15 liters culture of MC1061(pBADarcA). For ArcB protein purification, the ammonium sulfate precipitate obtained from 6 liters of MC1061(pBADarcB) culture as described above was resuspended in buffer A, dialyzed to a conductivity equivalent of 50 mm KCl, and subjected to FastQ column chromatography (90 ml of bed volume) using a 900-ml gradient ranging from 50 mm to 1 m KCl in buffer A. Fractions containing ArcB were pooled, then dialyzed to a conductivity equivalent of 50 mm KCl and loaded onto a Cibacron blue column (17 ml of bed volume). A 170-ml gradient ranging from 50 mm to 1m KCl in buffer A was run over the column. ArcB eluted in a broad range of fractions, which were pooled, and the protein was precipitated by the addition of 0.45 g/ml ammonium sulfate followed by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 30 min in a Ti70 rotor (Beckman). The pellet was resuspended with buffer A and subjected to Superose-12 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, HR 10/30). ArcB eluted as a single peak. These fractions were pooled and loaded onto a MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, HR 5/5). ArcB eluted from the MonoQ column at near homogeneity and was used in further experiments. A 6-liter culture of MC1061(pBADarcB) yielded about 9 mg of homogeneous ArcB. Transphosphorylation reactions (TP), including purified ArcA and ArcB, were performed as previously described (34Iuchi S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 10 μl of the TP mixture contained 6 μg each of ArcA and ArcB, 0.1 mm ATP, 70 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 33 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation at 32 °C for 10 min, the reaction mixture (2 μl per each assay unless indicated) was immediately used for further experiments. To visualize the phosphorylated proteins, [γ-32P]ATP was added to the above mixture. The reaction was terminated by addition of gel-loading buffer (10% glycerol, 3% SDS, 3% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.3% bromphenol blue). After incubation at 55 °C for 3 min, the mixture was subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. Phosphorylation reaction of ArcA with carbamyl phosphate (CP) was performed as previously described (35Lynch A.S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μl of the CP mixture containing the indicated amount of ArcA protein, 40 mmdilithium carbamyl phosphate,125 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and immediately used for experiments. DNase I protection assays were performed as previously described (36Lee Y.S. Kim H. Hwang D.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A 435-bp XbaI/XhoI fragment from pFToriCwas labeled at either the XhoI or XbaI restriction site. 21.5 fmol of labeled fragments was mixed with the indicated proteins in 25 μl of standard reaction mixture containing 0.1 mm ATP, 50 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), and 10% glycerol. After incubation at 32 °C for 10 min, DNase I (5 ng in 1.5 μl of H2O) was added, incubated for 30 s, then stopped by the addition of 27 μl of 0.6 m sodium acetate, 0.4% SDS, 25 mmEDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA. Proteins were removed by phenol/chloroform extraction, and DNA was precipitated by ethanol, followed by a 70% ethanol wash. DNA was subjected to electrophoresis through a 5% Long Ranger polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7m urea. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. As previously described (37Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 38Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), in vitro oriC plasmid replication with fraction II from WM433 (dnaA204) and purified DnaA protein was performed using 200 ng of M13RE85 RF DNA as a template. Single-stranded phage DNAs, such as G4, M13mp19, and φX174, and pBluescript containing the ColE1 replication origin, 200 ng each, were used for DnaA-independent replication. In these assays, all conditions were identical to oriC plasmid replication reactions, except that DnaA was omitted. Open complex formation at oriC was detected using single-strand specific P1 nuclease as previously described with modifications (21Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Torheim N.K. Skarstad K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4882-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 25 μl of opening reaction mixture containing the indicated amount of DnaA, 15 ng of HU, 200 ng of supercoiled pSBoriC, 4 mm ATP, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), and 17% glycerol, was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Then 3 units of P1 nuclease in 3 μl of 30 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 s. The cleavage reaction was quenched by the addition of 27 μl of stop solution (25 mm EDTA, 0.4m NaOH). After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, followed by addition of 6 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), proteins were removed by phenol/chloroform extraction. With 2.5 μg of yeast tRNA as a carrier for precipitation, DNA samples were collected by ethanol precipitation followed by a 70% ethanol wash. The precipitated DNA was resuspended with 6 μl of H2O, and 2 μl was taken to be used as template for primer extension reactions. 6 μl of the primer extension mixture included 1.25 nmol of each dNTP, 0.25 pmol of 5′-end-labeled primer PA1 (21Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 0.42 unit of Vent (exo−) DNA polymerase in Vent (exo−) buffer with 5 mm MgSO4. The primer was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase; unincorporated radioactivity was removed using a Bio-Gel 6 spin column (Bio-Rad). The mixture was subjected to primer extension reactions in a thermocycler, for 20 cycles (95 °C for 1 min except for 4 min in the first cycle, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min except for 6 min in the last cycle). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of sequencing gel loading buffer, then subjected to electrophoresis through a 5% Long Ranger polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 m urea. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. To investigate the interaction of ArcA and ArcB with oriC DNA, ArcA and ArcB proteins were overproduced and purified to near homogeneity using column chromatography (Fig. 1 A). Due to poor expression of the ArcB protein, we instead expressed and purified a truncated ArcB lacking the N terminus from amino acid residues from 1 to 128 as described previously (34Iuchi S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ArcA and ArcB proteins used in this study were distinctive from the proteins containing the hexa-histidine (7Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lynch A.S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Colloms S.D. Alen C. Sherratt D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 41Strohmaier H. Noiges R. Kotschan S. Sawers G. Hogenauer G. Zechner E.L. Koraimann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or renatured from SDS-polyacrylamide gels (34Iuchi S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as used in previous studies. The purified ArcA and ArcB proteins were active in transphosphorylation reactions. In the presence of ATP, ArcB underwent autophosphorylation and subsequently transferred the phosphoryl group from itself to ArcA, forming ArcA-P, whereas ArcA alone was not phosphorylated (Fig.1 B). Binding of the transphosphorylation mixture (TP mixture), which contains ArcA, ArcB, and ATP, to the oriC region of theE. coli chromosome was detected using a DNase I protection assay (Fig. 2). Increasing the amount of TP mixture added to the footprinting reaction revealed that an ∼150-bp region located at the left end of oriC, including the three 13-mer AT-rich regions, DnaA box R1, and IHF binding site, was protected from DNase I cleavage (Fig. 2). The omission of ArcA, ArcB, or both from the TP mixture abolished the protection pattern observed at oriC, indicating that the oriCbinding activity requires both ArcA and ArcB proteins. Neither ADP nor the nonhydrolyzable ATP-analogue AMPPNP was able to substitute ATP for the oriC protection activity of the TP mixture, implying the requirement of ATP hydrolysis for binding (Fig.3 A). Efficient oriCprotection activity required more than 50 μm ATP. Without ArcB and ATP, it has been shown that the phosphoryl group donors carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate can phosphorylate ArcA (35Lynch A.S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we incubated ArcA with carbamyl phosphate in the absence of ArcB and ATP, and found an identical DNase I cleavage protection pattern (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that ArcA-P, produced by phosphorylation of ArcA protein either by ArcB and ATP or by carbamyl phosphate, binds to the left end of oriC. The AT-rich regions and DnaA box R1 found at oriC are indispensable for both in vitro andin vivo initiation of chromosomal replication (18Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 29Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23087-23091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Asai T. Takanami M. Imai M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of ArcA-P, which was found to bind those regions of oriC, on chromosomal initiation was examined using anin vitro oriC plasmid replication assay (37Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 38Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This assay resembles in vivo chromosomal initiation in many aspects, including dependence upon the oriC sequence, requirement of replicative proteins, and bidirectional replication fromoriC (37Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 43Kaguni J.M. Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Nature. 1982; 296: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Addition of purified DnaA protein to the oriC plasmid replication assay sustained the replication of oriC plasmid M13RE85 RF DNA, in which the oriC region has been inserted into M13mp8 RF DNA (Fig. 4 A). The presence of the TP mixture in the assay, however, inhibited DnaA-dependent oriC plasmid replication. Omission of ArcA, ArcB, or both from the TP mixture eliminated the inhibitory activity of the TP mixture (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the inhibitory activity is dependent on both ArcA and ArcB. However, incubation of ArcA protein with carbamyl phosphate instead of ArcB and ATP also inhibited oriC plasmid replication, whereas carbamyl phosphate or ArcA alone was not inhibitory (Fig.4 C). These results imply that ArcA-P, formed either by ArcB and ATP or by carbamyl phosphate, inhibits the oriC plasmid replication, and ArcB is not a requirement. To determine whether ArcA-P specifically inhibits initiation atoriC, the effect of ArcA-P on other origins was studied. Single-stranded viral DNAs φX174, M13, and G4 replicate from single- to double-stranded RF DNA using unique initiation processes, with each viral origin using varying proteins (16Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 521-533Google Scholar). In the absence of DnaA, the soluble proteins of fraction II, used for oriC plasmid replication, are sufficient to replicate single-stranded viral DNAs to RF DNAs (37Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBluescript, which contains the ColE1 origin, can also be replicated by fraction II in the absence of DnaA, but with less efficiency than the DnaA-dependent replication oforiC plasmid DNAs (37Fuller R.S. Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Addition of the TP mixture to these reactions did not affect replication of any of the tested single-stranded viral DNAs or pBluescript DNA (Fig. 4 D), indicating that ArcA-P specifically inhibits the initiation of replication at oriC. Because DNase I footprinting revealed the binding region of ArcA-P at a 150-bp region of the left end of oriC containing both DnaA box R1 and the IHF binding site, DNase I footprinting was further performed to determine whether ArcA-P inhibits initiation of replication at oriC by blocking the interaction of DnaA or IHF with oriC (Fig. 5). Addition of increasing amounts of DnaA to oriC (Fig.5 A, lanes 2–4) resulted in the protection of DnaA boxes R1 to R4 and IHF bound to the IHF binding site (Fig.5 B, lanes 2–4) both as previously described (21Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaA and IHF added prior to or after ArcA-P did not allow the binding of ArcA-P to DnaA box R1 nor the IHF site, respectively; however, neither protein affected the binding of ArcA-P to the AT-rich region (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 5–11). These results indicate that the binding of DnaA to DnaA box R1 and IHF to the IHF site is preferred over the binding of ArcA-P to those sites. However, DnaA and IHF do not affect ArcA-P binding to the AT-rich region. To further study the binding of ArcA-P to the AT-rich region oforiC, competition experiments using IciA were performed. IciA protein specifically binds to the three 13-mers in the AT-rich region and inhibits the initiation stage of in vitro oriCreplication (52Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. Cell. 1990; 63: 325-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, addition of IciA to a preformed ArcA-P·oriC complex displaced ArcA-P to generate a footprint similar that of IciA only. Conversely, ArcA-P displaced IciA bound to oriC (Fig. 5 B, lanes 14–16). At the onset of initiation, DnaA protein unwinds the AT-rich regions of oriC with the aid of HU or IHF, forming the open complex, a step that is prerequisite for the subsequent stages of initiation (18Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 19Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 54: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). DnaA-dependent strand opening of the AT-rich region can be observed using single-stranded-specific P1 nuclease and primer extension assays (Fig.6), as previously described (21Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Torheim N.K. Skarstad K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4882-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Addition of the TP mixture prior to DnaA protein in the assays resulted in inhibition of open complex formation. However, the addition of the TP mixture after open complex formation did not significantly inhibit open complex formation. These results imply that ArcA-P functions prior to the DnaA-dependent strand opening of the AT-rich region. The amounts of TP mixture required for oriC binding (Fig.2), inhibition of oriC replication (Fig. 4 B), and inhibition of open complex formation (Fig. 6) were comparable to each other. These results suggest that binding of ArcA-P to oriCinhibits oriC initiation by blocking open complex formation. ArcA protein phosphorylated by ArcB and ATP or by carbamyl phosphate binds the left end of oriC. This bound region includes the AT-rich 13-mers, DnaA box R1, and the IHF binding site, regions all highly conserved in chromosomal replication origins of Gram-negative bacteria (15Zyskind J.W.

A. 1983; 80: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and all of which are essential for initiation of E. coli chromosomal replication (18Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 29Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23087-23091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Asai T. Takanami M. Imai M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In chromosomal initiation events, the AT-rich region of oriCis unwound upon binding of DnaA proteins to the DnaA boxes (18Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 19Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 54: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Interaction of DnaA protein with the AT-rich region, leading to strand opening, is facilitated by the bending of oriC by IHF protein bound to the IHF site (20Polaczek P. New Biol. 1990; 2: 265-271PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of ArcA-P blocks DnaA-dependent strand opening of the AT-rich regions (Fig.6), a step required for subsequent stages of chromosomal initiation to occur. Binding of ArcA-P also results in the inhibition of in vitro oriC plasmid replication (Fig. 4). Because ArcA-P does not appear to affect the binding of DnaA and IHF to their loci (Fig. 5), such inhibition may be caused by ArcA-P binding to the AT-rich regions of oriC, thereby inhibiting a proper interaction between DnaA protein and the AT-rich region, an interaction which is thought to be required for the opening of the AT-rich region by DnaA (29Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23087-23091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,44Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from our reported binding of ArcA-P to oriC, ArcA-P binds to a number of promoter regions (35Lynch A.S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6146-6150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Drapal N. Sawers G. Mol.

Microbiol. 1993; 9: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), including thepfl promoter that controls expression of pyruvate formate lyase (46Tardat B. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We observed that ArcA-P possessed similar affinities to theoriC and pfl promoters using gel-shift assays (data not shown). However, we could not match the suggested ArcA-P binding consensus sequence (49Verma M. Moffat K.G. Egan J.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with the oriC sequences, the only commonality we found was a richness of A and T. Although unphosphorylated ArcA binds to pfl and sodApromoter regions in a several- to 10-fold excess over ArcA-P, with the same pattern of ArcA-P binding (46Tardat B. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 47Pellicer M.T. Fernandez C. Badia J. Aguilar J. Lin E.C. Baldom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1745-1752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we could not detect any binding of unphosphorylated ArcA to oriC, even when using a 15- to 20-fold excess (up to 15 μm) as compared with ArcA-P in the DNase I footprinting assay (data not shown). ArcA-P, even with a molecular mass of 27 kDa, protected a wide region, ∼150 bp, of oriC from DNase I cleavage (Figs. 2 and 3). This broad binding pattern was also observed at other ArcA-P binding sites (35Lynch A.S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Tardat B. Touati D. Mol.

The increased amount of ArcA-P enhanced the intensity of protected regions, rather than resulting in the broadening of the bound region, which would be evident if sequential bindings of ArcA-P were taking place (Fig. 2). These binding patterns suggest that multimerized or oligomerized ArcA-P, formed prior to DNA binding, as suggested from other binding sites (35Lynch A.S. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6238-6249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Tardat B. Touati D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 47Pellicer M.T. Fernandez C. Badia J.

The DNase I-hypersensitive sites with ∼10-bp intervals (Figs. 2 and 3) suggest that multimerized ArcA-P wraps the left end of oriC. Chromosomal replication is regulated mainly at the level of initiation; the rate of chromosomal replication is coupled to growth rate (13von Meyenburg, K., Hansen, F. G., Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology, Neidhardt, F. C., Ingraham, J. L., Low, K. B., Magasanik, B., Schaechter, M., Umbarger, H. E., 2, 1987, 1555, 1577, American Society for Microbiology, Washington DC.Google Scholar). Different physiological conditions determine unique growth rates, reflected by the frequency of chromosomal initiation. Slow growth conditions require a reduction in the frequency of chromosomal initiations to meet the retarded growth. However, it has been scarcely documented how organisms set the initiation frequency in response to various physiological conditions or environmental stresses. In E. coli, it was reported that UV irradiation inhibits the initiation of chromosomal replication from oriC (50Iuchi S. Furlong D. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2889-2893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, there are no further studies showing the regulatory factors involved or underlying mechanisms.

Even under aerobic condition, arcA mutants possess reduced chromosome numbers compared with the wild type (data not shown). Although there is no clear in vivo data available, our in vitroresults suggest that Arc, a two-component signal transduction system operated under anaerobic conditions in E. coli, plays a role in regulation of chromosomal initiation. Under oxygen depletion stress, the response regulator ArcA, phosphorylated by sensor kinase ArcB, may bind to oriC and reduce chromosomal initiation. We thank Dr. Edmund C. C.

TbPDE2A is a class I phosphodiesterase. Its catalytic domain exhibits 30–40% sequence identity with those of all 11 mammalian phosphodiesterase (PDE) families, as well as with PDE2fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae, dunce fromDrosophila melanogaster, and regA fromDictyostelium discoideum. The overall structure of TbPDE2A resembles that of human PDE11A in that its N-terminal region contains a single GAF domain. This domain is very similar to those of the mammalian PDE2, -5, -6, -10, and -11, where it constitutes a potential cGMP binding site. TbPDE2A can be expressed in S. cerevisiae, and it complements an S. cerevisiae PDE deletion strain. Recombinant TbPDE2A is specific for cAMP, with aK m of ∼2 μm. It is entirely resistant to the nonselective PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, but it is sensitive to trequinsin, dipyridamole, sildenafil, and ethaverine with IC50 values of 5.4, 5.9, 9.4, and 14.2 μm, respectively.

All four compounds inhibit proliferation of bloodstream form trypanosomes in culture, indicating that TbPDE2A is an essential enzyme. Cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterases represent a large and divergent group of enzymes. In eukaryotes, two classes of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 1The abbreviations used are:PDEphosphodiesteraseIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthinebpbase pair(s)have been recognized (1Nikawa J. Sass P. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 2Sass P. Field J. Nikawa J. Toda T. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Class I includes all currently known families of mammalian PDEs (see below), as well as a number of PDEs from lower eukaryotes, such as PDE2 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the product of the regA gene ofDictyostelium discoideum. All class I enzymes show a considerable extent of amino acid sequence conservation within their catalytic domains. In contrast, the class II PDEs show little sequence similarity to the class I enzymes, and their K m are generally much higher than those of the class I enzymes. Class II PDEs were identified (e.g. in S. cerevisiae (1Nikawa J. Sass P. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar),D. discoideum (3Lacombe M.L.

Each family exhibits >50% amino acid sequence identity within the conserved catalytic domain of about 250 amino acids length, while sequence identity between different families is only 30–40% in the same region (5Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Family members also share extensive similarity in regions outside the catalytic domain, while no significant similarity of that region can be detected between different families. Besides their amino acid sequences, the different families also display distinctive pharmacological properties, which form the basis for the development of family-specific PDE inhibitors for clinical use (5Beavo J.A.

Genetic defects in PDE genes have been suspected as the underlying causes of a number of diseases (10Petersen-Jones S.M. Entz D.D. Sargan D.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

PDEs have become highly attractive targets for drug development over the last few years. A growing number of family-specific and subtype-specific inhibitors have been developed despite the considerable sequence conservation between the catalytic domains of different families. Several PDE inhibitors are being used or are under exploration for ailments as diverse as autoimmune disease (14Bielekova B. Lincoln A. McFarland H. Martin R. J.

The ongoing development of new and ever more subtype-specific inhibitors holds great promise for achieving more specific drug action with fewer side effects as well as new areas for the application of PDE inhibitors. In view of the potential of PDE inhibitors as chemotherapeutics, it is surprising how little is currently known about PDEs of parasites as possible drug targets. The African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei is a eukaryotic microorganism that causes the fatal human sleeping sickness (22Vickerman K. Br. Med. J. 1985; 41: 105-114Google Scholar), as well as Nagana, a devastating disease of domestic animals in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Chemotherapy of human trypanosomiasis is in a dismal state (23Seebeck T. Naula C. Shalaby T. Gong K.-W. Nova Act. Leopold. 1999; 78: 227-241Google Scholar). New drugs and drug targets are urgently required, and the cyclic nucleotide-specific PDEs may constitute a class of new drug targets. cAMP signaling in trypanosomes is still largely unexplored (24Naula C. Seebeck T. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 35-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Pays E. Rolin S. Magez S. Hide G. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Holmes P.H.

An early study demonstrated PDE activity in cell lysates of bloodstream form T. brucei (29Walter R.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1982; 6: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and experiments with PDE inhibitors suggested that interference with PDE activity might affect cell differentiation (26Vassella E.

Immunol. 1985; 49: 844-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report (31Rascon A. Viloria M.E. De-Chiara L. Dubra M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 282-292Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) described a PDE activity in cultured Leishmania mexicana. This enzyme is partly soluble and partly particulate, and its characteristics indicate that it may represent a class II PDE. The current study describes the identification and characterization of a cAMP-specific PDE from T. brucei (TbPDE2A) with considerable amino acid sequence similarity to the class I PDEs. This classification is further supported by its low K mfor cAMP as a substrate. In its N terminus, TbPDE2A contains a single GAF domain (32Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), which may represent a noncatalytic cGMP-binding site.TbPDE2A is a representative of a small, dispersed family of similar, but nonidentical genes. It can be expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae, and it complements the heat-shock susceptibility phenotype of a PDE1/PDE2 deletion strain. Inhibitor studies showed that TbPDE2A is fully resistant to most inhibitors tested, including broad spectrum inhibitors such as IBMX. However, the enzyme is sensitive to the family 5 inhibitors dipyridamole and sildenafil, the family 3 inhibitor trequinsin, and the calcium-channel blocker ethaverine. Radiochemicals were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Barium hydroxide solution was purchased from Sigma. PDE inhibitors were from the following sources: IBMX, zaprinast, ethaverine, papaverine, theophylline, milrinone, trequinsin, vinpocetine, 8- methoxymethyl-IBMX, dipyridamole, and rolipram were from Sigma; erythro-9-(2-Hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine, HCl, zardaverine, cilostamide, and Ro-20–1724 were from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); etazolate and pentoxiphylline were from Calbiochem; and sildenafil citrate was a gift from Pfizer Central Research (Sandwich, Kent, UK). DNA sequencing was outsourced to Microsynth GmbH (Balgach, Switzerland). Reactions were run with BigDye terminators (PE-Biosystems) and were analyzed on an ABI Prism 377 instrument. Trypanosoma brucei strain 427 (derived form MiTat 15a) was grown as procyclic form at 27 °C in SDM medium (33Brun R. Schönenberger M. Acta Tropica. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Monomorphic bloodstream forms of strain 221 (MiTat 1.2) were cultivated as described by Hesse et al. (34Hesse F. Selzer P.M. Mühlstadt K. Duszenko M. Mol. Biochem.

Yeast transformation was done as described (36Atienza J.M. Colicelli J. Methods. 1998; 14: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) and 2% glucose, supplemented with an amino acid mixture lacking leucine (SC-leu). Heat shock experiments were performed by replica-plating patches onto YPD plates prewarmed to 55 °C, and the heat shock was continued for 15 min. After cooling the plates to room temperature, they were incubated for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Screening of the T. bruceiEST data base for class I PDE homologs identified plasmid pT2928 (accession number W84103) as coding for a potential T. brucei PDE. The cDNA fragment of pT2928 was completely sequenced and shown to represent the catalytic domain and the complete 3′-untranslated region of a candidate phosphodiesterase. This gene was termed TbPDE2A. The cDNA of pT2928 was then used to screen a genomic library of T. brucei in λEMBL4 (37Schlaeppi K. Deflorin J. Seebeck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1695-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a 6.3-kilobase pair genomic DNA fragment was isolated and sequenced. The fragment contained the TbPDE2 gene, flanked by an unrelated gene on either side (see “Results”). Full-lengthTbPDE2A for recombinant expression was constructed as follows: The 3′-end of the open reading frame of TbPDE2A was amplified from the cDNA plasmid pT2928 using the forward primer pde2tyfor (5′- ATGACAATGGATGGATGTGCTTAT-3′) and the reverse primer pde2tirev (5′-CTTCTCGAGGGATCCCTAT CCATGGGCAGACGAAGCCCCTGTACTC-3′), containing XhoI, BamHI, andNcoI sites (underlined) and a stop codon (boldface italic type). The resulting PCR fragment (366 bp) was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega) and verified by sequencing. The fragment was then excised by digestion withEcoRV and XhoI and was inserted into pT2928 digested with the same enzymes. This step removed the 3′-untranslated region and introduced an NcoI site immediately before the stop codon and resulted in plasmid pTPDE23U. The 5′-end of the open reading frame was amplified from a fragment of genomic DNA, using the forward primer pde2gf2 (5′-GAGAATTCAAACATGTATGTGCACGACGTACGCATGTTC-3′), containing an EcoRI site (underlined) followed by a Kozak sequence and the start codon (boldface type, underlined), and the reverse primer pde2gr (5′-TTCAACCCCATATGATCAAGATCATGCACCAG-3′). The PCR product (804 bp) was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy, verified by sequencing, and then excised by digestion with EcoRI and NdeI and cloned into pTPDE23U cut with the same enzymes. This step generated a full-length copy of TbPDE2A (pTPDE2A) containing an NcoI site immediately before the stop codon. The aim of these manipulations was to obtain a TbPDE2A gene with an unaltered open reading frame but with restriction sites introduced upstream (EcoRI) and downstream (XhoI, BamHI) of the start and stop codons, respectively, to facilitate further cloning steps. In addition, a Kozak sequence for efficient expression in S. cerevisiae was introduced in front of the start codon, as well as an NcoI site immediately before the stop codon for the later insertion of immunological tags (see below). For generating an N-terminally truncated form of TbPDE2A without the noncatalytic cGMP-binding domain (starting at Met124of the full sequence), the corresponding region was amplified from genomic DNA using the forward primer pde2gf1 (5′-GAGAATTCAAACATGGAAGTTAACGAACACCGAGCAACATTG-3′), containing an EcoRI site (underlined) followed by a Kozak sequence and the codon for Met124 (boldface type, underlined), and the reverse primer pde2gr (see above). The PCR product (475 bp) was cloned and sequenced as indicated above. Finally, it was excised by digestion with EcoRI and NdeI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pTPDE23U to generate pTPDE2AT. The various constructs are outlined in Fig.1. For inserting a hemagglutinin tag (amino acid sequence: YPYDVPDYAGIPM) at the C terminus of both constructs, two complementary oligonucleotides, Htfor (5′-CATGGTTACCCATACGATGTCCCAGATTACGCCGGTATTCCAATGTAGG-3′; open NcoI site underlined, stop signal in boldface type and underlined) and Htrev (5′-GATCCCTACATTGGAATACCGGCGTAATCTGGGACATCGTATGGGTAAC-3′; open BamHI site underlined), were annealed and then inserted into pTPDE2A and pTPDE2AT digested with NcoI andBamHI. The resulting tagged constructs (pTPDE2Ahm and pTPDE2AThm) were finally verified by sequencing. Similar constructs were also made that contain the TY-1 tag (38Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) instead of the hemagglutinin tag at their C termini. For expression in S. cerevisiae, the hemagglutinin-tagged genes were introduced into the yeast expression vector p425CYC1 containing an attenuated CYC1 promotor (39Mumberg D. Mueller R. Funk M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar) and into pLT1, which allows high level expression from a strong TEF2 promotor. pLT1 was derived from p425CYC1 by replacing its expression cassette with the TEF2 promotor, including the original TEF2 Kozak sequence. The initiation codon is followed by two restriction sites, which allow cloning of the gene to be expressed. The resulting sequence of the expression site is as follows: TEF2 promotor (−412 through −7), followed by 5′-CTAAAC ATGAGTCGAC CTCGAGT-3′ (Kozak sequence in boldface type, start-codon in boldface type and underlined, SalI site underlined, XhoI site in italic type). Protein expression and stability of the enzyme under assay conditions were monitored by immunoblotting, using a monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Yeast cells grown to midlog to end log phase in SC-leu medium were collected, resuspended quickly in the original volume of prewarmed YPD medium, and incubated for an additional 3 h at 30 °C to maximize protein expression. Cells were then harvested and washed once in H2O and once in HBB buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution, containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5). The washed cell pellet was suspended in an equal volume of HBB containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed by grinding with glass beads (425–600 μm; Sigma) in 2-ml Sarstedt tubes using a FastPrep FP120 (3 × 45 s at setting 4). After cell breakage, a hole was punched in the bottom of the tube with a needle, the tube was placed on top of a 5-ml plastic tube, and it was centrifuged in an SS34 rotor for 6 min at 6000 rpm. This step left the glass beads in the Sarstedt tube, while the cell lysate was collected in the plastic tube, where unbroken cells and large cell fragments formed a pellet. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and was clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. To the resulting supernatant, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 25% (v/v), and it was stored at −70 °C. Under these conditions, TbPDE2A activity is stable for at least several months. PDE assays were done using the ZnSO4/Ba(OH)2 precipitation method of Schillinget al. (40Schilling R.J. Morgan D.R. Kilpatrick B.F. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This assay was chosen because it can potentially be upgraded to high throughput screening and because it produces less liquid radioactive waste than other procedures. The assay was validated and found to provide results essentially identical to those with other assay formats (40Schilling R.J. Morgan D.R. Kilpatrick B.F. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reaction contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and [3H]cAMP or [3H]cGMP (50,000 dpm/reaction) in a total volume of 100 μl. Incubation was at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 21.5 mm ZnCl2, followed by 50 μl of 9 mm Ba(OH)2 and incubated on ice for 30 min. The precipitates were filtered through GF-C glass fiber filters, and filters were washed three times with 1 mm NaOH, 100 mm NaCl. The filters were dried and counted in liquid scintillation fluid (4 g/liter omnifluor in toluene). All assays were carried out in triplicates and with three independent enzyme preparations. Controls for the efficiency of precipitation of cAMP and of AMP were always included. AMP was precipitated with an efficiency in the range of 55%, while the contamination of the precipitate with cAMP was in the range of 0.6–0.8% of the input. The assay worked reliably over all cAMP concentrations used, up to 50 μm. When assaying yeast cell extracts, control lysates from the PDE deletion strain transfected with empty vector were used as background controls. These control lysates never exhibited detectable activity beyond the background produced without lysate. The efficiency of 5′-AMP precipitation remained unchanged when yeast lysates were incubated for up to 2 h under assay conditions, indicating that the assay is not affected by a potential conversion of 5′-AMP to adenosine or adenine. Inhibitor studies were done at a cAMP concentration of 1 μm,i.e. close to the K m of TbPDE2A, so that the IC50 values should approximate theK i. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO or ethanol, and the final concentration of the solvent never exceeded 1% in the assay reaction. Incubation times and enzyme concentrations were always adjusted so that less than 30% of the input substrate was hydrolyzed (2–5 μg of total protein/100-μl assay). IC50 values were calculated by curve fitting on a four-parameter dose-response model with variable slope, using the Prism software package of Graph Pad Inc. (San Diego, CA). Cytotoxicity of PDE inhibitors was determined for bloodstream forms in culture by determining acid phosphatase activity as described (41Bodley A.L. McGarry M.W. Shapiro T.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 172: 1157-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing monomorphic bloodstream forms MiTat 1.2 were transferred into colorless medium (42Sbicego S. Vassella E. Kurath U. Blum B. Roditi I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (cell density 3 × 105 cells/ml culture) and were seeded into microtiter wells (199 μl/well) containing 1 μl of inhibitor or solvent control. Plates were incubated for both 20 and 40 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. At the end of the growth period, cells were lysed by the addition of 20 μl of lysis/substrate buffer (20 mg/ml p-nitrophenylphosphate in 1m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1% Triton X-100), and the incubation was continued for another 4 h at 37 °C. Production of p-nitrophenol was determined at 405 nm on a microtiter plate reader. To control for intrinsic absorbance by the inhibitors, control series containing inhibitor dilutions but no cells were run for every experiment, and the resulting absorbance values were subtracted as background from the experimental readings. All assays were run in triplicates. Intracellular cAMP concentrations were determined using an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (BioMol). Bloodstream form trypanosomes (5 × 106/ml) were incubated with inhibitors at the concentrations and for the times specified. At the end of the incubation, 1-ml aliquots were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 8 min to collect the cells. The cell pellet was suspended in 150 μl of 0.1 n ice-cold HCl. After incubation in ice for 20 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The HCl precipitate was processed for protein determination, while 100 μl of the cleared supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and used to assay the cAMP content, following the instructions of the supplier of the kit. Assays were performed in triplicates, and two independent experiments using different batches of cells were performed. The cAMP content of control cells as determined with this procedure was 66 ± 14 pmol/109 trypanosomes, corresponding well with values obtained with different trypanosome strains and a different cAMP assay (26Vassella E. Reuner B. Yutzy B. Boshart M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2661-2671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon searching the T. bruceiexpressed sequence tag data base for potential phosphodiesterase genes, an expressed sequence tag clone (pT2928) was identified. The corresponding plasmid was obtained (courtesy Philip Majiwa, ILRI) and sequenced. The cDNA fragment contained the 3′-part of a cDNA that unambiguously represented a phosphodiesterase gene, termedTbPDE2A according to the recently proposed rules for the nomenclature of trypanosomatid genes (43Clayton C. Adams M. Almeida R. Baltz T. Barrett M. Bastien P. Belli S. Beverley S. Biteau N. Blackwell J. Blaineau C. Boshart M. Bringaud F. Cross G.A.M. Cruz A. Degrave W. Donelson J.E. El-Sayed N. Fu G. et al.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA demonstrated that TbPDE2A is not a single gene but rather a member of a small gene family (Fig.2 A). This was further confirmed by screening a procyclic cDNA library, 3U. Bauer, unpublished data. which resulted in the identification of several cDNA clones that represent different PDE2 family members (unpublished results). The cDNA fragment from pT2928 was then used to screen a genomic library of T. brucei, and the TbPDE2A locus was recovered on a 6-kilobase pair genomic EcoRI DNA fragment. The fragment was sequenced, as were several cDNA clones for TbPDE2A. The organization of the TbPDE2A locus (Fig. 2 B) demonstrates that it contains three different, closely spaced genes. The first one is a RIME element (nucleotides 376–876), a member of a family of abundant, highly transcribed, repetitive transposable elements (44Murphy N.B. Pays A. Tebabi P. Coquelet H. Guygaux M. Steinert M. Pays E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 855-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Within this element, nucleotides 868–632 on the reverse strand represent the open reading frame coding for a RIME-associated protein. The RIME element is flanked by two 12-bp direct repeats (nucleotides 364–375 and 877–888). The open reading frame for TbPDE2A extends from nucleotide 1770 to 3225 and codes for a protein of 485 amino acids. The predicted initiator methionine codon was functional, and the predicted open reading frame coded for an active protein when expressed in S. cerevisiae (see below). The coding region is followed by a long 3′-untranslated region of 1196 nucleotides, and the poly(A)-addition site is represented by nucleotide 4420. Downstream of the TbPDE2A gene, a gene for a member of the NHP2/RS6 family of nuclear proteins (45Henras A. Henry Y. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Gelugne J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7078-7090Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) is coded for by nucleotides 4635–5062. This is the first instance where such a gene was detected in T. brucei, and the role of the corresponding protein remains unknown. The presence of unrelated genes upstream and downstream ofTbPDE2A demonstrated that the members of this PDE family are not closely linked. Expression of TbPDE2A was analyzed both by Northern blot hybridization and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Both approaches demonstrated that TbPDE2A is expressed both in the bloodstream and the procyclic (insect stage) form of the trypanosome life cycle (data not shown). The open reading frame of TbPDE2A predicts a protein of 485 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 55,348 (Fig.3). The N terminus of TbPDE2A contains a single GAF domain (Val3–Val117; Ref.32Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), which may function in cGMP binding. The presence of a single GAF domain in TbPDE2A is reminiscent of the human PDE11A, which also has a single GAF domain, while all ot"
https://openalex.org/W2020704846,"Cross-talk between Smad and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways has been described recently, and evidence for Smad cooperation with AP-1 is emerging. Here we report that epidermal growth factor (EGF) potentializes transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)−induced Smad3 transactivation in rat hepatocytes, an effect abrogated by TAM-67, a dominant negative mutant of AP-1. Antisense transfection experiments indicated that c-Jun and JunB were involved in the synergistic effect, and endogenous c-Jun physically associated with Smad3 during a combined EGF/TGF-β treatment. We next investigated which signaling pathway transduced by EGF was responsible for the Jun-induced synergism. Whereas inhibition of JNK had no effect, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3′ kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway by LY294002 or by expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI3-kinase reduced EGF/TGF-β-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity. Transfection of an activated Ras with a mutation enabling the activation of the PI3-kinase pathway alone mimicked the EGF/TGF-β potentiation of Smad3 transactivation, and TAM-67 abolished this effect, suggesting that the PI3-kinase pathway stimulates Smad3 via AP-1 stimulation. The EGF/TGF-β-induced activation of Smad3 correlated with PI3-kinase and p38-dependent but not JNK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun. Since potentiation of a Smad-binding element-driven gene was also induced by EGF/TGF-β treatment, this novel mechanism of Jun/Smad cooperation might be crucial for diversifying TGF-β responses.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). TGF-β is central in the regulation of many biological processes, including cell differentiation, growth, adhesion, and apoptosis. TGF-β signals through a system of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors composed of type I and type II receptors (TGF-βRI and TGF-βRII) (see Refs. 2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 3Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 4Chen Y.-G.

Rev. 1998; 19: 349-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding to TGF-βRII recruits and activates the TGF-βRI receptor, which phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 on their SSXS motif. Smad proteins encompass a conserved amino-terminal domain that binds DNA and a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain that binds receptors and partner Smads. These domains are separated by a less conserved linker region. Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 forms stable complexes with Smad4, which translocate into the nucleus, where they bind the consensus GTCTAGAC sequence found in the promoter of many TGF-β-responsive genes (6Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Disruption of the Smad pathway or Smad mutations have underscored the functional importance of this signaling pathway in the transcriptional response of target cells to TGF-β (reviewed in Ref. 7Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar).Emerging evidence indicates that TGF-β signaling may also cross-talk with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases. Antagonistic or synergistic interplay between these kinases and Smad signaling has been described. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), members of the MAPK, cause a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in their linker region, preventing their translocation into the nucleus and therefore providing a mechanism of repression of TGF-β signaling (8Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 9Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). At the opposite, a synergistic mechanism between Smads and MAPK has been proposed, in a kinase downstream of the MAP kinase kinase MEK1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation on the SSXS motif and its nuclear translocation (10De Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Recent evidence also indicates that Smad cooperates with AP-1 (11Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 12Liberati N.T. Datto M.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Stimulation of AP-1-dependent transcription can be achieved by phosphorylation of the c-Jun transactivation domain by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), another member of the MAPK family. Smad and AP-1 response elements are juxtaposed in the promoters of several TGF-β-inducible genes, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or c-jun, and both sites appear to be critical in the TGF-β response (15Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 16Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).In the present study we addressed the question of whether AP-1/Smad cooperation occurs in normal rat hepatocytes following a combined stimulation with EGF and TGF-β. We show that under these experimental conditions AP-1 induces a strong activation of Smad3 transactivation independent of AP-1 binding to its cognate cis-element. This synergism was mediated by c-Jun and JunB, and a protein-protein interaction between Smad3 and endogenous c-Jun was found during EGF/TGF-β stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of AP-1 via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), but not the JNK pathway, is implicated in this functional synergism. Finally, we show that Jun/Smad3 cooperation induced by EGF is effective on a SBE-driven reporter gene. These data suggest that Jun/Smad3 synergism independent of binding to TRE elements might represent another important mechanism of regulation of TGF-β-inducible genes in hepatocytes.DISCUSSIONThere is increasing evidence that several signaling pathways interfere with Smads to regulate TGF-β-responsive genes, resulting in antagonistic as well as synergistic effects. In the present study, we show that EGF alone induces a mild activation of Smad3 transcriptional activity only detectable under conditions of Smad3 overexpression, in agreement with previous reports (10De Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). More importantly, we show that a combined treatment with EGF and TGF-β strongly activates (about 30-fold) Smad3 transactivation. This synergistic effect is dependent on the presence of AP-1 proteins, since it is prevented by transfection of TAM-67, a dominant negative c-Jun truncated on its transactivating domain acting as an inhibitor of AP-1 function (18Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar, 19Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-800PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, cooperation of Smad proteins with the AP-1 proteins Fos and Jun has been documented in mink lung epithelial cells (11Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 12Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In vitro binding of Smad3 and Smad4 to all three Jun family members as well as in vivo association between Smads and a TGF-β-phosphorylated form of endogenous c-Jun induced by JNK have been demonstrated in HaCaT cells (12Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cooperation of AP-1 proteins with Smad3 and Smad4 occurred via Jun proteins bound to their cognatecis-element, the TRE, or to composite sites containing juxtaposed AP-1 and SBE sites (11Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 12Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and the interaction was shown to involve 13 carboxyl-terminal amino acids conserved in the three Jun proteins (12Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The mechanism described herein differs from these previous studies by two major features as follows: 1) by using a Gal reporter system, we could demonstrate that the interaction of Smad3 with c-Jun induced a synergistic effect on Smad3 transactivation independently of binding to the TRE; 2) overexpression of TAM-67, a dominant negative c-Jun which is truncated in its transactivating NH2-terminal domain but still possesses the COOH-terminal domain implicated in the physical interaction with Smad proteins (11Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), abrogated the EGF/TGF-β-induced stimulation of Smad3 transactivation, implying that the functional cooperation with Smad3 requires the amino-terminal transactivation domain of Jun proteins. In addition, we also show that the EGF-induced cooperative effect of Jun proteins on Smad3 transactivation was not paralleled by any modification of the binding of Smad proteins to their cognate cis-element, the SBE site, indicating that the increased transcriptional activity of Smad3 proteins is probably due to their association with Jun proteins rather than to the recruitment of additional Smads to the SBE. Despite the fact that a physical association between Jun proteins and Smads has been reported to occur in vitro (11Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 12Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and the demonstration that c-Jun coimmunoprecipitates with Smad3 during EGF/TGF-β stimulation (our present result), we failed in detecting c-Jun or other AP-1 proteins bound to the SBE by supershift experiments. This could be due to the lack of sensitivity of the method that is known to produce false negative results (32Osborn M.T. Herrin K. Buzen F.G. Hurlburt B.K. Chambers T.C. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Binding of EGF to its receptor activates the PI3-kinase pathway (28Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 29Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 30Logan S.K. Falasca M. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), a cascade involved in AP-1 activation (29Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4187-4194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We show that this pathway is involved in the potentiation of Smad3 transactivation by Jun proteins since inhibition of the PI3-kinase pathway by the highly selective inhibitor LY294002 or by a PI3-kinase dominant negative mutant efficiently blocked the EGF-induced Smad3 transactivation, whereas activation of the PI3-kinase pathway by RasV12C40 reproduced the synergistic effect of EGF stimulation on Smad3 transactivation. The PI3-kinase-activating effect was blunted in cells transfected with TAM-67 which are deficient in AP-1 transactivating function, strongly suggesting that the effect of PI3-kinase is through AP-1 activation rather than the result of direct PI3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Smad3. The involvement of PI3-kinase in Smad transactivation has never been demonstrated before. That PI3-kinase activation may be involved in TGF-β signaling had been previously suggested from the observation that wortmannin, another PI3-kinase inhibitor, inhibits TGF-β-stimulated chemotaxis of human neutrophil leukocytes (34Thelen M. Uguccioni M. Bosiger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that TGF-β markedly enhanced EGF-induced PI3-kinase activity in human airway smooth muscle cells (35Krymskaya V.P. Hoffman R. Eszterhas A. Ciocca V. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1220-L1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, involvement of PI3-kinase in the inhibitory effect of insulin, EGF, or interleukin-6 on TGF-β-induced apoptosis has been reported (36Roberts R.A. James N.H. Cosulich S.C. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 37Chen R.-H. Su Y.-H. Chuang R.L.C. Chang T.-Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but the relationship with AP-1 function or Smad signaling was not investigated. We show here that one mechanism by which PI3-kinase may cross-talk with Smad signaling is through activation of Jun proteins, which themselves cooperate with Smad3 for transactivation.Another important signaling pathway that originates from the EGF receptor is the MAPK pathway, including the ERK1 and ERK2 pathways, the JNK/SAPK, and the p38 MAPK pathways (Ref. 39Kyriakis J.M.

Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), all implicated in EGF-induced AP-1 activation (14Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). In our study, neither inhibition of the JNK pathway by transfection of a dominant negative mutant (DNMKK4) nor inhibition of the ERK pathway by the specific inhibitor PD98059 decreased the EGF-induced potentialization of Smad3 transactivation, whereas involvement of the p38 pathway was suggested by the inhibitory effect of SB 202190 on EGF/TGF-β-induced Smad3 transactivation. These data confirm and extend the previous demonstration that p38 increases the transcriptional activity of TGF-β-inducible genes (41Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17647-17652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In these studies, p38 activation was shown to be induced by TGF-β-activated kinase, a MAP kinase kinase kinase also involved in TGF-β signaling (45Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Marsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 46Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). According to this model, TGF-β-activated kinase-induced p38 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β triggers the phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2, a basic leucine zipper protein member of the activating transcription factor/cAMP-response element-binding protein family that shares many structural characteristics with AP-1 proteins. Activated transcription factor 2 forms a complex with Smad4 that is transcriptionally active on Smad-regulated genes (41Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M. Fujisawa J.-I Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27161-27167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 42Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The mechanism of p38 activation found in the present study is clearly different from this model. It is very likely that the activating effect of p38 on Smad3 transactivation detected in our study lies downstream of PI3-kinase activation, since inhibition of the two pathways was not clearly additive. That PI3-kinase can contribute to the activation of protein kinases of the MAPK family, such as ERK, has been previously shown (47Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), but a direct demonstration of p38 activation by the PI3-kinase pathway has never been published. Finally, since our Western blot experiments indicated that EGF induces c-Jun phosphorylation by mechanisms dependent of PI3-kinase and p38, it is very likely, but not proven, that these phosphorylation events are implicated in the potentiation of Smad3 transactivation by EGF. In sharp contrast with our results describing a stimulating effect of Jun/Smad3 cooperation for transactivation in the context of PI3-kinase-induced Jun activation, two recent examples of interplay between Jun proteins and Smad3 leading to transcriptional repression of Smad3 have recently been published (13Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 48Verrecchia F. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30226-30231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In one model, Jun activated via a TGF-β-induced JNK binds to Smad3 on an SBE element and inhibits Smad3 transcriptional activity (13Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In a second model, c-Jun activated by tumor necrosis factor α binds to Smad3 and prevents its binding to DNA, therefore acting again as a transcriptional repressor (48Verrecchia F. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30226-30231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data and ours suggest that the functional interplay between Jun and Smads is far more complicated than previously thought and might vary according to the mechanisms of Jun activation.In summary, we have described another novel mechanism allowing TGF-β to integrate with regulatory networks of the cell. Whether this pathway is specific to the hepatocyte environment remains to be determined. We show that such a mechanism operates on an SBE-driven gene, although with a lower magnitude, and therefore represents a potential mechanism of regulation of TGF-β-inducible genes. In normal hepatocytes, simultaneous treatment with EGF and TGF-β induces a proliferation arrest (49Nakamura T. Tomita Y. Hirai R. Yamaoka K. Kaji K. Ichihara A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 50Carr B.I. Hayashi I. Branum E.L. Moses H.L. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2330-2334PubMed Google Scholar, 51Mc Mahon J.B. Richards W.L. DelCampo A.A. Song M.K. Thorgeirsson S.S. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 4665-4671PubMed Google Scholar). Whether Jun/Smad3 synergism is at work on the promoter of Smad-responsive gene inhibitors of the cell cycle will be the subject of our next investigations. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)1 is a member of a large family of cytokines that includes bone morphogenetic proteins, activins, and several more distantly related factors (1Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). TGF-β is central in the regulation of many biological processes, including cell differentiation, growth, adhesion, and apoptosis. TGF-β signals through a system of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors composed of type I and type II receptors (TGF-βRI and TGF-βRII) (see Refs. 2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 3Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 4Chen Y.-G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 5Hu P.P.-C. Datto M.B. Wang X.-F. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 349-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding to TGF-βRII recruits and activates the TGF-βRI receptor, which phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 on their SSXS motif. Smad proteins encompass a conserved amino-terminal domain that binds DNA and a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain that binds receptors and partner Smads. These domains are separated by a less conserved linker region. Phosphorylated Smad2 or Smad3 forms stable complexes with Smad4, which translocate into the nucleus, where they bind the consensus GTCTAGAC sequence found in the promoter of many TGF-β-responsive genes (6Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Disruption of the Smad pathway or Smad mutations have underscored the functional importance of this signaling pathway in the transcriptional response of target cells to TGF-β (reviewed in Ref. 7Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence indicates that TGF-β signaling may also cross-talk with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases. Antagonistic or synergistic interplay between these kinases and Smad signaling has been described. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), members of the MAPK, cause a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in their linker region, preventing their translocation into the nucleus and therefore providing a mechanism of repression of TGF-β signaling (8Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 9Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). At the opposite, a synergistic mechanism between Smads and MAPK has been proposed, in a kinase downstream of the MAP kinase kinase MEK1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation on the SSXS motif and its nuclear translocation (10De Caestecker M.P.

Recent evidence also indicates that Smad cooperates with AP-1 (11Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 12Liberati N.T. Datto M.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Stimulation of AP-1-dependent transcription can be achieved by phosphorylation of the c-Jun transactivation domain by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), another member of the MAPK family. Smad and AP-1 response elements are juxtaposed in the promoters of several TGF-β-inducible genes, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or c-jun, and both sites appear to be critical in the TGF-β response (15Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 16Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the present study we addressed the question of whether AP-1/Smad cooperation occurs in normal rat hepatocytes following a combined stimulation with EGF and TGF-β. We show that under these experimental conditions AP-1 induces a strong activation of Smad3 transactivation independent of AP-1 binding to its cognate cis-element. This synergism was mediated by c-Jun and JunB, and a protein-protein interaction between Smad3 and endogenous c-Jun was found during EGF/TGF-β stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of AP-1 via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), but not the JNK pathway, is implicated in this functional synergism. Finally, we show that Jun/Smad3 cooperation induced by EGF is effective on a SBE-driven reporter gene. These data suggest that Jun/Smad3 synergism independent of binding to TRE elements might represent another important mechanism of regulation of TGF-β-inducible genes in hepatocytes. DISCUSSIONThere is increasing evidence that several signaling pathways interfere with Smads to regulate TGF-β-responsive genes, resulting in antagonistic as well as synergistic effects. In the present study, we show that EGF alone induces a mild activation of Smad3 transcriptional activity only detectable under conditions of Smad3 overexpression, in agreement with previous reports (10De Caestecker M.P.

An earlier complementation test suggests that SX10 would belong to x-ray-cross complementing group (XRCC) 4. However, in this study, a human XRCC4 expression vector failed to complement the SX10 phenotype. Consistent with the previous report, SX10 showed the same level of DNA-dependent protein kinase activity as the wild-type SR-1. We isolated and analyzed hybrids between SX10 and human diploid fibroblast cells and found that human chromosome 13 conferred the x-ray resistance to the hybrids, suggesting that a candidate gene would be located on this chromosome. Polymerase chain reaction analysis with these hybrids and x-ray-resistant transformants obtained by introducing human chromosomes into SX10 indicated that the mutant was likely to be defective in DNA ligase IV. Sequence analysis of the DNA ligase IV gene confirmed that a defect in SX10 was attributed to a transition of G to A at nucleotide position 1413 of the gene, leading to an amino acid substitution from Trp at residue 471 to a stop codon. Revertant clones (Rev1–3) derived from SX10 showed a restored x-ray resistance; Rev1 reverted to the original nucleotide G at position 1413, whereas Rev2 and Rev3 to C. Transfection of a mouse DNA ligase IV cDNA vector into SX10 restored the resistance to both x-rays and bleomycin. SX10 showed a reduced frequency of chromosomal integration of transfected DNA, but the revertants restored the frequency found in the wild-type cells. These results suggest a possible involvement of DNA ligase IV in the integration event of foreign DNA as well as a crucial role in DNA double-strand break repair.

Immunol. 1997; 64: 39-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If unrepaired or repaired inadequately, DSBs cause cell death by loss or inactivation of an essential gene, or various chromosomal rearrangements, which lead to genetic diseases and cancer (3Yunis J.J. Science. 1983; 221: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Therefore, very efficient mechanisms have evolved to repair such DNA damage. In eukaryotes, there are two major pathways for DSB repair: homologous recombination that involves the exchange of genetic information between a damaged chromosome and its undamaged partner, and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) that requires little or no homology at broken DNA ends (4Kanaar P. Hoeijimakers J.H.J. van Gent D.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 483-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Although homologous recombination is a main pathway in yeast cells, NHEJ predominantly acts in mammalian cells (5Rouet P. Smih F. Jasin M. Mol. Cell.

Mammalian cell mutants hypersensitive to ionizing radiation or radiomimetic agents have been isolated and greatly contributed to understanding the mechanism of DNA repair. These mutants have been shown to be deficient in DSBR and classified into at least nine x-ray cross complementing (XRCC) groups (6Jeggo P.A. Tesmer J. Chen D.J. Mutat.

SX10 possesses a greatly reduced rejoining capacity of DSBs compared with the wild-type cells (26Waters, R. L., Barrows, L. R., and Chen, D. J. (1995)Mutat. Res. 1–7.Google Scholar) and have been suggested to fall into the same complementation group as that of x-ray-hypersensitive mouse lymphoma M10 cells (25Sato K. Ito A. Shiomi T. Hama-Inaba H. Ishikawa H. Yoshizumi T. Nakazawa T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 456-461PubMed Google Scholar). Although SX10 has been characterized in several ways (25Sato K. Ito A. Shiomi T. Hama-Inaba H. Ishikawa H. Yoshizumi T. Nakazawa T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 456-461PubMed Google Scholar, 26Waters, R. L., Barrows, L. R., and Chen, D. J. (1995)Mutat. Res. 1–7.Google Scholar, 27Peterson S.R.

Here we show that SX10 is a DNA ligase IV-defective mutant and that the defect results from a nonsense mutation in the ligase gene. Also we show that SX10 has a lower activity to integrate transfected DNA into the genomic sites than wild-type cells, suggesting the involvement of NHEJ mechanism in the integration event. Mouse mammary carcinoma FM3A cell lines, wild-type SR-1, mutant SX10, and its 6-thioguanine- and ouabain-resistant derivative SX10TOR (25Sato K. Ito A. Shiomi T. Hama-Inaba H. Ishikawa H. Yoshizumi T. Nakazawa T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 456-461PubMed Google Scholar) were used; cells were grown in suspension in ES medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo) (28Koyama H. Kodama H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4210-4214PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 4% bovine calf serum (HyClone). The mouse leukemia cell lines L5178Y and its x-ray-hypersensitive mutant M10 (29Sato K. Hieda N. Radiat. Res. 1979; 78: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were used; cells were grown in suspension in ES medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. HeLa and normal human diploid fibroblast TIG-3 cells (obtained from the Tokyo Institute of Gerontology, Tokyo) were also used; cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co.) supplemented with 10% calf serum or 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), respectively, and were subcultured by dispersing with 0.1% trypsin solution. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Logarithmically growing cells were used for all experiments. Cells were exposed to x-rays (MBR-1520, Hitachi Medico Tokyo) at a dose rate of 1.1 Gy/min with a 0.5-mm Al/0.2-mm Cu filter at room temperature. Then the cells were diluted appropriately with growth medium and plated at 100–104 cells/dish into 60-mm bacterial plastic dishes containing 5 ml of 0.15% agarose-containing growth medium and cultured for 14–18 days. For growth inhibition assays, x-ray-treated or untreated cells were plated at 104 cells/well into 24-well plates (NUNC), cultured for 3–5 days, and counted for cell number. To determine sensitivity to bleomycin (Wako Pure Chem. Ind., Osaka), cells were plated at 100–104 cells/dish into 60-mm dishes containing 5 ml of 0.15% agarose-containing growth medium with different drug concentrations and cultured for 14–18 days. Resulting colonies were counted and plating efficiencies were calculated. Cell fusion was carried out as described previously (25Sato K. Ito A. Shiomi T. Hama-Inaba H. Ishikawa H. Yoshizumi T. Nakazawa T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 456-461PubMed Google Scholar). Human diploid fibroblast TIG-3 cells were used as a partner of cell fusion. Briefly, SX10TOR and TIG-3 cells were harvested and washed with serum-free ES medium; both cells (each 1 × 106) were mixed in a glass centrifuge tube and centrifuged. To the cell pellet was gently added 0.3 ml of a 50% PEG1500 solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 1 min at room temperature, serum-free ES medium was gradually added and suspended. The mixture was spun down at low centrifugation, and the cell pellet was dispersed into growth medium, plated into 100-mm bacterial dishes, and incubated. On the next day, hybrid selection started in growth medium containing HAT/ouabain (75 μm hypoxanthine, 0.5 μm amethopterin, 20 μm thymidine, and 1 mm ouabain). Two weeks later, the resulting colonies were picked, transferred to normal medium, and subcultured. This method was carried out as described previously (30McBride O.W. Ozer H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1258-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, metaphase chromosome preparations from human HeLa cells were passed through a needle and precipitated with calcium phosphate, and the precipitate was added to SX10 cells. On the next day, the cells were harvested, plated, and grown in 0.15% agarose-containing growth medium with 500 ng/ml bleomycin. The drug-resistant colonies were isolated, subcultured in growth medium without bleomycin, and assayed for sensitivity to x-rays. The presence of human Alu sequences was screened by PCR using Alu-PCR probe 451 as described (31Dorin J.R. Emslie E. Hanratty D. Farrall M. Gosden J. Porteous D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, the humanDNA ligase IV sequence was examined by PCR by using the following primers h21F (5′-GATGTATTGATGGTTAATAATAAAAAGCTAGGG-3′) and hR1 (5′-AAAGCTAGCTTTAAATCAAATACTGGTTTTCTTC-3′). The PCR was performed in 20 μl of a reaction mixture composed of 1× PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each of four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.2 μl of the above primers, 40 ng of template genomic DNA, and 0.12 μl of Taq polymerase (5 units/μl, Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction conditions were: 94 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 40 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles and 72 °C for 10 min. Total cellular DNA and RNA were prepared as described previously (32Kobayashi M. Adachi N. Koyama H. Gene. 1998; 215: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To examine a mutation in the mouse DNA ligase IV gene, the following primers were used for both genomic PCR and RT-PCR: mF1 (5′-CAAACCGGAGGATTTGTTGTCGCT-3′), mF2 (5′-CCCATTTATTCACAATGCGTTCGGGA-3′), mR1 (5′-CATCATCACTGTCTGCTGTTGTCTGACA-3′), mR2 (5′-TAGGTCAGCCTTTGGATAACCATCTAA-3′), mR3 (5′-AGATGGCCTGTCACCAGGAGGTGGTG-3′), and mR4 (5′-GGGTTGTAGGCCATCATCTCACCG-3′). The PCR was carried out as described above. The reaction conditions were: 94 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 40 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles and 72 °C for 10 min. Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and directly sequenced using a DNA sequencer model 4000 (Li-COR) with SequiTherm Long-Read cycle sequencing kits LC (Epicenter Technologies) as described (32Kobayashi M. Adachi N. Koyama H. Gene. 1998; 215: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Otherwise, the fragments were digested with the restriction enzymeDdeI (New England BioLabs), electrophoresed on a 8% polyacrylamide gel, stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and photographed. Southern blotting was performed as described previously (33Fujimaki K. Aratani Y. Fujisawa S. Motomura S. Okubo T. Koyama H. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of genomic DNA purified from cells were digested with DdeI, electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Then the membrane was probed with a 32P-labeled 487-bp fragment of the mouseDNA ligase IV sequence (see Fig. 3 A). The probe had been prepared by amplifying with mF2 and mR2 primers and SR-1 cell DNA as a template, and by digesting the 1099-bp product withDdeI. Based on the reported sequence of human XRCC4 cDNA (9Li Z. Otevrel T. Gao Y. Cheng H.-L. Seed B. Stamato T.D. Taccioli G.E. Alt F.W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), we amplified the fragment of the entire open reading frame and inserted it into a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting vector, designated phXRCC4, was purified by 2 cycles of CsCl density centrifugation and used for transfection. To isolate stable transfectants with the above phXRCC4 plasmid and the mouse DNA ligase IV expression vector pCLig4 (a gift from Frederic W. Alt), transfection was carried out with the plasmids linearized by digestion with restriction enzymes BglII and PvuI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively, which cut the vector backbone once. SX10 was transfected by electroporation as described previously and incubated in growth medium for 24 h (33Fujimaki K. Aratani Y. Fujisawa S. Motomura S. Okubo T. Koyama H. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cells were then harvested, replated, and cultured in 0.15% agarose-containing growth medium with 0.8 mg/ml active Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.) for about 2 weeks. The resulting colonies were picked with micropipets, grown to mass culture in the presence of the drug, and used for further analysis. To examine the ability of SR-1 and SX10 cells to integrate foreign DNA into their chromosomes, quantitative transfection assays were carried out with plasmid pSV2neo linearized with EcoRI before use (33Fujimaki K. Aratani Y. Fujisawa S. Motomura S. Okubo T. Koyama H. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of the plasmid DNA was transfected into 4 × 106 cells by electroporation, and the cells were diluted appropriately in growth medium and cultured for 24 h. Then, the cells were collected, diluted, and replated at 1–5 × 105 and 102 cells/60-mm dish into 0.15% agarose-containing growth medium with and without active G418 (0.9 mg/ml), respectively. They were cultured for 14–18 days at 37 °C. The number of resulting colonies was scored, and the integration frequency was calculated by dividing the number of G418rcolonies with surviving cells. Sato et al. (25Sato K. Ito A. Shiomi T. Hama-Inaba H. Ishikawa H. Yoshizumi T. Nakazawa T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 456-461PubMed Google Scholar) reported that SX10 would belong to the same complementation group as that of the M10 mouse leukemia line, which is hypersensitive to x-rays (26Waters, R. L., Barrows, L. R., and Chen, D. J. (1995)Mutat. Res. 1–7.Google Scholar). Because M10 had been suggested to belong to the XRCC4 group (34Stackhouse M.A. Ortiz J.B. Sato K. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1994; 323: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we constructed a human XRCC4 expression vector, phXRCC4, transfected it into wild-type SX10 and M10, and obtained G418-resistant clones. We assayed their sensitivity to x-rays using two representative clones, SX10/hXRCC4 and M10/hXRCC4. Fig. 1 clearly shows that SX10/hXRCC4 was as sensitive to x-ray irradiation as SX10 but that M10/hXRCC4 restored the resistance of L5178Y cells, the parental cells of M10, indicating that the XRCC4 vector was able to complement M10 but not SX10. We therefore conclude that SX10 is not part of theXRCC4 group. Although we measured DNA-PK activity in whole cell extracts by pull-down assays (35Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), no difference was found between SR-1 and SX10 cells (data not shown), indicating that SX10 would fall into a complementation group distinct from those ofXRCC5–7. We measured the level of sister chromatid exchange in SR-1 and SX10 and observed no significant difference between the two cell types (data not shown). Because the elevated sister chromatid exchange level is characteristic for a γ-ray-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary mutant EM-9 classified into XRCC1 (36Thompson L.H. Brookman K.W. Jones N.J. Allen S.A. Carrano A.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6160-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), our result suggests that SX10 does not fall into the XRCC1group. Like the XRCC4–7 mutant lines reported, SX10 revealed much greater sensitivity to ionizing irradiation thanXRCC2 (37Thacker J. Tambini C.E. Simpson P.J. Tsui L.C. Scherer S.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), XRCC3 (38Tebbs R.S. Zhao Y. Tucker J.D. Scheerer J.B. Siciliano M.J. Hwang M.H. Liu N. Legerski R.J. Thompson L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6354-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), XRCC8 (39Busch D.B. Zdzienicka M.Z. Natarajan A.T. Jones N.J. Overkamp W.J.I. Collines A. Mitchell D.L. Stefanini M. Botta E. Albert R.B. Liu N. White D.A. van Gool A.J. Thompson L.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and XRCC9 (40Liu N. Lamerdin J.E. Tucker J.D. Zhou Z.-Q. Walter C.A. Albala J.S. Busch D.B. Thompson L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 94: 9232-9237Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar); therefore, we infer that SX10 would belong to a complementation group different from these groups. To determine a human chromosome that could complement the defect in SX10, we established three hybrid lines between SX10 and normal human diploid fibroblast TIG-3 cells by selection in growth medium containing HAT/ouabain after cell fusion as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We first isolated one of the hybrid clones, CC3, which exhibited a high resistance to x-rays, and subcloned CC3-2J and CC3-2P after serial passages. We examined their sensitivity to x-rays by growth inhibition assays. As shown in Fig.2 A, CC3-2J was almost as resistant as wild-type SR-1 whereas CC3-2P showed a striking sensitivity like SX10. Moreover, subclone CC3-2J-13D derived from the CC3-2J line lost the resistance to x-rays, indicating that a human chromosome conferring the x-ray resistance segregated from the CC3-2J cells. Then, with these hybrid lines, PCR analysis was performed using primer sets (MapPaires, Research Genetics) specific for each of human chromosomes. As a result, we found that only a 205-bp fragment amplified by using a primer set (D13S325) specific for human chromosome 13 was correlated with the x-ray resistance of the hybrid lines (Fig.2 B). These results imply that the restored resistance was concordant with human chromosome 13, thus suggesting a candidate gene residing in chromosome 13. So far, the genes responsible for DNA repair residing in human chromosome 13 areDNA ligase IV (41Wei Y.-F. Robins P. Carter K. Caldecott K. Pappin D.J.C., Yu, G.-L. Wang R.-P. Shell B.K. Nash R.A.

Jones T.A. Corlet J. Scherly D. Sheer D. Wood R.D. Clarkson S.G. Genomics. 1994; 21: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because SX10 is highly sensitive to x-rays but insensitive to UV (25Sato K. Ito A. Shiomi T. Hama-Inaba H. Ishikawa H. Yoshizumi T. Nakazawa T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1986; 77: 456-461PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that the DNA ligase gene could be a responsible gene. Therefore, we established three x-ray-resistant transformants (Tor1–3) by the CMGT with human chromosomes prepared from HeLa cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The transformants all showed restored resistance to x-ray treatment, although Tor2 was less resistant than Tor1 and Tor3, as determined by a growth inhibition assay (Fig.2 C). To examine the existence of the human DNA ligase IV gene in the transformants, genomic PCR using h21F and h21R primers specific for the gene sequence was carried out. Like human diploid fibroblast TIG-3 cells, a 1645-bp fragment was amplified in the three transformants, whereas no fragment was amplified in either mouse SR-1 or SX10 cells (Fig. 2 D). These results strongly suggest that SX10 is complemented by DNA ligase IV located in human chromosome 13. To verify directly the defect in SX10, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the DNA ligase IV gene in SR-1 and SX10. Because the mouse DNA ligase IV gene consists of only one exon (44Frank K.M. Sekiguchi J.M. Seidl K.J. Swat W. Rathbun G.A. Cheng H.L. Davidson L. Kangaloo L. Alt F.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), we were able to amplify a genomic sequence, including the entire open reading frame, using several pairs of primers prepared based on the mouse DNA ligase IV sequence and genomic DNA as a template (Fig. 3). We identified a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide position 1413 of the ligase gene in SX10 cells, resulting in an amino acid substitution from Trp at residue 471 to a stop codon (TGA). No other change was detected in the sequence in the mutant cells. During the CMGT experiments mentioned above, we isolated three additional clones that were found on PCR amplification with either human Alu-PCR primers or the h21F and h21R primers for the human DNA ligase IV gene. We examined whether these clones, designated as Rev1–3, were sensitive to x-rays. Fig.4 shows that they all were resistant to the radiation (data not shown for Rev3 cells). So we determined their sequences of the DNA ligase IV gene. As shown in Fig.3 A (upper panel), the mutated nucleotide A in SX10 was changed to the original G in Rev1, and to C in both Rev2 and Rev3. Therefore, we conclude that these cells resulted from reversion of the mutated gene in SX10. We asked whether the mutation found in SX10 cells was homozygous or hemizygous. Because the transition of G to A at position 1413 results in the appearance of the recognition site (CTGAG) for DdeI, this mutation will generate 245- and 84-bp fragments from the 329-bp fragment observed in SR-1 (see Fig. 3, lower panel). We amplified a region (including the mutation site) of DNA ligase IV cDNA from SR-1, SX10, and the two revertants and a pair of mF2 and mR3, and analyzed them on a polyacrylamide gel (Fig.5 A). Without DdeI digestion, cDNAs from all the cell lines gave a 559-bp fragment. When digested with DdeI, the wild-type cDNA was split into 329- and 209-bp fragments, whereas the SX10 cDNA was into 245-, 209-, and 84-bp fragments (Fig. 5 A). The two revertants Rev1 and Rev2 revealed the pattern of the wild-type cells, reflecting a nucleotide change at the mutated site (Fig. 3, upper panel). The 21-bp fragment was too small to be visible on the gel for any cell line. These results suggest that SX10 has only a single mutated allele of DNA l"

Of these, the ADP/ATP carrier mediating transport of ADP and ATP, the phosphate carrier mediating the symport of orthophosphate (Pi) and H+, and the type 1 uncoupling protein forming the short circuit of the proton current (2Klingenberg M.

However, their precise structural characteristics are not fully understood in relation to their transport functions. Because fluorescein derivatives have been thought to have similar structural features to those of adenine nucleotides (7Fletterick R.J. Bates D.J. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Majima E. Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 1997; 106: 192-197Google Scholar, 14Majima E. Yamaguchi N. Chuman H. Shinohara Y. Ishida M. Goto S. Terada H.

Of the fluorescein analogs, the SH reagent eosin 5-maleimide (EMA)1 most significantly interacts with the ADP/ATP carrier; it quickly and specifically labels Cys159 in the second loop facing the matrix of the bovine heart mitochondrial carrier in competition with ADP, showing that the region around Cys159 is a major recognition and binding site of the adenine nucleotides (14Majima E.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9530-9536Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we studied the effect of the amine/SH-modifying fluorescein analog of fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) on bovine heart mitochondria and the submitochondrial particles. Unexpectedly, it specifically labeled the 34-kDa mitochondrial phosphate carrier from both cytosolic and matrix sides at a physiological pH of 7.2. We further examined the effects of various fluorescein analogs (for chemical structures, see Structure FsI) on the FITC labeling and Pi uptake of the phosphate carrier and those of FITC on EMA labeling and ADP uptake of the ADP/ATP carrier. Based on the results, we discuss the mode of binding of FITC in relation to the transport activity of the phosphate carrier. FITC (isoform I) and EMA were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fluorescein, eosin Y, and lysylendopeptidase were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), erythrosin B was from Fluka (Buchs, Germany), mersalyl was from Aldrich, and hydroxylapatite and AG 1-X8 were from Bio-Rad. Bongkrekic acid was a gift from Prof. Duine (Delft University of Technology). Bovine heart mitochondria were prepared according to Smith (17Smith A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 81-86Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Submitochondrial particles containing 5 mmpotassium phosphate were prepared by sonication of bovine heart mitochondria, as described previously (15Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria and submitochondrial particles were finally suspended in the standard assay medium consisting of 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mmEDTA, and 10 mm Mops, pH 7.2 (S. E. medium). The amounts of proteins in mitochondria and submitochondrial particles were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) in the presence of 1% SDS using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For FITC labeling at pH 7.2, freshly prepared mitochondria and submitochondrial particles (both 10 mg of protein/ml) suspended in S. E. medium were incubated with 200 μm FITC for 10 min at 0 °C in the dark to avoid possible damage of membrane proteins caused by singlet oxygen, which could be generated by fluorescein analogs in the light (14Majima E. Yamaguchi N. Chuman H. Shinohara Y. Ishida M. Goto S. Terada H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the labeling was terminated by 5-fold dilution of samples with the solution used for electrophoresis consisting of 1% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol (DTT), and 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8). Then, the samples (25 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensities of protein bands labeled with FITC on the gel were determined with excitation at 500 nm, as described previously (15Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For study of FITC labeling at various pH values, three Good's buffers were used; 40 mm Mes-NaOH for pH 5.0 and 6.0, 40 mm Mops-NaOH for pH 7.0 and 8.0, and 40 mmChes-NaOH for pH 9.0. For examination of the effects of test compounds on the labeling, the mitochondria or the particles (10 mg of protein/ml) were first incubated with a test compound for various periods, usually 10 min, at 0 or 37 °C and then incubated with FITC for 5 min at 0 °C in the dark, unless otherwise noted. Freshly prepared mitochondria (2 mg of protein/ml) that had been incubated with FITC were suspended in S. E. medium supplemented with inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation such as oligomycin (2 μg/ml) and antimycin A (20 ng/mg protein). Pi uptake was started by the addition of a final concentration of 1 mm potassium [32P]phosphate (specific radioactivity, 2.78 kBq/μmol) at 0 °C. After 30 s, uptake was terminated with 400 μm mersalyl according to Ligeti and Fonyo (19Ligeti E. Fonyo A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity of [32P]phosphate incorporated into mitochondria was determined in an Aloka liquid scintillation counter, model LSC-3500, as described previously (15Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the effect of DTT on the FITC-treated mitochondria was examined, FITC-treated mitochondria were incubated with 10 mm DTT for 10 min at 0 °C and then centrifuged. The sedimented mitochondria were washed with S. E. medium and used for the assay of Pitransport. As a control, mersalyl was added to the mitochondrial suspensions before examining the Piuptake. The Pi transport activity of submitochondrial particles was determined in a similar way to that of ADP uptake by the ADP/ATP carrier at 0 °C (15Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but Pi was used as a transport substrate with incubation for 3 min. The effects of test compounds on Piuptake by the mitochondria were examined by incubation with a test compound for 10 min at 0 °C and pH 7.2 and then determining the Pitransport activity by the addition of a final concentration of 1 mm potassium [32P]phosphate. The effect of FITC on EMA labeling of the ADP/ATP carrier was examined by incubation of the particles (10 mg of protein/ml) with various concentrations of FITC in S. E. medium at 0 °C for 10 min in the dark. The particles (2 mg protein/ml) were then incubated with 20 μm EMA for 30 s, and labeling was terminated with excess DTT (10 μmol/mg of protein). The particles were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, and the fluorescent intensity of the 30-kDa band due to the labeled ADP/ATP carrier was determined in a Shimadzu chromatoscanner, model CS-9000, with excitation at 530 nm. The effect on ADP uptake was examined as reported previously (15Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the particles (10 mg protein/ml) in S. E. medium were incubated with FITC for 10 min at 0 °C. After a 5-fold dilution, ADP transport was started with 20 μm [14C]ADP (specific radioactivity, 0.67 GBq/nmol), and ADP uptake was terminated after 10 s with 20 μm bongkrekic acid. The amount of [14C]ADP taken up by the particles was determined from the radioactivity of the incorporated [14C]ADP in an Aloka liquid scintillation counter, model LSC-3500 (15Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the labeled protein and its peptide samples were determined with an HP G1005A protein sequencing system (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Mitochondria and submitochondrial particles (both 10 mg of protein/ml) suspended in S. E. medium were incubated with 200 μm FITC for 20 min at 0 °C. After removing the free FITC by chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 column, the fluorescent eluates were solubilized with 5% Triton X-100 containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, and 10 mm Mops (pH 7.2) for 10 min at 0 °C, and solubilized samples were applied to a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with a solution consisting of 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1m NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, and 10 mmMops (pH 7.2). Proteins labeled with FITC in the flow-through fractions were precipitated with cold acetone at −20 °C, dissolved with 6m guanidine HCl in 1 mm EDTA and 0.5m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), and treated with DTT (0.67 μmol/mg of protein) for 2 h at 37 °C to reduce all the cysteine residues. The cysteine residues were then carboxamidomethylated with freshly prepared iodoacetamide (1.41 μmol/mg of protein) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The alkylation of proteins was terminated with DTT (4.2 μmol/mg of protein), and the sample solution was applied to a column of G4000SWXL (7.8 × 300 mm, Tosoh, Tokyo) equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid containing 63% acetonitrile and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The protein labeled with FITC was detected by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm and fluorescent intensity at 510 nm with excitation by 450 nm. The fluorescent fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant, New York). After dilution of the FITC-labeled protein 5-fold with 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), it was digested with lysylendopeptidase (2% w/w) for 20 h at 35 °C. The digest was diluted 4-fold with 7 m guanidine HCl, and peptide fragments were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a TSK gel ODS-120T column (4.6 × 150 mm, Tosoh) with linear gradients of acetonitrile at 0–12% for 5 min, 12–52% for 80 min, and 52–90% for 5 min in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min monitored with absorbance at 210 nm and fluorescence at 510 nm excited at 450 nm. The eluate was collected at intervals of 1 min. First we examined the labeling of mitochondrial proteins with fluorescein analogs, the SH reagent EMA, and amine/SH-modifier FITC. Freshly prepared bovine heart mitochondria and their submitochondrial particles were incubated with 200 μm EMA for 30 s at 0 °C and pH 7.2 in the dark to avoid possible production of singlet oxygen. Alternatively, suspensions of mitochondria and submitochondrial particles were incubated with 200 μm FITC for 10 min at 0 °C in the dark. Then these samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.1, EMA predominantly labeled the 30-kDa ADP/ATP carrier (band AAC) in the submitochondrial particles but not mitochondria, as we reported previously (15Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EMA also labeled the 34-kDa protein slightly. In contrast, FITC did not label the ADP/ATP carrier, but it selectively labeled the 34-kDa protein both in mitochondria and submitochondrial particles (Fig. 1). Because membrane-impermeable EMA labeled the ADP/ATP carrier only from the matrix side (15Majima E. Koike H. Hong Y.-M. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Houstek J. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6288-6295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the labeling of the 34-kDa protein by FITC from both the cytosolic and matrix sides was not due to damage of the mitochondrial membrane. Next we incubated mitochondria and the particles with various concentrations of FITC for 10 min at 0 °C and pH 7.2. After termination of the labeling, progress of the labeling was assayed from the intensity of the fluorescent band on SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.2 A, the labeling of the 34-kDa protein by FITC in both membrane systems increased with increase in the FITC concentration, and the labeling attained a plateau at 600 μm and above in both samples. It is noteworthy that even 800 μm FITC selectively labeled the 34-kDa protein, giving a single fluorescent band on SDS-PAGE (inset, Fig.2 A). The concentration required for 50% labeling was determined to be about 120 μm with both mitochondria and the particles. The effect of the incubation period on FITC labeling was examined in both membrane systems at pH 7.2 and 0 °C. As shown in Fig.2 B, labeling with 200 μm FITC proceeded rapidly in the first 10 min and then became gradual until it attained a plateau level. This dye still specifically labeled the 34-kDa protein by incubation for 60 min (inset, Fig. 2 B). In Figs. 2, A and B, the greater the labeling of the particles than mitochondria should be due to the higher content of the 34-kDa protein in the particles, which contain only mitochondrial membrane proteins, showing that FITC specifically labeled the 34-kDa protein to a similar extent from both the cytosolic and matrix sides at 0 °C at a physiological pH of 7.2. For identification of this 34-kDa protein, mitochondria were incubated with 200 μm FITC at pH 7.2 and 0 °C for 20 min, when FITC labeling almost attained the plateau level (see Fig. 2 B). After solubilization of the treated mitochondria with Triton X-100, samples were applied to a column of hydroxylapatite gel. The labeled protein in flow-through fractions was denatured with guanidine HCl, and the cysteine residues were reduced with DTT and carboxamidomethylated with iodoacetamide. The labeled protein was isolated by gel filtration chromatography. After SDS-PAGE, the fluorescent band was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. The N-terminal sequence of 51 amino acid residues was determined as AVEEQYSCDYGRGRFFILCGLGGIISCGTTHTALVPLDLVKCRMQVDPQKY. Because this sequence was the same as the N-terminal sequence of the bovine heart mitochondrial phosphate carrier (21Aquila H. Link T.A. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Runswick M.J. Powell S.J. Nyren P. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 23Kolve H.V.D. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15889-15906Google Scholar), the phosphate carrier was concluded to be specifically labeled with FITC at 0 °C. FITC did not label the N-terminal α-amino group of Ala1, the ε-amino groups of Lys41 and Lys50, or the SH groups of Cys8, Cys19, Cys27, and Cys42 in this N-terminal region of the carrier at pH 7.2. However, it is not certain whether FITC actually did not label the above cysteine residues because it is possible that treatment of the phosphate carrier with DTT released the labeled FITC, as described later. Next, we examined the effect of FITC labeling on Pi uptake mediated by the phosphate carrier. For this, we incubated mitochondria with various concentrations of FITC for 10 min at pH 7.2 and 0 °C and started Pi transport by the addition of 32Pi. After 30 s, Pi uptake was terminated with the phosphate transport inhibitor mersalyl, and the amount of Pi incorporated into the mitochondria was determined. As shown in Fig.3, FITC inhibited Piuptake depending on the FITC concentration. The transport in the mitochondria was almost completely inhibited by 200 μm FITC, and the concentration necessary for 50% inhibition (IC50) was about 60 μm. A similar inhibitory effect was observed with the particles (Fig. 3). Because FITC labels the deprotonated SH group and amino group (24Podhradsky D. Drobnica L. Kristian P. Experientia. 1979; 35: 154-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it was necessary to determine whether inhibition of Piuptake via the phosphate carrier by FITC was due to the labeling of cysteine and/or lysine residues in the carrier. We examined the effect of DTT on Piuptake by mitochondria labeled with FITC. If the Pitransport inhibition was due to labeling of a cysteine reside(s) in the carrier, DTT treatment should cause loss of Pitransport inhibition (25Genchi G. Petrone G. De Palma A. Cambria A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We incubated FITC-treated mitochondria with 10 mm DTT for 10 min at 0 °C, then removed the added DTT by washing the mitochondria and examined their Pitransport activity. We confirmed that DTT completely abolished the inhibited Piuptake caused by SH-modifying reagents such as mersalyl (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, DTT did not affect Piuptake inhibited by FITC. Therefore, we concluded that Pitransport inhibition by FITC was due to its labeling of the lysine residue, and no cysteine residues were associated with the inhibition of Pitransport. We tried to identify the labeling site of FITC in the phosphate carrier. For this, we incubated bovine heart mitochondria and the submitochondrial particles suspended in S. E. medium at pH 7.2 with 200 μm FITC for 20 min at 0 °C. After removal of free FITC by chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 column, labeled mitochondria and the particles were solubilized with Triton X-100, and the solubilized preparations were subjected to chromatography on a hydroxylapatite column. The flow-through fractions, major components of which were the phosphate carrier and the ADP/ATP carrier, were treated with cold acetone to precipitate proteins. Then, the precipitated proteins were dissolved with 6 m guanidine HCl and treated with DTT to reduce cysteine residues. Subsequently, cysteine residues were carboxamidomethylated with iodoacetamide, and the carboxamidomethylated samples were subjected to gel filtration chromatography to isolate the FITC-labeled phosphate carrier. The fluorescent fractions of the phosphate carrier were digested with the lysine-specific proteinase lysylendopeptidase, and the peptide fragments thus obtained were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. Fig. 4 A shows elution profiles on reversed-phase HPLC of the peptide fragments of the phosphate carrier from submitochondrial particles monitored with optical absorbance at 210 nm. Of the peaks in the chromatogram, two peaks were found to be fluorescent monitored at 510 nm and excited at 450 nm, as shown in Fig. 4 B (top chromatogram). The same elution profile was observed with the phosphate carrier from mitochondria (see Fig. 4B, middle chromatogram). The first fluorescent peak, referred to as peak 1, eluting at 43 min was consistently observed both with and without lysylendopeptidase digestion (top and bottom chromatograms). In contrast, the second fluorescent peak, referred to as peak 2, eluting at 96 min was not observed when the phosphate carrier was not treated with lysylendopeptidase. We isolated a fluorescent component of peak 1 by reversed-phase HPLC and performed amino acid sequence analysis of this component. However, no amino acid derivatized with phenylthiohydantoin was detected. These results showed that the fluorescent component of peak 1 was not to be the peptide fragment labeled with FITC. A similar nonpeptide fluorescent peak was observed besides the FITC-labeled fluorescent peptide peak in the reversed-phase HPLC on digestion of the FITC-labeled Ca2+-ATPase with trypsin (26Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6232-6237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fluorescent fraction producing peak 2 from submitochondrial particles was subjected to amino acid sequence analysis, and the results are summarized in Table I. This peptide consisted of 29 amino acid residues, but the 16th residue could not be determined due to modification with FITC. According to the sequence of the bovine heart mitochondrial phosphate carrier (21Aquila H. Link T.A. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Runswick M.J. Powell S.J. Nyren P. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the determined sequence was found to correspond to that from Gly170 to Lys198. Therefore, the 16th residue of the peptide was Lys185, located in the putative fourth transmembrane segment (27Capobianco L. Brandolin G. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4963-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, Lys185 of the phosphate carrier in mitochondria was determined to be modified by FITC. Therefore, the hydrophilic and anionic FITC specifically labeled the same lysine residue from both the cytosolic and matrix side.Table IAmino acid sequence analysis of the fluorescent fraction derived from the phosphate carrier labeled with FITC in submitochondrial particles from bovine heart mitochondriaCyclePhenylthiohydantoin-derivativeCyclePhenylthiohydantoin-derivativepmolpmol1Gly (56.9)16ND 1-aNot detected.2Val (54.9)17Phe (9.6)3Ala (63.1)18Ala (9.9)4Pro (15.1)19Cys (NQ) 1-bDetected as carboxamidomethylated cysteine, but its amount was not quantified.5Leu (20.9)20Phe (13.1)6Trp (17.2)21Glu (7.2)7Met (18.4)22Arg (6.1)8Arg (9.4)23Thr (4.7)9Gln (14.7)24Val (6.8)10Ile (8.4)25Glu (9.0)11Pro (8.5)26Ala (7.2)12Tyr (12.2)27Leu (6.0)13Thr (6.1)28Tyr (5.0)14Met (10.0)29Lys (2.5)15Met (18.7)The phosphate carrier purified from submitochondrial particles treated with FITC was denatured with guanidine-HCl, and its cysteine residues were carboxamidomethylated with iodoacetamide after reduction with dithiothreitol.

Then the FITC-labeled carrier was digested with lysylendopeptidase, and the peptide fragments thus obtained were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. The fluorescent fraction eluted at 96 min was subjected to amino acid sequence analysis (see Fig. 4). It is well known that acylation of amines by isothiocyanates is significantly pH-dependent and that FITC modification of lysine residues proceeds well at alkaline pH values, in which lysine residues are deprotonated (28Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., NY1993: 10-12Google Scholar). We examined the labeling of the phosphate carrier with 200 μm FITC at 0 °C at various pH values between pH 5.0 and 9.0. The results of SDS-PAGE showed that FITC specifically labeled the phosphate carrier in mitochondria and the particles at various pH values examined, and the labeling was significant at pH 6.0 and 7.0 (Fig.5). It is noteworthy that FITC was not essentially reactive with the phosphate carrier at pH 9.0. Fig.6 shows the results of pH-dependent FITC labeling determined from the intensities of the fluorescent bands shown in Fig. 5. FITC labeling increased with increase in pH, attaining a maximum level at pH 7.0, and then decreased with further increase in pH in both mitochondria and the particles.Figure 6Dependence of FITC labeling of the phosphate carrier on pH.

Egebjerg J. Nielsen E.Ø. Madsen U. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2609-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The mGluRs are members of family C of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which also includes two γ-aminobutyric acid receptors type B (GABABR1–2) (2Möhler H. Fritschy J.-M.

Genomics. 2000; 67: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning has revealed the existence of eight different mGluR subtypes, subdivided into three subgroups based on their amino acid sequence similarities, agonist pharmacology, and signal transduction pathways (1Bräuner-Osborne H.

Group I is constituted by mGluR1 and mGluR5, group II by mGluR2 and mGluR3, and group III by the remaining four subtypes. Some of the subtypes exist as multiple splice variants, which only differ in their carboxyl termini (10Schoepp D.D. Jane D.E. Monn J.A. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1431-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). In the case of mGluR1, the splice variant mGluR1a possesses a C-terminal of 359 amino acid residues, whereas the termini of the other splice variants cloned so far only consist of 50–60 residues. With the exception of the orphan receptors in family C (5Cheng V. Lotan R. J. Biol.

The ATDs can be up to 600 amino acids long, and agonist binding to the family C receptor has been demonstrated to take place to this region (11O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D.

Weak amino acid sequence similarities exist between these ATDs and a family of periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) involved in the transfer of nutrients into the cytoplasm in bacteria (11O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.H. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). We have previously applied the crystal structure of one of these PBPs, the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein, as a template for the construction of a tertiary molecular model of the ATD of mGluR1, and similar models have been published for mGluR4, GABABR1, and CaR (11O'Hara P.J.

According to these models, the ATD of the family C receptor consists of two globular domains (“lobesȁ) connected by a hinge region. Based on the information obtained from crystal structures of the PBPs, the ATD of the family C receptor is speculated to exist in two conformations: an “openȁ inactivated and a “closedȁ activated form (21Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Agonist binding to the ATD is believed to take place to a closed form of the region. How the closure of ATD subsequently is translated into G-protein coupling and effector enzyme activation or inhibition is at present poorly understood. Two conserved serine/threonine residues throughout the PBPs and the family C receptors have been shown to be important for agonist binding to and/or activation of mGluR1, mGluR4, GABABR1, and CaR (11O'Hara P.J.

Furthermore, an arginine residue conserved within the mGluRs has been shown to be crucial for agonist binding to and/or activation of mGluR1 and mGluR4, most likely through an ionic interaction with the distal negatively charged group of the agonists (18Hampson D.R.

According to our model of the “openȁ ATD of mGluR1, the three residues identified as key participants in agonist binding, Arg78, Ser165, and Thr188, are located in the same lobe of the ATD. As an attempt to shed light on the contraction process of the ATD following agonist binding, we have created a high affinity zinc binding site in mGluR1 by mutating Lys260, located in the top of the lobe opposite to the lobe containing the agonist binding residues, to a histidine. The results of the study provide interesting information regarding the ATD closure mechanism and the structural flexibility within each ATD lobe.

The tsA cells and the mGluR1a-CHO cell line were generous gifts from Dr. Penelope S. V. Jones (University of California, San Diego, CA) and professor Shigetada Nakanishi, respectively. The subcloning of mGluR1b, mGluR1a, and CaR from their respective vectors into the pSI vector have all been described previously (16Bräuner-Osborne H. Jensen A.A. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.

The point-mutated mGlu1b receptors were constructed using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The construction of mutant K260H mGluR1a-pSI for the Western blot experiments were done by subcloning a region containing the Lys260 → His mutation from mutant K260H mGluR1b-pSI into mGluR1a-pSI using the unique restriction enzymes XhoI andApaI. All amplified receptor DNAs were sequenced on an ABI 310 sequencer using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). tsA cells (a transformed HEK 293 cell line (24Chahine M. Bennett P.B. George Jr., A.L. Horn R. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 427: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)) were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% calf serum. 1 × 106 tsA cells were split into a 10-cm tissue culture plate and transfected with 5 μg of plasmid the following day using Superfect as a DNA carrier according to the protocol by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The day after transfection, the cells were split into a poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well tissue culture plate in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and 1 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol. 16–24 h later, the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution (HBSS) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in HBSS supplemented with 0.9 mm CaCl2, 1.05 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm LiCl (and in the antagonism experiments, various concentrations of ZnCl2or 100 μm CPCCOEt). The buffer was removed, and the cells were incubated for 40 min in the same buffer containing various concentrations of Glu, a fixed Glu concentration and various concentrations of ZnCl2 or 100 μm CPCCOEt, or containing a fixed ZnCl2 concentration and various concentrations of Glu. The reactions were stopped by exchanging the buffer with 500 μl of ice-cold 20 mm formic acid, and separation of total [3H]inositol phosphates was carried out by ion exchange chromatography as described previously (23Bräuner-Osborne H.

The effect of ZnCl2 on tsA cells transfected with CaR-pSI or m5-pCD was studied in the same manner, except that CaCl2 and acetylcholine were used as agonists, respectively. The effects of CuCl2 and CoCl2 on cells transfected with wild type (WT) or K260H mGluR1b were studied using the same protocol as in the Zn2+ antagonism experiments. Almost all IP experiments were performed in triplicate (a few were performed in duplicate), and the results are given as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. 2 × 106 tsA cells were split into a 15-cm tissue culture plate and transfected with 10 μg of plasmid the following day using Superfect as a DNA carrier according to the protocol by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The day after transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The following day, the cells were suspended in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 50,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was homogenized (using a Polytron homogenizer for 10 s) in ice-cold 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.1 mmEDTA (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 50,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. This step was performed twice. The membranes were homogenized in assay buffer, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2(pH 7.4), and protein concentrations were measured using Bradford Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (Bio-Rad). In the saturation binding experiments with WT, K260H, and K260H/H231A/E233A/E238A mGluR1b, 5–15 μg of membrane fractions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with various concentrations of [3H]Quis in the absence or presence of 1 mm Glu (representing total and nonspecific binding, respectively) in a total assay volume of 100 μl. [3H]Quis was diluted with unlabeled (S)-quisqualic acid at concentrations above 250 nm. Expression levels of other mutant receptors were estimated by measuring binding at a concentration of 250 nm[3H]Quis in the absence and presence of 1 mmGlu. To investigate whether Zn2+ was able to displace [3H]Quis binding to WT or K260H mGluR1b, 50–100-μg membrane fractions of cells transfected with the two receptors were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 30 nm[3H]Quis in the absence or presence of 1 mmGlu, 100 μm (S)-4CPG, 100 μmCPCCOEt, or 100 μm ZnCl2. The assay mixture was aspirated onto a GF/C filter (Whatman) and washed with 3 × 5 ml of ice-cold assay buffer, after which the filters were dried and counted in a scintillation counter. The binding experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate at least three times. The rabbit anti-mGluR1a polyclonal antibody used is directed toward the Glu1116–Leu1130peptide in the C terminus of mGluR1a. This region does not exist in the “short tailedȁ splice variant mGluR1b. Hence, we used WT mGluR1a and the mutant K260H mGluR1a in the experiments. 1 × 106 tsA cells were split into a 10-cm tissue culture plate and transfected with 5 μg of plasmid (WT mGluR1a-pSI, K260H mGluR1a-pSI, or pSI) the following day using Superfect as a DNA carrier according to the protocol by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The day after transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The following day, the cells were washed twice in HBSS and scraped into lysis buffer (2 mm HEPES, 2 mmEDTA, containing protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche, Switzerland) and 100 mm iodoacetamide) and homogenized. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, the nuclear pellet was discarded, and membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min. The membranes were homogenized in HBSS containing 1% SDS and 100 mm iodoacetamide and incubated for 30 min in the presence or absence of 300 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, or 10 mm ZnCl2. The samples were heated for 5 min at 65 °C before electrophoresis, where the samples (5–15 μg of membrane protein/well) were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by transblotting at 200 mA for 1 h. The blots were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 2% powdered skim milk overnight. The blots were washed three times for 30 min with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with rabbit anti-mGluR1a polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:2000 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 2% powdered skim milk) for 1 h. This was followed by three 30-min washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubation in anti-Rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:1500 in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 2% powdered skim milk) for 1 h, after which the membranes were developed in a solution of 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Kem-En-Tec A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). Three independent Western blot experiments were performed, and similar results were obtained in all of them. Data from Glu concentration-response experiments were fitted to the following simple mass equation:R = Rbasal + (Rmax/(1 + (EC50/[A]n))), where [A] is the concentration of agonist, n is the Hill coefficient, and R is the response. Data from the Zn2+ antagonism experiments were fitted to the following:R = Rmax − (Rmax/(1 + (IC50/[A]n))), where [A] is the concentration of antagonist, n is the Hill coefficient, and R is the response. Curves were generated by nonweighted least-squares fits using the program KaleidaGraph 3.08 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Exposure of tsA cells transiently transfected with WT mGluR1b to Zn2+ in concentrations of 300 μm and above led to an inhibition of agonist-induced IP accumulation with an IC50 value of the metal ion of ∼1 mm (Fig.1). However, similar pharmacological profiles were observed when two other phosholipase C-coupled receptors, CaR and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m5, were exposed to Zn2+ (Fig. 1). The observation that zinc displays the same apparent antagonistic effect at three different receptors strongly suggests that the observed inhibition is of a nonspecific nature. Zn2+ appears to have an inhibitory or a toxic effect on the tsA cells. Alternatively, this ion may inhibit events downstream in the signal transduction pathway of the receptors. In agreement with the findings in this study, the group of Pin have also only observed a minute decrease in the maximal response (induced by 1 mmGlu) exerted by 100 μm ZnCl2 on mGluR1. 2L. Prézeau and J.-P. Pin, personal communication. Since the nonspecific effect of Zn2+ on receptor functionality in our assay is negligible at concentrations below 300 μm, 100 μm was used as the maximal concentration of Zn2+, when testing the WT and mutant mGlu1breceptors. In the experiments of Zn2+ antagonism of Glu-induced receptor activation, an agonist concentration of 1 mm Glu was used. At this concentration, the WT and all mutant receptors were fully activated. In cells transfected with mutant K260H mGluR1b, where Lys260 had been substituted with a histidine, the IC50 of Zn2+ was decreased 500-fold compared with the “apparentȁ IC50 of this ion on the WT receptor (Fig. 2 and TableI). Zn2+ showed an affinity on the mutant receptor independent of the agonist concentration used, indicating a noncompetitive antagonist effect (Fig.3A). This proposal was supported by a Schild analysis, where Glu concentration-response experiments were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of Zn2+. Here, the maximal response of K260H was markedly reduced with increasing concentrations of Zn2+ present, whereas the EC50 values of Glu were relatively unaltered (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, much like the noncompetitive mGluR1 antagonist CPCCOEt and in contrast to the competitive antagonist (S)-4CPG, Zn2+ did not influence [3H]Quis binding to either WT or K260H mGluR1b (Fig.4A). In conclusion, Zn2+ was clearly a noncompetitive antagonist at mutant K260H. The metal ions Cu2+ and Co2+ were tested on WT and K260H mGluR1b. However, CuCl2 and CoCl2 were unable to antagonize the agonist-induced response in both the WT and the mutant receptor in concentrations up to 100 μm (data not shown). In concentrations above 100 μm, CuCl2 had a marked toxic effect on the tsA cells.Table IPharmacological characterization of WT and mutant mGlu1breceptorsReceptorGluZn2+EC50Rmax/R100 μm CPCCOEt1-aThe ratio between the responses in the presence of 1 mm Glu and 100 μm CPCCOEt, respectively.IC50μmμmWT4.1 ± 0.623.3 ± 0.19>100K260A5.9 ± 0.333.5 ± 0.33>100K260H5.5 ± 0.433.9 ± 0.371.8 ± 0.24K260H/H231A6.04 ± 1.43.5 ± 0.445.9 ± 2.5K260H/E233A2.2 ± 0.563.7 ± 0.472.3 ± 0.52K260H/E238A2.9 ± 1.13.9 ± 0.233.2 ± 0.24K260H/H257AND1-bND, not determined.3.6 ± 0.393.8 ± 1.2K260H/D259AND3.1 ± 0.270.94 ± 0.25K260H/H231A/E233AND3.6 ± 0.191.9 ± 0.33K260H/H231A/E238AND4.1 ± 0.135.8 ± 0.45K260H/E233A/E238AND3.9 ± 0.333.5 ± 0.56K260H/H231A/E233A/E238A2.4 ± 0.233.3 ± 0.14>100K260H/H231E/E233H/E238HND3.9 ± 0.230.31 ± 0.092K260H/E238H3.1 ± 1.93.5 ± 0.191.5 ± 0.34Shown are the pharmacological parameters of WT and selected mutant mGlu1b receptors from Glu concentration-response experiments and Zn2+ inhibition of Glu-induced IP accumulation.

Amino acids within the C termini of Stats constitute the transactivation domain but also regulate the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation and extent of DNA binding. We mutated Thr757 in the C-terminal of Stat5a (Thr-Stat5) to Val (Val-Stat5) and Asp (Asp-Stat5) and examined the effect on nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and prolactin-induced transcriptional activation of a Stat5-responsive luciferase reporter gene. Val-Stat5 produced a 5-fold higher increase in transcriptional activity relative to Thr-Stat5; Asp-Stat5 produced a similar response to Thr-Stat5. The increased transactivation was ligand induced and was not due to differences in basal expression of Val-Stat5 or to a constitutively activated Stat5 protein. Similar rates of loss of DNA binding ability and phosphorylation of Val- and Thr-Stat5 were observed following a single pulse of prolactin, indicating that the dephosphorylation pathways were unaltered. The serine-threonine kinase inhibitor H7 inhibited the transactivation potential of Thr-, Val-, and Asp-Stat5 to a similar extent, eliminating phosphorylation of Thr757 as a regulatory mechanism. The results suggest that Thr757 modulates the transactivation potential of Stat5 by a mechanism(s) that is dependent on the formation of Stat5 dimers and/or their nuclear translocation.

Ligand binding by the cytokines to their cognate cell surface receptors leads to a conformational change in the receptor, which in turn results in activation of the receptor-associated Janus kinases (Jak).1 The activated Jak phosphorylate the receptor at specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain, thus recruiting the Stat proteins, which bind via their Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (2Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Jak-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor-bound Stats leads to their dissociation from the receptor, dimerization by means of reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions and translocation to the nucleus, where the Stat dimers bind to specific DNA sequences and induce gene transcription. Seven mammalian members of the Stat family have been reported and show a high degree of similarity. The highest degree of similarity occurs in the SH2 domain, whereas the C-terminal domain is the least conserved region (4Briscoe J. Kohlhuber F. Muller M. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 336-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). C-terminal deletion mutants and alternatively spliced variants lacking this region have provided evidence that this region serves as the transactivation domain (5Wen Z. Zhong A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). The transactivation domain of Stat5 has been mapped to a region between amino acids 750–772 (6Morrigl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotriropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C terminus of Stat5 resulted in a dominant negative phenotype with sustained tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding relative to the wild type but with no transcriptional activation.Members of the growth hormone family of cytokines such as prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone transduce intracellular signals via activation of the Jak2-Stat5 signal transduction pathway to regulate the transcription of a variety of genes (7Li S.

The specificity of transcriptional regulation by Stat5 is believed to result from its association with coactivators and corepressors of transcription and binding of additional transcription factors to the promoter regions of target genes (14Verdier F. Rabionet R. Gouilleux F. Beisenherz-Huss C. Varlet P. Muller O. Mayeux P. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Chretien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that PRL acts via the long form of the PRL receptor (PRLRL) to facilitate the binding of Stat5 multimers to two interferon-γ-activated sequences (GAS)-like elements in the promoter of the rat liverntcp(Na+/taurocholatecotransporting polypeptide) gene to increase its transcription (15Ganguly T.C.

Obligatory tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr694 and subsequent serine/threonine phosphorylation has been demonstrated for hepatic Stat5 activation following growth hormone stimulation (9Groner B.

Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 18Kazasky A.V. Raught B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29998-30006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The amino acids within the C-terminal region in Stat5a and Stat5b isoforms from various species are conserved and contain a serine/threonine at position 757, which could serve as a potential phosphorylation site. Two serine residues (Ser779and Ser725) in the C-terminal domain of Stat5a have been shown to be phosphorylation sites. Although mutation of Ser779 to Ala had no effect on PRL-induced transcriptional activation of a β-casein reporter construct, mutation of Ser725 to Ala resulted in prolonged DNA binding activity following PRL treatment (21Beuvink I. Hess D. Flotow H. Jofsteenge J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10247-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, serine phosphorylation may serve to modulate Stat5a transactivation. The present studies were designed to evaluate the role of the conserved Thr757 in transcriptional regulation of ntcp and used site-directed mutagenesis to alter Thr757 to Val and Asp and compare the transactivation properties of these mutants to those of wild type Stat5. We also studied the effect of the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, H7, on the transactivation potential of wild type Stat5 and its mutants. The present studies show that the mutation of Thr757 to Val markedly increased the transactivation potential of Stat5, whereas mutation to Asp did not significantly alter this potential.DISCUSSIONSignal transduction via the Stat5 pathway requires the recruitment of the latent cytoplasmic transcription factor to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, phosphorylation of a key tyrosine (Tyr694) in Stat5 by the receptor-associated Jak, followed by the interaction of the SH2 domain, and formation of dimers by each of the phosphotyrosines in the two Stats in a reciprocal manner. The dimers are then translocated to the nucleus, where they bind to the GAS elements via their DNA-binding domain and direct an increase in specific transcriptional activity by the recruitment of the general transcription factors via their transactivation domain. A number of studies have demonstrated that amino acids 750–772 in the C termini of Stat5 are essential for the increase in transcriptional activity, and may also act to down-regulate activity by increasing the dephosphorylation of Tyr694. Other studies have demonstrated that although tyrosine phosphorylation is obligatory to Stat5 transcriptional activation, serine phosphorylation can modulate the binding to DNA (5Wen Z. Zhong A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of Ser725 to Ala in Stat5a resulted in sustained DNA binding activity relative to that of wild type Stat5a but with no change in transcriptional activation (21Beuvink I. Hess D. Flotow H. Jofsteenge J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10247-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The increased DNA binding observed in the present experiments is similar to the increased binding observed with C-terminal deletion mutants and naturally occurring splice variants of Stat5a and Stat5b (6Morrigl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotriropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 30Wang D. Stravopodis D. Teglund S. Kitazawa J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, unlike the C-terminal deletion variants of Stat5a and Stat5b that exert a dominant negative phenotype, mutation of Thr757 to Val resulted in a higher transactivation potential, whereas simulation of a phosphorylated site by mutation to Asp had no effect on activity. These data suggest that Thr757 is not an essential site for phosphorylation in the induction process mediated by the wild type version of Stat5. The observation that incubation with the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7 equally inhibited transactivation by wild type Stat5a and its mutants further supports the argument that Thr757 is not a site for phosphorylation of Stat5a. The similar inhibitory effect of H7 on Thr-, Val-, and Asp-Stat5-mediated transcription suggests that other phosphorylation sites that contribute to Stat5 function are targets for the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor. However, our results are consistent with reports that Stat5a/5b isoforms are phosphorylated at tyrosine and serine, but not threonine residues, following activation with PRL or interleukin-2 in a variety of cell lines (33Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Liu X. Henighausen L. Hynes N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15459-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Because dephosphorylation of Stat5 Tyr694 is the primary regulator of down-regulation of its DNA binding ability and amino acids 750–794 have been shown to down-regulate the DNA binding activity of Stat5, we postulated that Thr757 might interact with a phosphatase that mediated the dephoshorylation of Tyr694. However, when we compared the rates of loss of DNA binding ability and dephosphorylation of Thr- and Val-Stat5 following a pulse dose of oPRL, they were both very similar. These observations indicate that the increased transactivation potential of Val-Stat5 is not a consequence of delayed dephosphorylation of this mutant protein but rather because of an increased rate of formation and/or nuclear translocation of Stat5 dimers.Several mechanisms could be involved in the enhanced transactivation by Val-Stat5. Overcoming negative regulation could be one of the mechanisms by which Val-Stat5 elicits an increased response. The SOCS (suppressors of cytokinesignaling) family of inhibitors either bind the activated Jaks or compete with Stat5 for binding to the receptor to bring about inhibition (reviewed in Ref. 36Starr R. Hilton D.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Because the mutation is in Thr757 of Stat5 and not in the receptor or Jak2, such a mechanism is unlikely. Delayed dephosphorylation was experimentally ruled out as a possible reason for increased Val-Stat5 transactivation. The coactivators and corepressors of transcription like CBP/p300 are known to interact with the C-terminal of the activated Stat5 (37Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in cotransfection experiments, we found no evidence of increased interaction of Val-Stat5 with p300, compared with Thr-Stat5 (data not shown). The most likely mechanism of enhanced transactivation by Val-Stat5, therefore, is either a more effective association between Val-Stat5 and Jak2 to facilitate phosphorylation by Jak2, increased stability and translocation of the Val-Stat5 dimers following activation, or both. Crystallographic studies have shown that in Stat dimers, the C termini are in very close proximity, whereas the N termini are far apart, forming a saddle-like structure around the DNA (38Milocco L. Haslam J.A. Rosen J. Seidel H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that replacement of the OH group of Thr757 with the methyl group of Val results in increased hydrophobic bonding between the C termini of Val-Stat5, leading to more stable dimers. This hypothesis also explains the sustained high levels of phosphorylated Val-Stat5 in the nucleus. The faster nuclear translocation could result from faster dimerization as a result of better interaction between Jak2 and Val-Stat5, or alternatively, an enhanced rate of actual translocation into the nucleus. Mutation of Thr757 to a Val, however, does not appear to disrupt the interaction between Stat5 and the nuclear phosphatases that are involved in deactivation and resetting of the Jak-Stat pathway. Whether a specific PIAS (protein inhibitor ofactivated Stats) exists for Stat5, as has been shown for Stat1 and Stat3 (38Milocco L. Haslam J.A. Rosen J. Seidel H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), is not known. If identified, altered interaction with such a PIAS might also account for the increased transactivation potential of Val-Stat5.Recently, Callus and Mathey-Prevot (39Callus B.A. Mathey-Prevot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16954-16962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) further characterized the C termini of murine Stat5a and confirmed that deletion of the last 57 amino acids results in the loss of ability to transactivate. Within this region, deletion of a 12-amino acid block (749) also dramatically decreased the transactivation potential of a chimerae of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 with the C-terminal transactivation domain of Stat5. However, when the full-length Stat5 containing this deletion was cotransfected into cells expressing the PRL receptor and a Stat5-responsive luciferase reporter gene, the luciferase activity in response to PRL was not affected. This was found to be due to enhanced DNA binding activity of the 12-amino acid deletion mutant, which these authors also postulated might reflect an enhanced rate of dimerization. Mutation of Ser756 (analogous to Thr757 in the present study) within this 12-amino acid block to Gly resulted in a 25% decrease in the transactivation following PRL treatment, even though neither the DNA binding nor phosphorylation of Tyr694 were altered. The basis for the modest decrease in transactivation in the S756G mutant was postulated to reflect subtle structural changes in the 12-amino acid region. Importantly, mutation of the hydrophobic Phe751 and Leu753 to Ala reduced transactivation about 70%, indicating the importance of hydrophobicity of this region to transactivation. These findings support the hypothesis that the increased hydrophobicity of Val-Stat5 is a key factor in its enhanced transactivation potential.In summary, the present studies show that amino acid residues present in the C-terminal transactivation domain of wild type Stat5a, specifically Thr757, play a critical role in regulating its function as a transcription factor. The presence of the hydroxyl group in Thr757 appears to limit the rate of phosphorylation and/or nuclear translocation of Stat5, because substitution with a Val at this position markedly increased its ability to form transcriptionally active dimers. The increased hydrophobicity of Val-Stat5 appears to be a major contributor to its DNA binding and transactivation activity, consistent with the essential nature of other nearby hydrophobic amino acids. Stat (signal transducers andactivators of transcription) proteins constitute a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated by a large number of cytokines and growth factors (1Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 4: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 2Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev.

Ligand binding by the cytokines to their cognate cell surface receptors leads to a conformational change in the receptor, which in turn results in activation of the receptor-associated Janus kinases (Jak).1 The activated Jak phosphorylate the receptor at specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain, thus recruiting the Stat proteins, which bind via their Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (2Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Jak-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor-bound Stats leads to their dissociation from the receptor, dimerization by means of reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions and translocation to the nucleus, where the Stat dimers bind to specific DNA sequences and induce gene transcription. Seven mammalian members of the Stat family have been reported and show a high degree of similarity. The highest degree of similarity occurs in the SH2 domain, whereas the C-terminal domain is the least conserved region (4Briscoe J. Kohlhuber F. Muller M. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 336-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). C-terminal deletion mutants and alternatively spliced variants lacking this region have provided evidence that this region serves as the transactivation domain (5Wen Z. Zhong A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). The transactivation domain of Stat5 has been mapped to a region between amino acids 750–772 (6Morrigl R.

Deletion of the C terminus of Stat5 resulted in a dominant negative phenotype with sustained tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding relative to the wild type but with no transcriptional activation.

Erdjument-Bromage H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 18Kazasky A.V. Raught B.

The amino acids within the C-terminal region in Stat5a and Stat5b isoforms from various species are conserved and contain a serine/threonine at position 757, which could serve as a potential phosphorylation site. Two serine residues (Ser779and Ser725) in the C-terminal domain of Stat5a have been shown to be phosphorylation sites. Although mutation of Ser779 to Ala had no effect on PRL-induced transcriptional activation of a β-casein reporter construct, mutation of Ser725 to Ala resulted in prolonged DNA binding activity following PRL treatment (21Beuvink I.

Thus, serine phosphorylation may serve to modulate Stat5a transactivation. The present studies were designed to evaluate the role of the conserved Thr757 in transcriptional regulation of ntcp and used site-directed mutagenesis to alter Thr757 to Val and Asp and compare the transactivation properties of these mutants to those of wild type Stat5. We also studied the effect of the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, H7, on the transactivation potential of wild type Stat5 and its mutants. The present studies show that the mutation of Thr757 to Val markedly increased the transactivation potential of Stat5, whereas mutation to Asp did not significantly alter this potential. DISCUSSIONSignal transduction via the Stat5 pathway requires the recruitment of the latent cytoplasmic transcription factor to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, phosphorylation of a key tyrosine (Tyr694) in Stat5 by the receptor-associated Jak, followed by the interaction of the SH2 domain, and formation of dimers by each of the phosphotyrosines in the two Stats in a reciprocal manner. The dimers are then translocated to the nucleus, where they bind to the GAS elements via their DNA-binding domain and direct an increase in specific transcriptional activity by the recruitment of the general transcription factors via their transactivation domain. A number of studies have demonstrated that amino acids 750–772 in the C termini of Stat5 are essential for the increase in transcriptional activity, and may also act to down-regulate activity by increasing the dephosphorylation of Tyr694. Other studies have demonstrated that although tyrosine phosphorylation is obligatory to Stat5 transcriptional activation, serine phosphorylation can modulate the binding to DNA (5Wen Z. Zhong A. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of Ser725 to Ala in Stat5a resulted in sustained DNA binding activity relative to that of wild type Stat5a but with no change in transcriptional activation (21Beuvink I. Hess D. Flotow H. Jofsteenge J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10247-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The increased DNA binding observed in the present experiments is similar to the increased binding observed with C-terminal deletion mutants and naturally occurring splice variants of Stat5a and Stat5b (6Morrigl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotriropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, unlike the C-terminal deletion variants of Stat5a and Stat5b that exert a dominant negative phenotype, mutation of Thr757 to Val resulted in a higher transactivation potential, whereas simulation of a phosphorylated site by mutation to Asp had no effect on activity. These data suggest that Thr757 is not an essential site for phosphorylation in the induction process mediated by the wild type version of Stat5. The observation that incubation with the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7 equally inhibited transactivation by wild type Stat5a and its mutants further supports the argument that Thr757 is not a site for phosphorylation of Stat5a. The similar inhibitory effect of H7 on Thr-, Val-, and Asp-Stat5-mediated transcription suggests that other phosphorylation sites that contribute to Stat5 function are targets for the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor. However, our results are consistent with reports that Stat5a/5b isoforms are phosphorylated at tyrosine and serine, but not threonine residues, following activation with PRL or interleukin-2 in a variety of cell lines (33Wartmann M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15459-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Because dephosphorylation of Stat5 Tyr694 is the primary regulator of down-regulation of its DNA binding ability and amino acids 750–794 have been shown to down-regulate the DNA binding activity of Stat5, we postulated that Thr757 might interact with a phosphatase that mediated the dephoshorylation of Tyr694. However, when we compared the rates of loss of DNA binding ability and dephosphorylation of Thr- and Val-Stat5 following a pulse dose of oPRL, they were both very similar. These observations indicate that the increased transactivation potential of Val-Stat5 is not a consequence of delayed dephosphorylation of this mutant protein but rather because of an increased rate of formation and/or nuclear translocation of Stat5 dimers.Several mechanisms could be involved in the enhanced transactivation by Val-Stat5. Overcoming negative regulation could be one of the mechanisms by which Val-Stat5 elicits an increased response. The SOCS (suppressors of cytokinesignaling) family of inhibitors either bind the activated Jaks or compete with Stat5 for binding to the receptor to bring about inhibition (reviewed in Ref. 36Starr R. Hilton D.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Because the mutation is in Thr757 of Stat5 and not in the receptor or Jak2, such a mechanism is unlikely. Delayed dephosphorylation was experimentally ruled out as a possible reason for increased Val-Stat5 transactivation. The coactivators and corepressors of transcription like CBP/p300 are known to interact with the C-terminal of the activated Stat5 (37Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in cotransfection experiments, we found no evidence of increased interaction of Val-Stat5 with p300, compared with Thr-Stat5 (data not shown). The most likely mechanism of enhanced transactivation by Val-Stat5, therefore, is either a more effective association between Val-Stat5 and Jak2 to facilitate phosphorylation by Jak2, increased stability and translocation of the Val-Stat5 dimers following activation, or both. Crystallographic studies have shown that in Stat dimers, the C termini are in very close proximity, whereas the N termini are far apart, forming a saddle-like structure around the DNA (38Milocco L. Haslam J.A. Rosen J. Seidel H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that replacement of the OH group of Thr757 with the methyl group of Val results in increased hydrophobic bonding between the C termini of Val-Stat5, leading to more stable dimers. This hypothesis also explains the sustained high levels of phosphorylated Val-Stat5 in the nucleus. The faster nuclear translocation could result from faster dimerization as a result of better interaction between Jak2 and Val-Stat5, or alternatively, an enhanced rate of actual translocation into the nucleus. Mutation of Thr757 to a Val, however, does not appear to disrupt the interaction between Stat5 and the nuclear phosphatases that are involved in deactivation and resetting of the Jak-Stat pathway. Whether a specific PIAS (protein inhibitor ofactivated Stats) exists for Stat5, as has been shown for Stat1 and Stat3 (38Milocco L. Haslam J.A. Rosen J. Seidel H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), is not known. If identified, altered interaction with such a PIAS might also account for the increased transactivation potential of Val-Stat5.Recently, Callus and Mathey-Prevot (39Callus B.A. Mathey-Prevot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16954-16962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) further characterized the C termini of murine Stat5a and confirmed that deletion of the last 57 amino acids results in the loss of ability to transactivate. Within this region, deletion of a 12-amino acid block (749) also dramatically decreased the transactivation potential of a chimerae of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 with the C-terminal transactivation domain of Stat5. However, when the full-length Stat5 containing this deletion was cotransfected into cells expressing the PRL receptor and a Stat5-responsive luciferase reporter gene, the luciferase activity in response to PRL was not affected. This was found to be due to enhanced DNA binding activity of the 12-amino acid deletion mutant, which these authors also postulated might reflect an enhanced rate of dimerization. Mutation of Ser756 (analogous to Thr757 in the present study) within this 12-amino acid block to Gly resulted in a 25% decrease in the transactivation following PRL treatment, even though neither the DNA binding nor phosphorylation of Tyr694 were altered. The basis for the modest decrease in transactivation in the S756G mutant was postulated to reflect subtle structural changes in the 12-amino acid region. Importantly, mutation of the hydrophobic Phe751 and Leu753 to Ala reduced transactivation about 70%, indicating the importance of hydrophobicity of this region to transactivation. These findings support the hypothesis that the increased hydrophobicity of Val-Stat5 is a key factor in its enhanced transactivation potential.In summary, the present studies show that amino acid residues present in the C-terminal transactivation domain of wild type Stat5a, specifically Thr757, play a critical role in regulating its function as a transcription factor. The presence of the hydroxyl group in Thr757 appears to limit the rate of phosphorylation and/or nuclear translocation of Stat5, because substitution with a Val at this position markedly increased its ability to form transcriptionally active dimers. The increased hydrophobicity of Val-Stat5 appears to be a major contributor to its DNA binding and transactivation activity, consistent with the essential nature of other nearby hydrophobic amino acids. Signal transduction via the Stat5 pathway requires the recruitment of the latent cytoplasmic transcription factor to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, phosphorylation of a key tyrosine (Tyr694) in Stat5 by the receptor-associated Jak, followed by the interaction of the SH2 domain, and formation of dimers by each of the phosphotyrosines in the two Stats in a reciprocal manner. The dimers are then translocated to the nucleus, where they bind to the GAS elements via their DNA-binding domain and direct an increase in specific transcriptional activity by the recruitment of the general transcription factors via their transactivation domain. A number of studies have demonstrated that amino acids 750–772 in the C termini of Stat5 are essential for the increase in transcriptional activity, and may also act to down-regulate activity by increasing the dephosphorylation of Tyr694.
