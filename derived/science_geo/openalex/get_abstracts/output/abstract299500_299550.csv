https://openalex.org/W1970528721,"In near-field scanning optical microscopy, a light source or detector with dimensions less than the wavelength (lambda) is placed in close proximity (lambda/50) to a sample to generate images with resolution better than the diffraction limit. A near-field probe has been developed that yields a resolution of approximately 12 nm ( approximately lambda/43) and signals approximately 10(4)- to 10(6)-fold larger than those reported previously. In addition, image contrast is demonstrated to be highly polarization dependent. With these probes, near-field microscopy appears poised to fulfill its promise by combining the power of optical characterization methods with nanometric spatial resolution."

In particular, (Mg,Fe)SiO(3) perovskite, the most abundant mineral of Earth's lower mantle, is expected to react with liquid iron to produce metallic alloys (FeO and FeSi) and nonmetallic silicates (SiO(2) stishovite and MgSiO(3) perovskite) at the pressures of the core-mantle boundary, 14 x 10(10) Pascals. The experimental observations, in conjunction with seismological data, suggest that the lowermost 200 to 300 kilometers of Earth's mantle, the D"" layer, may be an extremely heterogeneous region as a result of chemical reactions between the silicate mantle and the liquid iron alloy of Earth's core. The combined thermal-chemical-electrical boundary layer resulting from such reactions offers a plausible explanation for the complex behavior of seismic waves near the core-mantle boundary and could influence Earth's magnetic field observed at the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2066792877,"Overlayer structures can be formed on surfaces by the deposition of clusters containing hundreds or thousands of atoms. Cluster assembly alters the reaction pathway at the surface so that novel structures with unique chemical and physical properties can be stabilized. This article discusses the process of cluster assembly. Cluster-assembled interfaces are compared to those obtained by conventional techniques, and examples are given for metal-semiconductor and semiconductor-high temperature superconductor systems."

Beams of various energies were successfully extracted for experimental use. Modifications of the ion source, the injector, and the main acceleration system made the production of highenergy heavy ions possible. Our computer control system played an important part."
https://openalex.org/W2071094070,"Estimates of terrigenous fluxes at three different water depths at two sites in the equatorial Atlantic by normalization against excess 230Th flux indicate that the flux of terrigenous material to the seafloor was significantly higher during the last glacial period than it is today. Fluxes started to decrease during deglaciation and reached minimal values in the middle of the Holocene. From 15,000 to 5,000 years ago, there was a substantial increase in flux with increasing water depth below 2,800 meters; this increase may reflect resuspension and lateral transport of slope and rise sediment, possibly because of intensification of deepwater circulation during that period."

https://openalex.org/W1994726602,"Nitrogen ions in charge states N5+ and N6+ have been accelerated in the Princeton Particle Accelerator to 4 and 7.4 billion electron volts (Gev), respectively. An external N5+ beam of 1 × 106 particles per second has been obtained and focused to a 6-millimeter-diameter spot. The N6+ beam was about 2 × 105 particles per second. The total charge-changing collision cross section of N5+ in water vapor was determined as a function of ion energy. The improvement in vacuum necessary to increase the N5+ beam at least tenfold was calculated. The N6+ total cross section is probably smaller than that of N5+ at the higher energies."

https://openalex.org/W2048549053,"An experiment has been carried out at the bevatron on the nuclear fragmentation of nitrogen-14 ions at an energy of 2.1 billion electron volts (Gev) per nucleon. Because of the near equality of the velocities of the nitrogen-14 beam and the fragmentation products at an angle of 0°, we find it possible to identify the nuclear fragments isotopically."
https://openalex.org/W2089479905,"Internal heat flow from radioactive decay in Triton's interior along with absorbed thermal energy from Neptune total 5 to 20 percent of the insolation absorbed by Triton, thus comprising a significant fraction of Triton's surface energy balance. These additional energy inputs can raise Triton's surface temperature between approximately 0.5 and 1.5 K above that possible with absorbed sunlight alone, resulting in an increase of about a factor of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 in Triton's basal atmospheric pressure. If Triton's internal heat flow is concentrated in some areas, as is likely, local effects such as enhanced sublimation with subsequent modification of albedo could be quite large. Furthermore, indications of recent global albedo change on Triton suggest that Triton's surface temperature and pressure may not now be in steady state, further suggesting that atmospheric pressure on Triton was as much as ten times higher in the recent past."
https://openalex.org/W2018565625,"The interaction with matter of nitrogen ions in the 3.9-billion-electron-volt (Gev) beam of the Princeton Particle Accelerator has been studied. In polyethylene, the range of ions is 12.6 +/- 0.2 grams per square centimeter and the mean free path for nuclear collisions is 15.4 +/- 3.8 centimeters; the loss of energy by the ions passing through polyethylene agrees with that predicted by stopping-power theory. The production of secondary particles has been investigated. These data are useful for experiments and for evaluating the merits of nitrogen ions in biomedical application."
https://openalex.org/W2105394276,"Eastern red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens, Salamandridae) are rarely attacked by leeches. This protection is not shared by related salamandrids or by Ambystoma (Ambystomatidae). Tetrodotoxin is not the repellent. The immunity of Notophthalmus to leech parasitism is probably most significant in its aquatic stages, although the terrestrial efts are also protected."

https://openalex.org/W2061281469,130 scientists met in a conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health to review current research on the regulation of mammalian reproduction. Major topics were 1) how the pituitary function could be regulated 2) how sperm production might be regulated; 3) the process and possible points of intervention in sperm maturation and fertilization; 4) the biology of the ovum; 5) the mechanism of action by which gametes are transported in the Fallopian tubes; and 6) the effect of corpus luteum function. Among findings which appear promising are (1) data which suggests the administration of estrogens might induce ovulation at a time when the endometrium is not prepared for implantation; 2) sperm maturation in the epididymis seems to require a certain hormonal ambience which if changed could have a reversible anti-fertility effect; 3) the fallopian tubes may also require a certain hormonal environment for normal reproductive function and may be an end ocrine target for disrupting the reproductive function; 4) data from some species indicates there is a uterine luteolytic factor which could be developed for use in human fertility control.(AUTHORS MODIFIED)

https://openalex.org/W1985234725,"A nationally celebrated team of scientists this week announced a discovery that may change the face of the 1973 budget now in preparation, and may even advance the frontiers of knowledge as well. Because of the dilatory schedule of academic journals (none of which could guarantee publication before the week after next), the scientists were obliged to publish their results in the form of a press release, together with high quality micrographs which were distributed to those attending the press conference. Following is a transcript of the press conference held this week at the Center for Duplicative Results."
