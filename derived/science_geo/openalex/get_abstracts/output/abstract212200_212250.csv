https://openalex.org/W2057814407,"22 October issue presents the wildly improbable coincidence of containing both a letter about parapsychology and spontaneous cases (p. 436) and a spontaneous case. For on page 463, as part of my comments on the 1965 Nobel Laureates in Medicine or Physiology, there appears the phrase The operator ‘loses’. . ., though what I had actually written was The operator ‘closes’.... Now since I happen to have some doubts about the validity of the operator concept, doubts that I certainly would not consciously have wished to introduce on this happy occasion [though I did voice them earlier in Science 144, 816 (1964)], this strange error can be explained only as a Freudian slip by a member of the editorial staff of Science acting under the telekinetic influence of an author9s psyche."
https://openalex.org/W2042132060,"The hemopoietic cells from anemic mice of genotype WWv are less able by 200-fold to take part in colony formation in the spleen than cells from the normal littermates of genotype ww. The genetic defect shows itself in the colony-forming cells, since cells from normal littermate mice form colonies in the spleens of unirradiated mice of genotype WWv. Use of animals of genotype WWv as recipients improves the spleen-colony method by removing bias resulting from the death of irradiated recipients."
https://openalex.org/W1978099366,Equations based on the assumption of a reversible first step in the reaction between organophosphate inhibitors and esterases are proposed for the bimolecular rate constant which now includes an affinity constant and a phosphorylation constant. The treatment applies when the inhibition reaction follows first-order kinetics.

https://openalex.org/W2093370136,"A type of excitatory synaptic transmission which is novel for the vertebrate brain has been found in the ner neuron (M-cell) by means of the passive spread of their action currents across the synaptic membrane. After stimulating the ipsilateral eighth cranial nerve, an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) appears in the M-cell with a latency which is very brief ( about 0.1 msec) and which proba; bly represents a negligible synaptic delay. This response is attributed to the club endings: there were steep gradients of potential along the lateral dendrite of the M-cell during activity and the early EPSP was maximal in the distal part of the dendrite where the club endings predominate. Potential changes in the M-cell spread (passively) backwards into certain eighth-nerve fibers (probably club endings) indicating the presence of special low-resistance connections between them and the M-cell."

https://openalex.org/W2007453609,"The length of the DNA molecules from wild-type lambda bacteriophage is 17.2 micro, corresponding to a molecular weight of 33 million in the B form. The molecules from a double-deletion mutant of lambda are 23 percent shorter. Both types of molecules join ends at 60 degrees C to form circular molecules or polymers. The point of junction cannot be distinguished by any irregularity in the uniform duplex molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2009061673,The specific activity of the citrate cleavage enzyme is 3.3 times greater in livers of obese mice than in livers of their nonobese litter mates. The difference persists during starvation. The specific activity of the acetate activating enzyme is approximately the same in the livers of both types of animals. It is proposed that a high activity of citrate cleavage enzyme is one of the factors responsible for obesity.
https://openalex.org/W2056376954,"Serums obtained from paired humans following reciprocal fourthset skin homografts, or from a prolonged series of reciprocal intradermalinjections of leukocytes, displayed potent cytotoxic activity againstlymphocytes of certain individuals and no activity against lymphocytes of other persons. Study of one family suggested that lymphocyte reactivity may be transmitted according to simple Mendelian genetics. Itis probable that this reactivity reflects and can be used to identifyspecific histocompatibility antigens in man."

https://openalex.org/W2025396059,"Bone marrow from normal and polycythemic mice was filtered through glasswool columns to remove cells other than ""lymphocytes."" For a given number of nucleated cells, filtered marrow was more efficient than the original marrow in repopulating the spleen of an isogenic recipient previously exposed to lethal irradiation. The proliferative capacity of both the filtered and unfiltered marrow suspensions appeared to be a constant function of the number of small and medium ""lymphocytes"" present and not of any other cell type."
https://openalex.org/W2043717542,"Sterols of fungal, plant, and animal origin induced sexual reproduction in Pythium periplocum and Phytophthora megasperma var. sojae and the formation of large zoosporangia in Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae. Some sterols, especially cholesterol, stimulated growth."
https://openalex.org/W2060505125,"After the injection of L-lysine and uniformly labeled L-lysine-carbon-14 into the rat, labeled homocitrulline and homoarginine are found in the liver and kidney. The ingestion of lysine by seven normal adults results in an increased urinary excretion of homocitrulline and homoarginine. These data suggest the occurrence of an unreported metabolic pathway for lysine in the rat and man."

Prolonged exposure to concentrated potassium citrate or potassium tartrate solutions caused lysis of the virus; the resulting products, having different densities, separated on the density gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2062990697,"Pups of both the California and Stellar sea lions have no intestinal enzymes for hydrolysis of sucrose, lactose, cellobiose, or trehalose. If these animals were given lactose or sucrose, they developed severe fermentative diarrhea and weight loss similar to the clinical syndrome encountered in infants with either hereditary or acquired intolerance to disaccharides. quired intolerance to disaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2090310946,"A peculiar sweetish odor was noted in the exhaled breath of cats treated with dimethylsulfoxide. By means of gas chromatographic and mass spectrographic techniques, the responsible compound was identified as dimethylsilfid."
https://openalex.org/W1998986810,"Flow transducers were surgically implanted on the terminal aorta of five monkeys. A classical conditioning procedure, in which a light preceded a brief shock, was superimposed upon a variable-interval schedule of food reinforcement for key pressing (three monkeys) and alternated with an avoidanceschedule of shock reinforcement for key pressing (two monkeys). Suppression of the rate of the response of key pressing and sizable increase in blood flow and heart rate during the light were obtained for all animals."
https://openalex.org/W2015729461,"The blue-green algal virus LPP-1 was concentrated by ultrafiltration and purified by density-gradient and differential centrifugation. The virus contains DNA and has a sedimentation coefficient of 548S. Electron micrographs of purified viral preparations show that the polyhedral particles have short tails, which are approximately one-fourth as long as the diameter of the head. Data presented in this report indicate that the blue-green algal virus more closely resembles bacteriophages than viruses infecting higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W2031522566,"Observers made numerical judgments of the apparent viscosities of silicone liquids whose absolute viscosities ranged from 10.3 to 95,000 centipoises. Judgments were made by three procedures: shaking or turning a bottle containing the liquid, stirring the liquid with a rod with the eyes blindfolded, and stirring with the eyes open. For all these methods of judging, apparent viscosity was found to grow as the absolute viscosity raised to a fractional power. The exponents ranged from 0.42 to 0.46. The perception of viscosity follows the psychophysical power law that seems to govern prothetic perceptual continua."

https://openalex.org/W2021852473,"Serotonin deficiency induced in newborn mice and maintained to adulthoodresulted in reduced ability to learn a maze. The serotonin deficiency was produced by overloading with phenylalanine plus tyrosine (to cause phenylketonuria), by feeding of reserpine, and by feeding of chlorpro mazine from birth to maturity."
https://openalex.org/W2067948043,"The relationship between smoking and pulmonary emphysema was explored in 71 autopsies, by correlating Gough-Wentworth lung macrosections with smoking histories. An increasing percentage of smokers was found with each increment of emphysema. Particularly close relationship was observed between centrilobular emphysema and smoking. No definite association was found between smoking and panlobular emphysema."
https://openalex.org/W1982121987,Immunofluorescent staining of the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with and without neurological disease demonstrates an affinity of the gamma-globulin fraction for glial cells and myelin sheaths in normal human nervous tissue. This affinity appears to be specific for the 7S gamma-globulin fraction and is not seen with the other major protein fractions of serum and cerebrospinal fluid or with the fluorescein conjugated antisera alone.

https://openalex.org/W1979769507,A technique has been developed for the in vivo measurement of absorption of calcium in man after oral administration of 1 to 5 microcuries of calcium-47 and continuous counting of the radiation in the subject's arm with a large volume liquid scintillation counter. The maximum value for the arm counting technique is proportional to the absorption of tracer as measured by direct stool analysis. The rate of uptake by the arm is lower in subjects with either the malabsorption syndrome or hypoparathyroidism. The administration of vitamin D increases both the absorption rate and the maximum amount of calcium absorbed.
https://openalex.org/W1973784472,"Characteristic antigen-antibody interactions in agar gel were obtained in 50 to 90 minutes in an electrical field with microgram quantities of three plant viruses, which were either in purified form or in crude plant juice. The method was faster and more senstive than agar-gel diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2007673508,"The half-life of the body water pool in cattle is unusually short, relative to their body size. The short half-life is not due to milk formation, since the same result is observed in nonlactating cattle as in cattle producing 23 kg (50 lb) of milk per day."
https://openalex.org/W2031535177,"The decreased solubility of a gastropod hemocyanin in the region of the isoelectric point has been correlated with a sharp increase in light scattering produced by the protein in solution. Electron microscopic observations on negatively stained spray preparations in the isoelectric region demonstrated that the formation of linear polymers of the molecule underlies both the increase in light scattering as well as the decreased solubility of the protein. While the linear polymerization produces chains of varying length with no evidence of interaction between chains, the polymerization proceeds with a high degree of ordering of individual molecules. On either side of the isoelectric region of this hemocyanin two forms of molecules are present, rectangular and circular. The rectangular molecules polymerize in an end-to-end fashion in the isoelectric region. The rectangular molecules which participate in the polymerization appear to be divided perpendicularly to their length into three major segments."
https://openalex.org/W2084126266,"The activity of a particulate succinate cytochrome c reductase is inhibited by antimycin, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, 2-(9-cyclohexyl-n-nonyl)-3-hydroxy-1,4naphthoquinone and thenoyltrifluoroacetone. The ratio of antimycin A (required for complete inhibition) to the molar content of the cytochrome b of the reductase is approximately 0.5 in contrast to the reported value of 1.0 or higher for succinate oxidase preparations. However, the degreeof inhibition by antimycin is dependent on the exogenous coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) present. Indeed, the inhibition from any of these compounds is competitively reversed by exogenous coenzyme Q in the system."
https://openalex.org/W2162957161,"Information concerning body temperature was recorded by radio transmission from within a dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, swimming freely in a pool. The temperature varied according to the activity of the animal and appeared to oscillate when the dolphin was returned to the pool after a brief period outside it. The transmitter was passed approximately 17 hours after it had been swallowed. A new type of antenna was used with the circuit. The transmitter can be adapted for telemetering heart beat, movement, aquatic animals."
https://openalex.org/W2071382854,"The filaments of Leucothrix mucor are able to form true knots under certain cultural conditions. Such structures have apparently not been previously seen in filamentous organisms. As the culture ages, the knots become tighter and eventually the cells in the knot region fuse and form a large bulb. The filament breaks on each side of the bulb, and two shorter filaments anda free bulb are produced. The free bulbs have not been observed to grow into new filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2074029251,"Adult guinea pigs develop a delayed hypersensitivity to intradermally injected neoarsphenamine. If the animals are treated intravenously with high doses of this compound before sensitization, a specific and permanent immunological tolerance develops. Permanent tolerance is also obtained in previously sensitized animals when an intravenous injection of neoarsphenamine isfollowed 6 hours later by an intradermal one. When, however, the interval between the two injections is extended to 7 or 14 days, no tolerance is observed."
https://openalex.org/W2090610976,"The binding of serotonin to nerve-ending particles and other preparations from rat brain has been examined. By investigating the amount bound as a function of serotonin concentration from 10-7M to 10-2M, it was possible to identify three major components having Kassoc (association constant) values of 2 × 106, 5 × 104, and 5 × 102. The component having the highest binding constant was not present in liver and appeared to be confined to the cortex and midbrain regions. This component is inhibited by d-lysergic acid diethylamide at low concentrations. Solubilization of this binding component has been achieved."

https://openalex.org/W1994860991,"A transfer RNA molecule accepts a particular amino acid from an activating enzyme and subsequently transfers it to the end of a growing peptide chain, in association with ribosomes and messenger RNA. The acceptor and transfer functions of transfer RNA differ in their sensitivity to damage by bromination, and thus appear to comprise different areas on the transfer RNA molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1994996074,"The standard The standard procedures Glucostat method and Fiske-Subbarowphosphorus determination-are inadequate for the assay of glucose-6-phosphatase activity in Ehrlich ascites cells. Therefore, RNA induction of this enzyme in ascites cells, even if it occurs, cannot be demonstrated by thefe procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2039648898,The sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) inhibits the agglutination of horseshoe crab hemocytes. The inhibitory action is neutralized by adding cysteine to the NEM before it is mixed with the hemolymph. This new method for arresting horseshoe crab hemocyte agglutination suggests the participation of sulfhydryl groups in the process.
https://openalex.org/W2002560313,"The half-wave potentials of all-trans beta-carotene, all-trans retinol, 13-cis retinol, all-trans retinyl acetate, all-trans retinal, and vitamins D(2) and D(3) were related to the number of double bonds in conjugation. A minimum of three double bonds in conjugation was required before reduction took place at the dropping-mercury electrode. As the number of conjugated bonds increased in the fat-soluble vitamins, the initial reduction took place at a lower half-wave potential. All of the waves were linearly proportional to the concentration of the vitamins in the concentration range studied."
https://openalex.org/W2003521526,"IN recent investigations1 a sialoprotein was isolated from bovine cortical bone and some similarities with the orosomucoid (α1-acid glycoprotein)2 of bovine plasma were noted. It was considered to be of some interest, therefore, to compare these two substances under similar conditions of isolation and analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1984653982,"A differential effect of actinomycin D on the capacity of mouse peritoneal fluid cells to form antibody after cell transfer has been found. Actinomycin treatment in vitro during transfer inhibited the delayed response toward a first antigen, administered before transfer, while the competence of cells to respond to a second antigen, given aftertransfer, was not affected."
https://openalex.org/W2042593515,"During the summer of 1963 people at five villages above the Arctic Circle in Alaska were measured for accumulated radioactivity with a portable whole-body counter. Adults of the interior village of Anaktuvuk Pass showed the highest average body burden, 628 nanocuries of cesium-137. This is an increase of nearly 50 percent over the summer before. The maximum burden foundwas 1.24 microcuries."
