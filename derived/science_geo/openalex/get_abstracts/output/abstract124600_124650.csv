https://openalex.org/W2077861409,"A vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA species containing exons 1-6 and 8 of the VEGF gene was found to be expressed as a major VEGF mRNA form in several cell lines derived from carcinomas of the female reproductive system. This mRNA is predicted to encode a VEGF form of 145 amino acids (VEGF145). Recombinant VEGF145 induced the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and promoted angiogenesis in vivo VEGF145 was compared with previously characterized VEGF species with respect to interaction with heparin-like molecules, cellular distribution, VEGF receptor recognition, and extracellular matrix (ECM) binding ability. VEGF145 shares with VEGF165 the ability to bind to the KDR/flk-1 receptor of endothelial cells. It also binds to heparin with an affinity similar to that of VEGF165. However, VEGF145 does not bind to two additional endothelial cell surface receptors that are recognized by VEGF165 but not by VEGF121. VEGF145 is secreted from producing cells as are VEGF121 and VEGF165. However, VEGF121 and VEGF165 do not bind to the ECM produced by corneal endothelial cells, whereas VEGF145 binds efficiently to this ECM. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-depleted ECM containing bound VEGF145 induces proliferation of endothelial cells, indicating that the bound VEGF145 is active. The mechanism by which VEGF145 binds to the ECM differs from that of bFGF. Digestion of the ECM by heparinase inhibited the binding of bFGF to the ECM and released prebound bFGF, whereas the binding of VEGF145 was not affected by heparinase digestion. It therefore seems that VEGF145 possesses a unique combination of biological properties distinct from those of previously characterized VEGF species.

The amino acids encoded by exon 8 are also present in all the VEGF splice variants. The VEGF isoforms are distinguished by the presence or the absence of the peptides encoded by exons 6 and 7 of the VEGF gene. VEGF121 is 121 amino acids long and lacks both exons. VEGF165 contains the exon 7-encoded peptide, whereas VEGF189 contains both exon 6- and exon 7-encoded peptides (6Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Poltorak Z. Tessler S. Gengrinovitch S. Levi B.

VEGF121 and VEGF165 promote angiogenesis, cause permeabilization of blood vessels, and induce proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (10Kondo S. Matsumoto T. Yokoyama Y. Ohmori I. Suzuki H.

VEGF189 has not yet been purified, but studies with cells expressing VEGF189 indicate that it may induce endothelial cell proliferation (8Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J.

Low levels of a mRNA corresponding in size to a mRNA encoding a putative VEGF variant of 145 amino acids (VEGF145) containing exon 6 but lacking exon 7 were detected previously in reverse PCR experiments, but the protein encoded by this mRNA has not yet been characterized (15Charnock-Jones S.D.

The different VEGF isoforms differ in their heparin binding ability. VEGF121 does not bind to heparin, whereas VEGF165 and VEGF189 do (8Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol.

The heparin binding affinity of VEGF189 was reported to be higher than that of VEGF165, suggesting that exon 6 contributes to the heparin binding ability of VEGF189 (8Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF165 and VEGF121 are secreted efficiently from producing cells and do not bind efficiently to the ECM produced by CEN4 cells (8Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol.

In contrast, VEGF189 is retained on the cell surface and in the ECM, from which it can be released by prolonged incubation with heparin. (9Park J.E. Keller G.A. Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The peptide encoded by exon 7 also seems to affect the receptor recognition patterns of VEGF isoforms. VEGF121 recognizes a single VEGF receptor in endothelial cells that was identified as the KDR/flk-1 VEGF receptor (20Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C.

VEGF165 also binds to this receptor but recognizes two additional VEGF receptors of unknown structure that are found in endothelial cells and in several transformed cell types (21Gitay-Goren H.

We have observed that VEGF145 is one of the main VEGF isoforms expressed by several cell lines derived from carcinomas of the female reproductive system. We have characterized VEGF145 and have compared its biological properties with those of other VEGF forms. Recombinant VEGF145 expressing the exon 6-derived peptide binds to heparin but behaves like VEGF121 with regard to its receptor recognition ability. In contrast to VEGF121 and VEGF165, it binds to a basement membrane like ECM produced by corneal endothelial cells in a biologically active form. VEGF145 therefore represents a VEGF form possessing distinct biological characteristics. Human recombinant VEGF165 and VEGF121 were purified from Sf-9 insect cells, whereas recombinant human bFGF was produced in bacteria as described previously (19Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Sharon R.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against VEGF165 (23Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Neufeld G. Levi B. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and a mouse monoclonal IgM antibody (M-35) directed against full-length VEGF165 were produced in our laboratory using standard techniques. Heparinases type I, II, and III were kindly donated by Dr. J. Zimermann (Ibex Technologies, Montreal, Canada). The bicystronic mammalian expression vector MIRB was kindly provided to us by Dr. Craig MacArthur (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) (25MacArthur C.A. Lawshe A. Shankar D.B. Heikinheimo M. Shackleford G.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 817-825PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody clone 26503.11 and peroxidase- and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Sigma. Disuccinimidyl suberate was from Pierce. Sodium alginate was from Fluka. Heparin-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. 125I-Sodium was obtained from New England Nuclear. Anti-mouse IgM antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were from Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Tissue culture plasticware was from Nunc, and 96-well dishes for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were bought from Corning. Grace's medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other tissue culture reagents were from Biological Industries Inc. (Kibbutz Beth Haemek, Israel). Total mRNA was prepared from OC-238 human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells (26Maymon R. Maymon B.B. Holzinger M. Tartakovsky B. Leibovici J. Gynecol. Oncol. 1994; 55: 265-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 300 ng of total RNA using oligo(dT) as a primer and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. PCR amplification was carried out in the presence of a [32P]dCTP tracer (2 μCi in a 100-μl reaction volume), 1 mM of each dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. 25 amplification cycles were used, each consisting of a 1-min incubation at 94°C, a 2-min incubation at 65°C, and a 3-min incubation at 72°C. The VEGF-specific oligonucleotides used were GGAGAGATGAGCTTCCTACAG and TCACCGCCTTGGCTTGTCACA, corresponding to amino acids 92-98 and to the six carboxyl-terminal amino acids of VEGF, respectively. A pair of primers from the L19 ribosomal protein were included in the reactions as an internal control. Amplified fragments were resolved in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and were visualized by autoradiography. The band corresponding to the VEGF145 mRNA (see Fig. 1B) was excised, reamplified, and sequenced. A similar procedure using different primers was used to detect VEGF145 mRNA in A431 and HeLa cells. The VEGF-specific primers used here were derived from the 5′ of the coding region (amino acids 13-20) and from the 3′ region encompassed by the last 6 amino acids of VEGF including the translation stop codon of the VEGF sequence. In order to produce recombinant VEGF145, we prepared a VEGF145 cDNA construct by deleting the oligonucleotides encoded by exon 7 out of the VEGF189 cDNA. Primers used to amplify exons 1-6 of the VEGF cDNA were the external primer GCTTCCGGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGG, corresponding to a puc118 sequence, and the internal primer ACGCTCCAGGACTTATACCGGGA, corresponding to a sequence at the 3′ end of exon 6. Primers used to amplify the 3′ end of the VEGF cDNA were complementary to the puc118 sequence GGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTC and to the 3′ end of the exon 6 sequence (underlined) and to the start of exon 8 (ATGTGACAAGCCGAGGCGGTGA). Following amplification, the PCR products were precipitated, and the products were reamplified using only the puc118-derived external primers. The product was gel purified, subcloned into the PCR-II vector, and sequenced using the sequenase-II kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. This cDNA was further used for protein expression studies. The VEGF145 cDNA was subcloned into the BamHI site of the MIRB expression vector (25MacArthur C.A. Lawshe A. Shankar D.B. Heikinheimo M. Shackleford G.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 817-825PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfection into BHK-21 cells and selection with 0.6 mg/ml G418, VEGF145-expressing cells were identified using anti-VEGF antibodies. The VEGF145 cDNA was also subcloned into the transfer plasmid pVL-1393 (Invitrogen) downstream from the polyhedrin promoter to yield pVL-1393/v145. This plasmid and baculovirus wild type DNA were co-transfected into Sf9 cells using the calcium-phosphate co-precipitation method, and recombinant baculoviruses were isolated as described (23Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Neufeld G. Levi B. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). VEGF145 was produced in Sf9 cells as described for VEGF165 (23Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Neufeld G. Levi B. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium contained approximately 5 mg of VEGF145/liter. The conditioned medium was concentrated by precipitation with 70% ammonium sulfate at 4°C for 12 h. The precipitate was solubilized in 20 mM Tris, pH 7, and 0.1 M NaCl, dialyzed extensively against this buffer at 4°C, and applied to a heparin-Sepharose column. The column was washed with the same buffer containing 0.3 M salt, followed by elution with the same buffer containing 0.8 M NaCl. A small residual amount also eluted at 2 M NaCl. The 0.8 M salt eluant was further purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on an Applied Biosystems Brownlee C-8 column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (20-80%) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. VEGF145 was eluted at 48% acetonitrile. The trifluoroacetic acid in the eluant was neutralized using Tris base, and the acetonitrile was removed using a SpeedVac evaporator at room temperature. Increasing concentrations of VEGF in 50 μl of coating buffer (20 mM K2HPO4, 10 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.8% NaCl, pH 7.2) were adsorbed to 96-well dishes for 3 h at 25°C. Free VEGF was aspirated, and the wells were blocked with coating buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The wells were extensively washed with wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with the anti-VEGF M-35 monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 25°C, washed again, and incubated for 1 h with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. After final washing, the amount of bound antibody was determined using para-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate. Human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (HUVECs) were prepared from umbilical veins and cultured as described previously in M199 medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, vitamins, 1 ng/ml bFGF, and antibiotics (21Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B.-Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol.

Bovine corneal endothelial (BCE) cells were isolated from steer eyes and cultured as described previously (28Neufeld G. Gospodarowicz D. J. Cell Physiol. 1987; 132: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ECM-coated dishes were prepared from cells grown in the presence or the absence of 30 mM chlorate as described previously (28Neufeld G. Gospodarowicz D. J.

The binding and the cross-linking of 125I-VEGF165 to confluent layers of HUVECs grown in 5-cm dishes in the presence or the absence of various competitors was done essentially as described. VEGF165 was purified from infected Sf9 cells and iodinated as described (19Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Sharon R. Shibuya M. Halaban R. Levi B.-Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol.

The ECM-coated wells were washed with rinse buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). Nonspecific sites were blocked with binding buffer (20 mM K2HPO4, 10 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.8% NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2) for 1 h at room temperature. The binding buffer was aspirated and iodinated, or unlabeled growth factors were incubated with the ECM-coated wells in binding buffer for 2 h at 24°C. Free growth factors were removed by aspiration, and the ECM was washed twice with rinse buffer. In binding experiments, 0.2 N NaOH was added to dissociate bound growth factors, and aliquots were counted in a γ counter or neutralized using Tris base and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Alternatively, the wells were further incubated with various anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies in binding buffer for 2 h and washed. Bound antibody was detected with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline-phosphatase, using para-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate. Our M-35 anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody and commercial anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies produced identical results in these assays. For biological activity experiments, 15,000 HUVECs were seeded on ECM containing various amounts of adsorbed VEGF in a final volume of 1 ml of growth medium. Cells were trypsinized and counted after 3 days in a coulter counter. All experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. Reverse PCR analysis of mRNA from OC-238 human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells (Fig. 1B), HeLa cells, and A431 cells (Fig. 1C) detected a VEGF mRNA containing a coding region smaller than that of VEGF165 but larger than that of VEGF121. The size of the coding region corresponded to the expected size of a mRNA encoding a VEGF form containing exons 1-6 and 8 and should lead to the production of a VEGF form containing 145 amino acids (VEGF145) (15Charnock-Jones S.D. Sharkey A.M. Rajput-Williams J. Burch D. Schofield J.P. Fountain S.A. Boocock C. Smith S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 1120-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In all these cell lines the VEGF145 cDNA seemed to be expressed at levels comparable with those of VEGF165. The VEGF145 mRNA was not detected in several other transformed cell lines including C6 glioma cells and U937 cells. Sequence analysis of the PCR product from the OC-238 cells showed that this mRNA was indeed generated by alternative splicing and that it contains exons 6 and 8 but not exon 7 of the VEGF gene. To study the properties of VEGF145, we have expressed the VEGF145 cDNA in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (23Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Neufeld G. Levi B. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most of the VEGF145 produced by the infected Sf9 cells was found in the conditioned medium as a homodimer of ∼41 kDa, with small amounts of monomeric VEGF145 (Fig. 2B). The VEGF145 dimers dissociated into monomers upon reduction with dithiotreitol (Fig. 2A). VEGF145 was partially purified by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. VEGF145 was eluted from heparin-Sepharose columns using a stepwise salt gradient. Most of the VEGF145 eluted at 0.6-0.7 M NaCl, indicating that the heparin binding affinity of VEGF145 is similar to that of VEGF165 (data not shown) (17Gospodarowicz D. Abraham J.A. Schilling J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7311-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 23Cohen T. Gitay-Goren H. Neufeld G. Levi B. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The recombinant VEGF145 was biologically active and induced the proliferation of HUVECs. The ED50 of VEGF145 was 30 ng/ml, whereas VEGF165 was 6-fold more active than VEGF145 in this assay (Fig. 3).Fig. 3VEGF145 stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells. HUVECs were seeded in 24-well dishes (20,000 cells/well), and increasing concentrations of VEGF121 (⋄), VEGF145 (▪), and VEGF165 (□) were added every other day as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were counted in a Coulter counter after 4 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether VEGF145 can induce angiogenesis in vivo, the VEGF145 cDNA was subcloned into the BamHI site of the mammalian bicystronic expression vector MIRB (25MacArthur C.A. Lawshe A. Shankar D.B. Heikinheimo M. Shackleford G.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 817-825PubMed Google Scholar). The MIRB/VEGF145 plasmid was transfected into BHK-21 cells (31Neufeld G. Mitchell R. Ponte P. Gospodarowicz D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and stable cell lines producing VEGF145 were isolated. The VEGF145 produced by the mammalian cells was biologically active and was secreted into the growth medium. A stable clone producing 0.1 μg of VEGF145 per 106 cells was isolated. The VEGF145 expressing cells were embedded in alginate beads, and the beads were implanted under the skin of BALB/c mice (32Plunkett M.L. Hailey J.A. Lab. Invest. 1990; 62: 510-517PubMed Google Scholar). The pellets containing the alginate beads were removed after 4 days and photographed. Clusters of alginate beads containing VEGF145 expressing cells were dark red with blood, whereas beads containing cells transfected with vector alone had a much lower content of blood (Fig. 4). When examined under higher magnification, pellets containing VEGF145 producing cells appeared much more vascularized than pellets containing control cells. 125I-VEGF165 forms high molecular weight complexes with three types of VEGF receptors following cross-linking to HUVECs (Fig. 5, lane 1), whereas 125I-VEGF121 only binds to the larger of these receptors. The common receptor to which both VEGF121 and VEGF165 bind is the KDR/flk-1 VEGF receptor (Fig. 5, open arrow) (21Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B.-Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In order to compare the receptor recognition pattern of VEGF145 with those of VEGF165, 125I-VEGF165 was bound to HUVECs in the presence of 1 μg/ml of heparin and increasing concentrations of VEGF145. Bound 125I-VEGF165 was subsequently covalently cross-linked to the VEGF receptors. VEGF145 inhibited the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to the KDR/flk-1 receptor of the HUVECs (Fig. 5). This result was verified in a cell-free binding experiment in which VEGF145 competed with 125I-VEGF165 for binding to a soluble fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of the flk-1 receptor (data not shown) (33Tessler S.

In contrast, VEGF145 did not effectively inhibit the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to the two smaller VEGF receptors of the HUVECs (Fig. 5, filled arrow), indicating that the affinity of VEGF145 toward these two receptors is substantially lower than that of VEGF165. This behavior resembles the behavior of VEGF121 (21Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B.-Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and indicates that the presence of exon 6 is not sufficient to enable efficient binding of VEGF145 to these two receptors, despite the heparin binding properties that exon 6 confers on VEGF145. VEGF189 binds efficiently to the ECM produced by CEN4 cells, whereas VEGF165 binds to it very weakly (9Park J.E. Keller G.A. Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The fact that VEGF189 binds heparin with high affinity led to the suggestion that the interaction of VEGF189 with the ECM is mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (8Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Park J.E. Keller G.A. Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The heparin binding affinities of VEGF145 and VEGF165 are similar and substantially lower than the heparin binding affinity of VEGF189 (8Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore expected VEGF145 to bind poorly to ECM. Unexpectedly, experiments in which VEGF145 was bound to an ECM produced by bovine corneal endothelial cells (28Neufeld G. Gospodarowicz D. J.

In these experiments the binding was monitored with anti-VEGF antibodies, but similar results were obtained when binding to the ECM was assayed directly using 125I-VEGF145 (30 ng/ml) or 125I-VEGF165 (50 ng/ml) (Fig. 6B, first and third lanes). The binding of 125I-VEGF145 to the ECM was substantially but not completely inhibited by 10 μg/ml heparin (Fig. 6B, second lane).

The structural solution was obtained by molecular replacement using superimposed polyalanine coordinates of six intracellular lipid-binding proteins as a search probe. The entire amino acid sequence of rat liver fatty acid-binding protein along with an amino-terminal formyl-methionine was modeled in the crystal structure. In addition, the crystal was obtained in the presence of oleic acid, and the initial electron density clearly showed two fatty acid molecules bound within a central cavity. The carboxylate of one fatty acid molecule interacts with arginine 122 and is shielded from free solvent. It has an overall bent conformation. The more solvent-exposed carboxylate of the other oleate is located near the helix-turn-helix that caps one end of the β-barrel, while the acyl chain lies in the interior. The cavity contains both polar and nonpolar residues but also shows extensive hydrophobic character around the nonpolar atoms of the ligands. The primary and secondary oleate binding sites appear to be totally interdependent, mainly because favorable hydrophobic interactions form between both aliphatic chains."

Tyler B.S. Boolootian R. Physiology of Echinodermata. Interscience Publication, New York1966: 683-741Google Scholar). First, males and females must synchronize the time of release of their gametes (2Starr M. Himmelman J.H. Therriault J.C. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 1992; 79: 275-287Crossref Google Scholar). Once spawned, the sperm must find and interact with an egg of the correct species. A further event necessary for successful fertilization is induction of the acrosome reaction in the sperm (3Trimmer J.S. Vacquier V.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Foltz K.R. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 46-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which involves fusion of the acrosomal vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane. This results in exocytosis of the vesicle contents, which include proteases and bindin. Concomitantly, actin in the subacrosomal region of the sperm polymerizes and causes extension of the tip of the sperm. As a consequence of these two events, bindin is localized to the outside of the tip of the process where it can then interact with an egg protein (3Trimmer J.S. Vacquier V.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Foltz K.R. Lennarz W.J. Dev.

The sea urchin egg is surrounded by a transparent gelatinous layer composed mainly of sulfated fucan, sialoprotein, and other glycoproteins or peptides (5Suzuki N. Zool. Sci. 1990; 7: 355-370Google Scholar). Previous attempts to identify the acrosome reaction inducer in sea urchin egg jelly have suggested that all the activity resides in the sulfated fucan (6SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.L. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.L. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, these authors suggested that the jelly coat preparations of some species of sea urchins are totally species-specific and induce the acrosome reaction only in homologous sperm. On the basis of these observations, it was suggested that the specificity of induction of the acrosome reaction might reside in structural differences in the carbohydrate linkages and/or location and degree of sulfation of the polysaccharide (6SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.L. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.L. Dev. Biol. 1981; 86: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that a glycoprotein or peptide, tightly associated with the sulfated fucan, was also involved in acrosome reaction induction (8Shimizu T. Kinoh H. Yamaguchi M. Suzuki N. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1990; 32: 473-487Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Mikami-Takei K. Kosakai M. Isemura M. Suyemitsu T. Ishihara K. Schmid K. Exp.

These compounds have simple, well-defined repeating structures that from each species present a particular pattern of sulfate substitution. Purified polysaccharide from the egg jelly induces the acrosome reaction in sperm from the same species of sea urchin and not from different species. This result is of considerable significance for the study of fertilization processes since it is the first time that fully described carbohydrate structures have been shown to regulate part of the process at such a specific level.CONCLUSIONSpecificity in fertilization is the result of a series of interactions between molecules located on the surfaces of the egg and of the sperm. This is especially relevant in free-spawning organisms and constitutes a barrier to prevent interspecific crosses, and consequently the formation of hybrids. It may be that the induction of acrosome reaction by sulfated polysaccharides from the egg jelly coat is the first level of recognition during fertilization in sea urchin species while the more specific interaction of egg receptor with sperm serves as a second level of recognition (4Foltz K.R. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 46-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Our results indicate that the acrosome reaction in sea urchin is mediated by sulfated polysaccharide and in fact is regulated by the structure of the saccharide chain and its sulfation pattern. This constitutes an unusually clear-cut example of a biological event regulated by sulfated polysaccharides. Variations in the structure of these polymers among the species of sea urchins may represent one of the barriers which prevent interspecific crosses.Approximately 900 species of sea urchins have been described (29Barnes R.D. Invertebrate Zoology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1980: 1001-1102Google Scholar). To act as a recognition molecule for the acrosome reaction in such a large number of species, the sulfated polysaccharides from the egg jelly must have a wide capacity for structural variation. In fact, an array of sulfated esters in the eight possible sulfation positions of the tetrasaccharide repeat units of a linear sulfated L-fucan (as those reported in Fig. 5) allows 255 combinations. Different positions of the glycosidic linkages (2-, 3-, or 4-linked), as we reported for the sulfated L-fucans from the sea urchins L. variegatus and A. lixula, increase the possible combinations to 765. In addition, the presence of sulfated L-galactan in some other species, for example E. lucunter, expands the variation possibilities for sulfated polysaccharides from the egg jelly of sea urchins.Recent studies have suggested that glycoproteins or peptides, tightly associated with the sulfated polysaccharides of the egg jelly coat, are in fact the inducers of the acrosome reaction in sea urchins (8Shimizu T. Kinoh H. Yamaguchi M. Suzuki N. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1990; 32: 473-487Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Mikami-Takei K. Kosakai M. Isemura M. Suyemitsu T. Ishihara K. Schmid K. Exp.

Vacquier V.D. Chandler D.E. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that glycoproteins or peptides would resist the drastic protease digestion conditions we have used to extract sulfated polysaccharides from the egg jelly or would remain associated with the sulfated polysaccharides at the NaCl concentration we used to elute these polymers from the DEAE-cellulose column (Fig. 1A-C). But, if this is the case, and the sulfated polysaccharides are not the inducers of the acrosome reaction but the “carriers” of glycoproteins or peptides, which directly induce the process, our proposition is still valid. That is, there is a species-specific variation in the structure of the sulfated polysaccharide from the sea urchin egg jelly coat, and these polymers are either directly involved in the induction of the acrosome reaction or are specific “carriers” of acrosome reaction-inducing molecules. We believe the relative importance of these glycoproteins or peptides and of the sulfated polysaccharides as inducers of the acrosome reaction in sea urchins requires further investigation.

In some mammals, including the rat, the high nocturnal level of AA-NAT activity is preceded by an ∼100-fold increase in AA-NAT mRNA. The increase in AA-NAT mRNA is generated by norepinephrine acting through a cAMP mechanism. Indirect evidence has suggested that cAMP enhances AA-NAT gene expression by stimulating phosphorylation of a DNA-binding protein (cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein) bound to a CRE. The nature of the sites involved in cAMP activation was investigated in this report by analyzing the AA-NAT promoter. An ∼3700-base pair fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the rat AA-NAT gene was isolated, and the major transcription start points were mapped.

The importance of transcriptional events in the regulation of AA-NAT activity varies remarkably on a species-to-species basis (8Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Baler R. Weller J.L. Namboodiri M.A.A.

The mechanism involved in turning on expression of the AA-NAT gene does not require de novo protein synthesis (9Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Baler R. McCune S.K. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Rather, it appears to be initiated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) (10Roseboom P.H. Klein D.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 439-449PubMed Google Scholar) or another member of this growing family (11Michael L.F. Alcorn J.L. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. Mol.

The molecular basis of cAMP stimulation of expression of the rat AA-NAT gene has not yet been investigated at the level of the promoter, and it is not known whether cAMP acts directly or indirectly on the AA-NAT gene. Here we describe the isolation of the rat AA-NAT promoter region and report the results of a functional analysis focused on the question of NE- and cAMP-dependent activation. The results of this study indicate that cAMP can effect gene activation from the AA-NAT promoter. Furthermore, it appears that cAMP acts through a CRE·CCAAT complex, which consists of a near-perfect CRE located within two helical turns of an inverted CCAAT box. AA-NAT promoter sequences were identified using the Promoter Finder™ DNA Walking kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in conjunction with the nested AA-NAT primers 652, 581, and 587 (see below) derived from the 5′-flanking regions of AA-NAT. The PCR conditions were recommended by the manufacturer. Genomic fragments were subcloned into pCR3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (13Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). To generate promoter/reporter hybrid constructs, different PCR-generated fragments of the AA-NAT promoter region were introduced into the XbaI site in pCAT-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) or into the NheI site in pGL3-BASIC (Promega). These vectors carry the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter genes, respectively. For S1 nuclease protection analysis, a 289-nucleotide end-labeled single-stranded probe was synthesized that was complementary to positions −207 to +82 in the AA-NAT gene (relative to the start of transcription); synthesis was by asymmetric PCR driven by primer 581 (see below). The probe was gel-purified and added (50,000 cpm) to 30 μg of total pineal RNA in 20 μl of S1 hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 40 mM Pipes, pH 6.4, 400 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8). The mixture was then denatured (10 min, 65°C) and hybridized overnight at 44°C. S1 nuclease digestion was carried out by adding 300 μl of S1 nuclease buffer (0.28 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 4.5 mM ZnSO4, 10 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 240 units of S1 nuclease). After a 1-h incubation at 37°C, 80 μl of stop buffer (4 M ammonium acetate, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8, and 40 μg/ml tRNA) were added. After ethanol precipitation, samples were boiled and electrophoresed on a 6% sequencing gel. A dideoxynucleotide sequencing reaction of −267/CAT primed with primer 581 was run in parallel to locate the transcription start point. Dissociated rat pinealocytes (5 × 106 cells) were prepared by trypsinization essentially as described (14Buda M. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 50 pineal glands (Taconic Farms Inc., Germantown, NY) were separated from residual afferent nerve fibers and the surrounding leptomeninges, partially teased apart, and rinsed in 10 ml of BGJb (Life Technologies, Inc.). Glands were incubated (37°C, 95% O2 and 5% CO2) in 5 ml of DMEM containing 0.2% trypsin and 40 μg/ml DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) for 50 min. Trypsinization was ended by the addition of 10 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (DMEM+). Partially dissociated glands were allowed to sediment and triturated in 3 ml of DMEM+ supplemented with 70 μg of DNase I. Pineal cells were passed through a small funnel-shaped mesh (125-μM opening; Bellco Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ) to a new tube, spun at 1000 × g for 5 min, and plated in two wells of a six-well plate (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) in 2 ml of DMEM+. Twenty-four hours later, cells in suspension were harvested, collected, and resuspended in serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.; ∼0.5 × 106 cells/ml); and 0.4-ml samples were transferred to individual wells in a 24-well plate (Costar Corp.). Transfections were performed by overlaying the cells with a precipitate of 3 μl of LipofectAmine™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μg of DNA for 30 min before adding ∼2 × 108 adenovirus shuttle particles to enhance transfection efficiency (15Yoshimura K. Rosenfeld M.A. Seth P. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2300-2303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eighteen hours later, 0.5 ml of DMEM+ were added. Where indicated, dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) was added to the cultures at this point. Cells were harvested 48 h later. CAT assays were performed as described (16Gorman C.M. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured with the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Transfection of primary rat pituitary cells or fibroblasts was done using the same procedure as described above. COS-7 and C6 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were transfected using LipofectAmine following the manufacturer's recommendations. The synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and primers referred to in this study were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 381B DNA synthesizer. Nested primers for promoter cloning were as follows (positions are relative to start of transcription): primer 652 (positions +177 to +158), 5′-CAT GGG TAT CTG GCC ACT GA-3′; primer 581 (positions +82 to +63), 5′-TCC CCA CCA CAG AGC TGG TCA CAC TGG-3′; and primer 587 (positions −14 to −34), 5′-CCT GAC AGC ATG TGA TGG CTC A-3′. Oligonucleotides used in EMSA and for site-directed mutagenesis were as follows (only upper strand is shown): natCRE, 5′-GAA AAG CTT AGT ACC ACC GAT GAC GCC AGC CCT CAG CAG TCT AGA GC-3′; natCREmut, 5′-GAA AAG CTT AGT ACC ACC GAT TAA ACC AGC CCT CAG CAG TCT AGA GC-3′; AP-1, 5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′; CCAAT-binding transcription factor, 5′-CCT TTG GCA TGC TGC CAA TAT-3′; sstCRE (where sst is somatostatin), 5′-AGA GAT TGC CTG ACG TCA GAG AGC TAG-3′; caCRE, 5′-GAG CCC GTG ACG TTT ACA CTC ATT C-3′; AP-2, 5′-GGA TTA TAG TTA GAC CCC AGG CTT AGC CCA TGC TCT CC-3′; CCAAT, 5′-CAG CCC TCA GCA GGA TTG GGT CAG GGC CTG ACT ACC-3′; CCAATmut1, 5′-CAG CCC TCA GCA GTC TAG AGTCAG GGC CTG ACT ACC-3′; CCAATmut2 5′-CCT CAG CAG GTATGG GTC AGG GCC T-3′; and CRECCAAT+5, 5′-GAT GACGCC AGC CCT CGA GTA AGC AGG ATTGGG TC-3′. Pineal glands were quick-frozen on dry ice. To prepare extracts, a 30-μl sample of ice-cold buffer C (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.42 M NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 5 μM sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol) was added to two glands. The glands were homogenized on ice with 20 strokes of a tight-fitting 1.5-ml microtube pestle. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 s, vortexed, and refrozen on dry ice for 5 min. They were next incubated in ice water for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. This procedure extracted 40-50 μg of soluble protein/pineal gland. EMSA was performed using a 32P-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the natCRE or natCCAAT sequence (see Fig. 1) and 3 μl of whole pineal extract as described previously (17Baler R. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27319-27325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Competition EMSA was performed as described above with a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides added before the probe or 1 μl of one of the following antisera (added 20 min after the probe): anti-c-Fos-(3-16) (SC-52X), anti-Fra-1-(3-22) (SC-183X), anti-Fra-2-(285-299) (SC-57X), anti-FosB-(102-117) (SC-48X), anti-JunD-(329-341) (SC-74X), and anti-CREM-1 (SC-440X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit anti-rat CREB-(1-205) polyclonal antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). In vitro mutagenesis of the CRE and CCAAT cis-acting elements within the AA-NAT promoter was done with the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Initial screening of putative mutant clones was performed by BsaHI and XbaI restriction endonuclease digests, respectively. Mutations were then confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Promoter fragments were subsequently excised with XbaI and inserted into an NheI-linearized pGL3-BASIC reporter vector. Putative regulatory regions in the sequence immediately upstream of the AA-NAT coding sequence were isolated using a ligation-mediated PCR-based technique as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This generated an ∼3700-bp genomic fragment that contains the first intron (intron 1; Fig. 1A) located in the 5′-untranslated region after position +114; the intron is 1628 bp long. 2R. Baler, S. Covington, and D. C. Klein, unpublished results. The 2160-bp putative promoter sequence was analyzed to determine if it contains known transcription factor-binding sites (Fig. 1A). This failed to identify a canonical TATA box; however, an A/T-rich sequence resembling a TATA box (ATTAGAAT) is located 38 bp upstream of the start of transcription, as defined below. This putative TATA box is preceded by a GC-rich region (positions −47 to −65), which could function as an SP1-binding (18Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar) and/or AP-2-binding (19Williams T. Adman A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) site. An inverted CCAAT box (natCCAAT) exists at position −120. In addition, we detected an alternate purine-pyrimidine repeat (20Hamada H. Petrino M.G. Kakunaga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6465-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) between positions −1165 and −1104, an AP-1-like element (21Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar) at position −32, and a CRE-related sequence at position −139 (natCRE). The natCRE sequence (TGACGCCA) closely resembles (seven out of eight) the perfect CRE consensus sequence ((TGACGTCA) (22Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ziff E.B. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 69-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The transcription initiation site was established using S1 nuclease protection analysis of total RNA isolated from Bt2cAMP-treated pineal glands. Three transcription start points were detected (Fig. 1B), the strongest of which generates the longest leader sequence (173 nucleotides). The leader sequences generated by the weaker start points are 148 and 136 nucleotides long. The upstream initiation site is located within an apparent initiator consensus sequence, characterized by an initiating A with a 3′-pyrimidine-rich flanking sequence (Fig. 1C) (24Corden J. Wasylyk B. Buchwalder A. Sassone-Corsi P. Kedinger C. Chambon P. Science. 1980; 209: 1405-1414Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 25Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Regions necessary and sufficient for AA-NAT promoter activity were identified using partial promoter constructs. These contained decreasing portions of the longest 5′-flanking genomic fragment placed in front of the CAT reporter gene. Primary pinealocytes were transiently transfected with this series of constructs and tested for basal and stimulated CAT activity (Fig. 2). CAT activity was low in untreated cells in all constructs. Bt2cAMP treatment produced comparable levels of CAT expression from a family of intronless promoter deletion constructs with 5′-boundaries ranging from positions −2160 to −267 and encompassing sequences up to position +82. Similar results were obtained following treatment with NE or a selective β-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol), but not following selective α-adrenergic treatment (phenylephrine + propranolol; data not shown). Maximum Bt2cAMP induction was achieved using a promoter construct that begins at position −207, spans the entire length of intron 1, and ends just prior to the first codon (−207/iCAT). However, a similar construct containing >90% of intron 1 but no 5′-untranslated region (+371/CAT) failed to drive detectable CAT enzyme activity, indicating that the key elements promoting Bt2cAMP responsiveness are not likely to reside in intron 1. Taken together, these results suggest that the region between positions −267 and +82 is sufficient for conferring cAMP responsiveness. This region contains the natCRE and natCCAAT sequences described above. The −267/CAT construct fragment was also able to drive cAMP-dependent expression of CAT when tested in non-pineal cells, including rat glioma C6, COS-7, and primary rat pituitary cell cultures (Table I). It follows that this fragment does not confer tissue specificity, nor does it require pineal gland-specific proteins to support cAMP responsiveness.Table I.The minimal AA-NAT promoter responds to increased cAMP in non-pineal cell types.Cell typeCAT activityStimulation indexBasalStimulated% conversion ± S.E.Pinealocytes0.8 ± 0.720 ± 225Pituitary cells1.3 ± 0.45 ± 1.33.8COS-7 cells2.5 ± 1.237 ± 1214.7C6 glioma cells6.3 (NA)aNA, not applicable.15.4 (NA)2.4a NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab The capacity of natCRE to recruit specific DNA-binding proteins was tested using a 30-bp-long double-stranded oligonucleotide centered around position −139; this probe does not contain the natCCAAT box. EMSA analysis revealed that this natCRE oligonucleotide formed complexes with pineal proteins (Fig. 3A). The patterns of retarded species were not dramatically different if extracts were prepared from pineal glands harvested during the day or night (data not shown), indicating that similar or identical binding proteins are present at both times. To determine if this EMSA pattern reflected specific interactions, excess unlabeled CRE-containing oligonucleotides (somatostatin or c-fos CRE) were added (Fig. 3A); this blocked the appearance of most retarded species. In contrast, excess unlabeled oligonucleotides containing either CCAAT-binding transcription factor- or AP-1-binding sites did not alter this pattern. Accordingly, formation of these complexes is CRE-dependent. To test for the presence of specific transcription factors among the proteins associated with natCRE, selected antisera were used (Fig. 3A, lanes 6-12). An anti-CREB antiserum modified the EMSA pattern by preventing the formation of two nucleoprotein complexes (asterisks). However, antisera directed against several bZIP-containing transcription factors, belonging to the Fos, Jun, and CREM families, did not. Taken together, these results indicate that natCRE can specifically interact with several pineal proteins, including a CREB-like protein(s). The function of the natCRE sequence was tested by site-directed mutagenesis in the context of the minimal promoter construct −267/CAT. The mutation involved three base changes (TGACGCCA→TTAAACCA), including a G/T transversion at position −141, which disrupts CRE function (26Sassone-Corsi P. Visvader J. Ferland L. Mellon P.L. Verma M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The triple mutation abolished binding to specific nuclear proteins (data not shown). In transfection studies using primary pinealocytes, the CREmut/CAT reporter construct partially reduced the response to Bt2cAMP (60-80% inhibition) (Fig. 3B) as compared with the response exhibited by the unmutated control. The possibility that this apparent inhibition was due to uncontrolled reporter gene-dependent artifacts was ruled out using equivalent firefly luciferase constructs, indicating that the triple mutation partially reduced effects of cAMP (Fig. 4B, wt/LUC versus CREmut/LUC). The above results indicate that natCRE plays a key role in translating the adrenergic stimulus into an increase in AA-NAT gene transcription, consistent with predictions regarding the role of CREB phosphorylation in activation of the rat AA-NAT gene (10Roseboom P.H. Klein D.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 439-449PubMed Google Scholar). However, a discrepancy is apparent: the triple natCRE mutation completely abolished binding, but only partially abolished the effects of Bt2cAMP on promoter activity. This raised the possibility that cAMP-mediated gene activation requires another element(s) in the −267 construct. The basis of this residual responsiveness was examined below. As indicated above, an inverted CCAAT box is located downstream and two helical turns away from natCRE. The CCAAT box is of special interest because of two observations: a CRE·CCAAT complex in the fibronectin gene promoter is necessary for full cAMP activation of gene expression (27Muro A.F. Bernath V.A. Kornblihtt A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Srebrow A. Muro A.F. Werbajh S. Sharp P.A. Kornblihtt A.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22271-22279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and an inverted CCAAT box mediates cAMP activation of expression of the apparently CRE-less tryptophan hydroxylase promoter in primary pinealocytes (30Boularand S. Darmon M.C. Ravassard P. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3757-3764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To test whether natCCAAT binds pineal proteins, we analyzed the region containing the inverted natCCAAT sequence by EMSA using whole pineal protein extracts. The double-stranded oligonucleotide used did not contain natCRE. A distinct nucleoprotein complex was generated using either day or night pineal extracts. Proteins in this complex are referred to here as CCAAT-binding proteins (CATBPs) (Fig. 4A). Binding specificity was demonstrated by successful competition with a 200-fold molar excess of the wild-type natCCAAT sequence (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 7 and 8). In contrast, binding was not inhibited by double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either of two mutated natCCAAT oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A, lanes 9 and 10) or by AP-2 or AP-1 sequences (lanes 11 and 12). These studies indicate that natCCAAT specifically binds to pineal CATBPs. The contribution of the natCCAAT site to gene expression was determined by site-directed mutagenesis of position −120 within the minimal promoter (construct −267) using the firefly luciferase reporter system. Promoter activity of the resulting construct (CCAATmut/LUC) was reduced by 60-80% when compared with that obtained using wt/LUC and CREmut/LUC (Fig. 4B). These observations raise the possibility that both natCRE and natCCAAT are important for inducible promoter activity. To determine whether both sites are required to achieve full transactivation, we generated a double mutant without functional natCRE and natCCAAT sites ((CRECCAAT)mut/LUC). Whereas the single mutant constructs CREmut/LUC and CCAATmut/LUC were partially active, the double mutant (CRECCAAT)mut/LUC was essentially refractory to cAMP stimulation (Fig. 4B). This supports the interpretation that both sites participate in cAMP regulation of the AA-NAT gene. When the natCRE and natCCAAT sites are considered within the context of coiled DNA, their centers are separated by approximately two turns of a helix and are therefore likely to be in phase. To address the question of whether this precise alignment is crucial for cAMP-inducible promoter activity, phasing was disrupted by inserting a 5-bp sequence between the two elements (Fig. 4B, CRECCAAT+5/LUC). This did not affect promoter activity, indicating that precise phasing between bound factors does not appear to be important when the distance between these sites is not significantly affected. Transcription plays a pivotal role in the nocturnal stimulation of AA-NAT in the rat. This is evident from the findings that NE and cAMP protagonists, including Bt2cAMP, increase AA-NAT mRNA levels ∼100-fold (9Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Baler R. McCune S.K. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and that the transcription blocker actinomycin D blocks the NE → cAMP stimulation of AA-NAT mRNA and activity (3Klein D.C. Ciba Found. Symp. 1985; 117: 38-56PubMed Google Scholar, 9Roseboom P.H. Coon S.L. Baler R. McCune S.K. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We have suspected that cAMP acts to increase AA-NAT mRNA through cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of CREB resident at a CRE site. This was based on the evidence that NE acts through a cAMP mechanism to phosphorylate CREB in the pineal gland and that the protein kinase A antagonist (Rp)-8-CPT-cAMP-S inhibits cAMP-dependent induction of AA-NAT activity (10Roseboom P.H. Klein D.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 439-449PubMed Google Scholar). The studies presented here appear to support this notion because a near-perfect CRE (natCRE) is found in a 2160-bp fragment of the rat AA-NAT promoter. Functional dissection by deletion analysis revealed that an natCRE-containing region from positions −267 to +82 confers cAMP-dependent responsiveness to either CAT or luciferase reporter genes in primary pinealocytes. Furthermore, the natCRE core sequence binds a CREB-like moiety present in whole pineal protein extracts, and mutagenesis of the natCRE site reduces promoter activity and binding, indicating that it functions as a bona fide CRE. Accordingly, it appears very likely that natCRE mediates cAMP stimulation of expression of the rat AA-NAT gene, presumably in response to cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of resident CREB molecules. In addition to this site, a neighboring sequence appears to be involved in cAMP responsiveness because disruption of natCRE in the −267/+82 region of the promoter does not completely abolish the response to NE or Bt2cAMP. The most likely element involved in this residual cAMP responsiveness is the inverted CCAAT box (natCCAAT) at position −120. natCCAAT represents a perfect match in reverse orientation to a known regulatory site referred to as the CCAAT box. Such sites are found in many promoters and appear to control gene expression through interaction with members of a growing family of different CATBPs (31Graves B.J. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L.

The natCCAAT element appears to exert a positive effect on transcription because site-directed mutagenesis abolished binding activity and decreased the level of reporter gene activity under both basal and stimulated conditions (Fig. 4B). In addition, a double mutant with a disrupted CRE·CCAAT complex displayed only basal luciferase activity after Bt2cAMP stimulation. This finding, together with the partial decrease obtained after mutagenesis of either site alone, is consistent with the hypothesis that both elements are necessary to achieve full activation of the AA-NAT p"

Insulin induced 5.7- and 2.7-fold increases in GLUT4 and GLUT1 at the cell surface, respectively, as determined by the nonpermeant photoaffinity label [3H]2-N-[4(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl]-1,3-bis-(D-mannos-4-yloxy)propyl-2-amine. The total amount of GLUT1, as determined by quantitative Western blot analysis of cell homogenates, was found to represent a substantial fraction (∼30%) of the total glucose transporter content. Intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles were immunoisolated from low density microsomes by using monoclonal anti-GLUT4 (1F8) or anti-SCAMP antibodies (3F8) coupled to either agarose or acrylamide. With these different immunoisolation conditions two GLUT4 membrane pools were found in nonstimulated cells: one pool with a high proportion of GLUT4 and a low content in GLUT1 and SCAMP 39 (pool 1) and a second GLUT4 pool with a high content of GLUT1 and SCAMP 39 (pool 2). The existence of pool 1 was confirmed by immunotitration of intracellular GLUT4 membranes with 1F8-acrylamide. Acute insulin treatment caused the depletion of GLUT4 in both pools and of GLUT1 and SCAMP 39 in pool 2. In conclusion: 1) GLUT4 is the major glucose transporter to be recruited to the surface of cardiomyocytes in response to insulin; 2) these cells express a high level of GLUT1; and 3) intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles consist of at least two populations, which is compatible with recently proposed models of GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2029587634,"PST and STX are polysialyltransferases that form polysialic acid in the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), although it is not known why these two polysialyltransferases exist. In the present study, we have first isolated cDNA encoding human STX, which includes 5′-untranslated sequence. Northern blot analysis, using this cDNA and PST cDNA previously isolated by us, demonstrated that PST and STX are expressed in different fetal and adult tissues. STX is primarily expressed in embryonic tissues, but only modestly in adult heart, brain, and thymus. PST, on the other hand, is continuously expressed in adult heart, brain, thymus, spleen, small and large intestines, and peripheral blood leukocytes. In various parts of adult brain, the relative amount of PST and STX appears to be substantially different depending on the regions. The analysis by in situ hybridization of mouse adult brain, however, suggests that polysialic acid in the hippocampal formation is synthesized by both STX and PST. HeLa cells doubly transfected with the isolated STX cDNA and N-CAM cDNA supported neurite outgrowth much better than HeLa cells expressing N-CAM alone. However, polysialic acid synthesized by PST appears to be a better substratum than that synthesized by STX. Moreover, the genes for PST and STX were found to reside at chromosome 5, band p21 and chromosome 15, band q26, respectively. These results, taken together, strongly suggest that PST and STX are expressed distinctly in tissue-specific and cell-specific manners and that they apparently have distinct roles in development and organogenesis.

Polysialic acid is a developmentally regulated glycan composed of a linear homopolymer of α-2,8-linked sialic acid residues. Polysialic acid is mainly attached to the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) 1The abbreviations used are: N-CAMthe neural cell adhesion moleculehPST and mPSThuman and mouse polysialyltransferase (ST8Sia IV)PCRpolymerase chain reactionPVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideendo-NendoneuraminidaseWGAwheat germ agglutininAPCadenomatous polyposis coli. and is more abundant in embryonic brain than adult brain (1Edelman G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 135-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Presence of this large negatively charged carbohydrate modulates the adhesive property of N-CAM, and removal of polysialic acid increases binding between N-CAMs (4Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl.

Polysialylated N-CAM was also shown to attenuate cell-cell interactions mediated by other cell adhesion molecules (9Bixby J.L. Pratt R.S. Lilien J. Reichardt L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, we and others have cloned cDNAs encoding human, hamster, and mouse polysialyltransferases (PST for human, PST-1 for hamster, and ST8Sia IV for mouse, respectively) (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of PST and PST-1 are more than 97% identical. Both PST and PST-1 directed the expression of polysialic acid on the cell surface. The same studies also revealed that PST is highly homologous to STX (sialyltransferase X, or ST8Sia II) (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and STX and PST have 59% identity at the amino acid level. STX was originally cloned as a developmentally regulated sialyltransferase from the rat fetal brain (15Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 11504-11507Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Although the substrate specificity of STX was not known at the time of its discovery, the above results prompted investigation of STX as a polysialyltransferase. In support of this speculation, it was shown that STX also directs the expression of polysialic acid in small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (16Scheidegger E.P. Sternberg L.R. Roth J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22685-22688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and forms polysialic acid in both wild-type N-CAM as well as soluble chimeric N-CAM proteins (17Kojima N. Tachida Y. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presumed roles of polysialic acid, it has been shown that PST facilitates neurite outgrowth (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with human PST and N-CAM cDNAs or N-CAM cDNA alone and used as the substratum for the neurite outgrowth assay. When neurons derived from embryonic chicken were grown on these substrata, neurites were much longer and more branched on the substratum cells expressing polysialic acid and N-CAM than those on the substratum expressing N-CAM alone (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These results clearly indicate that polysialic acid formed by PST facilitates neurite outgrowth. However, it is not known if expression of STX and N-CAM cDNAs also facilitates neurite outgrowth. By using an in vitro assay system, both PST and STX added polysialic acid to fetuin and soluble chimeric N-CAM (17Kojima N. Tachida Y. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that either PST or STX alone can form polysialic acid by adding the first α-2,8-linked sialic acid to α-2,3-linked sialic acid in a glycoconjugate template, followed by multiple α-2,8-linked sialic acid residues to the acceptor containing NeuNAcα2→8NeuNAcα2→3Gal→R structure. PST and STX thus appear to share common enzymatic properties. On the other hand, it is not known why these two enzymes exist for polysialylation. In order to address this question, in the present study we have compared the expression profile of PST and STX in various fetal and adult tissues using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization. In addition, we have analyzed PST and STX in their capability to promote neurite outgrowth. Moreover, we demonstrate the presence of genes encoding PST and STX on different chromosomes, implying early separation in their evolution. These results strongly suggest that PST and STX play distinct roles in development and organogenesis. First, cDNA was synthesized from the human fetal brain mRNAs (Clontech) using a 3′-primer and reverse transcriptase. The 3′-primer, ASTX-3-1, is 5′-GTCCTCC-3′. The last 15 nucleotides in this sequence correspond to nucleotides 1114-1128 of human STX, hSTX sequence (nucleotides 1126-1128 encode the stop codon) (16Scheidegger E.P. Sternberg L.R. Roth J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22685-22688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The rest of ASTX-3-1 sequence was adapted from the mouse STX (mSTX) sequence (19Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By reverse transcriptase-catalyzed reaction, cDNA was produced, and PCR was performed using the formed cDNA as a template to amplify the sequence between nucleotides 96 and 1128 (nucleotides 1-3 and nucleotides 1126-1128 encode the initiation and the stop codon, respectively). The primer sequences were based on the hSTX sequence (16Scheidegger E.P. Sternberg L.R. Roth J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22685-22688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In order to obtain the sequence upstream from nucleotide 96, cDNA was synthesized using a 3′-primer corresponding to nucleotides 188-199, reverse transcriptase, and human fetal brain mRNAs as a template. PCR was then carried out using the formed cDNA as a template. The 5′-primer, STX-XbaI, for this PCR is 5′-GCCCTCGCCCCGGCCCG-3′, in which the last 15 nucleotides encode nucleotides −40 to −26 of mSTX (19Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The rest of the sequence contains XbaI site (denoted by an underline). The 3′-primer sequence corresponds in antisense direction to nucleotides 110-133 of hSTX. The PCR product obtained was cloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene) and then digested at HindIII site in the vector and at an internal EcoRI site (nucleotides 99-104). This HindIII-EcoRI fragment was appended to the 5′-end EcoRI site of a larger cDNA fragment (encompassing nucleotides 100-1283), producing a full-length cDNA encoding hSTX. The ligated cDNA was cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pcDNAI. Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from human fetal (19-23 gestational weeks) and adult brains, as well as human multiple tissue Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA, were purchased from Clontech. These blots were hybridized with a gel-purified cDNA insert of pcDNAI-hSTX or pcDNAI-hPST after labeling with [α-32P]dCTP by random-oligonucleotide priming (20Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar) (Prime It-II labeling kit, Stratagene). A mouse genomic DNA library derived from 129 SVJ mouse genome (Stratagene) was screened with a DNA fragment that represents the 5′-portion of human PST cDNA (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One of the isolated genomic clones, I15, contains the exon surrounding the translation initiation methionine of mPST judging from the comparison of human PST cDNA and mouse genomic sequences. Subsequently, this was verified by comparison of this sequence and the mPST cDNA sequence reported later (14Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The details of the isolation of mouse genomic DNA will be described elsewhere. Using this clone I15 as a template, mPST cDNA sequence surrounding the initiation methionine (nucleotides −47 to 113; the first nucleotide of the initiation codon is +1) was amplified by PCR. The 5′-primer and 3′-primer are 5′-GCAGGTGCCTGAGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATGAGTTGCGTCTCTT-3′, respectively. The XbaI and KpnI sites are denoted by an underline. The sequence of the 3′-primer ends at the 3′-end of the exon, which was deduced from the comparison of the mouse genomic and human PST cDNA sequences. This amplified cDNA sequence was cloned into XbaI and KpnI sites of pBluescript II SK, and the resultant vector was used as a template for the construction of RNA probes. A digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe was produced using the XbaI-cut template and T7 RNA polymerase with the DIG RNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Similarly, a sense probe for a negative control experiment was prepared using the Asp718-cut template and T3 RNA polymerase with the same kit. In order to obtain the 5′-region of mSTX cDNA, cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase, Superscript™ II (Life Technologies, Inc.) using poly(A)+ RNA from mouse brain (Clontech) and the primer oligonucleotide 5′-TTCACAGCTGATCTGATTGT-3′ synthesized according to the published sequence (nucleotides 118-137, 19Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Using this cDNA as a template, the 5′-region of mSTX sequence was amplified by PCR. The 5′-primer, STX-XbaI is described above and the 3′-primer is 5′-CGGAGAATTCCCGATTTCTTC-3′ (nucleotides 88-107) (underlined sequence denotes KpnI site). The obtained cDNA was cloned into XbaI and KpnI sites of pBluescript II SK, and used as a template to produce RNA probes. Hybrid-Ready tissue slides of mouse adult brain (NIH Swiss strain) were purchased from Novagen. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (21Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry for detection of the hybridized probes by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody with the DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The alkaline phosphatase reaction was demonstrated by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium in the presence of 10% polyvinyl alcohol (22De Block M. Debrouwer D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Control experiments using sense probes for PST or STX produced no specific signals. The Hybrid-Ready tissue slides were subjected to the immunohistochemical staining for detection of polysialic acid as described previously (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M.

Neurol. 1991; 314: 290-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Pharmingen) was used in this study, and immunochemical detection was performed by indirect method using anti-rat immunoglobulins conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Dako) (25Nakane P.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1975; 254: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. A control experiment was done by omitting the antibody 12F8 from the staining procedure, and no specific staining was found. The results obtained using antibody 12F8 were confirmed by using antibody 735 (26Frosch M. Görgen I. Boulnois G.J. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) or 12E3 (27Seki T. Arai Y. Anat. Embryol. 1991; 184: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Since HeLa cells were negative for both PSA and N-CAM, they were transfected by a plasmid pHβAPr-1-neo-N-CAM encoding N-CAM140 (28Dickson G. Gower H.J. Barton C.H. Prentice H.M. Elsom V.L. Moore S.E.

After selection with G418, clonal cell lines stably expressing N-CAM were selected by staining with anti-N-CAM antibody, CD56 (Dako). A clonal HeLa cell line expressing N-CAM was then transfected with pcDNAI-STX and a plasmid pSV2HyB encoding the hygromycin resistance gene, and HeLa cells expressing both N-CAM and polysialic acid (detected by 12F8 antibody), named HeLa-N-CAM+STX cells, were selected. HeLa cells expressing both N-CAM and PST, termed HeLa-N-CAM+PST, were established as described (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured as monolayers in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc). Sensory neurons were obtained from the dorsal root ganglia of 10-day-old chicken embryos. These neurons were dissociated with trypsin (0.5%), counted, seeded at low density over HeLa cell monolayers, and cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (29Doherty P. Cohen J. Walsh F.S. Neuron. 1990; 5: 209-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 30Zhang H. Miller R.H. Rutishauser U. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3107-3114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor was included in the sensory neuron culture. Neuron-HeLa cell cocultures were grown for 15 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with anti-neurofilament antibody RM0270 (31Lee V.M. Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3474-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Neurite lengths were measured with the Metamorph Imaging system (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) as described previously (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The mean neurite lengths and the number of branch points per neuron were compared among the different substrate conditions by Student's t test. HeLa-N-CAM, HeLa-N-CAM+PST, and HeLa-N-CAM+STX cells were subjected to Western blotting using the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham) as described (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) with a modification. Briefly, the cell pellet was recovered by centrifugation and a portion of the pellet was digested with endo-N (32Hallenbeck P.C. Vimr E.R. Yu F. Bassler B. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3553-3561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then dissolved in 1% Nonidet P-40 containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) in phosphate-buffered saline, and the supernatant obtained after centrifugation was incubated with an equal volume of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-agarose (EY Laboratories). After incubation with rotation, the suspension was briefly centrifuged and the WGA-agarose beads were recovered. The glycoproteins were dissociated from WGA-agarose by heating at 85°C for 3 min in the sample buffer for electrophoresis (18Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The proteins, separated by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were blotted to PVDF membrane and treated in 0.01 N HCl at 80°C for 20 min, followed by blocking with 10% skim milk. The membrane was then incubated with anti-N-CAM antibody, CD56 (Becton Dickinson). For detection of polysialic acid, the blotted PVDF membrane without acid pretreatment was incubated with 12E3 antibody (27Seki T. Arai Y. Anat. Embryol. 1991; 184: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The 12E3 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Yasumasu Arai, Juntendo Medical School, Tokyo, Japan. P1 plasmid human genomic DNA library was screened by PCR as described (34Onda M. Fukuda M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ primers for PCR of PST gene correspond to the PST sequence of nucleotides 599-608 and that of nucleotides 757-776, respectively. Purified DNA from one of the clones, clone 6029, was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes, and the chromosome banding was carried out as described (35Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Hirabayashi Y. Kanamori A. Sasaki K. Nishi T. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3684-3691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, P1 plasmid human genomic DNA library was screened for STX gene by PCR. The 5′- and 3′-primers for this PCR correspond to the STX sequence of the nucleotides 954-972 and that of the nucleotides 1101-1118, respectively. Purified DNA from one of the isolated clones, clone 6747, was used as a probe as described above. There were two reports on human STX (hSTX) sequences that differ in several nucleotides, including the stop codon (16Scheidegger E.P. Sternberg L.R. Roth J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22685-22688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine whether or not either sequence was correct and if allelic differences might exist, we cloned hSTX cDNA. First we cloned the cDNA encompassing nucleotides 96-1128 by synthesizing cDNA using human brain mRNA as a template. This was only possible using the nucleotide sequence reported by Scheidegger et al. (16Scheidegger E.P. Sternberg L.R. Roth J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22685-22688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). When primers were synthesized according to the 3′-end sequence reported by another laboratory (33Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no PCR product was formed. We then tried to extend this sequence upstream to 5′-untranslated sequence since there is no information on this sequence of human STX even in the data bank. This sequence was also necessary to express STX protein in mammalian cells. The 5′-untranslated sequence was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the 5′-primer sequence adapted from mouse STX and human fetal brain mRNA as a template. This 5′-upstream sequence was ligated to the above large cDNA fragment at a common EcoRI site to form a cDNA encompassing a single long open reading frame predicted to code the entire hSTX polypeptide. Fig. 1A shows the 5′-region of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of hSTX obtained by the above experiments. The nucleotide sequence from codon 1 to the stop codon was found to be identical to that of Scheidegger et al. (16Scheidegger E.P. Sternberg L.R. Roth J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22685-22688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of hSTX and hPST have 58.8% identity. As shown in Fig. 1B, the similarity is more significant in the catalytic domains of STX and PST. In order to understand how STX and PST differ, the expression of STX and PST transcripts were examined by Northern blot hybridization using the same blot. Although the expression of hSTX and hPST transcripts were reported individually (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 33Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17872-17878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is no report on the direct comparison of two enzymes side by side, nor is there any report on STX expression in various parts of the brain. The results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that STX transcripts are much more abundant in fetal brain than adult brain (for adult brain, see the whole brain in multiple brain tissues). Among adult tissues, the STX transcript is relatively abundant in thymus and heart, and moderately present in the small intestine, colon, and skeletal muscle. Among adult brain tissues, the STX transcript is present prominently in hippocampus, medulla oblongata, and putamen and moderately in amyglada, cerebral cortex, subthalmic nucleus, and cerebellum. In contrast, the PST transcript is more prominent in amyglada, subthalmic nucleus, cerebral cortex, and occipital pole (Fig. 2). PST is moderately detectable in hippocampus where STX is prominently present. PST is also abundant in fetal brain, but the difference in the PST transcript between fetal brain and fetal lung or kidney is much less than that of STX transcript. In adult tissues, PST is more widely present in non-neural cells. In particular, a substantial amount of the PST transcript is present in spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes, where STX is hardly expressed. PST was also expressed in placenta where STX was not detected. These results suggest that STX is more dramatically reduced during embryonic development and its expression is restricted to only a few tissues in adult. PST is also substantially reduced during development of brain but persists in some non-neural tissues. The specific hybridization by PST or STX probe was confirmed by the fact that only PST or STX transcript could be detected in certain tissues. For example, only PST transcript was detected in placenta while only STX transcript was detected in cerebellum. Moreover, the relative intensity of each transcript in different tissues did not change even after more stringent washings. The above results indicate that STX is more dominant than PST in the hippocampus. In order to determine which cells express these enzymes, in situ hybridization was carried out using mouse brain. In the hippocampus formation, a significant amount of the signal for the mPST transcript was detected in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus as well as the pyramidal cells medially located in the CA1 and CA3 fields of the Ammon's horn (Fig. 3A). In CA3, the mPST transcript was barely detectable, and the CA2 field lacked the mPST transcript. In contrast, a strong signal for the mSTX transcript was detected not only in CA1 and the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, but also in CA2 and CA3 (Fig. 3B). Polysialic acid, on the other hand, was expressed in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the mossy fibers arising from these granule cells (Fig. 3D), and this staining pattern is consistent with results shown in the previous report (36Seki T. Arai Y. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results combined together indicate that the polysialic acid in the granule cells are coordinately synthesized by mPST and mSTX, and most likely transported to the mossy fibers through axoplasmic flow. We have shown previously that the expression of PST and N-CAM cDNAs in HeLa cells resulted in the expression of polysialic acid on N-CAM (12Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the present study, HeLa cells were stably transfected with the cloned STX and N-CAM cDNAs. As shown in Fig. 4, HeLa cells express both N-CAM and polysialic acid detected by immunofluorescent staining using anti-N-CAM and anti-polysialic acid antibodies (Fig. 4, G and H). The immunostaining of polysialic acid was abolished after endo-N treatment of the cells (Fig. 4J). In parallel, HeLa cells transfected with N-CAM and PST cDNAs were examined. Those HeLa cells showed a positive staining for N-CAM before and after endo-N treatment (Fig. 4, C and E), while polysialic acid staining disappeared after endo-N treatment (Fig. 4, D and F). In order to determine whether or not STX actually formed polysialic acid on N-CAM, the cell lysates from the above stably transfected HeLa cells were subjected to Western blot analysis. A diffused high molecular band detected in cell lysates was converted to a sharp low band after endo-N treatment (Fig. 5, left panel, lanes 5 and 6). Almost identical results were obtained on HeLa cells expressing both N-CAM and PST (Fig. 5, left panel, lanes 3 and 4). Such a broad smear band was not obtained in parental HeLa cells which were transfected only with N-CAM cDNA (Fig. 5, left panel, l"

Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases play a pivotal role in the effector phase of apoptosis. We show that, in HL-60 cells, the addition of either anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor, or geranylgeraniol, an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, results in a rapid and en masse induction of apoptosis. The levels of actin, p42 and p44 MAPK, JNK1, JNK2, p38, and PCNA were not substantially altered during this process. Although these treatments appear to function by diverse pathways, they both result in the processing and activation of caspase-3 (CPP32β/Yama/Apopain). In contrast, no activation of caspase-1 (interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE)) was observed. Furthermore, we obtained ambiguous results regarding the activation of caspase-2 (Ich-1) depending on the antibody used. Pretreatment of the cells with benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk), a tetrapeptide inhibitor of caspases, prevented the induction of apoptosis for 24 h. Even after 72 h of treatment, some cells were still alive and progressing through the cell cycle, suggesting that blockage of caspase activity is able to protect cells.

https://openalex.org/W2010944002,"In this report, we demonstrate the ability of the cellular thiol glutathione to modulate the ryanodine receptor from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Reduced glutathione (GSH) inhibited Ca2+-stimulated [3H]ryanodine binding to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and inhibited the single-channel gating activity of the reconstituted Ca2+ release channel. The effects of GSH on both the [3H]ryanodine binding and single-channel measurements were dose-dependent, exhibiting an IC50 of ∼2.4 mM in binding experiments. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that GSH decreased the binding affinity of ryanodine for its receptor (increased Kd) and lowered the maximal binding occupancy (Bmax). In addition, GSH did not modify the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding. In single-channel experiments, GSH (5-10 mM), added to the cis side of the bilayer lipid membrane, lowered the open probability (Po) of a Ca2+ (50 μM)-stimulated Ca2+ channel without modifying the single-channel conductance. Subsequent perfusion of the cis chamber with an identical buffer, containing 50 μM Ca2+ without GSH, re-established Ca2+-stimulated channel gating. GSH did not inhibit channel activity when added to the trans side of the bilayer lipid membrane. Similar to GSH, the thiol-reducing agents dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol also inhibited high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. In contrast to GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was a potent stimulator of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding and it also stimulated the activity of the reconstituted single Ca2+ release channel. These results provide direct evidence that glutathione interacts with reactive thiols associated with the Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor complex, which are located on the cytoplasmic face of the SR, and support previous observations (Liu, G, Abramson, J. J., Zable, A. C., and Pessah, I. N. (1994) Mol. Pharmacol. 45, 189-200) that reactive thiols may be involved in the gating of the Ca2+ release channel.

INTRODUCTIONCollagens are the most abundant proteins in the human body, and they are found essentially in all tissues. To date, 19 different collagen types have been identified (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M.

The biosynthesis of collagens is characterized by several posttranslational modifications, one of which is hydroxylation of lysyl residues. Hydroxylysine occurs in the Y position of the repeating X-Y-Gly triplets within the helical region of the collagen molecule. Hydroxylysine also occurs in the sequence of nonhelical telopeptide regions of some collagen molecules, when glycine is replaced by either serine or alanine (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B.

J. 1974; 139: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The amount of the hydroxylysyl residues varies considerably between the different collagen types. Additional variation is found within the same collagen type in different tissues and even within the same tissues in different physiological and pathological states (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B.

The hydroxy groups participate in the formation of intermolecular cross-links and serve as sites of attachment for carbohydrate units that are unique to collagens (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R.

INTRODUCTIONCollagens are the most abundant proteins in the human body, and they are found essentially in all tissues. To date, 19 different collagen types have been identified (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M.

The biosynthesis of collagens is characterized by several posttranslational modifications, one of which is hydroxylation of lysyl residues. Hydroxylysine occurs in the Y position of the repeating X-Y-Gly triplets within the helical region of the collagen molecule. Hydroxylysine also occurs in the sequence of nonhelical telopeptide regions of some collagen molecules, when glycine is replaced by either serine or alanine (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B.

J. 1974; 139: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The amount of the hydroxylysyl residues varies considerably between the different collagen types. Additional variation is found within the same collagen type in different tissues and even within the same tissues in different physiological and pathological states (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Crabbe M.J.C. Harding J. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 1-51Google Scholar, 2Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B.

J. 1974; 139: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Hydroxylysyl residues have an important role in the structure and stability of collagens. The hydroxy groups participate in the formation of intermolecular cross-links and serve as sites of attachment for carbohydrate units that are unique to collagens (1Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R.

https://openalex.org/W2074099899,"To define the structural requirements of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related protein (PTHrP) receptor necessary for activation of phospholipase C (PLC), receptors with random mutations in their second cytoplasmic loop were synthesized, and their properties were assessed. A mutant in which the wild type (WT) rat PTH/PTHrP receptor sequence EKKY (amino acids 317-320) was replaced with DSEL had little or no PTH-stimulated PLC activity when expressed transiently in COS-7 cells, but it retained full capacity to bind ligand and to generate cAMP. This phenotype was confirmed in LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing the DSEL mutant receptor, where both PTH-stimulated PLC activity and sodium-dependent phosphate co-transport were essentially abolished. Individual mutations of these four residues point to a critical role for Lys-319 in receptor-G protein coupling. PTH-generated IPs were reduced to 27 ± 13% when K319E, compared with the WT receptor, and PLC activation was fully recovered in a receptor revertant in which Glu-319 in the DSEL mutant cassette was restored to the WT residue, Lys. Moreover, the WT receptor and a mutant receptor in which K319R had indistinguishable properties, thus suggesting that a basic amino acid at this position may be important for PLC activation. All of these receptors had unimpaired capacity to bind ligand and to generate cAMP. To ensure adequacy of Gαq-subunits for transducing the receptor signal, Gαq was expressed in HEK293 and in LLC-PK1 cells together with either WT receptors or receptors with the DSEL mutant cassette. PTH generated no inositol phosphates (IPs) in either HEK293 or LLC-PK1 cells, when they expressed DSEL mutant receptors together with Gαq. In contrast, PTH generated 2- and 2.5-fold increases in IPs, respectively, when these cells co-expressed both the WT receptor and Gαq. Thus, generation of IPs by the activated PTH/PTHrP receptor can be selectively abolished without affecting its capacity to generate cAMP, and Lys-319 in the second intracellular loop is critical for activating the PLC pathway. Moreover, α-subunits of the Gq family, rather than βγ-subunits, transduce the signal from the activated receptor to PLC, and the PLC, rather than the adenylyl cyclase, pathway mediates sodium-dependent phosphate co-transport in LLC-PK1 cells.

PLD previously described from various plant sources generally requires millimolar ranges of calcium for optimal activity. In this study, we genetically suppressed the expression of this conventional PLD in Arabidopsis by introducing an antisense PLD cDNA. However, both the antisense transgenic and wild-type plants showed comparable PLD activity in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of calcium and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate using phosphatidylcholine as a substrate. This new PLD activity was partially stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, but not by other phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylcholine. Its requirement for polyphosphoinositides was further supported by its ability to be inhibited by neomycin. The polyphosphoinositide-dependent PLD requires calcium for activity, but no magnesium. The calcium stimulation was observed in the nanomolar range and reached a plateau at 5 μM calcium. The findings of this study demonstrate the presence of different PLDs that are regulated in a distinct manner in plants. The potential significance of a PLD that is regulated by polyphosphoinositides and physiological concentrations of Ca2+ is discussed.

Biliverdin is normally reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase and is excreted after conjugation with glucuronic acid (2Schmid R. McDonagh A.F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins Vol. VI.

Intervention of α-meso-hydroxyheme as a true intermediate in the normal catalytic process therefore remains unproven. This shortcoming is important in view of the demonstration that α-meso-methyl-substituted heme groups are oxidized to the corresponding α-biliverdins without the formation of CO, a reaction that does not involve α-meso-hydroxylation of the heme (34Torpey J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or HO-1 (29Yoshinaga T. Sudo Y. Sano S. Biochem.

These studies indicate that a radical species forms when α-meso-hydroxyheme reacts with O2 prior to the formation of verdoheme, but the reduction equivalent requirements for the subsequent reaction are a matter of debate. Matera et al. (42Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) concluded that 1 reducing eq is required for the HO-1-catalyzed reaction, whereas Sano et al. (31Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) did not find such a requirement in the myoglobin reaction. Our previous demonstration that NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and O2 can be replaced by H2O2 in supporting the HO-1-catalyzed conversion of heme to verdoheme is in accord with the conclusion that exogenous electrons are not required for this reaction (16Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here that α-meso-hydroxyheme is formed as a stable intermediate when the heme-hHO-1 complex reacts anaerobically with H2O2 and characterize this intermediate by UV-visible, resonance Raman, and EPR spectroscopy. In the presence of CO, α-meso-hydroxyheme exists predominantly as a CO-complexed Fe(II) π neutral radical. On exposure to O2, this porphyrin radical reacts with O2 to yield Fe(III) verdoheme with no requirement for exogenous reducing equivalents. An electron is only required to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) verdoheme. hHO-1 without the 23-amino acid membrane anchor was expressed in E. coli and was purified as previously reported (16Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wilks A. Black S.M. Miller W.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The truncated protein has the same catalytic activity as the full-length form. The catalytic activity was assayed by monitoring the formation of bilirubin at 37°C in the presence of biliverdin reductase, and the biliverdin products were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (16Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 (30%), NADPH, protoporphyrin IX, methyl viologen, sodium dithionite, and pyridine were obtained from either Aldrich or Sigma. High purity argon (99.998%) and CO (99.95%) were obtained from Matheson and Aldrich, respectively. All other chemicals were the highest grade available and were used without further purification. A custom-made anaerobic cuvette (glass shop, University of California, Berkeley, CA) was assembled from a fluorescence cuvette with four optical windows (1- and 0.4- or 0.2-cm path length, respectively) by attaching it to a spherical chamber (for gas exchange and mixing) bearing a standard ground-glass joint, a septum-sealed adapter, and a side arm for the addition of reagents after gas exchange is complete. The reconstituted heme-hHO-1 complex (35 μM in 1.2 ml of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was placed in the UV cuvette, and 1 eq of H2O2 (50 μl) was placed in the side arm. The concentration of H2O2 was quantitated by titration with iodide (43Ramettes R.W. Sanford Jr., R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 82: 5001-5005Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or by measuring the absorbance at 240 nm (ε240 = 43.6 M−1 cm−1). The protein solution and H2O2 were made anaerobic by flushing the cuvette with oxygen-free argon for at least 40 min. The argon was passed through an oxygen scrubber to remove the trace O2 contamination from the gas, and a water-filled bubbler was used to humidify the argon and to prevent drying of the solutions in the cuvette. During the gas exchange, the protein solution was placed in the round bowl of the cuvette to maximize the surface area and the argon exchange rate. After the solutions were fully anaerobic, the reaction was initiated by mixing the protein solution with the H2O2 in the side arm at 23°C and recording the UV-visible spectrum until no further changes were observed. For subsequent reaction with O2, the sealed septum was removed; the protein solution was flushed with 100% O2; and the UV-visible spectrum was recorded. For the experiments performed under an atmosphere of CO, the protein and H2O2 solutions were flushed with O2-free CO. The CO (99.95%) gas was bubbled through a sodium dithionite solution containing reduced methyl viologen (blue) as an indicator to remove oxygen impurities prior to entry into the cuvette. The procedure was otherwise the same as that for the anaerobic experiments. Resonance Raman experiments were performed using the same anaerobic cuvette used for the absorption spectroscopy. The procedures used to prepare samples for absorption measurements were repeated for resonance Raman experiments with higher protein concentrations (∼150 μM). Optical absorption data could be concomitantly obtained using the cuvette with a 0.2-cm path length. Resonance Raman spectra were recorded on a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (0.67-m focal length, 1800 grooves/mm of grating, and 6 cm−1 spectral resolution) using a Kaiser Optical holographic super-notch filter and a Princeton Instruments liquid N2-cooled CCD detector (LN-1100PB). The excitation source was provided by an Innova 302 krypton laser (413 nm, ∼5 mW). Spectra were collected in a 90°-scattering geometry at room temperature with a collecting time of a few minutes. Peak frequencies were calibrated relative to an indene standard and are accurate to ±1 cm−1. Anaerobic sample handling was as described above except that higher concentrations of the reconstituted heme-hHO-1 complex were used for EPR experiments. The protein solution (300 μM, 250 μl) in a Teflon-sealed constantly stirred 1-ml reaction vial was made anaerobic by flushing, as required, with either O2-free argon or CO. The reaction, initiated by anaerobic addition of 1 eq of H2O2, was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 23°C before the protein solution was transferred to an anaerobic EPR tube, in which it was frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. For the reaction with O2, 100% O2 was used to flush the head space over the protein solution with constant stirring. Sodium dithionite was prepared in anaerobic buffered solutions and was quantitated by titration with potassium ferricyanide solution (ε420 = 1.03 mM−1 cm−1). X-band EPR spectra were recorded using a Varian E-109 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-910 liquid helium cryostat, a Hewlett-Packard 436A power meter, and a Hewlett-Packard 5350B microwave frequency counter. Temperature, g value calibrations, data acquisition, subtraction, and integration procedures were as described previously (44Lipscomb J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 45Lipscomb J.D. Salo R.W. Comput. Enhanced Spectrosc. 1983; 1: 11-15Google Scholar, 46Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). When the heme-hHO-1 complex (Fig. 1, −−) reacts anaerobically (argon atmosphere) with 1 eq of H2O2 at pH 7.4, the Soret band (- · -) becomes broader, decreases in intensity, and crosses at 425 nm that of the original heme-hHO-1 complex. In the visible region, the α and β bands at 574 and 536 nm are greatly attenuated; the absorbance at 635 nm increases; and a new band appears around 820 nm. These spectroscopic changes differ dramatically from those observed when verdoheme is formed by aerobic addition of 1 eq of H2O2 to the heme-hHO-1 complex (16Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The new species that is formed anaerobically is stable at 23°C for at least 30 min if anaerobicity is maintained. The broad Soret band at 405 nm and the relatively featureless visible region of the anaerobic intermediate are similar to those of the reconstituted α-meso-hydroxyheme-HO-1 complex reported by Matera et al. (42Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and the α-meso-hydroxyheme-myoglobin complex reported by Sano et al. (31Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). When the anaerobically generated intermediate is exposed to O2, the Soret intensity undergoes a further slight decrease; the broadening of the Soret band and the band at 820 nm disappear; and the absorption at 660-690 nm increases markedly (Fig. 1, - - -). This spectrum, which is the same as that obtained upon aerobic addition of H2O2 (16Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that verdoheme is formed by reaction of the anaerobically generated intermediate with O2. The formation of verdoheme was confirmed by the addition of 20% pyridine to the protein solution, which produced the typical spectrum of the verdoheme-pyridine complex (Fig. 1, - ·· -) (16Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yoshida T. Noguchi M. Kikuchi G. J. Biochem.

Additional evidence for the formation of α-meso-hydroxyheme in the anaerobic reaction of H2O2 with the heme-hHO-1 complex is provided by comparison of the resonance Raman spectrum of the product with that reported for HO-1 reconstituted with synthetic α-meso-hydroxyheme (42Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The resonance Raman spectrum of the ferric heme-hHO-1 complex (Fig. 2, trace A), as previously reported (18Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Takeuchi N. Ikeda-Saito M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5531-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), is characteristic of a mixture of high and low spin hexacoordinate heme dominated by a ν4 porphyrin skeletal mode at 1375 cm−1. Anaerobic addition of 1 eq of H2O2 leads to a decrease of the contributions from the ferric heme and the appearance of new resonance Raman features that signal the formation of a new species (Fig. 2, trace B), although the residual band at 1375 cm−1 indicates that some unreacted ferric heme is still present. Reaction with higher concentrations of H2O2 further decreases the ferric heme bands, but no increase is observed in the bands attributed to α-meso-hydroxyheme. This is probably due to side reactions of α-meso-hydroxyheme with H2O2. 2When >1 eq of H2O2 is used, anaerobic reaction of the ferric heme-hHO-1 complex with H2O2 yields products in addition to α-meso-hydroxyheme. The anaerobically generated α-meso-hydroxyheme possibly reacts with H2O2 to give secondary products. The difference spectrum (Fig. 2, trace C) obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the residual starting material from trace B exhibits major resonance Raman bands at 889, 1125, 1226, 1334, 1354, 1401, 1581, and 1616 cm−1. Allowing for an experimental error of 2 cm−1, the difference spectrum reproduces the features of the previously reported spectrum of the α-meso-hydroxyheme complex (42Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown that chemically synthesized α-meso-hydroxyheme can be converted to biliverdin (29Yoshinaga T. Sudo Y. Sano S. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 31Sano S. Sano T. Morishima I. Shiro Y. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), this is the first demonstration of the heme oxygenase-catalyzed formation of α-meso-hydroxyheme. Rapid scanning spectroscopy at 23°C shows that formation of the α-meso-hydroxyheme intermediate in the anaerobic reaction of the heme-hHO-1 complex with H2O2 is complete within 4 min (Fig. 3A). As before, completion of the reaction is associated with a decrease in and broadening of the Soret peak with an isosbestic point at 425 nm and a slight increase in the absorbance at 635 nm. Aerobic reaction of the heme-hHO-1 complex with H2O2 also reaches completion within 4 min at 23°C (Fig. 3B). However, the isosbestic point at 425 nm and the broadening of the Soret band are not observed, and the 660-690 nm absorption characteristic of verdoheme increases in parallel with the decrease in the Soret band. In the aerobic reaction, the heme appears to be directly transformed into verdoheme without the accumulation of α-meso-hydroxyheme. When preformed α-meso-hydroxyheme reacts with oxygen, there is a slight loss of Soret absorption and an increase in the 660-690 nm absorption (Fig. 3C). These changes are complete within 5 s at 23°C, indicating that the conversion of α-meso-hydroxyheme to verdoheme is very rapid. The kinetics of these aerobic and anaerobic reactions of the heme-hHO-1 complex with H2O2 indicate that (a) a new stable intermediate with a different UV-visible spectrum forms anaerobically with H2O2; (b) the new intermediate is a precursor of verdoheme and is converted rapidly to verdoheme upon exposure to O2; and (c) the rate of the H2O2-dependent oxidation of heme to verdoheme appears to be limited by the rate of formation of α-meso-hydroxyheme. This latter result is consistent with the observation that α-meso-hydroxyheme does not accumulate in the aerobic reaction of the heme-hHO-1 complex with H2O2. The resting state of the heme-hHO-1 complex at pH 7.4, as previously reported, gives predominantly a high spin (S = 5/2) ferric axial EPR signal with g⦹ = 6 and g∥ = 2 (Fig. 4, trace A) (18Sun J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14151-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the complex reacts anaerobically with 1 eq of H2O2, a slight loss of the g = 6 signal and a radical signal at g = 2.008 are observed (Fig. 4, trace B). The deprotonated ferric α-meso-hydroxyheme can be represented as a mixture of ferric phenolate, ferric keto anion, and ferrous keto π neutral radical resonance forms (32Morishima I. Fujii H. Shiro Y. Sano S. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 1528-1535Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The EPR data in Fig. 4 (trace B) are consistent with this interpretation: the π neutral radical species accounts for the g = 2.008 signal, and the EPR-silent ferrous iron accounts for the decrease in the g = 6 signal. The g = 6 signal is broader (Fig. 4, trace B) than that in the parent ferric state (trace A). The broadening of the signal may be due to either the generation of a rhombic signal contributed by the ferric α-meso-hydroxyheme or the presence of a more heterogeneous electronic structure in the keto-enol iron complex. It is difficult to differentiate the signal type due to interference by the g = 6 axial signal from unreacted ferric heme, the presence of which is confirmed by the resonance Raman experiments. When the EPR signal from unreacted ferric heme is subtracted, the remaining spectrum shows a ferric α-meso-hydroxyheme rhombic signal (Fig. 4, trace C) consistent with that reported by Matera et al. (42Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The rhombic signal suggests that the ferric keto-enol form of α-meso-hydroxyheme has a high spin iron (S = 5/2). However, the ferrous π neutral radical species at g = 2.008 was not observed previously in either the reconstituted α-meso-hydroxyheme-HO-1 (42Matera K.M. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Like other biological activities of TNF, its antitumor activity is exerted through binding to two distinct but structurally related cell surface receptors, p55 (TNF-R1) and p75 (TNF-R2). Gene knockout experiments and the use of receptor-specific agonistic antibodies confirmed that the two TNF receptors generate nonoverlapping signals (4Rothe J. Lesslauer W. Lotscher H. Lang Y.

Although there is now considerable evidence that p55 is the TNF receptor that directly mediates cytotoxicity in a wide variety of cell types (8Tartaglia L.A. Rothe M. Hu Y.F. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 73: 213-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), recent studies have indicated that p75-mediated signals may cooperate with p55 to facilite cell death in some cell types (9Tartaglia L.A. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18542-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structure function analysis of p55 TNF-R signaling demonstrated that an 80-amino acid region within the cytoplasmic domain is required for initiation of apoptosis and NF-κB activation (10Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V.

The cytotoxic effect of TNF toward tumor cells can be affected by both intrinsic and acquired cell resistance. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms critical for tumor resistance to TNF and for subsequent tumor progression remains limited. Cell surface expression of TNF receptors is necessary but not sufficient to induce a biological response, and post-receptor mechanisms are important in controlling the susceptibility to the cytotoxic action of TNF. The elucidation of the TNF signaling transduction pathway is particularly challenging because of the extremely wide variety of TNF responses. It is established that TNF regulates the transcription of several genes, many of which are regulated by NF-κB (11Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). It is also clear that the activation of this transcription factor is a pivotal and integral event for the transfer of the TNF signal to the nucleus. Several mechanisms have been reported to contribute to cellular resistance to TNF-induced cell killing, including the constitutive expression of several protective proteins in resistant tumor cells, such as MnSOD, endogenous TNF, major heat shock protein hsp70, A20 zinc finger protein (12Wong G.H.W. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 13Vanhaesbroeck B. Decoster E. Ostade X.V. Bladel S.V. Lenaert A. Roy F.V.

Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these proteins confer only partial protection against TNF cytotoxicity, suggesting that additional resistance mechanisms exist. Recently, ceramide was reported to be an important lipid messenger in various pathways of TNF action (16Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 17Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide can be generated from sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis by two types of early TNF-responsive sphingomyelinases (SMases), a membrane-associated neutral (N-)SMase and an endosomal acidic (A-)SMase (18Spence M.W. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 3-23PubMed Google Scholar, 19Merrill Jr., A.H. Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide targets may include a membrane-associated ceramide-activated protein kinase (20Liu J. Mathias S. Yang Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3047-3052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a cytosolic ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (21Wolff R.A. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19605-19609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (22Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the stress-activated protein kinases (23Westwick J.K. Bielawska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22689-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Recent studies established that ceramide generated by N-SMase directed the activation of proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinase(s) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2), while ceramide generated by A-SMase triggers the activation of NF-κB, suggesting that the two SMases control important yet dissociable and nonoverlapping pathways of TNF receptor signaling (24Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Because of the potential role of ceramide in mediating the cytotoxic effect of TNF, we examined its possible involvement in cell resistance to TNF. Our findings indicate that stable transfection of p55 TNF receptor restores TNF signaling including NF-κB activation in TNF-resistant MCF7 variant R-A1, but does not restore the susceptibility of these cells to TNF cytotoxicity. The data presented in this study further support the notion that the apoptotic effect of TNF is probably dissociated from NF-κB activation, and suggest that an alteration of sphingomyelinase activation and subsequent ceramide generation may represent an important additional mechanism by which human tumor cells may escape TNF-mediated apoptosis. Highly purified (>99%) recombinant TNF-α (TNF, specific activity 6.63 × 106 units/mg protein) was kindly provided by A. G. Knoll (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany). Monoclonal antibodies htr-9 and utr-1 directed against TNF receptors p55 and p75, respectively, were generously provided by Dr. M. Brokhaus (Hoffman-La Roche, Ltd., Basel, Switzerland). Sphingomyelinase (Staphylococcus aureus) and phospholipase D (cabbage) were obtained from Sigma. N-Hexanoyl-D-sphingosine (C6-ceramide) and C6-dihydroceramide were purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). TNF-resistant R-A1 cells were derived from a TNF-sensitive human breast carcinoma MCF7 cell line after continuous exposure to increasing doses of recombinant TNF-α (25Zyad A. Branellec D. Mahé Y. Tursz T. Chouaib S. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The wild-type human p55 TNF-R cDNA cloned in a mammalian expression vector pMPSVEH (26Brakebusch C. Nophar Y. Kemper O. Engelmann H. Wallach D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was used to transfect R-A1 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (27Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1000 cells/10-cm tissue culture plate were plated. After 10-14 days of selection in growth medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Sigma), 4-5 resistant colonies were isolated from each plate and examined for human p55 TNF-R expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The positive clones were subsequently maintained in medium with 100 μg/ml G418 for more than 2 months. The sensitivity of clones to TNF was tested every 2 weeks during culture. All cell lines were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FCS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1%L-glutamine at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cell viability was determined using the crystal violet staining method as described previously (25Zyad A. Branellec D. Mahé Y. Tursz T. Chouaib S. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Absorbance (A), which was proportional to cell viability, was measured at 540 nm. Cell viability (%) = 100 × (A1/A0), cell lysis (%) = 1 − cell viability (%), where A1 and A0 were the absorbance obtained from treated and untreated cells, respectively. The mean value of quadruplicate was used for analysis. Quantitative DNA fragmentation was determined as described previously (28Escargueil-Blanc I. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). TNF- or ceramide-treated and untreated cells (1 × 106) were pelleted and washed in PBS. Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (0.5% v/v Triton X-100, 20 mM EDTA and 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min to separate the chromatin pellet from fragmented DNA. Both the pellet (resuspended in 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and supernatant were assayed to determine DNA by the spectrofluorometric DAPI procedure (29Kapuscinski J. Skooczylas B. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed by incubating of 1 × 106 cells with TNF receptor antibodies (htr-9 and utr-1) for 1 h on ice in PBS, 1% FCS. Cells were then washed and stained with 1:50 dilution of affinity-purified biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. After three washes with PBS, 1% FCS, cells were incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin-phycoerythrin solution for 30 min. After additional washing with PBS, stained cells were analyzed using an EPICS profile II Coulter (Coultronic, Margency, France). Fluorescence data were collected on 5 × 103 viable cells, as determined by forward light scatter intensity. Background fluorescence was determined using PBS, 1% FCS instead of the TNF-R monoclonal antibody. TNF ligand internalization and degradation were estimated, as described previously by Tsujimoto et al. (30Tsujimoto M. Yip K. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7626-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 106) were exposed to 125I-TNF (Amersham) at 4°C for 2.5 h and then washed with ice-cold medium and shifted to 37°C by adding prewarmed medium and further incubated at 37°C. At the times indicated, culture fluids were harvested, and trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10% to quantitate degradation of internalized TNF by the cells. The soluble counts were determined after removal of the precipitate by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 20 min. The cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 5 min at 4°C with 2 ml of 50 mM glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.0) containing 150 mM NaCl. After removal of the glycine buffer, cells were washed twice and solubilized in 0.1% SDS. 125I radioactivity found in the glycine buffer and that found in solubilized cells, respectively, represented surface-bound TNF and internalized intracellular TNF. Human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells (15 × 106) were incubated for 90 min in the presence or absence of TNF. Adherent cells were then trypsinized, and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Dignam et al. (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed with a synthetic double-stranded 31-mer oligonucleotide containing the κB sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat, 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 kinase (32Feuillard J. Gouy H. Bismutch G. Lee L.M. Debré P. Körner M. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from the tumor cell lines according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA (15 μg/lane) were electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane Hybond-C (Amersham). The membrane was then hybridized overnight at 42°C with the probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham). The hybridized membrane was washed and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham). The blot was stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS and probed again with a β-actin probe as a control for equal RNA loading. For phospholipid labeling, cells were incubated with RPMI medium containing 5% FCS and 1 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (35.9 Ci/mmol, NEN du Pont, France). After 48 h of incubation, the radioactive medium was removed and cells were incubated for another 2-4 h in culture medium. Cells (3 × 106) were resuspended in 1 ml of culture medium supplemented with 10 mM HEPES and treated with TNF at various times. Lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.S. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using chloroform/methanol/water (100:42:6, by volume) followed by a second step using petroleum ether/diethylether/acetic acid (80:20:1, by volume) or hexane/diethylether/formic acid (55:45:1, by volume) as developing solvent systems. Radioactive lipid spots, detected with a Berthold radiochromatoscan and upon exposure to iodine vapor, were scraped into scintillation fluid and counted. The positions of ceramide on TLC plates were determined by comparison with concomitantly run 3H-lipid extracts from MCF7 cells treated with exogenous bacterial SMase (100 milliunits/1.5 × 106 cells). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Cells (5 × 106) were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dye (34Bligh E.G. Dyer W.S. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and separated on TLC using chloroform/methanol/water (70:35:5, by volume). The various spots detected after exposure to iodine vapor were determined for phosphorus content according to Böttcher et al. (35Böttcher C.J.F. Van Gent C.M. Pries C.A. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The SMase assay was performed, as described previously by Wiegmann et al (24Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with or without TNF for various times, and the stimulation was stopped by placing 2-3 × 106 cell aliquots in a methanol-dry ice bath. To measure acidic SMase activity, cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 15 min at 4°C before homogenization. About 100 μg of cellular lysate protein were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in a buffer containing 250 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 1 mM EDTA, and [choline-methyl-14C]SM (54.5 mCi/mmol, NEN DuPont; 100,000 dpm/assay). To measure neutral SMase activity, cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM Na2MoO4, 10 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 750 μM ATP, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM leupeptin, and 10 μM pepstatin. After incubation for 5 min at 4°C, cells were homogenized and 100 μg of cellular lysate protein were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM MgCl2, and [choline-methyl-14C]SM (100,000 dpm/assay). Radioactive phosphocholine produced from [choline-methyl-14C]SM was then extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and quantitated by scintillation counting (36Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the method of Mutch et al (37Mutch D.G. Powell C.B. Kao M. Collins J.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 866-872PubMed Google Scholar), cells (2 × 105) were plated in 35-mm dishes containing 1 ml of culture medium to attach overnight and were then incubated with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid ([5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]) (209 Ci/mmol, NEN du Pont, France) at 37°C for 18 h. Unincorporated [3H]arachidonic acid was removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA. Radiolabeled cells were incubated with medium or TNF. The medium was then removed and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min to separate cell debris. 0.1 ml of the supernatant fluids was mixed with 3 ml of scintillation fluid and counted. The amount of 3H release was determined in triplicate. The relative release of 3H was calculated as the percentage of arachidonic acid released in the supernatant with respect of total [3H]arachidonic acid content of cells. In an attempt to examine the mechanism of TNF-resistance acquisition by tumor cells, we established a TNF-resistant variant R-A1, derived from MCF7 cells (25Zyad A. Branellec D. Mahé Y. Tursz T. Chouaib S. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, R-A1 cells were resistant to TNF compared to the parental MCF7 cells. Flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1B) indicates that while p55 TNF-R was highly expressed in parental MCF7 cells (80%), a lower level of p55 expression (30%) was observed in R-A1. Both cell lines displayed marginal expression of the p75 receptor (10%). Data of binding experiments (Fig. 1C) using 125I-radiolabeled TNF show that receptor-bound TNF was rapidly internalized by TNF-sensitive MCF7 cells. In contrast, very little TNF binding and no TNF internalization were detected in R-A1 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays for NF-κB activation were performed to further evaluate the response of these cells to TNF. Treatment with TNF induced NF-κB translocation in MCF7 but had no effect in R-A1 cells (Fig. 1D). The data of binding and internalization experiments are consistent with the failure of TNF to induce NF-κB activation in R-A1. The hypothesis that resistance to TNF exhibited by R-A1 cells may be due to altered signaling through TNF receptors was examined next. Based on the above observations and as the p55 TNF receptor was reported to be responsible for TNF cytotoxicity signaling in most cellular models, we attempted to correct TNF signaling by transfecting R-A1 cells with a wild-type p55 expression vector, pMPSVEH-hup55 TNF-R. Following screening by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using anti-TNF-R-p55 monoclonal antibody (htr-9), the stable transfected cells expressing a high level of cell surface p55 receptor (more than 70%) were selected for further study. Gel shift experiments were first performed to examine early response to TNF, i.e. NF-κB activation, in the transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, exposure of three representative R-A1 p55-transfected clones (clones 1001, 2101, and 3024) to TNF (50 ng/ml) resulted in the activation of NF-κB, indicating that the TNF signaling pathway leading to NF-κB activation was functional. Interestingly, despite NF-κB activation, these p55-transfected clones remained resistant to TNF, even when a high concentration of TNF (200 ng/ml) was used (Fig. 2B). These data clearly indicate that wild-type p55 receptor expression and the resulting NF-κB activation in R-A1 cells are not sufficient to trigger TNF cytotoxic activity. Strong evidence has been provided about the role of MnSOD and A20 in cell protection against the cytotoxic action of TNF (12Wong G.H.W. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 38Jäättelä M. Mouritzen H. Elling F. Bastholm L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1166-1173PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the mRNA expression of these genes in the p55-transfected R-A1 cells to determine whether they were involved in the resistance to TNF cytotoxicity observed in these cells. Northern blot analysis showed that TNF treatment induced a similar increase in MnSOD and A20 mRNA expression in sensitive MCF7 and in p55-transfected R-A1 cells (Fig. 3). As expected, no increase in the mRNA expression level of either gene was detectable in control R-A1 cells due to the absence of TNF signaling. These data suggest that the resistance of these transfected cells was not directly related to MnSOD and A20 gene expression and further emphasize TNF signaling efficiency in these p55-transfected cells. Ceramide, the product resulting from the breakdown of sphingomyelin, serves as the second messenger in the apoptotic signaling pathway (17Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, ceramide was reported to be an essential mediator in TNF-induced cell killing (39Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar, 40Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Grant S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possible interference of the sphingomyelin/ceramide pathway with the mechanism of TNF resistance in MCF7-derivative cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, a concomitant increase in intracellular ceramide (∼2.4-fold increase) was detected in MCF7 at 10-20 min of TNF incubation, preceded by a rapid SM hydrolysis (>30% decrease in SM content) that reached the maximum level within 5-10 min after TNF treatment. The measurement of neutral and acidic SMases indicates that the SM breakdown and ceramide generation in MCF7 cells was correlated with a significant induction of these two SMase activities (20% and 40% of control for neutral and acidic SMases, respectively) after 5-15 min of TNF incubation (Fig. 4B). In contrast, TNF did not induce neither ceramide generation nor SM hydrolysis in R-A1 and p55-transfected cells (clones 1001 and 3024) (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with the failure of TNF to stimulate both SMase activities in these cells (Fig. 4B). However, the defect of the SMase activation was not related to a decrease in basal SMase activities in the resistant cells, since the basal SMase activities were not significantly different in the three cell lines tested (e.g. N-SMase activities were 231, 385, and 258 pmol/h/mg proteins for MCF7, R-A1, and clone 1001 cells, respectively). In order to compare the basal level of SMase substrate in TNF-sensitive and resistant cells, the analysis of cellular SM content was performed. As shown in Table I, the percentage of SM (as compared to total phospholipids) was significantly higher in parental MCF7 cells (28-30% of increase) than in R-A1 and clone 1001 cells. Moreover, the basal SM content was 2-fold higher in MCF7 than in the two resistant counterparts (20.9 nmol for MCF7 versus 10.7 nmol and 12.4 nmol for R-A1 and clone 1001 cells, respectively). This result suggests that the different responses induced by TNF in these cells may be dependent on the cellular SM content.Table I.Cellular SM content in TNF-sensitive and -resistant MCF7 cellsCellsSMSM (compared to PL)nmol IP/mg protein%MCF720.9 + 0.314.96 + 0.20R-A110.7 + 1.311.46 + 1.60aDecreased vs. % of MCF7 SM (p < 0.02).Clone 100112.4 + 0.311.66 + 0.50bDecreased vs. % of MCF7 SM (p < 0.001).a Decreased vs. % of MCF7 SM (p < 0.02).b Decreased vs. % of MCF7 SM (p < 0.001). Open table in a new tab To determine whether the activation of SMase and the production of ceramide could overcome the resistance of transfected R-A1 cells, we examined the susceptibility of these cells to exogenous bacterial-derived SMase and synthetic cell-permeable ceramide. The addition of SMase (Fig. 5A) or C6-ceramide (Fig. 5B) was able to induce the killing of p55-transfected cells as well as that of control R-A1 and parental MCF7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The cytolytic effect of SMase and C6-ceramide on these cells was specific, since the addition of phospholipase D (data not shown) or C6-dihydroceramide (Fig. 5B) at equivalent concentrations failed to induce cell killing. Furthermore, DNA fragmentation analysis indicates that C6-ceramide killed both TNF-sensitive and TNF-resistant MCF7 cells through an apoptotic pathway (Fig. 6). After 24 or 48 h of treatment of TNF-sensitive MCF7 cells, more apoptotic cells were observed upon C6-ceramide treatment than that upon TNF treatment, indicating that ceramide triggers apoptosis of these cells in a more direct manner than TNF.Fig. 6Analysis of DNA fragmentation in MCF7 and p55-transfected R-A1 cells. Cells were incubated with TNF (50 ng/ml) or C6-ceramide (10 μM) for 24 and 48 h. Qua"

To elucidate the ability of SCF to affect the erythropoietin signaling pathway, we studied the effect of SCF on EPOR phosphorylation, SHC/ERK-1 activity, and cell proliferation and apoptosis in EPO-dependent HCD57 cells. Treatment of these cells with SCF resulted in phosphorylation of the EPOR. However, SCF-dependent phosphorylation of the EPOR did not initiate an EPO-like intracellular signal. SCF induced proliferation, SHC phosphorylation, and activation of ERK-1 but did not activate the JAK/STAT pathway. SCF stimulated SHC phosphorylation and ERK-1 activation independent of the EPOR in cells where the EPOR was down-regulated; the presence of the EPOR appeared to facilitate SCF activation of SHC and ERK-1. Furthermore, treatment of HCD57 cells with SCF increased cell number over a 3-day treatment, but apoptosis was observed in these cells. These data may illustrate two distinct pathways for erythroid cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis in response to EPO, thereby providing a system to discriminate these intracellular signals.

https://openalex.org/W1987660914,"We have shown previously that neurotoxic venom secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) have specific receptors in brain membranes called N-type receptors that are likely to play a role in the molecular events leading to neurotoxicity of these proteins. The sPLA2 found in honey bee venom is neurotoxic and binds to this receptor with high affinity. In this paper, we have used a number of mutants of bee venom sPLA2 produced in Escherichia coli to determine the structural elements of this protein that are involved in its binding to N-type receptors. Mutations in the interfacial binding surface, in the Ca2+-binding loop and in the hydrophobic channel lead to a dramatic decrease in binding to N-type receptors, whereas mutations of surface residues localized in other parts of the sPLA2 structure do not significantly modify the binding properties. Neurotoxicity experiments show that mutants with low affinity for N-type receptors are devoid of neurotoxic properties, even though some of them retain high enzymatic activity. These results provide further evidence for the involvement of N-type receptors in neurotoxic processes associated with venom sPLA2s and identify the surface region surrounding the hydrophobic channel of bee venom sPLA2 as the N-type receptor recognition domain.

They are found in mammalian tissues and in the venoms of a wide range of organisms (insects, reptiles, amphibians, arachnids, coelenterates). Most sPLA2s require millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ as a catalytic cofactor and show broad specificity for phospholipids with different polar head groups and fatty acyl chains (2Dennis E.A. J.

The mammalian pancreatic sPLA2, the mammalian non-pancreatic inflammatory sPLA2, and the sPLA2 purified from honey bee venom (denoted bvPLA2) are prototypes of group I, II, and III sPLA2s, respectively. The structures of type I and II enzymes are very similar, but the structure of bvPLA2 is similar to those of the other sPLA2 only in its active site (6Scott D.L. Sigler P.B. Adv.

Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), while pancreatic group I sPLA2 is involved not only in digestion but is also endowed with other cellular functions such as the induction of cell proliferation (12Arita H. Hanasaki K. Nakano T. Oka S. Teraoka H. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19139-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and smooth muscle contraction (13Nakajima M. Hanasaki K.

Pharmacol. 1992; 216: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, most sPLA2s from venom are toxic enzymes: they can act as neurotoxins, myotoxins, anticoagulants, and they can also cause inflammation (15Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kim J. Fornasier V. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 807-811PubMed Google Scholar–18Strong P.N. Dowdall M.J. Hawthorne J.N. Cellular and Molecular Basis of Cholinergic Function.Ellis Horwoods. 1987; : 534-549Google Scholar). The existence of specific receptors for sPLA2s has been demonstrated recently (19Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using OS1 and OS2, two sPLA2s purified from Taipan snake Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus venom, two types of receptors have been characterized. The M-type receptor is a 180-kDa protein that was first characterized in rabbit skeletal muscle (20Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor binds various venom sPLA2s, including OS1 and OS2, but does not bind bvPLA2. It also binds pancreatic type and inflammatory type sPLA2s with high affinities (1-10 nM), suggesting that these sPLA2s are probably the endogenous ligands of this sPLA2 receptor (21Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The M-type receptor has been cloned recently from various animal species (21Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Notably, the interaction between the M-type receptor and sPLA2 has been studied both from the receptor side (25Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Teraoka H. Ohara O. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Nicolas J.-P. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Although the biological role of the M-type receptors remains to be clearly elucidated, this receptor has been proposed to be involved in many biological effects of the pancreatic sPLA2 (30Ohara O. Ishizaki J. Arita H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 117-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Another type of PLA2 receptor has been identified in rat brain using OS2 as a ligand and called the N (for neuronal)-type sPLA2 receptor (19Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-type receptors are highly expressed in brain, but are also present in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, liver, pancreas, and smooth muscle (31Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). They have been shown to consist of proteins of 36-51 and 85 kDa (19Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-type receptors have a pharmacological binding profile distinct from that of M-type receptors. They bind several neurotoxic sPLA2s, including OS2 and bvPLA2, with high affinity, but unlike M-type receptors they do not bind pancreatic and inflammatory type sPLA2s (19Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Kini R.M. Venom Phospholipase A2 Enzymes: Structure, Function and Mechanism.John Wiley & Sons. 1996; Google Scholar). These N-type receptors are thought to mediate some of the physiological, pathophysiological, and toxic effects of sPLA2s. The normal biological role(s) of N-type receptors is presently unknown. Based on the fact that these latter receptors bind neurotoxic sPLA2s but not non neurotoxic sPLA2s with very high affinities, we have suggested that N-type receptors are involved in the neurotoxicity of venom sPLA2s after intracerebroventricular injection (19Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Gandolfo G. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Gottesmann C. Pharmacol. & Toxicol. 1996; 78: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study is to identify the region of sPLA2s that is responsible for both their interaction with N-type receptors and their neurotoxicity. These studies were carried out using a series of mutants of the neurotoxic bvPLA2, a very specific ligand of the N-type receptors (32Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Kini R.M. Venom Phospholipase A2 Enzymes: Structure, Function and Mechanism.John Wiley & Sons. 1996; Google Scholar–34Fossier P. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Baux G. J. Physiol.

Science. 1990; 250: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). OS2 was purified and iodinated as described previously (19Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pa2 and Pa5, two sPLA2s from Heloderma suspectum were a generous gift from Prof. André Vandermeers (Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium). The bvPLA2 expression plasmid p6xHis-Kall-BV-PLA2-#2 has been described previously (36Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Technical grade guanidine hydrochloride and USP grade urea were purchased from AMRESCO (Solon, OH). The following commercial kits, Geneclean kit (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA), QIAGEN plasmid mini-kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), and Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA), were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose is from Qiagen. 1-Palmitoyl-2[10-(1-pyrene)decanoyl]-sn-glycerol-3-phosphomethanol lithium salt was prepared as described elsewhere (37Kim S. Master thesis, University of Washington. 1991; Google Scholar) or purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The GRASP program was obtained from Dr. Anthony Nicholls, Department of Biochemistry, Columbia University. All mutants were made using a PCR-based method. All primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Table I. Some of the primers contain a mixture of nucleotides so that several mutations at a single site were introduced in a single mutagenesis experiment. One-hundred μl of PCR reactions consist of 1 ng of template p6xHis-Kall-BV-PLA2-#2 (36Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim.

PCR reaction conditions were set at 96°C for 30 s, 45°C for 30 s (if no PCR product is detected, the annealing temperature was varied in the range 37-55°C), 2 min primer extension at 72°C, and this cycle was repeated 35 times. At the end of the 35th cycle, 10 min of extension at 72°C was used. PCR products were analyzed and purified by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose) to remove the unreacted primers and the template. The PCR product band was cut from the gel, and the DNA was recovered using the Geneclean kit. After restriction digestion, the PCR fragment was ligated into p6xHis-Kall-BV-PLA2-#1 (36Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that had been digested previously with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The constructs were used to transform XL1-Blue (Stratagene). The insert in p6xHis-Kall-BV-PLA2-#1 lacks the BamHI site that is present in the PCR product (36Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and restriction analysis with BamHI was used to identify the recombinant p6xHis-Kall-BV-PLA2-#1 that contains the PCR fragment. In many cases, the PCR mutagenesis primers also contain a second mutation that either adds or eliminates a restriction site to facilitate the identification of recombinant clones. After restriction mapping, plasmids from candidate clones were purified using the QIAGEN plasmid mini-kit, and the DNA was sequenced using the DyeDeoxy terminator sequencing kit on a model 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the primers described previously (36Dudler T.

Finally, the plasmid was transferred into M15/pRep4 cell line (36Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Open table in a new tab For the production of recombinant bvPLA2 mutants, cells were grown and induced as described (36Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R.

The fusion proteins were obtained by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described (36Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M.

The denatured fusion protein was refolded as described, and the protein was purified by chromatography on SP-Sephadex C-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described (36Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S.

The fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed against 5 mM Tris, pH 7.5. After dialysis, the solution was concentrated up to 4 mg of protein/ml in a Speed-Vac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Farmidale, NY). Mutant proteins were stored at −80°C. The protein concentrations of recombinant bvPLA2 solutions were obtained from the absorbance at 280 nm (38Ghomashchi F. Schuttel S. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9559-9569Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using commercial bvPLA2 (Boehringer Mannheim) as a standard (both methods gave similar results). The enzymatic activities of the mutants were assayed using a spectrofluorimeter (Jasco 821-FP) with the fluorescent substrate 1-palmitoyl-2[10-(1-pyrene)decanoyl]-sn-glycerol-3-phosphomethanol lithium salt (39Bayburt T.

Mutants in which a bvPLA2 residue was changed to cysteine require special comment. Analysis of these mutants with Ellman's reagent after refolding them in the presence of the cysteine/cystine redox couple buffer showed that in all cases these proteins lack free SH groups. This suggests that not only have all the 10 cysteines of wild-type bvPLA2 formed disulfides, but the added cysteines is engaged in a disulfide bond with free cysteine from the buffer. This result was confirmed by analysis of of the mutants by mass spectrometry and by the fact that treatment of these mutants with DTT under conditions that do not cleave the disulfide of wild-type enzyme results in the appearance of 0.7-1.0 equivalents of SH/mol of enzyme. The full details of these analyses will be reported elsewhere. Natural purified bvPLA2 (300 μg) was incubated with or without 1 unit N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim, catalog number 913 782) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM EDTA for 18 h at 37°C. After digestion, the mixtures were chromatographed on a C18 Waters column (4.6 × 250 mm) prewarmed at 30°C with a Beckman system gold apparatus. Elution was performed using an acetonitrile linear gradient in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.9% triethylamine, 0.001%β-mercaptoethanol, 27-40% acetonitrile for 35 min at 1.4 ml/min. The eluted fractions were lyophilized, resuspended in water, and assayed for protein concentration by measurement of the absorbance at 280 nm. 1.5 μg of the samples were then analyzed by high resolution SDS/Tris/Tricine gels (16.5%) under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein molecular mass markers were from Promega. All N-type receptor binding experiments were performed as described (19Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes, 125I-OS2, and competitors were incubated at 20°C in 0.5 or 1 ml of buffer (140 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Incubations were started by addition of rat brain membranes and filtered after 90 min of incubation through GF/C glass fiber filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine. Neurotoxic properties of the various recombinant sPLA2s have been determined by intracerebroventricular injections in adult male Balb/C mice (average weight, 20 g). Animals were anesthetized using a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg, Rhône Mérieux) and xylazine hydrochloride (12 mg/kg, Bayer Pharma). Injections of sPLA2s in a volume of 5 μl of saline solution were made into the right ventricle according to stereotaxic coordinates (40Lehmann A. Atlas Stéréotaxique du Cerveau de la Souris.Editions du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. 1974; Google Scholar). Lethality was checked 24 h after injection. A panel of mutants of recombinant bvPLA2 have been used to identify the region of the enzyme that is involved in binding to N-type receptors. Binding properties of these mutants and of wild-type bvPLA2 have been determined by competition binding experiments with 125I-OS2, which is the canonical labeled ligand for N-type receptors (19Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step toward the identification of the binding domain of sPLA2 involved in the interaction with N-type receptors, we have analyzed the binding properties of recombinant bvPLA2 expressed either as a fusion protein or after the removal of the N-terminal His-tag fusion peptide and compared their binding properties with those of the natural bvPLA2. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table II, the K0.5 values obtained for the recombinant forms of bvPLA2 (4.6 and 2.0 nM for recombinant cleaved bvPLA2 and recombinant fusion protein bvPLA2, respectively) are close to the K0.5 value measured for the natural purified bvPLA2 protein (0.79 nM). These results establish that recombinant forms of bvPLA2 expressed either as a fusion protein or as a free protein are good tools for the study of the molecular determinants of sPLA2 that are implicated in binding to N-type receptors. Furthermore, as both uncleaved fusion protein and cleaved recombinant bvPLA2 bind nearly equally well to N-type receptors, the different mutants have been used as recombinant proteins containing the N-terminal peptide extension.Table II.Binding properties and enzymatic activity of recombinant wild-type and mutant bee venom sPLA2ssPLA2Binding activity, K0.5 valuePLA2 activityaAll of the mutants were also assayed using the well established pH-stat method with vesicles of the anionic phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidylmethanol (36). The results are essentially the same, within 20%, as those obtained with the fluorimetric assay. In both assays, all of the mutants are tightly bound to vesicles, and thus the decrease in catalytic turnover is due to an increase in the interfacial Km, a decrease in the interfacial kcat, or a combination of both.nM% of rBVrbvPLA2fp2.0100rbvPLA24.6170bvPLA2 (purified)0.8183Interfacial binding surfaceI1C5215I2C375I78C/Y490/4.27/117F82C2807K85C/E69/8242/104K85E/K133E36069K85E/K94E/K133E>1030.22R23E/K85E/K133E>10318Y87F2.6152I91F9820D92C1433Ca2+-binding loopG12A/C>103/3537/17G12S/K14R5.3100N13C1243N14C/E42/1629/62K14E/R23E58010S15C1458Hydrophobic channel and active siteT57F/V131/5500.7/0.2T57D/E>103/>1030.8/0.4T57L1030.04D64A/N>103/131.2/5D64E/K66C2.785Other mutationsR23C/E10/2032/165R23E/R58A>1037.6F24C42102K25Q2.780T51C8.933T53C6.228R58A7380K66C/E2.5/1.797/100K72E5.5100K94E40100K122Q0.6110K133E9.480Δ99-1187.6>20a All of the mutants were also assayed using the well established pH-stat method with vesicles of the anionic phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidylmethanol (36Dudler T.

The results are essentially the same, within 20%, as those obtained with the fluorimetric assay.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 indicates a 3-6-fold difference in affinity between recombinant and natural bvPLA2. Natural bvPLA2 is heavily glycosylated on Asn-13 (41Shipolini R.A. Callewaert G.L. Cottrell R.C. Vernon C.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 42Kubelka V. Altmann F. Staudacher E. Tretter V. Marz L. Hard K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), but the recombinant forms of bvPLA2 have been produced in Escherichia coli where glycosylation does not occur. This suggests that differences in affinity between recombinant and natural bvPLA2 could be due to the presence of the carbohydrate moiety in the native enzyme. To address this point, we have enzymatically deglycosylated the natural bvPLA2 with N-glycosidase F and analyzed the binding properties of the purified deglycosylated enzyme. After treatment with N-glycosidase F, deglycosylated bvPLA2 was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Fig. 2A), and the resulting peaks were analyzed by SDS-Tricine gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). A shift in mobility of about 3 kDa was observed between the two main peaks that is consistent with the molecular mass of the carbohydrate moiety of bvPLA2 made of 14 N-glycans (42Kubelka V. Altmann F. Staudacher E. Tretter V. Marz L. Hard K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This suggests the major peak (peak B) effectively corresponds to deglycosylated bvPLA2. Furthermore, the migration position of the faster moving protein is identical to that of the non-glycosylated fraction that is present in natural bee venom (36Dudler T. Chen W.Q. Wang S. Schneider T.

The identification of peak B as deglycosylated bvPLA2 was further confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing, indicating that Asn-13 has been fully deglycosylated (not shown).

It is known that unliganded sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) binds to a receptor (RSHBG) on prostate membranes. The RSHBG·SHBG complex is rapidly activated by estradiol to stimulate adenylate cyclase, with a resultant increase in intracellular cAMP. In this paper we examine the effect of this system on a prostate gene product known to be activated by androgens, prostate-specific antigen. In serum-free organ culture of human prostates, dihydrotestosterone caused an increase in prostate specific antigen secretion. This event was blocked by the anti-androgens cyproterone acetate and hydroxyflutamide. In the absence of androgens, estradiol added to prostate tissue, whose RSHBG was occupied by SHBG, reproduced the results seen with dihydrotestosterone. Neither estradiol alone nor SHBG alone duplicated these effects. The estradiol·SHBG-induced increase in prostate-specific antigen was not blocked by anti-estrogens, but was blocked both by anti-androgens and a steroid (2-methoxyestradiol) that prevents the binding of estradiol to SHBG. Furthermore, an inhibitor of protein kinase A prevented the estradiol·SHBG-induced increase in prostate-specific antigen but not that which followed dihydrotestosterone. These data indicate that there is a signaling system that amalgamates steroid-initiated intracellular events with steroid-dependent occurrences generated at the cell membrane and that the latter signaling system proceeds by a pathway that involves protein kinase A.

These receptors have nascent transcriptional activity that is unmasked by estrogens, thus allowing the transcription of specific genes. The exclusivity of this model in accounting for estrogen action is disputed by observations that estrogens may act by non-ER-mediated mechanisms (5Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rosner W. Proc.

Furthermore, the plasticity of the model has had to be modified because of observations that the ER may initiate transcription in the absence of estrogens, so-called ligand-independent activation of transcription (2Ignar-Trowbridge D.M.

Through the intermediacy of the plasma protein, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), it causes the generation of cAMP (17Rosner W. Hryb D.J. Khan M.S. Nakhla A.M. Romas N.A. J.

Steroids. 1994; 59: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, unliganded SHBG binds to a receptor (RSHBG) on certain cell surfaces and the RSHBG·SHBG complex is rapidly activated by E2 to stimulate adenylate cyclase, with a resultant increase in intracellular cAMP. There is a paucity of information on events subsequent to the generation of cAMP by this system. In this paper we examine the effect of E2·SHBG·RSHBG on an androgen-responsive gene. The gene for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) contains an androgen response element. After binding its cognate ligand, the androgen receptor (AR) interacts with this response element to initiate PSA mRNA transcription (20Riegman P.H. Vlietstra R.J. van der Korput J.A. Brinkmann A.O.

Amsel I. Shaw N. Prins G.S. Kozlowski J.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 796-803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that, in the absence of androgens, E2 in concert with SHBG·RSHBG, acts at the cell membrane to cause secretion of PSA and that this effect is blocked by anti-androgens. This observation provides a first functional link between a classic steroid hormone receptor and a cell membrane-mediated steroidal effect. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), E2, and 2-methoxy-E2 were obtained from Steraloids, Wilton, MA. PKI, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA) was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. Highly purified SHBG was prepared and evaluated for purity as described previously (16Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It migrated as an uncontaminated doublet on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Because SHBG is isolated with an equimolar concentration of DHT, it was stripped of steroids with dextran-coated charcoal before use (16Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Heyns W. Van Baelen H. De Moor P. Clin. Chem. Acta. 1967; 18: 361-370Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Human prostate tissue was obtained and handled as described previously (5Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rosner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5402-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Prostate tissue was obtained at the time of transuretheral or open resection for benign prostatic hyperplasia and immediately brought to the laboratory under sterile conditions. Discolored portions were removed and the remaining tissue was divided into approximately 5-mm cubes. The tissue was placed in 60-mm Primaria culture dishes (Becton Dickinson Labware) in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 5% fetal bovine serum containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin, for 2-3 days. It then was minced into 1-mm3 portions and transferred to 16-mm wells in serum-free medium (0.5 ml of RPMI 1640) for about 18 h before beginning an experiment. All additions, e.g. SHBG, steroids, controls, were made in serum-free RPMI 1640. At the conclusion of all experiments, the medium was harvested and assayed for PSA by an immunoradiometric assay, Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA. The sensitivity of the assay is 0.1 ng/ml, and it has an intraassay coefficient of variation of ∼4.0%. Although it is well known that the normal prostate secretes PSA, the experimental data in vitro are largely based on the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. As is the case for that cell line, DHT caused an increase in PSA secretion in benign prostatic hyperplasia explants, Fig. 1. In LNCaP cells, E2 also caused increases in the secretion of PSA (23Lee C. Sutkowski D.M. Sensibar J.A. Zelner D. Kim I. Amsel I. Shaw N. Prins G.S. Kozlowski J.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 796-803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That effect was due to the mutated AR in those cells which permits the binding of estrogens as well as androgens (25Veldscholte J. Ris-Staplers C. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. Van Rooij H.C.J. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The normal human prostate contains an ER (26Lepor H. Walsh P.C. Urol. Clin. N. Am. 1990; 17: 461-475Google Scholar), but unlike LNCaP cells, does not increase PSA secretion in response to E2 (Fig. 1). However, in the presence of SHBG, E2 caused a dose-dependent increase in PSA secretion that was as great as that observed in response to DHT (Fig. 1). Because E2·SHBG stimulates RSHBG to increase intracellular cAMP (5Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rosner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5402-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Nakhla A.M. Ding V.D.H. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rhodes L. Smith R.G. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2259-2262PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the ability of increases in intracellular cAMP, brought about either by forskolin or the addition of cAMP to the medium, to affect PSA secretion. The effects of DHT and E2·SHBG were mimicked both by forskolin (which increases intracellular cAMP) and a cell-permeant analog of cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (Fig. 2). The response to 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP was biphasic with a stimulation of PSA secretion at 1 and 10 nM that diminished at 100 nM and disappeared at 1000 nM. We have observed a similar biphasic effect of cAMP on the growth of a human prostate cancer cell line (ALVA-41) (28Nakhla A.M. Rosner W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4126-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). cAMP begins its signaling cascade, by activating a protein kinase (PKA), the catalytic subunit of which then phosphorylates one or more proteins, which results in a change in their biological activity. Thus, if E2·SHBG increases PSA secretion through this pathway and DHT does not, inhibition of the activation of PKA should prevent E2·SHBG, but not DHT, motivated PSA secretion. That is precisely what occurs when PKA is inhibited with the PKA inhibitor, PKI (Fig. 3).Fig. 3The effect of the inhibition of PKA on induced PSA secretion. These experiments were carried out in triplicate on tissue from four patients. Tissue from two patients were used in the experiments represented by each of the two panels. Experimental details were as in the legend to Fig. 1. PKI, 1 μM, was added 30 min before DHT or E2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the participation of the ER in the response of PSA to E2·SHBG, anti-estrogens were added to prostate minces together with E2 to determine if these agents altered the effects of E2·SHBG. The increase in PSA caused by E2·SHBG was blocked neither by tamoxifen nor by the pure anti-estrogen ICI 164,384 (Fig. 4). However, 2-methoxy-E2, a hormonally inactive metabolite of E2 that binds tightly to SHBG (29Dunn J.F. Merriam G.R. Eil C. Kone S. Loriaux D.L. Nisula B.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2259-2262PubMed Google Scholar), blocked the effect of E2·SHBG on PSA secretion (Fig. 4). The promoter of the PSA gene has an androgen response element, and PSA secretion (22Henttu P. Vihko P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1051-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lee C. Sutkowski D.M. Sensibar J.A.

Cancer. 1995; 75: 2021-2026Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined the effect of hydroxyflutamide and cyproterone acetate, both potent anti-androgens, on the E2·SHBG-mediated increase in PSA secretion. As expected (31Berns E.M. de Boer W. Mulder E. Prostate. 1986; 9: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Warriar N. Page N. Koutsilieris M. Govindan M.V. Prostate. 1994; 24: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), both anti-androgens blocked the effect of DHT on PSA secretion (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, they also blocked the effect of E2·SHBG on PSA secretion. Although estrogens can bind to and activate the mutated LNCaP androgen receptor (25Veldscholte J. Ris-Staplers C. Kuiper G.G.J.M. Jenster G. Berrevoets C. Claassen E. Van Rooij H.C.J. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mulder E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Prostate. 1992; 21: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), there is no evidence that this is the case in nonmalignant prostate cells. Since E2 is not exerting its effect by binding to the AR, e.g. it is not its cognate ligand, the E2-induced secretion of PSA observed in this study is indicative of a ligand-independent activation of the AR. The inhibition of transactivation of the estrogen and progesterone receptors by appropriate antihormones, in the absence of their cognate ligands, has been part of the evidence adduced to support the concept of ligand-independent activation of these receptors (reviewed in 15O'Malley B.W. Schrader W.T. Mani S. Smith C. Weigel N.L. Conneely O.M. Clark J.H. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 333-347PubMed Google Scholar). Our demonstration of the blockade of an AR-mediated effect by an anti-androgen, in the absence of androgens, is consonant with observations first made by Culig et al. (34Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5474-5478PubMed Google Scholar). They used prostate cancer cell lines, cotransfected with an AR expression vector and an androgen-responsive reporter, to show that, in the absence of androgens, AR-mediated gene transcription could be driven by keratinocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor I. The transactivation induced by each of these was inhibited by anti-androgens. More recently, Nazareth and Weigel (35Nazareth L.V. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19900-19907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) showed that forskolin transactivated the human AR cotransfected into CV-1 cells with an appropriate reporter construct. Like the response to androgens, the response to forskolin was blocked by anti-androgens. Furthermore, PKI (an inhibitor of PKA) markedly diminished the response not only to forskolin but also to androgens. Thus, these data not only confirm that AR can undergo ligand-independent activation, but suggest a role for the PKA pathway in androgen initiated activation of the AR in this model. Although the data in that communication are generally consonant with our observations, the inhibition of androgen-induced reporter activity by PKI is at odds with the inability of PKI to inhibit DHT-induced PSA secretion (Fig. 3). It is reasonable to hypothesize that this important variance may reflect the difference between observations made on prostate explants and those made on transfected, non-prostatic cell lines. Ikonen et al. (36Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Kallio P.J. Reinikainen P. Jänne O.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) elicited synergism between androgens and activators of PKA (in cells cotransfected with an AR expression plasmid and a reporter containing two androgen response elements); however, they could not demonstrate ligand-independent activation of the AR. The reasons for these discrepancies are undoubtedly several but probably include the fact that they transfected cells with an expression plasmid containing the rat AR, whereas the other studies were all human AR-based. Although the existence of the RSHBG system has been apparent for a number of years, it is only recently that studies dealing with its biology have appeared. DHT, but not E2, caused an increase in the rate of growth of ALVA-41 cells (a human prostate cancer cell line) in serum-containing media (37Nakhla A.M. Rosner W. Steroids. 1994; 59: 586-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but failed to do so in serum free media (28Nakhla A.M. Rosner W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4126-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the introduction of SHBG enabled both DHT and E2 to enhance the growth of these cells in serum free media. Furthermore, the increase in growth was as great as that seen with DHT in serum-containing media (28Nakhla A.M. Rosner W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4126-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Working with a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), Fortunati et al. (38Fortunati N. Fissore F. Fazzari A. Becchis M. Comba A. Catalano M.G. Berta L. Frairia R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 686-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the RSHBG system antagonized the E2-induced growth of these cells. The data supported their conclusion that this effect was not caused by the sequestration of E2 by SHBG. Growth is a complex phenomenon, and the mechanisms underlying these observations on ALVA-41 and MCF-7 cells will undoubtedly be difficult to sort out. The observations in this communication deal with a simpler system and should be more amenable to a dissection of mechanisms. There are a number of general ways in which E2·SHBG·RSHBG-promoted increases in PSA secretion might be accomplished. PSA is synthesized and secreted by the prostate epithelial, but not the stromal, cell. However, although E2·SHBG·RSHBG-mediated increases in cAMP occur in the epithelial cell, both normal (5Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Romas N.A. Rosner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5402-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and cancerous (16Nakhla A.M. Khan M.S. Rosner W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Fortunati N. Fissore F. Fazzari A. Becchis M. Comba A. Catalano M.G. Berta L. Frairia R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 686-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the increases are most robust in the prostate stromal cell. Thus, although all the elements (RSHBG, AR, and PSA) needed to participate in E2-induced increases in PSA are contained in the epithelial cell, the stromal cell may be involved. That the stromal cell products, keratinocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor I all have been shown to activate the AR (34Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5474-5478PubMed Google Scholar), is consistent with such a mechanism. Furthermore, stromal cell conditioned medium enhanced DHT-induced PSA secretion by LNCaP cells (39Fong C.J. Sherwood E.R. Braun E.J. Berg L.A. Lee C. Kozlowski J.M. Prostate. 1992; 21: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations raise the possibility of stromal cell participation in the E2-induced increase in PSA secretion. In summary, we have shown that E2 can activate a typical AR-mediated event, PSA synthesis and secretion. It does so by activating SHBG·RSHBG and makes clear that there is cross-talk between a classic intracellular steroid hormone receptor and a steroid hormone-engendered event at the cell membrane. We thank Diagnostic Products Inc. for providing kits with which to measure PSA."

EC 1.14.99.1) is a bifunctional enzyme containing a cyclooxygenase activity that catalyzes the bisoxygenation of arachidonic acid to form the peroxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and a peroxidase activity that catalyzes the reduction of PGG2 to PGH2 (for a review, see 1Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1083: 1-17Crossref Scopus (572) Google Scholar). PGH2 is the common precursor of biologically active prostaglandins, thromboxane and prostacyclin. PGHS, hence, occupies a pivotal position in prostanoid biosynthesis. There are two isoforms of PGHS. The type 1 PGHS (PGHS-1) is constitutively expressed in most mammalian cells, whereas the expression of PGHS-2 is induced by cytokines and mitogenic factors (2Wu K.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 33: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Both isoforms of PGHS are important in catalyzing prostacyclin synthesis in endothelial cells. PGHS-1 catalyzes the synthesis of basal levels of prostacyclin, while prostacyclin productions by inflammatory agents correlate with the induced expression of the PGHS-2 enzyme (3Wu K.K. Hatzakis H.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9049-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have been interested in understanding the transcriptional regulation of the constitutive PGHS-1 gene in endothelial cells. The human PGHS-1 gene spans about 22 kb on chromosome 9 containing 11 exons (5Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 6Wang L-H. Hajibeigi A. Xu X-M. Loose-Mitchell D. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The coding region encodes a 599-amino acid protein including a 23-amino acid signal peptide (5Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of the human PGHS-1 gene has multiple transcription start sites (TSS), does not possess the canonical TATA or CAAT box, and is GC-rich. These features are consistent with those of a housekeeping gene. The 5′-flanking region of PGHS-1 bears several putative binding sites for transcriptional activators (6Wang L-H. Hajibeigi A. Xu X-M. Loose-Mitchell D. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region has not been delineated. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the basal promoter function is activated has not been elucidated. By fusing the 5′-flanking region to luciferase cDNA, we have recently demonstrated promoter activity in the 5′-flanking region of the PGHS-1 gene, but the promoter activity was very weak (6Wang L-H. Hajibeigi A. Xu X-M. Loose-Mitchell D. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We postulate that other cis-acting elements are important in the basal promoter activation of the PGHS-1 gene. We report here that binding of Sp1 and/or its closely related proteins to two Sp1 binding sites are critical for activating the basal transcription of the PGHS-1 gene.DISCUSSIONResults from this study demonstrate that two Sp1 elements are essential for basal transcription of the human PGHS-1 gene. Evidence to support this consists of specific binding of purified Sp1 and nuclear extract proteins to these two regions and a marked loss of promoter activity by Sp1 site mutations. Sp1 is a sequence-specific, ubiquitously expressed nuclear factor essential for basal expression of a variety of eukaryotic genes (for review, see 20Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar). It confers transcriptional activation by interacting with transcription-associated factors, thereby facilitating the assembly of the basal transcription machinery (21Chen J-L. Attardi L. Verrjzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Reported data suggest that for activation of constitutive transcription of mammalian TATA-less gene, Sp1 is required to bind to a spatially defined region, within 100 base pairs upstream from the TSS (22Zhang D-E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24892-24901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, Sp1 involvement in basal transcription of the PGHS-1 gene is different from that of other reported mammalian housekeeping genes in that two Sp1 sites required for basal transcription are separated by about 500 bp on the 5′-flanking region. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of critical involvement of two distantly located Sp1 sites in the activation of basal mammalian housekeeping gene transcription.It has been reported that the activity of the thymidine kinase promoter of the herpes simplex virus and an artificially constructed promoter is enhanced by interaction of two spatially widely separated Sp1 proteins to form Sp1 multimers (27Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 28Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 29Su W. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Echols H. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the promoter region by electron microscopy revealed DNA looping whereby the separated Sp1 proteins were brought into contact to form a tetramer followed by multiple tetramer formation (30Mashangelo I.A. Courey A.J. Wall J.S. Jackson S.P. Hough P.V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5670-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that basal PGHS-1 transcription regulated by two Sp1 sites may be mediated by a similar mechanism.It is estimated from the mutation experiments that these two Sp1 enhancer elements contribute to about 70-75% of the promoter activity conferred by the 2.0-kb promoter/enhancer fragment of PGHS-1 gene. Full basal promoter activity may require the involvement of additional enhancer element(s). Comparison of the promoter activity conferred by the construct shown in Fig. 5d versus Fig. 5f suggests that the region between nucleotides −257 and −21 bears additional enhancer elements important in full PGHS-1 gene expression. In this region, besides the functionally active Sp1 site at −105 to −111, there is another Sp1 site located at −83 to −89. The 3′-mutant fragment −257/−126 (Fig. 2) in which both Sp1 sites are removed exhibited almost no promoter activity. This result implies that the Sp1 site at −83 to −89 may be important in PGHS-1 basal transcription in vivo However, this 3′-deletion mutant is probably devoid of the binding site for the transcription initiation complex and consequently is expected to confer minimal (if any) promoter activity, even when enhancer elements are present distally such as the −916/−126 mutant (Fig. 2). Since Sp1 did not bind to the Sp1 site at −83 to −89 by DNase I footprinting, it would be highly unlikely that this Sp1 site is functionally active. Other sites in this region including a putative PEA3 binding site (−155AGGAAG−150) may be the potential enhancer element for a full PGHS-1 promoter activity. This is now being investigated.It has recently been reported in different types of cells that PGHS-1 gene expression is stimulated by serum, cytokines, or growth factors (for a review, see 2Wu K.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 33: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have shown that endothelial PGHS-1 expression is stimulated approximately 2-fold over the basal level by PMA and interleukin-1β (18Xu X-M. Tang J-L. Hajibeigi A. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Wu K.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C259-C264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, our results indicate that PMA increased the promoter activity conferred by the 5′-flanking promoter/enhancer of the PGHS-1 gene in HUVECs. Stimulation of the promoter activity by PMA is not entirely dependent on the two Sp1 sites but requires additional elements. Sp1 is involved in stimulation of gene expression by interacting with other transcriptional activators such as GATA, NF-κB, Egr-1, YY1, and Rb (31Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T.

It is possible that PMA stimulates PGHS-1 transcription by a similar mechanism. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism by which PMA stimulates PGHS-1 promoter activity.Nuclear extracts of HUVECs form two distinct bands with distal or proximal probes and with consensus Sp1 recognition sequences. Both bands are specifically competed by unlabeled Sp1 cognate oligonucleotides but not by Sp1 mutant, AP-2, or NF-κB sequences. These two bands are complexes of DNA with Sp1 and/or Sp1-related proteins. Purified Sp1, on the other hand, forms only a single DNA·Sp1 complex with fragment −119 to −94 (Fig. 4C). These results are similar to those reported in several recent studies (13Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been attributed to binding of Sp1 and a closely related protein to Sp1 recognition sites (38Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Three Sp1-related proteins, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4, have been identified (39Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 40Kingsley C. Winto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 41Hagen G.

A. 1994; 92: 192-196Crossref Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These isoforms of Sp1 bind to Sp1 recognition sites and are antigenically very close to Sp1. Hence, despite specific inhibition of binding by Sp1 cognate sequences and supershift by specific Sp1 antibodies, the additional band is probably formed as a result of binding of a Sp1-related protein to the Sp1 binding site.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of the human PGHS-1 gene has multiple transcription start sites (TSS), does not possess the canonical TATA or CAAT box, and is GC-rich. These features are consistent with those of a housekeeping gene. The 5′-flanking region of PGHS-1 bears several putative binding sites for transcriptional activators (6Wang L-H. Hajibeigi A. Xu X-M. Loose-Mitchell D. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region has not been delineated. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the basal promoter function is activated has not been elucidated. By fusing the 5′-flanking region to luciferase cDNA, we have recently demonstrated promoter activity in the 5′-flanking region of the PGHS-1 gene, but the promoter activity was very weak (6Wang L-H. Hajibeigi A. Xu X-M. Loose-Mitchell D. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We postulate that other cis-acting elements are important in the basal promoter activation of the PGHS-1 gene. We report here that binding of Sp1 and/or its closely related proteins to two Sp1 binding sites are critical for activating the basal transcription of the PGHS-1 gene."

This hormone is not secreted via the classical vesicular pathway, and the identification of intracellular proteins that facilitate its release remains lacking.

The growth of tumors beyond several millimeters in diameter requires the recruitment of capillaries into the tumor and the establishment of a tumor blood supply (1Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). Controlling or influencing this process is the paracrine communication between tumor, stromal and endothelial cells (2Klagsbrun M. Ryan U.S. Endothelial Cells.

In addition, since bFGF regulates endothelial cell growth and migration, factors that induce the release of bFGF would also facilitate tumor angiogenesis (8Folkman J. Klagsburn M.

The mechanism by which bFGF is released from cells remains to be elucidated. bFGF is actually four different translation products of a single message species exhibiting apparent molecular masses of 18, 22, 22.5, and 24 kDa (9Moscatelli D.

A. 1989; 86: 3978-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The translation of the 18-kDa species begins at a classical AUG start site whereas the higher molecular weight species (HMW bFGF) are initiated at CUG codons 5′ to the AUG start site (11Florkiewicz R.Z. Sommer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3978-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Neither the 18-kDa nor the HMW bFGF species possess a signal sequence and therefore are not secreted via the classical vesicular pathway involving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Indeed, agents that block trafficking through the Golgi-ER pathway do not inhibit the release of bFGF from cells, and novel pathways for bFGF release have been suggested (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Majak R.A. Buechlor R.D. Florkeiwicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 13Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 151: 81-93Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The identification of proteins involved in the release of bFGF remains lacking however. Data generated in this report suggest that the 27-kDa heat shock protein (HSP27) is involved in the non-lytic release of bFGF. Endothelial cells express a basal level of the HSP27, which is further enhanced by transcriptional up-regulation in response to estrogens (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Higher levels of HSP27 expression have been shown to affect microfilament assembly and morphology as well as cell growth (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, we have demonstrated that expression of human HSP27 in bovine arterial endothelial cells (BAECs) via transfection results in a 2-3-fold enhancement in the rate of cell growth (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These characteristics make HSP27 a likely control point in angiogenic processes where estrogens play key regulatory roles, e.g. breast tumor angiogenesis (2Klagsbrun M. Ryan U.S. Endothelial Cells. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 38-50Google Scholar, 3Torrey R.J. Rongish B.J. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1992; 27: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). HSP27 has several demonstrable functions that are attributed to its ability to act as a molecular chaperon, a property it shares with the highly homologous lens crystallins (16Hickey E. Brandon S.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To begin to investigate a role for HSP27 in breast tumor angiogenesis, stably transfected BAECs expressing human HSP27 or control BAECs (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were co-cultured with the breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells and the growth of each cell type was measured. We consistently found that the culture of the HSP27 BAECs with the tumor cells resulted in increased tumor cell growth if β-estradiol was included in the cultures. This was true even if the MCF-7 cells exhibited decreased estrogen receptor levels and were no longer capable of exhibiting a mitogenic response to β-estradiol alone (i.e were estrogen unresponsive). Conditioned media obtained from β-estradiol-treated HSP27 BAECs also induced MCF-7 cell growth, indicating that a soluble factor was released from the HSP27 BAECs. An anti-bFGF blocking antibody inhibited the potentiated MCF-7 growth, and analysis of HSP27 BAEC-conditioned media confirmed that bFGF was the paracrine factor released from the HSP27 BAECs. Reducing the expression of the endogenous HSP27 homolog (HSP25) by infection with HSP27 antisense adenovirus resulted in decreased bFGF secretion. Immunoprecipitation using either anti-HSP27 or anti-bFGF antibodies co-precipitated the two proteins, suggesting that a direct interaction exists between HSP27 and bFGF. These data suggest that HSP27 may act as a chaperon of bFGF, facilitating bFGF release from endothelial cells. Low passage bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells were a generous gift of Dr. W. Laug, Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, CA. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Bio Whittaker, Inc. except where otherwise noted. Cells were cultured under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 25 mM HEPES and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Intergen) and 1 mM each of sodium pyruvate, penicillin, streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids. Cells were plated at a density of 0.7-2 × 104 cells/cm2 and passaged when confluent (approximately 1 × 105/cm2). Clones of stably transfected BAECs expressing human HSP27 were generated as described (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, pHS2711, a plasmid containing a genomic clone of the human HSP27 gene (16Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J. Weber L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4127-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) or the vector plasmid (Bluescript) were transfected into low passage BAECs using cationic lipid (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.). The neomycin resistance-carrying plasmid, pCDM8neo, was co-tranfected for the purpose of selecting transfected cells from non-transfected cells. Cells were cultured in the presence of 700 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulfate, Life Technologies, Inc.). The breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection at passage 149 (ATCC HTB-22). This cell line is estrogen receptor positive and exhibits a mitogenic response to β-estradiol. Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 10 μg/ml bovine pancreas insulin. To generate estrogen-unresponsive cells (i.e. cells that do not exhibit a mitogenic response to β-estradiol), MCF-7 cells were subcultured into Phenol Red-free minimal essential medium containing sodium pyruvate, insulin, and 10% steroid-depleted fetal calf serum prepared by dextran/charcoal stripping (25Grady L.H. Nonneman D.J. Rottinghaus G.E. Welshons W.V. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3321-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These cultures represent non-clonal populations of cells selected for the ability to grow in steroid-deficient media that express reduced estrogen receptor levels. Triplicate wells in 12-well plates were seeded with 2.5 × 104 HSP27 BAECs (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or vector control BAECs in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. After 24 h in culture, the BAECs were washed three times with Phenol Red-free and serum-free minimal essential medium containing 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate (assay media). Assay media, with or without 100 nMβ-estradiol was then placed onto the BAECs or into empty wells for the generation of mock conditioned media for the No BAEC controls. The endothelial cells were then cultured for 18 h, after which the conditioned media were collected. 2.5 × 104 MCF-7 cells were seeded into 12 wells and cultured for 1-2 days prior to an experiment. The MCF-7 cells were washed three times in assay media, and the BAEC-conditioned media, to which tritiated methyl thymidine (1 μCi/ml, Amersham Corp.) was added, was placed on the MCF-7 cells. The MCF-7 cells were cultured for 18-22 h, and the amount of tritiated thymidine incorporated into the MCF-7 cells was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In experiments testing the effect of antibodies on growth, 20 μg/ml of either anti-bFGF (Sigma, clone FB-8) or an irrelevant isotype matched monoclonal antibody was added to the BAEC-conditioned media and incubated for 30 min prior to the addition to the MCF-7 cells. T-75 flasks of transfected HSP27 BAEC or vector control BAEC, at approximately 75% confluence, were placed in assay media (6 ml/flask) with or without 100 nMβ-estradiol and cultured for 18-24 h. The media were collected and the cells were washed three times in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline and then lysed with 300-500 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in 10 mM imidazole, 40 mM KCl and 10 mM EGTA (plus 10 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14000 × g for 5 min. Protein content of the Triton lysates was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). 75 μl of Triton lysate was solubilized immediately in 4 X reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The remaining material on the flasks (the Triton X-100-insoluble material) was washed 3 times in lysis buffer and then solubilized in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The conditioned media were cleared of cellular material by centrifugation at 800 × g, and 5.5 mls transferred into 5.5 ml of ice-cold 12% trichloroacetic acid. After an incubation on ice for 30 min, the precipitated material was pelleted by centrifugation at 46000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The pelleted material was resuspended in 0.75 ml of cold 5% TCA and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. An additional wash of the centrifuge tubes with 0.75 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid was combined with the resuspended precipitated material and centrifuged at 14000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The resulting pellets were allowed to air dry and then solubilized in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The conditioned media samples were neutralized with NaOH and all the samples applied to a 12% w/v acrylamide gel. Equivalent loading of each type of sample was obtained using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay results to calculate the volume of sample to add. Also loaded were serially diluted (2-fold) samples of rbFGF, beginning with 15 ng of rbFGF for the purpose of generating a standard curve. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and stained with the blocking anti-bFGF antibody using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Densitometric analysis was performed using the Eagle Eye II computerized digital camera and Eagle Sight 3.0 software (Stratagene). Adenovirus constructs were generated from replication-deficient adenovirus in which the EIA and EIB regions had been deleted. Sequence representing human HSP27 cDNA antisense was inserted behind a cytomegalovirus promoter which drove expression. Control adenovirus was the replication-deficient adenovirus lacking insert. HSP27 antisense or control virus was added to confluent T-75 flasks of a vector-transfected control clone at a concentration of 108 virons/ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum for 1 day. The media were removed, and the cells were washed three times in assay media. Assay media containing 100 nMβ-estradiol were added, and the cells were cultured for an additional day. Samples were prepared and analyzed for bFGF content by the immunoblot analysis described above. In addition, the blot was reprobed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against murine HSP25 (StressGen) and demonstrated itself to cross-react with bovine HSP25 (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Triton lysates of HSP27 BAECs were prepared as described above and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HSP27-Sepharose (G3.1, StressGen), anti-bFGF-Sepharose (FB-8, Sigma), or non-immune mouse IgG-Sepharose. The affinity matrices were prepared per manufacturer instructions using cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) with coupling performed at a ratio 1.0 mg of antibody per 1.0 ml of swelled gel. The lysates were precleared by incubation with non-immune mouse IgG-Sepharose (100 μl of beads/500 μl of lysate) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with 100 μl of anti-HSP27-, anti-bFGF-, or non-immune mouse IgG-conjugated Sepharose CL-4B for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with 1.5 ml of lysis buffer and then eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0. The eluates were neutralized and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis along with the starting material. The blots were first probed with the anti-bFGF antibody and then probed with the anti-HSP27 monoclonal antibody. To demonstrate a role for HSP27 in breast tumor angiogenesis, breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7 cells) were cultured in Transwell inserts above growing BAECs. We consistently found that the growth of the MCF-7 cells could be enhanced if these cells were either cultured with BAECs expressing human HSP27 (HSP27 BAECs) or cultured in the media conditioned by growing HSP27 BAECs, if the HSP27 BAECs were first treated with β-estradiol (Fig. 1). This mitogenic response of the MCF-7 cells was absolutely dependent on treatment of the HSP27 BAECs with β-estradiol. In the absence of β-estradiol, HSP27 BAEC culture had no effect on MCF-7 growth. For example, the culture of estrogen-unresponsive MCF-7 cells (see “Discussion”) in the conditioned media obtained from β-estradiol-treated HSP27 BAECs generated thymidine incorporation 1.54 ± 0.2 times that of control MCF-7 cultures (compare filled bars in Fig. 1, mean ± S.D., n = 5). Importantly, the addition of fresh β-estradiol to the conditioned media obtained from HSP27 BAECs not treated with β-estradiol failed to elicit a mitogenic response. In addition, MCF-7 culture in mock conditioned media containing β-estradiol (i.e. media cultured in the absence of cells) also failed to enhance growth (Fig. 1). This demonstrates that the estrogen-dependence of the enhanced MCF-7 growth is a consequence of β-estradiol affecting the HSP27 BAECs and not the MCF-7 cells. The enhanced MCF-7 growth was absolutely dependent on HSP27 expression in the BAECs, since co-culture with vector-transfected control cells or culture in their conditioned media did not result in enhanced thymidine incorporation into the MCF-7 cells. Thus, both enhanced HSP27 levels and β-estradiol treatment are required for the stimulation of MCF-7 cells. These data suggest that β-estradiol releases a paracrine factor from HSP27 BAECs and that HSP27 somehow facilitates this release. Stimulation of both tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis is partly dependent on paracrine communication (3Torrey R.J. Rongish B.J. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1992; 27: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) such as that suggested by the induction of MCF-7 cell growth by β-estradiol treatment of HSP27 BAECs. bFGF is a potent mitogen of endothelial cells that synthesize and store the growth factor (27Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 9: 115-165Crossref Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). To determine if the paracrine factor in the HSP27 BAEC-conditioned media responsible for the potentiated MCF-7 growth was indeed bFGF, 20 μg/ml of a function blocking anti-bFGF monoclonal antibody was included in the HSP27 BAEC-conditioned media. As shown in Fig. 1, this antibody completely abrogated the enhanced tritiated thymidine incorporation, whereas an isotype-matched control antibody did not. These data indicate that bFGF is the paracrine mitogenic factor released from the estrogen-treated HSP27 BAECs. To determine if the enhanced MCF-7 growth is correlative with increased bFGF secretion from the HSP27 BAECS, HSP27-expressing and control BAECs were placed in serum-free assay media (defined in Fig. 1), with or without β-estradiol, and cultured for 18 h. The conditioned media were cleared of cellular material and then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, solubilized for SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the monoclonal anti-bFGF antibody. Also included on the gels were Triton X-100 lysates of the cultures, the Triton-insoluble material (solubilized by SDS extraction), and, for the purpose of generating a standard curve, titrating amounts of rbFGF. In a representative experiment (Fig. 2, panel A), HSP27 BAECs and vector control BAECs, in the absence of β-estradiol, secreted 4.8 and 5.1 ng of bFGF/mg of protein in the Triton extract, respectively. Upon treatment of the transfectants with 100 nMβ-estradiol, the amount of bFGF released by the HSP27 BAECs increased to 10.2 ng of bFGF/mg of Triton lysate protein, with increases in all the bFGF forms evident. The amount of bFGF in the conditioned media of the control BAECs treated with β-estradiol in Fig. 2 was 5.2 ng of bFGF/mg of Triton lysate protein. Estrogen treatment of the HSP27 BAECs resulted in an average 2.4 ± 0.2-fold enhancement (n = 4) of bFGF released into the media, increasing the media concentration from 240-320 pg/ml to 512-730 pg/ml. The higher concentration range, which supported a mitogenic response in our culture system, is above the ED50 of bFGF for other cell types in culture (e.g. 3T3 fibroblasts (11Florkiewicz R.Z. Sommer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3978-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar)). In contrast, the control BAECs did not release additional bFGF upon β-estradiol treatment (+estrogen/−estrogen = 1.1 ± 0.07, n = 4). Although the transfectants released equivalent amounts of bFGF, HSP27 BAECs preferentially secreted HMW bFGF, with little or undetectable amounts of 18-kDa bFGF released. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the HSP27 BAECs secrete a disproportionate amount of HMW bFGF. In the absence of β-estradiol treatment, the average percentage of the secreted bFGF representing HMW bFGF was 94.5 ± 6.5% and 62 ± 8% for cultures of HSP27 BAECs and vector control BAECs, respectively (n = 4). Upon β-estradiol treatment, the average relative amount of HMW bFGF in the HSP27 BAEC-conditioned media dropped to 76 ± 6.8% whereas the relative amount of HMW bFGF released by the control cells did not change significantly. The average absolute amount (ng/mg of cellular protein) of HMW bFGF in the HSP27 BAEC-conditioned media increased 2-fold whereas 18-kDa bFGF levels increased at least 3-fold. The greater release of the 18-kDa bFGF accounts for the drop in the relative percentage of HMW bFGF in the HSP27 BAEC conditioned media. In addition to probing the immunoblots with anti-bFGF, the blots were reprobed with antibody specific for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as a measure of lytic and non-directed release. Importantly, estrogen treatment of the BAECs had little effect on the percentage of cellular glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase released from the cells. Densiometric analysis determined that BAECs released an average of 3 ± 1% (n = 3) of the total cellular glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase regardless of HSP27 expression or the presence or absence of estrogen in the culture media. In contrast, the percentage of total culture bFGF that was secreted into the media increased from 9.1 ± 1.4% to 25 ± 1.4% upon β-estradiol treatment of HSP27 BAEC cells. Given this difference and the fact the HSP27-expressing clones exhibited the same viability as control clones with or without estrogen treatment (92 ± 4%, n = 6), it is apparent that the estrogen-induced release of bFGF from HSP27 BAECs is not due to cell lysis. To determine if the enhanced release of bFGF is the result of a general enhancement of protein secretion, cultures of HSP27 BAECs and vector control BAECs were cultured in media containing [35S]methionine for 5 h and then placed in serum-free assay media for 18 h. The media were trichloroacetic acid precipitated, and Triton extracts were prepared from the cells. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into the precipitated proteins was determined and found to be 990 and 1040 cpm/mg of cellular protein for the HSP27 BAECs treated with estrogen and untreated, respectively. Thus, there was no general increase in the level of protein secretion as measured in this manner. Vector-transfected BAEC-secreted proteins had specific activities of 820 and 890 cpm/mg Triton lysate protein for estrogen-treated and non-treated cells, respectively. Increased levels of HSP27 in endothelial cells are thus correlative with increased estrogen-induced bFGF release. To determine if reduced levels of HSP27 would abrogate this response, BAEC cells were infected with either non-replicating control or HSP27-antisense adenovirus vectors. The expression of the bovine HSP27 homolog (HSP25) was dramatically decreased in the antisense-infected cells (Fig. 3). Infection of 107 virus particles/cm2 of culture area for 2 days reduces HSP25 levels by a third to one-half as measured by densitometry of immunoblots using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against murine HSP25 (Fig. 3). Infection with control virus had no effect on HSP25 levels. The viability of all the infected BAEC cultures was 96 ± 1.3% (n = 4), and neither virus affected overall secretion of proteins into the conditioned media. The amount of radioactivity of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins secreted into the media were determined to be 13,000 and 15,200 cpm/mg of cellular protein for antisense- and control-infected BAECs, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, infection of the antisense adenovirus dramatically reduced the level of bFGF in the culture media, whereas the control virus had no effect. No quantitative differences were noted in the amount of bFGF present in either the Triton-soluble or Triton-insoluble cellular fractions (Fig. 3). It thus appears that, not only does HSP27 expression correlate with bFGF release, but HSP27 may be necessary for bFGF release. To begin to elucidate the role of HSP27 in bFGF release, immunoprecipitations of cell extracts using immobilized anti-HSP27 and anti-bFGF monoclonal antibodies were performed. Eluted material was then subjected to immunoblot analyses using the same antibodies. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, anti-HSP27 antibody precipitated HSP27 (panel C, lane 7) and anti-bFGF immunoreactive material (panel B, lanes 3 and 4). The latter was overwhelmingly HMW bFGF, whereas the anti-bFGF precipitated all forms (panel B, lane 5), with the main form representing the 18-kDa species. Anti-bFGF chromatography precipitated HSP27 (panel C, lane 8) along with cellular bFGF. Since the antibodies do not recognize a common determinant, as demonstrated by the failure of the anti-bFGF antibody to stain HSP27 in cell extracts (panel A, lane 1) and failure of the anti-HSP27 antibody to stain bFGF (panel A, lane 2), the co-precipitation of both proteins is the result of an interaction between the HSP27 and bFGF. The small molecular weight heat shock protein (HSP27) is an estrogen-responsive protein, which has profound effects on cell growth (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and microfilament cytoskeletal dynamics (28Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). 2R. Piotrowicz and E. G. Levin, unpublished observation. Expression of HSP27 in estrogen responsive breast tumors (i.e. tumors requiring β-estradiol for growth and therefore susceptible to anti-estrogen therapy) is correlative with the growth of these tumors (29Edwards D.P. Adams D.J. Savage N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 93: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Edwards D.P. Adams D.J. McGuire W.L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1981; 1: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms by which enhanced HSP27 levels impart a phenotype of accelerated growth have not been firmly established. The data presented in this report demonstrate that enhanced HSP27 expression facilitates the release of bFGF from endothelial cells (Fig. 2). This secreted bFGF, which was predominantly HMW bFGF, was mitogenic to breast tumor cells (Fig. 1). The 18-kDa and HMW bFGF have different capacities to modulate cellular function and may work through different binding mechanisms and intracellular signals (31Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For example, HMW bFGF can support growth in low serum media at levels at which the 18-kDa bFGF form does not (31Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the results of the assays detailed in this report in which MCF-7 growth is observed in the serum-free media obtained from the HSP27 BAECs (Fig. 1). The difference in cellular response to the two forms of bFGF may be due to unique signals induced from the binding of HMW bFGF to an intracellular or nuclear membrane receptor or from direct regulation of transcriptional activity in the nucleus (32Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 33Quarto N. Finger F.P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Physiol. 1991; 147: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The MCF-7 cell line obtained for this study expresses an estrogen receptor and exhibits a mitogenic response to β-estradiol. Co-culture of these cells with the HSP27 BAECs accelerated the growth of the estrogen-responsive cells induced by β-estradiol alone (data not shown). Subculture of the MCF-7 cells in steroid-deficient media selected for cells that can grow in the absence of estrogens and generated cultures that exhibited decreased expression of the estrogen receptor. These cells no longer exhibited a mitogenic response to β-estradiol alone (Fig. 1) and thus roughly approximated estrogen-unresponsive breast tumors. Use of these cells in this study abrogated the estrogen-induced autocrine effects of β-estradiol and allowed the direct test of the effects of β-estradiol on the paracrine activity of the BAECs (Fig. 1). The paracrine communication responsible for the results depicted in Fig. 1 may have relevance to the pathogenesis of breast adenocarcinomas. Endothelial cells isolated from a wide range of tissue and vessel types, including the BAECs employed in this study, possess demonstrable estrogen receptors and are capable of exhibiting genomic responses to β-estradiol (34Gagliardi A.R. Henrig B. Collins D.C. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 1101-1106PubMed Google Scholar, 35Caulin-Glasser T. Watson C.A. Pardi R. Bender J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 36Vickers A.E. Lucifer G.W. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, culture of the BAECs employed in this study in the presence of β-estradiol for several days induced enhanced HSP25 expression (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the potential exists for the capillary endothelial cells involved in the vascularization of breast tumors to respond in a similar fashion and increase HSP27 expression, which then would facilitate bFGF release. The growth of estrogen-unresponsive tumors, therefore, would still be affected by β-estradiol present in the circulation even though the tumors are refractory to the steroid itself. Secretion of bFGF has been postulated to occur via pathways that are independent of the ER-Golgi vesicular pathway (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Majak R.A. Buechlor R.D. Florkeiwicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 13Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 151: 81-93Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Florkiewicz et al. (12Florkiewicz R.Z. Majak R.A. Buechlor R.D. Florkeiwicz E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the 18-kDa form of bFGF is translocated through the plasma membrane in an energy-dependent manner. This translocation could be arrested if the transmembrane domain of an integral membrane protein was affixed to the carboxyl terminus of the bFGF. A putative role for HSP27 in this model is suggested by the fact that a significant portion of cellular HSP27 is associated with the plasma membrane.2 The data presented in this report, however, demonstrate that HSP27 associates predominantly with HMW bFGF, whereas the model described is specific for the 18-kDa form of bFGF. Mignatti et al. (13Mignatti P. Morimoto T. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 151: 81-93Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar) demonstrated that agents which stimulate exocytosis (e.g. treatment with the ionophore A23187) facilitate bFGF release and that conditions which inhibit exocytosis (e.g. culture at 18°C or with methylamine) inhibited the release of bFGF which stimulated cellular migration in an autocrine fashion. Since inhibitors of ER-Golgi protein trafficking failed to inhibit the autocrine induction of migration, it was concluded that bFGF is released via exocytosis that is independent of the ER-Golgi pathway. A role for HSP27 in this putative mechanism of bFGF release is suggested by the fact that overexpression of HSP27 in fibroblasts has been demonstrated to increase the rate of pinocytotic activity (15Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenum was attributed to the role of HSP27 as a modulator of F-actin dynamics at the plasma membrane (15Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If similar mechanisms are involved in exocytosis, increased HSP27 expression may facilitate the release of bFGF via this pathway. The HSP27-dependent release of bFGF release requires β-estradiol treatment of the HSP27 BAECs. The nature of this estrogen-dependence is as yet unknown but is not due to greater bFGF (Fig. 2) or HSP27 expression (data not shown). The latter is consistent with the report demonstrating that the induction of HSP27 production by β-estradiol requires 72 h (14Piotrowicz R.S. Weber L.A. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1079-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). β-Estradiol exerts a myriad of receptor- and non-receptor-mediated events that result in both genomic and non-genomic changes in the cell. For example, the BAECs employed in this study have a demonstrable estrogen receptor, the activation of which could lead to altered transcriptional activity and the up-regulation of specific genes (37Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar). These gene products may influence HSP27-mediated bFGF release. Another of the many mechanisms by which estrogen may induce HSP27-dependent release is the possibility that activated estrogen receptor may directly associate with the HSP27-bFGF complex, acting as part of the putative chaperon machinery. Interactions of peptide hormones with the estrogen receptor have been proposed as one explanation for the peptide hormone induction of estrogen receptor-dependent transcription (38Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Pimentel M. Parker M.G. McLachlan J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism, the association of HSP27 with bFGF is likely to be an important step in the release of bFGF and/or the estrogen dependence of the release.

https://openalex.org/W2018193494,"Firefly luciferase has been used as a model protein to study cotranslational and chaperone-assisted protein folding. We found conditions for reversible unfolding of luciferase in the absence of cellular factors, and we characterized denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions and refolding kinetics of the enzyme. Luciferase unfolding induced by guanidinium chloride at 10°C can be described as a four-state equilibrium with two inactive intermediates highly populated around 1 and 3 M denaturant. The transitions occur around 0.3, 1.7, and 3.8 M denaturant. The free energy of denaturation to the first inactive intermediate (ΔG0N⇌I1 = 15 ± 3 kJ·mol−1) is small for a protein of 60 kDa. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra of the intermediates indicate that I1 has a compact conformation, whereas aromatic side chains are highly exposed in the second intermediate, I2, despite its high content of secondary structure. In the presence of a hydrophilic detergent, significant reactivation of luciferase is observed up to temperatures at which the native protein is unstable. Reactivation kinetics of luciferase are exceedingly slow and probably not limited by proline isomerization, as suggested by their independence from the time spent in the unfolded state.

INTRODUCTIONThe observation that some organisms are able to convert chemical energy into visible light has been fascinating researchers for many years. In Photinus pyralis, a beetle in the superfamily of Cantharoidae, the 61-kDa monomeric protein firefly luciferase is responsible for the production of light. It is located in specialized peroxisomes in the abdominal lantern organ of the insect and was one of the first enzymes to be investigated in biochemical detail (1McElroy W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 851-856Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although subsequent research has led to a more detailed understanding of the light reaction and although the crystal structure of the enzyme has recently been solved, some aspects of its enzymatic mechanism still remain mysterious (2Wood K.V. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 662-673Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin T.O. Structure. 1996; 4: 223-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Luciferase catalyzes the Mg2+-ATP-dependent oxygenation of the heterocyclic component firefly luciferin, yielding ultimately an electronically excited oxyluciferin species. This excited state product then returns to the ground state emitting yellow-green light with an emission quantum yield close to unity (5Ugarova N.N. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1989; 4: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Seliger H.H. McElroy W.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1960; 88: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The resulting flashes of light are employed by the firefly in its reproductive behavior.Because the enzymatic luminescence assay is highly sensitive, luciferase is widely used to rapidly determine small concentrations of ATP (7Gould S.J. Subramani S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The cloning of the cDNA coding for firefly luciferase has opened a wide field of applications in molecular biology in which luc is used as a genetic marker or reporter gene (8de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. Helinski D.R. DeLuca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7870-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). These applications are facilitated by the fact that the luciferase assay, with a detection limit of about 10−18 mol of the enzyme, can be performed in crude cell extracts or even in whole cells. For the same reason, firefly luciferase has become a popular model in studies of protein folding in vivo or upon in vitro translation in cell extracts (9Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 10Nimmesgern E. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V.

Science. 1996; 272: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Upon in vitro translation of the luc gene, luciferase activity could be detected almost immediately after release of the polypeptide from the ribosome (11Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, when chemically denatured or heat-inactivated luciferase was diluted into reticulocyte lysate or wheat germ extract, the enzyme reactivated in minutes and with high yields of 60-80% when ATP was provided by a regenerating system (10Nimmesgern E. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Kolb V.A. Makeyev E.V. Spirin A.S.

Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, renaturation of luciferase in buffer lacking cellular components was inefficient, and the enzyme was found to aggregate during refolding (9Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 10Nimmesgern E. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments with purified molecular chaperones identified DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE as candidates for the chaperoning system facilitating luciferase folding upon expression in Escherichia coli (9Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 15Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).On the other hand, it is generally held that the information required for correct folding is entirely encoded in the amino acid sequence of a protein (16Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar), and proteins found to depend on molecular chaperones for efficient folding in vivo generally can be efficiently renatured if refolding conditions are carefully optimized (17Seckler R. Jaenicke R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Such refolding experiments are a prerequisite for understanding critical steps in protein-folding pathways and to identify folding intermediates as candidate targets of chaperone action. The purpose of the present work was to find conditions for efficient refolding of P. pyralis luciferase in the absence of accessory proteins and to characterize the folding pathway of the enzyme. We found that firefly luciferase does indeed refold spontaneously and with high yield at low temperature and low protein concentration, conditions chosen to minimize aggregation as a competing side reaction. This allowed us to determine the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme from equilibrium unfolding transitions, to physically characterize two highly populated folding intermediates, and to follow the kinetics of luciferase refolding.RESULTSIn an initial series of experiments, we tested whether efficient reactivation of unfolded firefly luciferase is possible in the absence of molecular chaperones. P. pyralis luciferase was diluted into denaturant solution to a final concentration of 5 M GdmCl and kept for 30 min at 10°C. Similar conditions have been employed previously (10Nimmesgern E. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and are sufficient to completely unfold the protein (cf. Fig. 2 below). To prevent off pathway aggregation, refolding was attempted at low protein concentration (2-5 μg/ml) and low temperature (10°C). Samples of unfolded luciferase were rapidly diluted 100-fold into cold phosphate buffer without additional ingredients and kept at 10°C for several days. Within the first 24 h, refolding samples exhibited 50 ± 5% of the luminescence activity of native controls, for which no change in activity with time was observed under these conditions. Upon further incubation for 2 days, the activity of the refolding samples increased to 65 ± 5% of the controls. Addition of 1 mM dithioerythritol did not affect these results.A further increase in reactivation yield was achieved by addition of a hydrophilic detergent. In the presence of 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1 mM dithioerythritol (to suppress peroxide formation; see 19Miki T. Ori Y. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) samples refolded for 24 h or 3 days exhibited luminescence activities of 65 ± 5 and 80 ± 5% of those observed for native controls, respectively. The activities of the controls were also higher after incubation in the presence of the additives (20-50% compared with samples incubated in buffer alone), indicating that the detergent may act by preventing adsorption of the enzyme to vessel walls, as observed with other proteins (20van der Vies S.M. Viitanen P.V. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In our hands, the addition of Tween 20 into the enzyme assay did not have a stimulatory effect, as reported previously (21Kricka L.J. De Luca M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Equilibrium Unfolding of Firefly LuciferaseEquilibrium transitions induced by GdmCl and measured as changes in enzymatic activity and fluorescence in the absence of detergent at low protein concentration are depicted in Fig. 1, A and B Because GdmCl has an inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of P. pyralis luciferase (data not shown), corresponding amounts of GdmCl were added to the luminescence assay buffer in all experiments, keeping the overall GdmCl concentration in the luminescence assay constant at 55 mM.After 3 days at 10°C no further change in luminescence activity (Fig. 1A) or intrinsic protein fluorescence (Fig. 1B) were observed, and the midpoints of unfolding and refolding transitions were essentially coincident. Although the enzymatic activity was lost in a single cooperative transition with a midpoint around 350 mM GdmCl, the denaturant-induced fluorescence change was clearly biphasic. In a first transition, the fluorescence intensity at the emission maximum of the native protein (334 nm) was reduced by ∼35% with little change in the position of the emission maximum. This transition coincided with the inactivation of the enzyme. Beyond 1.2 M GdmCl, a further reduction in fluorescence intensity was observed, with a transition midpoint around 1.7 M GdmCl, and the emission maximum shifted to 351 nm. The presence of a pronounced plateau region around 1 M GdmCl indicated a highly populated equilibrium unfolding intermediate.The unfolding transition, as observed by fluorescence, was not affected by changes in protein concentration (Fig. 1C). The transition measured at 3.7 μg/ml enzyme was superimposable onto that determined at 50 μg/ml. In contrast, renaturation yields were clearly dependent on luciferase concentration (Fig. 1D). Reactivation yields, measured relative to controls of native enzyme diluted to and incubated at the same protein concentration, approached 100% below 2 μg/ml but decreased to less then 40% at 10-fold higher protein concentration. To a first approximation, the concentration dependence could be described by a second-order aggregation reaction competing with a unimolecular folding process (22Kiefhaber T. Rudolph R. Kohler H.-H. Buchner J. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), as represented by the solid line in Fig. 1DThe loss of secondary structure during unfolding at 50 μg/ml was followed by circular dichroism (Fig. 1E). Close to half of the CD signal amplitude at 220 nm was lost in a cooperative transition coincident with inactivation between 0 and 1 M GdmCl. Surprisingly, only a minor CD change paralleled the second phase of unfolding around 1.7 M GdmCl, whereas more than one-third of the CD change occurred in a highly cooperative transition with a midpoint at 3.8 M denaturant. The change in secondary structure around 3.8 M GdmCl was fully reversible (Fig. 1F) and rapid. When samples of native and completely unfolded luciferase were diluted to denaturant concentrations between 3 and 5 M, equilibrium ellipticities were attained in the dead time of manual mixing (data not shown). Thus, two equilibrium intermediates with varying contents of secondary and tertiary structure are populated during the reversible unfolding of luciferase.Characterization of the Equilibrium IntermediatesFluorescence emission and CD spectra of the intermediates in comparison with native and completely unfolded luciferase are presented in Fig. 2. Both types of spectra indicated that the enzyme was completely unfolded at 5.0 M GdmCl. The CD signal around 220 nm was 180 ± 600 degrees·cm2·dmol−1, proving that the protein had lost its secondary structure. Maximum fluorescence emission occurred at 351 nm, near the emission maximum of solvent-exposed tryptophan, and a distinct peak around 305 nm indicated spatial separation of tyrosine and tryptophan fluorophores. Very similar fluorescence spectra were observed in the plateau region of the CD transition around 3 M GdmCl. In contrast, the fluorescence spectrum of the first inactive intermediate was similar to that of native luciferase, with an emission maximum at 334 nm, differing mainly in fluorescence intensity. The data indicate that the intermediate populated around 1 M GdmCl is compact enough to largely shield its aromatic side chains from the solvent. In contrast, the intermediate observed around 3 M GdmCl, although retaining a large part of the secondary structure, does not significantly protect the fluorophores.Quantitative Analysis of Luciferase UnfoldingIt is apparent from the results presented above that luciferase unfolding is not completely reversible at elevated protein concentrations, i.e. under conditions in which a full set of spectroscopic and activity data can be acquired that might be subjected to global fitting procedures. Under certain conditions, however, individual inactivation and unfolding transitions could be sufficiently well separated to allow a quantitative analysis.As pointed out above, the reversibility of the inactivation transition could be improved by addition of Tween 20. Unfolding and refolding transitions measured by fluorescence and bioluminescence after incubation in the presence of Tween 20 were very similar to those observed in buffer alone (Fig. 3, A and B), although the reactivation yields were higher and the midpoints of unfolding and refolding transitions coincided more precisely. In the presence of Tween 20, the inactivation transition, as well as the first phase of the fluorescence transition, were somewhat more cooperative than in the absence of the detergent. This suggests an interaction of the unfolding intermediate with the detergent molecules. Since Tween 20 concentrations far above the critical micelle concentration were used, Tween 20 micelles might be the interacting species. The reactivation was superimposable with the inactivation transition when the data were normalized to the final yield obtained at very low denaturant concentrations. It was well separated from the second phase of the unfolding transition by a pronounced plateau in the fluorescence signal around 1 M GdmCl (Fig. 3B). On the basis of these observations, a thermodynamic analysis of the inactivation transition appeared justified.Fig. 3Quantitative analysis of luciferase denaturation. Denaturation (•) and renaturation (○) transitions in the presence of Tween 20 (buffer B) observed as changes in luciferase activity (A) and protein fluorescence emission at 334 nm (B). The protein concentrations were 3.7 and 2 μg/ml in A and B, respectively. The solid lines in A represent a two-state denaturation transition with an unfolding free energy of ΔG0N⇌I = 15 kJ·mol−1 and a denaturant dependence of m = 50 kJ·mol−1·M−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The inactivation data were fit to a N ⇌ I two-state model (Fig. 3A, solid lines) because sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments indicated the native enzyme to be monomeric (s20,w = 3.9 S, molecular mass = 60,600 Da). The analysis yielded a denaturation free energy of ΔG0N⇌I1 = 15 ± 3 kJ·mol−1 in the absence of denaturant with a denaturant dependence of m = 50 ± 6 kJ·mol−1·M−1. These results did not change significantly when we used a three-state model with inactive intermediate (I) and unfolded (U) species and a midpoint for the I ⇌ U transition around 1.7 M, as observed in the fluorescence transition (data not shown).Like the inactivation transition measured under this specific set of conditions, the unfolding of the second intermediate observed by circular dichroism between 3 and 5 M GdmCl was highly cooperative, reversible, and well separated from other phases of the unfolding transition. Gel filtration experiments at 4 M GdmCl resulted in a single peak consistent with a rapid equilibrium between two monomeric conformations. Thus, the unfolding free energy of the second intermediate could be estimated. Assuming the CD of the intermediate I2 and of the unfolded protein U to be independent of the solvent composition, the data depicted in Fig. 1F can be described by a two-state equilibrium with an unfolding free energy of ΔG0I2⇌U = 17 ± 3 kJ·mol−1 in the absence of denaturant and a denaturant dependence of m = 4.5 ± 1 kJ·mol−1·M−1. Because no reliable CD data could be obtained under conditions in which the first two phases of the transition (N ⇌I1⇌ I2) were found to be highly reversible, i.e. at nanomolar protein concentrations and/or in the presence of Tween 20, a rigorous quantitative description of the complete four-state unfolding transition is not possible at present.Time Course of Luciferase ReactivationThe equilibrium experiments described had already indicated that luciferase reactivation occurs very slowly at 10°C. Therefore, we undertook a more detailed analysis of reactivation kinetics at various temperatures. Results are illustrated in Fig. 4. Because the time course of reactivation did not follow monophasic first-order kinetics, no attempt at calculating rate constants was made. The time of half-maximal reactivation at 10°C was 4 h. It was independent of protein concentration between 0.2 and 4 μg/ml. With increasing temperature, it decreased to 2.5 h at 15°C and to 1.5 h at 20°C. Above 20°C, the activity of the native control decreased significantly during the experiment, and the activity of the refolding sample went through a maximum before decreasing at the rate observed for the control. When reactivation was calculated relative to the activity of the control sample at equivalent times, the time of half-maximal reactivation was close to 50 min at 30°C. At temperatures above 15°C, the effect of Tween 20 on refolding yields was more pronounced; however, omitting the detergent did not accelerate the reactivation reactions.Fig. 4Reactivation kinetics of firefly luciferase at varied temperatures. Luciferase was unfolded in 5 M GdmCl at 10°C and diluted 100-fold into buffer B at 10 (A), 20 (B), 30 (C), or 40°C (D) to initiate refolding, and the enzymatic activity was determined after varied times of refolding (•). At 20°C and above, the activity of native controls decreased during the time of the experiment (○). At 10°C, the time of unfolding at 5 M GdmCl was varied between 10 s (□) and 5 h (•) to test for the effect of proline isomerization on refolding kinetics. The protein concentration during refolding was 2 μg/ml, and luciferase was assayed at 20°C in 20 mM Tricine, 3 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33.3 mM dithioerythritol, 270 μM coenzyme A, 530 μM ATP, and 470 μMD-(−)-luciferin, pH 7.8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Slow folding of monomeric proteins is frequently caused by the rate-limiting isomerization of peptide bonds preceding proline residues. Although such peptide bonds are in a defined conformation, either cis or trans, in native proteins, an equilibrium of 10-40% cis and 60-90% trans conformers is attained for any given Xaa-Pro peptide bond in the unfolded state. Because this equilibrium is reached slowly, a test for proline isomerization as a rate-limiting folding reaction comprises rapid unfolding of a protein at high denaturant concentration in a time that is short compared with the half-time of proline isomerization in the unfolded state (around 5 min at 10°C; compare 23Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) followed by immediate dilution into refolding buffer (24Schmid F.X. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, firefly luciferase was diluted into buffer containing 5 M GdmCl at 10°C. Under these conditions, complete unfolding of the enzyme occurs in the dead time of mixing (data not shown). Renaturation, initiated within 10 s by a second dilution into refolding buffer, occurred at the same rate as it did in a sample diluted after 5 h of incubation in unfolding buffer (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, the presence of stoichiometric amounts of proline isomerases from the E. coli periplasm or from the eucaryotic cytosol did not accelerate luciferase reactivation after a long unfolding time, nor did the enzymes significantly affect luciferase reactivation yields (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The results prove that the rate of luciferase reactivation is not limited by proline isomerization.The Kinetic Intermediate of Luciferase RefoldingAs pointed out above, fully unfolded luciferase was observed to be in rapid equilibrium with the I2 conformation at 3-5 M GdmCl. Similarly, a rapid fluorescence change in the dead time of manual mixing was observed when the unfolded enzyme was diluted to denaturant concentrations between 1 and 3 M and the final amplitudes corresponded to those observed in the equilibrium transitions. Both the I2 and the I1 intermediates thus appear to rapidly equilibrate with the fully unfolded state. In contrast, slow reactivation with half-times of many hours was observed when luciferase reactivation was initiated after denaturing the enzyme overnight at 1 M GdmCl. Furthermore, a fluorescence increase of around 20% of the final signal was observed to coincide with the slow reactivation of unfolded luciferase. Taken together, the observations suggest that the conformation of luciferase preceding the rate-limiting step in the reactivation pathway may be related to the I1 equilibrium intermediate. For a direct comparison with the equilibrium unfolding intermediates, the putative kinetic intermediate accumulating during refolding at low denaturant concentration would have to be characterized further by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. This was precluded by the low protein concentrations necessary for efficient refolding and by the strong tendency of luciferase to adsorb to vessel walls during refolding in fused silica cells. However, it was possible to characterize some properties of the kinetic intermediate by analytical gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Analysis of luciferase refolding by size-exclusion chromatography. A, samples of luciferase (60 nM) refolding at 10°C for the times indicated and samples of a native control were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography, and the eluting protein was detected by its fluorescence. The solid lines represent the fits used to integrate the elution profiles for comparison with reactivation kinetics. B, fractions from the chromatographic separation of a sample refolded for 10 min (•, ○, ▪) and of a native control (□) were assayed for luciferase activity immediately after chromatography (•, □) and after further incubation in buffer B for 24 (○) and 72 h (▪) at 10°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In a series of experiments, equal amounts of luciferase, which had been allowed to renature for different time periods at 10°C as described before, were applied to a high-resolution gel filtration column. Fluorescence emission was used to detect the eluted protein. Native luciferase eluted from the column after 31.3 min, corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa when the column was calibrated with globular proteins. As is apparent from the elution profiles depicted in Fig. 5A, two forms of luciferase were present in the refolding samples in varying proportions. In the absence of detergent, only the native protein fraction was eluted as a distinct peak, increasing with longer renaturation time (data not shown). The remainder of the protein was lost by adsorption to the column material. Addition of Tween 20 to the running buffer efficiently suppressed this interaction with the column matrix. Two protein peaks were now resolved in the elution profile, one eluting at 28.9 min and a second peak at 31.3 min coeluting with native luciferase. The peak at 28.9 min continually decreased and finally disappeared with progressive renaturation, whereas the peak corresponding to the native enzyme increased simultaneously. During refolding, the time course of formation of the native peak coincided closely with the appearance of enzymatic activity (compare Figs. 5A and 4A). To verify the precursor-product relationship, fractions of the two peak regions observed with the sample renatured for 10 min were collected and assayed for luciferase activity (Fig. 5B). When the fractions were assayed immediately after chromatography, only a very low amount of enzymatically active luciferase could be observed. Its elution position around 31 min indicated that it corresponded to the fraction of native protein formed from the intermediate during chromatography. However, when the fractions were assayed after further incubation for 1 or 3 days at 10°C, the earlier eluting protein species became enzymatically active, proving that it represented a precursor of the native protein (Fig. 5B). The elution position of the intermediate corresponds to a globular protein of molecular mass 104 kDa. The 25% enlarged Stokes radius of the intermediate might indicate that it is a partially folded form, highly expanded compared with the native enzyme, or that it may be caused by an interaction with Tween 20 micelles.DISCUSSIONIn vitro renaturation of firefly luciferase in the absence of chaperone proteins has repeatedly been described as a very inefficient process blocked by the rapid aggregation of non-native protein chains (10Nimmesgern E. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U.

A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Our results, however, demonstrate that the enzyme is able to efficiently renature in the absence of cellular components. The conditions of efficient luciferase refolding, i.e. low protein concentration and low temperature, are those found to favor the refolding of other popular chaperone substrates such as citrate synthase, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, malate dehydrogenase, and rhodanese (25Schmidt M.

In Xenopus oocytes, a chimeric β2AR bearing the thrombin receptor second cytoplasmic (C2) loop gained the ability to trigger intracellular Ca2+ release in response to adrenergic agonist, whereas a β2AR bearing the cognate C2 loop from the D2R did not.

Thrombin activates platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial and mesenchymal cells in part via an unusual proteolytically activated G protein-coupled receptor (1Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor is important in embryonic development (4Connolly A. Ishihara H. Kahn M. Farese Jr., R.V. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and is thought to contribute to thrombotic, inflammatory, and proliferative responses in the adult. The mechanism by which thrombin activates its receptor is unusual. Thrombin cleaves its receptor's amino-terminal exodomain to unmask a new amino terminus, which then functions as a tethered peptide ligand, binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to effect transmembrane signaling. The irreversibility of this proteolytic activation mechanism stands in contrast to the reversible agonist binding that activates prototypical G protein-coupled receptors such as the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR). 1The abbreviations used are: β2ARβ2-adrenergic receptorD2Rdopamine D2 receptor. In addition, available evidence suggests that the thrombin receptor's tethered ligand interacts at least in part with the receptor's extracellular face (5Gerszten R.E. Chen J. Ishii M. Ishii K.

To identify the domains responsible for thrombin receptor-G protein interactions, we examined the signaling properties of chimeric receptors in which thrombin receptor cytoplasmic sequences replaced the cognate sequences in the Gs-coupled β2AR or the Gi-coupled dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). In Xenopus oocytes, a chimeric β2AR bearing the thrombin receptor second cytoplasmic loop gained the ability to trigger intracellular Ca2+ release in response to adrenergic agonist, whereas a β2AR bearing the cognate C2 loop from the D2R did not. Similarly, in COS-7 cells, a chimeric D2R bearing the thrombin receptor C2 loop gained the ability to trigger phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to dopaminergic agonist, apparently by coupling to a Gq-like G protein. No detectable Gs coupling was seen. Thus, the thrombin receptor C2 loop was able to confer Gq-like coupling in several different receptor contexts. Whether this loop specifies Gq coupling by directly binding Gq or by contributing to a structure required for Gq coupling remains to be determined.

To identify the thrombin receptor domains that specify its interaction with particular G proteins, we initially generated chimeras between the Gs-coupled β2AR and the human thrombin receptor, which couples to Gq and Gi (1Hung D.T.

In this system, the thrombin receptor did not stimulate adenylyl cyclase, but caused robust mobilization of cytoplasmic calcium, a reflection of phospholipase C activation (Fig. 2) (45Hirono C. Ito I. Sugiyama H. J. Physiol. (Camb.). 1987; 382: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 46Berridge M. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). By contrast, the β2-adrenergic receptor strongly activated adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3A), but coupled weakly at best to calcium mobilization (Fig. 2A). Thus, retention of β2-adrenergic receptor-like signaling by the chimeras was measured as isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, and gain of thrombin receptor-like signaling was assessed as isoproterenol-stimulated calcium mobilization.Fig. 3Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by chimeric receptors.

However, chimeras bearing the thrombin receptor first or third cytoplasmic loop or carboxyl-terminal tail failed to either activate adenylyl cyclase or mobilize calcium in response to isoproterenol and were thus uninformative. By contrast, the chimeric β2-adrenergic receptor bearing the thrombin receptor second cytoplasmic loop (designated β2C2) stimulated adenylyl cyclase like the wild-type β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 3A) and gained the ability to mobilize calcium (Fig. 2A). Both ends of this loop were required for gain of calcium signaling in that receptors chimeric for only the N- or C-terminal half of the second cytoplasmic loop did not mobilize Ca2+ (data not shown). The β2C2 chimera's gain of the ability to mobilize calcium was consistent with several possibilities. The thrombin receptor second cytoplasmic loop might provide a new surface that directly binds a calcium-mobilizing G protein. Alternatively, introduction of this loop might remove structural constraints in the β2AR that normally prevent interaction with such a G protein, either by contributing a surface specifically shaped to allow docking with a calcium-mobilizing G protein (i.e. the right “filter”) or by simply disrupting the normal structure of the β2-adrenergic receptor's cytoplasmic surface, thereby allowing promiscuous coupling. The latter has been described in muscarinic receptor chimeras bearing the β1-adrenergic receptor third intracellular loop (24Wong S.K.-F. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); such receptors coupled to all G proteins tested, and this promiscuity was rectified by the additional substitution of the β1-adrenergic receptor C2 loop. To test the specificity of the change in G protein coupling produced in these chimeras, we generated a chimeric dopamine D2 receptor bearing the thrombin receptor second cytoplasmic loop (designated D2C2) and a β2-adrenergic receptor bearing the D2 receptor second cytoplasmic loop (designated β2D2C2) (Fig. 1). In the oocyte system, the wild-type Gi-coupled dopamine D2 receptor was expressed on the cell surface and could trigger calcium mobilization in response to dopamine when coexpressed with Gβμ and Gβμ-activated phospholipase C-β2 (47Blank J.L. Shaw K. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25184-25191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). As expected, the wild-type D2R by itself neither mobilized calcium nor activated adenylyl cyclase in response to dopamine (Fig. 2B and data not shown). By contrast, the D2C2 chimera caused robust calcium mobilization. Activation of adenylyl cyclase by the D2C2 chimera was not detectable (Fig. 3B), suggesting that its gain of coupling to calcium mobilization was not due to a general increase in receptor promiscuity. The β2D2C2 chimera was expressed on the cell surface and retained the ability to activate adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3A), but did not gain the ability to cause calcium mobilization (Fig. 2A). The gain of coupling to calcium mobilization by the β2C2 receptor thus could not be mimicked by just any cytoplasmic loop substitution. These data suggest that the thrombin receptor second cytoplasmic loop contains specific information for coupling to a calcium-mobilizing G protein. To examine the signaling properties of the β2C2 and D2C2 chimeras in mammalian cells, we expressed the two chimeras and their parent receptors and assessed agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis in transfected COS-7 cells. β2C2 was expressed at only 20-25% of the level of the wild-type β2 adrenergic receptor on the COS-7 cell surface and did not cause detectable activation of phospholipase C (data not shown); it was thus not informative. By contrast, surface expression of the D2C2 chimera was similar to that of the wild-type dopamine D2 receptor (Fig. 4B), and this chimera elicited substantial inositol phosphate release in response to quinpirole, a D2R agonist (Fig. 4A). The wild-type D2R did not couple to phosphoinositide hydrolysis under the same conditions. Treatment with pertussis toxin only partially reduced D2C2-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (0-50% in three experiments); thus, D2C2 likely mediates this response at least in part via a pertussis-insensitive Gq-like G protein (48Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 49Taylor S. Chae H. Rhee S.-G. Exton J. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). At a structural level, the mechanism underlying receptor-G protein coupling remains to be elucidated. The studies presented above show that in the context of the β2-adrenergic and D2 receptors, replacement of the native second cytoplasmic loop with the cognate thrombin receptor sequence is sufficient to confer the ability to activate a Gq-like G protein. As noted above, biochemical and genetic experiments implicate elements in G protein-coupled receptor second and third cytoplasmic loops and carboxyl-terminal tail in G protein binding and activation. The ability of the thrombin receptor C2 loop to provide new coupling “instructions” to β2-adrenergic and D2 receptors is consistent with the C2 loop itself providing a Gq-binding site or a specific change in the filter function of the cytoplasmic face of these receptors to permit interaction with Gq, but not, in the case of the D2C2 chimera, Gs. More broadly, the ability of the thrombin receptor C2 loop to function in the context of the β2-adrenergic and D2 receptors suggests that the thrombin receptor and aminergic receptors use the same structural strategies for G protein binding and activation despite their remarkably different activation mechanisms. This provides additional support for the notion that while G protein-coupled receptors use quite varied strategies to sense light, small molecules, peptides and protein hormones, and proteases (50Coughlin S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 51Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), these ligands probably all elicit very similar changes in the arrangement of their receptors' transmembrane helices and cytoplasmic loops to effect G protein activation (14Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; PubMed Google Scholar).

Tat activates transcription likely by interaction with components of the transcriptional initiation and elongation complexes during different stages of the transcription reaction. In the current study, two approaches were used to address the sites at which Tat becomes stably associated with the HIV transcription complex. First, we isolated column purified HIV-1 and HIV-2 transcription complexes that were competent for <i>in vitro</i> transcription and found that wild-type but not mutant Tat protein was specifically associated with this complex. An intact HIV TATA element and the presence of functional TATA-binding protein were necessary for Tat association. In contrast, the HIV-1 and HIV-2 TAR bulge sequences which serve as binding sites for Tat were not required for its association with the HIV preinitiation complex. A second complementary approach using immobilized HIV-1 and HIV-2 templates also demonstrated a functional association of Tat with HIV-1 and HIV-2 preinitiation complexes. Wild-type but not mutant Tat proteins associated with transcription complexes assembled on immobilized HIV-1 and HIV-2 templates and the association of Tat correlated with increases in the level of <i>in vitro</i> transcription. These results indicate that Tat can associate with HIV-1 and HIV-2 transcription complexes prior to the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II."

These studies indicate (but do not prove) that metal-catalyzed LDL oxidation could be one contributing factor in the generation of oxidized LDL during atherosclerosis. It is therefore important to define the mechanisms that underlie the metal-dependent acceleration of LDL oxidation by macrophages, quantitatively one of the most important cell types present in the developing atherosclerotic lesion (20Faggiotto A. Ross R. Harker L. Arteriosclerosis. 1984; 4: 323-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to more completely understand the etiology of this disease.Several cellular mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the oxidative modification of LDL (12Garner B.

One potential mechanism is the cell-mediated reduction of transition metals, which might facilitate lipid hydroperoxide (L-OOH) decomposition and chain peroxidation (22Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar) (Equations 1 and 2).Mn++e−(cell−derived)→M(n−1)+(Eq. 1) L−OOH+M(n−1)+→L−O·+OH−+Mn+(Eq. 2) Such lipid hydroperoxides are present in atherosclerotic plaque (23Suarna C.

However, mechanisms of macrophage-mediated transition metal reduction have not been studied. One possible cell-derived extracellular reductant is O2, but O2 is clearly not a rate-limiting species for the accelerated oxidation of LDL by murine macrophages (24Jessup W. Simpson J.A. Dean R.T.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis could be that cell-derived thiols maintain transition metals in a reduced form, i.e. a state that confers high reactivity with lipid hydroperoxides. Such reduction of copper and iron by thiols (31Tien M. Bucher J.R. Aust S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and other molecules (32Miller D.M. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) is well known to promote lipid peroxidation (up to a critical reductant concentration beyond which inhibition of peroxidation often occurs) (27Heinecke J.W. Kawamura M. Suzuki L. Chait A. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2051-2061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Tien M. Bucher J.R. Aust S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 107: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Since previous studies demonstrated extracellular transition metal reduction by a direct trans-plasma membrane electron transport (TPMET) system in a variety of mammalian cells (33Crane F.L. Sun I.L. Clark M.G. Grebing C. Löw H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), we here sought evidence for such a system in macrophages. This system, which has been previously characterized by its ability to reduce extracellular ferricyanide, utilizes internal NADH as an electron donor (34Goldenberg H. Crane F.L. Morré D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2491-2498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transport of electrons out of the cell is accompanied by proton movement (35Sun I.L. Crane F.L. Grebing C. Löw H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We investigated the TPMET system within a broader study of the mechanisms responsible for macrophage-mediated transition metal reduction and so could assess the possible contribution of both thiol-dependent and -independent metal reduction to the process of cell-mediated LDL oxidation. Our hypothesis was that macrophages' ability to promote LDL oxidation is related to their ability to reduce transition metals and that a direct macrophage plasma membrane electron transport system may account for a significant proportion of macrophage-mediated metal reduction.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrated the ability of macrophages to reduce transition metals. Furthermore, we have attempted to delineate the mechanisms that underlie this process and their relationship to macrophage-mediated LDL oxidation.Cystine-independent Cell-mediated LDL OxidationOur studies show that macrophages are capable of promoting LDL oxidation in the absence of an extracellular substrate for thiol production. Careful assessment of data provided in previous reports that claimed a critical role for cell-derived thiols in LDL oxidation also showed that cell-mediated LDL oxidation was significantly greater than in parallel cell-free conditions even in thiol-free media. Thus, the monocytic THP-1 cell line (29Graham A. Wood J.L. O'Leary V.J. Stone D. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the RECB4 endothelial cell line (28Sparrow C.P. Olszewski J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1219-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) promoted LDL oxidation significantly (versus cell-free controls) in the absence of cystine, but in the presence of transition metals (0.01 μM copper and 3.0 μM iron). Santanam and Parthasarathy (54Santanam N. Parthasarathy S. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2203-2211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also recently argued that the cellular cysteine generation is not important for LDL oxidation.This study has confirmed the ability of macrophages to promote LDL oxidation in the presence of 0.01 μM copper and 3.0 μM iron and in the absence of cystine. In the two studies discussed above, as well as in the work presented here, addition of cystine to culture medium enhanced basal cell-mediated LDL oxidation, but not cell-free oxidation (28Sparrow C.P. Olszewski J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1219-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Graham A. Wood J.L. O'Leary V.J. Stone D. Free Radical Res. 1994; 21: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the apparently thiol-independent acceleration of LDL oxidation have not been previously addressed.A role for cellular thiol production in cell-mediated LDL oxidation has been suggested to be due to the production of O2 by the extracellular oxidation of the thiol (26Heinecke J.W. Rosen H. Suzuki L.A. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10098-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Parthasarathy S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the inability of superoxide dismutase to prevent macrophage-mediated LDL oxidation argues against this as a predominant mechanism (24Jessup W. Simpson J.A. Dean R.T. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 99: 107-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Macrophage-mediated transition metal reduction was investigated to understand the thiol-independent acceleration of LDL oxidation by these cells. A role for cell-derived thiols as enhancers of such cellular metal reduction was also examined. Cell-mediated metal reduction may stimulate LDL oxidation by reaction of reduced metal with lipoprotein hydroperoxides, causing propagation of lipid peroxidation.Macrophage-mediated Transition Metal ReductionMacrophages were able to reduce both iron and copper in the absence of a substrate for cellular thiol production at rates that could not be substantially accounted for by reductants released into the cell supernatant. When cystine was added to cells, the apparent cell-mediated copper reduction was enhanced after ≈1 h, and a larger proportion of this enhancement could be explained by exported thiols (≈85% of the supernatant's ability to reduce copper could be due to DTNB-detectable thiol). These results suggest that a proportion of cell-mediated metal reduction is due to direct electron transport and that, in the absence of a substrate for cell-derived thiols (i.e. when cystine is not supplied), this proportion is large. Evidence for copper reduction via a direct plasma membrane electron transport system was therefore sought by use of agents known to modulate similar systems (TPMET) in other cell types (33Crane F.L. Sun I.L. Clark M.G. Grebing C. Löw H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 35Sun I.L. Crane F.L. Grebing C. Löw H. J. Bioenerg.

Macrophage-mediated copper reduction shared striking similarities with previous reports in its sensitivity to depletion of plasma membrane iron (51Alcain F.J. Löw H. Crane F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7903-7906Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 55Alcain F.J. Villalba J.M. Löw H. Crane F.L. Navas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and exposure to FCCP (52Löw H. Crane F.L. Grebing C. Isaksson M. Lindgren A. Sun I.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 903-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or glucagon (53Clark M.G. Partick E.J. Crane F.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Cell-mediated Metal Reduction Dominates over Other MechanismsOur data show that in the absence of cystine, cell-mediated metal reduction is much more extensive than that induced by other components of the system, notably LDL. The reduction of copper by LDL, with or without cells, was an order of magnitude smaller than the cellular contribution. This quantity (∼0.6 nmol) is similar to the amount of tocopherol present in LDL, consistent with previous reports that tocopherol in lipid systems can reduce transition metals stoichiometrically (e.g. 56Fukuzawa K. Kishikawa K. Tadokoro T. Tokumura A. Tsukatani H. Gebicki J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 260: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such data have also been obtained with isolated LDL (48Yoshida Y. Tsuchiya J. Niki E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1200: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, Lynch and Frei (57Lynch S.M. Frei B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5158-5163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have claimed that LDL possesses a nonsaturable capacity to reduce copper in cell-free conditions, also measured by Cu(I)·BCS formation. This disparity may be explicable by two factors. First, the presence of selective reduced metal chelators can drive the metal toward the reduced chelated complexes (58Itabashi H. Umetsu K. Satoh K. Kawashima T. Anal. Sci. 1990; 6: 721-725Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 59van Reyk D. Dean R.T. Free Radical Res. 1996; 24: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Second, the extensive Cu(I)·BCS generation by LDL (57Lynch S.M. Frei B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5158-5163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) may be due to the lipoprotein oxidation that occurred simultaneously. Many components of this pathway (e.g. hydroperoxides) reduce copper; thus, the metal reduction in this system may be partly a consequence of oxidation, rather than a determinant of it. In our study, LDL was not present during measurement of cellular metal reduction, so its oxidation could not contribute to the rates of copper reduction reported. It is possible that BCS could promote Cu(I) generation in the presence of MDM, leading to an overestimate of the rate and extent of cellular reduction. However, the low ratio of chelator to copper (2.5:1) used in this study and the saturability of cell-mediated copper reduction (Fig. 7) indicate that chelator-driven reduction was not a significant factor here.Involvement of Macrophage-mediated Transition Metal Reduction in LDL OxidationThe final objective of this work was to assess the impact of changes in cell-mediated metal reduction on cell-mediated LDL oxidation. Glucagon suppressed both macrophage-mediated copper reduction and LDL oxidation, consistent with our hypothesis that the cell's ability to promote LDL oxidation is dependent on its capacity to reduce transition metals. Since glucagon also inhibited macrophage-mediated LDL oxidation in media that contained cystine, TPMET-mediated metal reduction may remain a rate-limiting mechanism in LDL oxidation even when thiol export is operational. In agreement with our conclusion that TPMET activity may be central to LDL oxidation, two recent studies have shown that other compounds that modulate its activity also modulate metal-dependent cell-mediated LDL oxidation. Thus, insulin increases ferricyanide reduction by HeLa cells (60Sun I.L. Crane F.L. Löw H. Grebing C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 61Sun I.L. Crane F.L. Grebing C. Löw H. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 156: 528-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and human erythrocytes (62Dormandy T.L. Zarday Z. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1965; 180: 684-707Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and accelerates LDL oxidation by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (63Rifici V.A. Schneider S.H. Khachadurian A.K. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 107: 99-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Actinomycin D inhibits both cellular TPMET activity (64Sun I. Crane F.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and macrophage-mediated LDL oxidation (65Aviram M. Rosenblat M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 385-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While agents that modulate cellular TPMET activity may have other effects that are relevant to the cells' ability to promote LDL oxidation (for example, modulation of thiol export), the possibility that cellular TPMET capabilities are key to the process of cell-mediated LDL oxidation remains plausible. That all mammalian cells studied so far display TPMET activity (33Crane F.L. Sun I.L. Clark M.G. Grebing C. Löw H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) indicates that many cell types could promote the metal-dependent oxidation of LDL by a similar mechanism.In conclusion, the results presented in this paper argue that macrophages can both accelerate the metal-dependent oxidation of LDL and reduce transition metals when cellular thiol production is minimized by omission of extracellular cystine. The cellular reducing activity shares many features with a TPMET system previously characterized in other cell types. Cellular TPMET activity appears to be amenable to modulation by hormones, growth factors, and drugs (33Crane F.L. Sun I.L. Clark M.G. Grebing C. Löw H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 233-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Thus, controlling the processes that contribute to cell-mediated transition metal redox cycling may provide an opportunity for controlling the formation of copper-oxidized LDL.

Redox Rep. 1996; 2: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and there is evidence for the presence of oxidized LDL in atherosclerotic plaque (13Palinski W. Rosenfeld M.E. Yla H.S. Gurtner G.C. Socher S.S. Butler S.W. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of transition metals (either deliberately added or adventitious) in the culture medium appears to be an absolute requirement for cell-mediated oxidation of LDL in vitro, indicating that the activity of cells is to ongoing metal-dependent oxidation (12Garner B. Jessup W. Redox Rep. 1996; 2: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Christen S. Thomas S.R. Garner B. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2149-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for the presence of transition metals in plaque (16Hunter G.C. Dubick M.A. Keen C.L. Eskelson C.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 196: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Smith C. Mitchinson M.J. Aruoma O.I. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and it is known that physiologically relevant forms of both iron (e.g. hemin and ferritin) and copper (e.g. ceruloplasmin) can promote LDL oxidation in vitro, particularly under conditions related to inflammation (17Smith C. Mitchinson M.J. Aruoma O.I. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 18Balla G. Jacob H.S. Eaton J.W. Belcher J.D. Vercellotti G.M. Arterioscler.

These studies indicate (but do not prove) that metal-catalyzed LDL oxidation could be one contributing factor in the generation of oxidized LDL during atherosclerosis. It is therefore important to define the mechanisms that underlie the metal-dependent acceleration of LDL oxidation by macrophages, quantitatively one of the most important cell types present in the developing atherosclerotic lesion (20Faggiotto A. Ross R. Harker L. Arteriosclerosis. 1984; 4: 323-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to more completely understand the etiology of this disease.Several cellular mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to the oxidative modification of LDL (12Garner B. Jessup W. Redox Rep. 1996; 2: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Jessup W. Leake D.S. Rice-Evans C. Bruckdorfer K.R. Oxidative Stress, Lipoproteins and Cardiovascular Function. Portland Press Ltd., London1995: 99-130Google Scholar). One potential mechanism is the cell-mediated reduction of transition metals, which might facilitate lipid hydroperoxide (L-OOH) decomposition and chain peroxidation (22Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar) (Equations 1 and 2).Mn++e−(cell−derived)→M(n−1)+(Eq. 1) L−OOH+M(n−1)+→L−O·+OH−+Mn+(Eq. 2) Such lipid hydroperoxides are present in atherosclerotic plaque (23Suarna C. Dean R.T. May J. Stocker R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 15: 1616-1624Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms of macrophage-mediated transition metal reduction have not been studied. One possible cell-derived extracellular reductant is O2, but O2 is clearly not a rate-limiting species for the accelerated oxidation of LDL by murine macrophages (24Jessup W. Simpson J.A. Dean R.T. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 99: 107-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) (25Garner B. Dean R.T. Jessup W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several studies have highlighted the importance of cellular thiol production in the acceleration of LDL oxidation (26Heinecke J.W.

An alternative hypothesis could be that cell-derived thiols maintain transition metals in a reduced form, i.e. a state that confers high reactivity with lipid hydroperoxides. Such reduction of copper and iron by thiols (31Tien M. Bucher J.R. Aust S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W1987976300,"Cloning of rat prolactin receptor (PRLR) cDNAs revealed the existence of two isoforms, termed short and long according to the length of their cytoplasmic domain. Internalization studies show, first, that PRLR internalization is hormone-dependent and, second, that ligand-receptor complexes of the short PRLR are internalized to a larger extent compared to the long form. In order to identify regions within the cytoplasmic domain of the short PRLR required for efficient internalization, serial truncations of the cytoplasmic tail were performed by inserting a stop codon in place of those encoding residues 282, 273, 262, 253, 244, or 237 (wild type short PRLR contains 291 amino acids). Our data show that two motifs, lying within residues 253-261 and 273-281, are involved in internalization. Both regions contain a consensus feature identified within other receptors as internalization signals, namely a di-leucine peptide (amino acids 259-260) and a tetrapeptide predicted to adopt a β-turn structure (amino acids 276-279). We propose these two motifs are involved in PRLR endocytosis. Finally, we show that α-adaptin, a component of adaptor protein AP-2, coprecipitates with short PRLR complexes upon PRL stimulation, which strongly suggests that PRLR internalization is mediated by the clathrin-coated pits endocytotic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2003826360,"For many years, the concept that the heparin-binding sequence is sequestered within vitronectin and exposed upon denaturation of the protein has guided experimental design and interpretation of related structure-function studies on the protein. To evaluate binding of heparin to both native and denatured/renatured vitronectin, methods for monitoring binding in solution have been developed. A fluorescence method based on changes in an extrinsic probe attached to heparin has been used to evaluate heparin binding to native and denatured/renatured vitronectin. This approach indicates that there are not major differences in intrinsic heparin-binding affinities between native and renatured protein and invalidate the currently accepted model for a cryptic heparin-binding sequence in the protein. Denaturation and renaturation of vitronectin under near physiological solution conditions is accompanied invariably by self-association of the protein into a multimeric form (Zhuang, P., Blackburn, M. N., and Peterson, C. B. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 14323-14332), resulting in exposure of multiple heparin-binding sites on the surface of the oligomer. On the basis of the binding data from solution studies and interaction of the native monomer and the denatured multimeric form of vitronectin with a heparin column, along with evaluation of the ionic strength dependence of heparin binding to these vitronectin forms in solution, an alternative model is favored to account for the altered heparin binding properties of vitronectin associated with denaturation of the protein. This model proposes that multivalent interactions between heparin and multimeric vitronectin are responsible for differences in heparin affinity chromatography and ionic strength dependence compared with the native protein. For many years, the concept that the heparin-binding sequence is sequestered within vitronectin and exposed upon denaturation of the protein has guided experimental design and interpretation of related structure-function studies on the protein. To evaluate binding of heparin to both native and denatured/renatured vitronectin, methods for monitoring binding in solution have been developed. A fluorescence method based on changes in an extrinsic probe attached to heparin has been used to evaluate heparin binding to native and denatured/renatured vitronectin. This approach indicates that there are not major differences in intrinsic heparin-binding affinities between native and renatured protein and invalidate the currently accepted model for a cryptic heparin-binding sequence in the protein. Denaturation and renaturation of vitronectin under near physiological solution conditions is accompanied invariably by self-association of the protein into a multimeric form (Zhuang, P., Blackburn, M. N., and Peterson, C. B. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 14323-14332), resulting in exposure of multiple heparin-binding sites on the surface of the oligomer. On the basis of the binding data from solution studies and interaction of the native monomer and the denatured multimeric form of vitronectin with a heparin column, along with evaluation of the ionic strength dependence of heparin binding to these vitronectin forms in solution, an alternative model is favored to account for the altered heparin binding properties of vitronectin associated with denaturation of the protein. This model proposes that multivalent interactions between heparin and multimeric vitronectin are responsible for differences in heparin affinity chromatography and ionic strength dependence compared with the native protein. Within the circulation, complicated networks of interactions between proteins and other macromolecules are important for maintaining stasis. An example of the complex interplay that must exist among these biomolecules is provided by the human glycoprotein, vitronectin. Vitronectin interacts with a wide variety of ligands that are involved in control of diverse physiological processes including coagulation, fibrinolysis, tumor metastasis, the humoral immune response, and cellular migration (reviewed in 1Preissner K.T.

A partial list of target macromolecules that interact with vitronectin includes heparin, collagen, plasminogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, serine protease inhibitor-protease complexes, and a subclass of integrin receptors on the surface of cells. Indeed, one of the first molecules shown to interact with vitronectin was heparin (7Silnutzer J. Barnes D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Much of the early work on vitronectin was devoted to evaluating structural requirements for heparin binding, including tests of the effects of denaturation or proteolysis of vitronectin on heparin binding activity. Binding activity was evaluated from vitronectin interactions with a heparin column, estimated in terms of the salt concentrations required to elute bound vitronectin. From these studies came a most striking observation: vitronectin binding to heparin was enhanced upon treatment of the protein with urea, heat, or acid (9Barnes D.W. Reing J.E. Amos B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9117-9122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon was exploited by Yatohgo et al. (17Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) to develop an affinity-based purification scheme for vitronectin that invoked chemical denaturation of bulk plasma prior to chromatography on heparin-agarose. As early as 1984, a model emerged in which the heparin-binding region is buried within the native molecule, so that heparin binding is induced when this cryptic binding site is exposed upon denaturation of vitronectin (11Hayashi M. Akama T. Kono I. Kashiwagi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 1135-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model has been generally accepted, and more recent work has included attempts to correlate the heparin binding properties of native and denatured/renatured vitronectin with other functions of the protein (12Suzuki S.

The two forms of the protein, which are sometimes denoted the “non-heparin-binding” (native) and “heparin-binding” (denatured/renatured) species, are characterized in much of the ongoing work in the field. Many years after the initial work examining effects of denaturation on vitronectin, it was recognized that denaturation is accompanied by self-association of the protein into a multimeric form (28Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multimerization of vitronectin ensues following unfolding of the protein to a structurally altered form that can be detected with a variety of conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies (29Stockmann A. Hess S. Declerck P. Timpl R. Preissner K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Seiffert D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Zhuang P. Li H. Williams J.G. Wagner N. Seiffert D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14333-14343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This partially folded intermediate form has a high propensity to self-associate into multimers that do not readily interconvert with native monomers. The net effect is that multimer formation is essentially irreversible (32Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14323-14332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that the process of self-association into multimers versus refolding to a monomeric form is highly sensitive to ionic strength (31Zhuang P. Li H. Williams J.G. Wagner N. Seiffert D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14333-14343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with multimer formation almost exclusively favored at physiological salt concentrations. From these analyses of denaturation and self-association, it is now clear that the vitronectin species that are commonly classified as heparin-binding are, in fact, multimeric forms of the protein. The native and multimeric forms of the protein are thought to represent the two forms that exist in vivo, with most of the circulating pool of vitronectin in a monomeric form, whereas matrix- and other tissue-associated forms appear to be predominantly multimeric. The hypothesis that guided this work is that the two forms of vitronectin exhibit ligand binding properties that differ according to their function and distribution within the body. The goal of this study was to enumerate the energetics of heparin binding to both the native monomer and multimeric vitronectin and to distinguish differences in heparin affinity and differences in numbers of heparin-binding sites on the two forms of vitronectin. In addition to the affinity chromatography approach mentioned above, other methods that have been used previously to evaluate heparin binding to vitronectin have either relied on indirect kinetic methods (14Lane D.A.

Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or assays that immobilize one or the other reactant on a plastic surface (16Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22874-22882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a rigorous quantitative analysis of the binding of heparin to both forms of vitronectin, it was essential to develop a solution-based method to monitor the bimolecular interaction. This study provides the first measurements of the affinity and stoichiometry of heparin binding to both forms of the protein using a fluorescently labeled form of heparin to quantify the interactions. Vitronectin was purified by a modification of the original procedure of Dahlback and Podack (34Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), essentially as described by Bittorf et al. (28Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the protein is 72,000, and the extinction coefficient is 1.02 ml·mg−1·cm−1 (32Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14323-14332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Multimeric vitronectin was prepared by treatment of protein in 8 M urea at room temperature for 2 h, with subsequent removal of denaturant by dialysis into 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA (32Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14323-14332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unbleached, unfractionated heparin was the kind gift of Dr. Michael N. Blackburn (Department of Macromolecular Sciences, SmithKline Beecham, King of Prussia, PA). Human thrombin was provided by Dr. Frank C. Church (Department of Hematology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The succinimidyl ester of 7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid was acquired from Molecular Probes. Urea was a product of U. S. Biochemicals. Chromozym-TH was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Sephadex G-100 Super Fine was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other chemicals were of reagent grade purity. Unbleached heparin was fractionated by molecular weight on two columns in series of Sephadex G-100 Super Fine (2.5 × 100 cm each) linked in series, essentially as described (35Nesheim M. Blackburn M.N. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3214-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions from the broad elution peak of heparin were combined into separate pools, dialyzed against deionized water, and lyophilized. For labeling with the fluorescent probe, 10 mg of fractionated heparin were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.3. 7-Diethylamino-coumarin-3-carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (1 mg dissolved in 100 μl of dimethylformamide) was added dropwise to the heparin solution and incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature. Unbound coumarin was removed by exhaustive dialysis into 0.1 M NaHCO2, pH 8.3. Labeling stoichiometries were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient for coumarin at 432 nm of 57,000 M−1·cm−1. Heparin concentrations were determined by an azure A dye binding method (36Jaques L.B. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1977; 24: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular weights for size-fractionated, coumarin-labeled heparin samples were determined by sedimentation equilibrium in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge as described previously (35Nesheim M. Blackburn M.N. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3214-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For ultracentrifugation experiments, heparin samples were dissolved in 2 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and a partial specific volume of 0.47 ml·g−1 was used for heparin (37Lasker S.E. Stivala S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 115: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Absorbance in the ultracentrifugation experiments was monitored at 430 nm, and interference patterns were also recorded at equilibrium. Molecular weights calculated from the absorbance and interference optical patterns were the same within experimental error; this result indicates that the small molecular weight probe was quantitatively bound to the macromolecule, heparin. Binding of heparin to vitronectin was monitored by alterations in fluorescence of the extrinsic coumarin probe that was incorporated into heparin. The change in the fluorescent properties of the coumarin probe upon vitronectin binding was measured by changes either in quantum yield or polarization. Changes in quantum yield were measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter, using a thermostatted cell holder connected to an external circulating water bath. Small volume aliquots of native vitronectin (at least 20 mg·ml−1) were added to a microvolume cuvette with a 1-cm path length, containing 150 μl of the labeled heparin sample (2.0-30.0 μM) in 0.02 M Tris-HCl, 20 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Measurements of the fluorescence emission at 480 nm using an excitation wavelength of 430 nm were recorded in triplicate. The data were mathematically corrected for dilution upon addition of vitronectin. To evaluate binding by changes in polarization of the coumarin probe on heparin, fluorescence anisotropy was measured with an SLM 8000 fluorimeter with film polarizers. Excitation was at 400 nm, and emission was measured at 480 nm utilizing a cut-off filter at 440 nm. Small volume aliquots of vitronectin (10 mg·ml−1 stock) were titrated into 2 μM labeled heparin in 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 20 mM NaCl. The change in fluorescence anisotropy of the coumarin-labeled heparin was monitored as a function of the total native vitronectin concentration. Binding constants were estimated from heparin titration data using a nonlinear least squares computer fit to the equation: where ΔF is the change in fluorescence, R is the total concentration of vitronectin-binding sites on heparin, T is the total titrant concentration, and K represents the dissociation constant for heparin-vitronectin interactions (38Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fitting was performed using the Statistical Analysis Software package. To determine whether the incorporation of an extrinsic probe into heparin affects binding to vitronectin, competitive binding studies using a fixed concentration 3 μM coumarin-labeled heparin in the absence or the presence of 15, 45, or 75 μM unlabeled heparin were performed. Aliquots from a concentrated stock of native vitronectin (at least 20 mg·ml−1) were added to a microvolume cuvette containing a sample of 150-μl volume. Measurements of the fluorescence emission at 480 nm with an excitation wavelength of 430 nm were recorded. The fluorescence intensity data were mathematically corrected for dilution. An equation analogous to that described by Bock et al. (39Bock P.E. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15079-15086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bock P.E. Shore J.D. Tans G. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was derived to analyze the competitive vitronectin binding to coumarin-labeled and unlabeled heparin, using the labeled heparin as the probe. The equation can be written as: where the [Unlabeled-Hep] is the total concentration of unlabeled heparin, [VN]′− [VN] is the difference in the total concentration of vitronectin required to achieve the same level of saturation in the presence of the unlabeled heparin and in its absence, Kd and Ki are the dissociation constants for the labeled and unlabeled heparin, respectively, l is the binding stoichiometry, and α is the fractional saturation. The data at values of α > 0.12 were analyzed according to the equation. Unfolding of vitronectin was induced by urea and monitored by changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence as described (32Zhuang P. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14323-14332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein fluorescence measurements were made on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter. Emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 450 nm using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and a path length of 1 cm. Buffer for the unfolding experiments was 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA and 0.04% (v/v) Tween 20, and the 10 M urea stock solution was made in the same buffer. Unfolding curves were generated from fluorescence measurements on vitronectin incubated overnight in mixtures of the urea stock and buffer to give solutions of intermediate urea concentrations. For differential scanning calorimetry experiments, vitronectin samples were dialyzed overnight against 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. Vitronectin solutions (0.9 mg/ml) in the absence and the presence of added heparin (Sigma, Mr∼6000) at a 100 μM concentration were scanned at 1°C·min−1 using a high precision differential scanning calorimeter (model DS-93). Samples and reference solutions were properly degassed and carefully loaded into the calorimeter to eliminate artifacts that might arise from spurious bubbles in the solution. Reproducibility of base lines was verified by multiple overnight scans. The analysis of the differential scanning calorimetry data was performed with software developed by Biocalorimetry Center (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (41Johnson C.R. Morin P.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Absolute and excess heat capacities were determined. Inactivation of thrombin was measured by the ability of antithrombin to inhibit the amidolytic activity of the enzyme essentially as described (38Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin plus heparin was monitored continuously by hydrolysis of the thrombin substrate, Chromozym-TH, to product that absorbs at 405 nm. Heparin with an average molecular weight of 6000 (product of Sigma) was used in the kinetic analyses at a final concentration of 1 μg·ml−1. The final concentration of chromogenic substrate was 0.19 mM, and thrombin concentration was fixed at 2 nM in the assay. Rates of reaction using a fixed antithrombin concentration of 60 nM were measured at 30°C in the presence of various amounts of added vitronectin. The standard assay buffer was phosphate-buffered saline (40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl) containing 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-8000. Absorbance at 405 nm was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer model Lambda 3B spectrophotometer interfaced with an IBM computer for automated data acquisition. Pseudo-first order rates of reaction were determined by nonlinear least squares analysis using the IGOR software package (Wavemetrics, Oswego, OR). Because previously published methods for evaluating interactions between vitronectin and heparin have relied either on measurements with one of the species bound to a solid phase or on complicated kinetic experiments with multiple interactions, a primary goal of this work was to develop a method to monitor the binary interaction in solution. Evaluation of changes in fluorescence of vitronectin upon interaction with heparin was an appealing possibility, because the protein contains nine tryptophans at positions 181, 209, 261, 294, 303, 320, 382, 405, and 450 within the 459-amino acid chain. Note that tryptophans 320 and 382 are located in the primary sequence within the general vicinity of the heparin-binding region, which has been localized to amino acids 341-375 (12Suzuki S. Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Nguyen K. Ohgren Y. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15307-15314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, binding of heparin to vitronectin could not be reliably measured by changes in fluorescence that were attributable to the interaction. 1A great deal of effort was expended to determine that there is not a reproducible change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein upon binding to heparin. Initial results that indicated that vitronectin exhibits a substantial quench in fluorescence upon binding to heparin were misleading; the quench was attributable to a loss of protein in dilute solutions due to adsorption to the cuvette during the course of the experiment. Potential problems stemming from adsorption of vitronectin to the surface of the cuvette were not observed in the experimental protocol that was subsequently pursued, involving titration of a labeled heparin sample with vitronectin. Presumably, a combination of higher protein concentrations used for the titrations and a fixed concentration (in the micromolar range) of the highly charged heparin sample were sufficient to prevent substantial loss of protein during the experiment. Because one of the goals of this research was to compare binding energetics for heparin with both monomeric and multimeric forms of vitronectin, the strategy adopted was to introduce an extrinsic fluorescent probe into heparin that would be sensitive to changes in environment upon binding to either form of the protein. Similar approaches have been previously used successfully to monitor heparin interactions with a variety of proteins, including histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (38Peterson C.B. Morgan W.T. Blackburn M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7567-7574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thrombin (35Nesheim M. Blackburn M.N. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12548-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows binding isotherms in which coumarin-labeled heparin was titrated with native vitronectin. The two panels of the figure illustrate that binding of vitronectin can be measured either by changes in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1A) or polarization (Fig. 1B) of the coumarin probe. The quantum yield of the coumarin probe is increased upon interaction with vitronectin, and the steady-state anisotropy of the fluor increases as would be expected upon formation of a molecular complex of larger hydrodynamic volume. The dissociation constants derived from the two equilibrium binding isotherms shown in Fig. 1 are in excellent agreement with that calculated from changes in intensity (Fig. 1A) equal to 5.4 × 10−6M and that measured by polarization methods (Fig. 1B) equal to 4.2 × 10−6M. Care was taken to establish that the coumarin probe on heparin did not perturb the binding equilibrium with vitronectin by performing rigorous competition studies in which vitronectin-binding isotherms with coumarin-labeled heparin were measured in the presence and the absence of several fixed concentrations of unlabeled heparin (Fig. 2A). These data were used to calculate Ki, the binding constant for unlabeled heparin, and compare it with the binding constant measured for the labeled heparin sample (Fig. 2B). From this analysis, the ratio between the binding affinities of labeled and unlabeled heparin samples was 1.08, indicating that the coumarin probe itself does not affect the measured binding equilibrium. The competition studies were also important to determine the stoichiometry of interaction between the heparin sample and native vitronectin, which is given from the y intercept of the plot of Fig. 2B The stoichiometry determined from simultaneous analysis of the three competition curves in Fig. 2 was 1.1 mol of vitronectin bound/mol heparin of molecular weight 9600. It is important to note that size-fractionated heparins were used for all of the experiments described in this paper, because the number of protein binding sit"

Mutational and structural studies have revealed that small clusters of amino acids rather than large structural motifs often contribute to most of the energy involved in protein-protein interactions such as hormone binding to its receptor (for review, see 1Wells J.A.

However, it is not clear how the conformation of a peptide ligand contributes to the coupling of binding to signal transduction. This is especially an issue for the function of hormone-receptor complexes involving multisubunit ligands. A convenient model for studying the tertiary and quaternary determinants in signaling is the glycoprotein hormone family which include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), 1The abbreviations used are: hCGhuman chorionic gonadotropinLHlutropinFSHfollitropinWTwild typeRIAradioimmunoassayCGβαunmodified single-chain hCG. lutropin (LH), follitropin (FSH), and thyrotropin.

The folding intermediates associated with the ordered formation of these bridges to acquire an assembly-competent form is well documented (9Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol.

One method to examine the functional role of the structural motifs in the glycoprotein hormones is to assess the biologic activity of variants containing mutated cysteine residues. However, breaking single disulfide bonds of the β subunit inhibits secretion and assembly with the α subunit, and as a result dimer recovery is dramatically reduced (15Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Table I). Since only the heterodimer binds to the receptor, it is virtually impossible to examine the bioactivity of these variants. Recently, a single gene encoding a protein containing CGβ and α subunit was constructed (16Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The tethered hormone exhibited secretion kinetics and bioactivity similar to that of the non-covalent heterodimer. Here we compile into a single protein subunits that cannot combine efficiently, namely the α subunit and CGβ with cysteine to alanine mutations. Because this tethered construction by-passes the assembly step, we can examine the role of the disulfide bonds on the biological activity of hCG. The data show that they are primarily required for assembly with the α subunit and secretion of the heterodimer. The extensive native subunit interaction in the dimer which is altered by these mutations is not critical for receptor binding and signal transduction.Table I.Secretion of hCG β Cys mutantsHormoneSecretion rate (t1/2)aTime (min) when half of the maximal secreted hormone is detected in the media.Recovery from mediaSingle-chainβ SubunitSingle-chainbThe amount of hormone retrieved from the media at steady state is expressed as a fraction of the total (lysate + medium).HeterodimercDetermined in cells expressing both WT-α and mutated monomeric CGβ subunits.

Construction of cysteine (Cys) to alanine (Ala) mutants in the CGβ subunit gene (CGβΔCys) was described (15Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol.

The ApaI fragment containing the first 135 amino acids of CGβ sequence in CGβα was exchanged for the ApaI fragment in CGβΔCys. The new KpnI-XhoI fragment was inserted into pM2AH and rechecked by restriction enzyme analysis. The mutations were confirmed using Taq DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI prism DNA Sequencer (Perkin Elmer). Clones of transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained as described (15Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We used polyclonal α antiserum for precipitation and Western blots since WTα subunit is tethered to the mutated CGβ sequence, and the immunoreactivity of all variants to the antiserum should be similar. Pulse-chase experiments were performed in 12-well dishes (300,000 cells/well) (15Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitates were resolved on SDS gels and were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or a laser densitometer (LKB). Condition medium obtained from cells grown in serum-free F12 was concentrated (using Amicon Centriprep 10 concentrators), the concentrate was diluted (1:15) in phosphate-buffered saline, and the volume reduced again. The mutants were quantitated using our polyclonal α antiserum and the double antibody RIA (Diagnostic Products Corp.). A human kidney-derived cell line (293), stably transfected with the cDNA-encoding human LH/CG receptor, was used for receptor binding and cAMP production (18Jia X.-C. Oikawa M. Bo M. Tanaka T. Ny T. Boime I. Hsueh A.J. Mol Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To assess the intracellular effect of the disulfide loops in the CGβ domain, we examined the secretion of tethered hCG variants in which both cysteines of a proposed pair were mutated. Transfected CHO cells stably expressing the Cys mutants were metabolically labeled and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis under reduced conditions. The electrophoretic migration of the secreted proteins is slower than the corresponding intracellular species (Fig. 2A) which reflects both the processing of the N-linked and addition of the O-linked oligosaccharides to the CGβ subunit just prior to secretion (15Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiment reveals that the secretion kinetics and extent of recovery of the mutants from the media are variable. For example, the 34-88 mutant is not detected in the media after 4 h of labeling (lane 7). Pulse-chase analysis shows that the unmodified single-chain hCG (CGβα) is secreted efficiently (t1/2 = 85 min; recovery = 75%; Table I) which is comparable to that of the heterodimer (15Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As previously observed for the monomeric CGβ subunit (15Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), release of the 26-110 mutant is accelerated (t1/2 = 60 min, recovery 90%). In contrast, mutations in the cystine knot (i.e. 9-57, 34-88, and 38-90) resulted in variants that were secreted slower and less efficiently. This is especially evident for the 34-88 mutant where the t1/2 is 350 min and 25% of the protein is recovered. The reduced recovery suggests that the mutants were altered resulting in degradation of a significant fraction of the pool. This is substantiated by pulse-chase analyses that show in contrast to CGβα, where most of the variant is secreted, 75% of the 34-88 mutant that accumulates in the lysate does not exit the cell and is no longer detected after 24 h (Fig. 2B). Thus, the disulfide bonds which comprise the core of the subunit, namely 9-57, 34-88, and to a lesser extent 38-90, are essential for efficient secretion of the CG single chain. The secretion kinetics generally parallel those seen for CGβ monomer (Table I), which implies that these mutation-induced alterations in intracellular behavior are not the result of the single-chain construction. If the conformation is altered by breaking the disulfide bonds, we should detect differences in electrophoretic mobility and immunoreactivity on SDS gels. To test this prediction, Western blots were performed under non-reduced conditions using a monoclonal antibody directed against α subunit epitopes that are exposed primarily in the heterodimer (designated A407; 19Krichevsky A. Birken S. O'Connor J.F. Bikel K. Schlatterer J.P. Canfield R.E. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 511-520Google Scholar). The antibody recognized the CGβα, suggesting that dimer-like structure is preserved despite the tethering (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 versus 6). The mutants lacking the bonds that form late in the folding sequence of CGβ monomer, i.e. 23-72, 26-110, and 93-100 (9Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8870-8879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were immunoreactive (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 7, and 8). The recognition of the 23-72 and 26-110 Cys variants by the dimer-specific antibodies presumably reflects the limited assembly of such mutated CGβ monomers with the α subunit (Table I and 15Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear why the 93-100 Cys mutant is detected because no discernible assembly is seen with monomer CGβ subunit bearing this mutation (Table I and 15Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this single-chain mutant may be partially configured to a heterodimeric form. Of significance, analogs lacking bonds of the cystine knot which are the first to form in CGβ (9Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8870-8879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) display little or no signal (Fig. 3A, lanes 3-5). Comparable results were obtained with B109 (data not shown), a monoclonal antibody raised against a CGβ epitope specific to the heterodimer (12Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Rao S.N.V. Ayad N.G. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20020-20031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When the same blot was reprobed with polyclonal α antiserum (Fig. 3B), all analogs and free α monomer were detected. This indicates there was sufficient protein in the blot and illustrates the discrimination between the conformation of free and dimerized subunit by the monoclonal antibody (lane 1). As previously reported, the CGβα migrated slightly faster than the heterodimer under non-reduced conditions (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 6, and 16Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J.W. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, the electrophoretic migration of each analog differs compared with CGα further demonstrating conformational changes induced by disrupting the disulfide bridges. We also observed slower migrating species on the blots and that this heterogeneity for the CGβα and the Cys mutants is variable; it is most pronounced for mutants 38-90, 9-57 (panel B, lanes 3 and 4), and, for the 34-88 mutant, the higher molecular weight protein represents a considerable fraction of the total (lane 5). The high molecular weight forms of CGβα are non-covalent since heating (95°C, 5 min) under non-reduced conditions converts them to the expected size of the single chain (data not shown). The larger forms of the Cys variants apparently consist mainly of covalent polymers since they are resistant to heat (95°C, 5 min) but dissociate when boiled in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (data not shown). Aggregate formation, often associated with misfolded forms of a protein, was observed when Cys mutants of CGβ subunit monomers were analyzed under non-reduced conditions (10Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and during purification of native urinary hCG (20Lustbader J.

Liu Y. Stockell Hartree A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data imply that bonds of the cystine knot motif are the scaffold for the structure, and the cysteine mutations induce conformational changes in the single chains. In contrast to the inability of such CGβ subunits to efficiently combine and thus interact with the α subunit, the mutated β domains in the single chain are nevertheless tethered to an α domain and secreted. The improved recovery (Table I) now permits analysis of the effects of disrupting the disulfide-bonded loops on biological activity. Binding of single-chain variants to the human LH/CG receptor stably expressed in 293 cells was examined. We unexpectedly found that all CG variants bind to the receptor including those mutants that as subunits assemble poorly (i.e. 34-88, 9-57, 93-100, and 38-90). The single-chain mutants, except analogs 38-90 and 34-88, displayed similar dose-response curves to the purified heterodimer (CR129) 2National Hormone and Pituitary Agency. and CGβα (Fig. 4A); the affinity of mutants 38-90 and 34-88 was apparently reduced by 7- and 10-fold, respectively (Table II). We cannot exclude the possibility that these changes are due to the observed aggregation (see above; Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 5); purification is needed to address this point. That the binding affinities observed were not due to an altered specificity induced by the single-chain configuration, we tested the action of single-chain FSH (22Sugahara T. Sato A. Kudo M.

As expected, this protein did not displace the bound hCG (Fig. 4A). The signal-transducing responses of the hCG variants were also assessed by quantifying adenylate cyclase activation. All these mutants increased cAMP levels, and the signal transduction paralleled binding efficiency, resulting in similar coupling ratios (Fig. 4B and Table II). These data show that bioactivity was preserved and mutations in the CGβ monomer which block assembly with the α subunit are without effect on the efficiency of signal transduction when expressed as single chains.Table IIReceptor binding and cAMP stimulation of single-chain hCG analogsHormoneBinding IC50cAMP EC50Coupling factor (IC50/EC50)Heterodimer9.5 ± 2.44.5 ± 0.62.1CGβα10.3 ± 2.14.6 ± 1.62.234-8893 ± 2432 ± 52.938-9067 ± 1151 ± 211.39-5720 ± 413 ± 11.523-728.0 ± 25.0 ± 21.693-10015 ± 413 ± 2.41.226-11023 ± 69.1 ± 4.52.5 Open table in a new tab Structural analyses of hCG revealed that the overall shape of the glycoprotein hormones is elongated rather than globular with the disulfide-bonded loops primarily surface-exposed (7Lapthorn A.J.

However, despite their relatively large structures, conformational changes induced by deleting each of the disulfide bonds and altering any of the loops in the CGβ domain does not abolish binding/signal transduction nor does it significantly affect coupling. These results were not anticipated since it is well accepted that the intracellular/extracellular behavior of the glycoprotein hormones is conformationally sensitive (11Combarnous Y. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 670-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Rao S.N.V. Ayad N.G. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang Y. J. Biol.

Mutations inhibiting heterodimer formation and eliminating dimer-specific epitopes in the tethered analogs did not significantly affect the bioactivity of the single-chain mutants. The glycoprotein hormone-specific quaternary structure, i.e. the heterodimer, signals key functional intracellular events such as efficient secretion and hormone-specific processing of the subunit N-linked oligosaccharides (23Corless C.L. Matzuk M.M. Ramabhadran T.V. Krichevsky A. Boime I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our data imply that analogs with different conformations can bind to the receptor and activate adenylate cyclase. Alternatively, the hormone could exist in a series of resonant conformers, and the receptor favors only the binding-competent species. We consider this less likely because for Cys knot mutants no signal indicative of the native form was seen with monoclonal antibody. Therefore, we would conclude that the tertiary and quaternary features created by single disulfide loops in the β subunit and the tight interaction between subunits are essential for the normal intracellular behavior of the gonadotropins, but not for the coupling of receptor binding/signal transduction in vitro The bioactivity of Cys analogs can be explained by several models.

These determinants for bioactivity could not be disrupted by the conformational changes induced by the Cys mutations; (b) hCG may contain redundant binding/signaling determinants, eliminating one is compensated by others in the intact loops; (c) binding of the complex to the receptor results in conformational changes of the CGβ subunit that restores activity of the Cys mutated analogs. The 91-110-amino acid stretch of CGβ envelops the α subunit and includes domains for bioactivity such as the “determinant loop” (i.e. residues 93-100; 29Ward D.N. Moore Jr., W.T. Alexander N.A. Animal Models for Research on Contraception and Fertility. Harper & Row, New York1979: 151-164Google Scholar). Because the single-chain 26-110 or 93-100 mutants were as active as CGβα, a major role for this sequence is apparently to stabilize the noncovalent heterodimer (7Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C.

Thus, the primary and/or secondary structure of loci within each of these individual loops rather than their tertiary structure are likely determinants for functional receptor recognition. By-passing the assembly step with the single-chain approach enabled us to expand the spectrum of analogs for structure-function analysis. Similarly, mutations in other multisubunit hormones and growth factors of the cystine knot superfamily which result in inefficient assembly, secretion, and loss of bioactivity (6 and references therein) can be examined.

Here it is shown that γ-irradiation of MMOH at 77 K results in reduction of the diiron cluster to an EPR active Fe(II)·Fe(III) mixed valence state. At this temperature, the conformation of the enzyme remains essentially unchanged during reduction, so the EPR-spectrum becomes a probe of the conformation of the diferric state. The γ-irradiated MMOH exhibits EPR spectra that differ in lineshape and saturation properties from those of the mixed valence MMOH generated by chemical reduction in solution; annealing the γ-irradiated sample at 230 K yields the spectra of the chemically reduced sample. This demonstrates that the conformation of diferric MMOH in the vicinity of the diiron cluster changes during reduction to the mixed valence state. The analogous experiment for the MMOB·MMOH complex gives a new mixed valence species following γ-irradiation that differs from all previously reported mixed valence species. Thus, binding of MMOB also causes a change in the conformation of diferric MMOH. It is hypothesized that the structural changes observed for the first time here may involve conversion of the dihydroxo-bridged diamond core structure to one with more readily dissociable bridging oxygen ligands to facilitate reaction with O2 following cluster reduction.

The most dramatic and informative in vitro responses to NGF are observed in the pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, which has been used extensively as a model for investigations of NGF-induced neuronal differentiation (10Greene L.A.

Although there is substantial information about the mechanism by which NGF causes profound and global changes in cell phenotypes, the identification of specific second messengers responsible for specific biological actions of NGF has proven difficult. NGF-induced changes in a number of these second messengers, such as cAMP (12Nikodijevic B. Nikodijevic O. Yu M.W. Pollard H. Guroff G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Perhaps the multiple roles of calcium in neurotrophin action are as well understood as any. Neuronal survival appears to depend upon the maintenance of sufficiently high levels of intracellular calcium (19Collins F. Schmidt M.F. Guthrie P.B. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2582-2587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and when such levels are sufficient, neurons normally dependent on NGF for survival become NGF-independent (20Koike T. Martin D.P. Johnson Jr., E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6421-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for NGF in keeping calcium levels from falling too low. On the other hand, when neurons sustain oxygen deprivation or hypoglycemia, the damage that ensues is due at least in part to extremely elevated intracellular calcium levels. Under such conditions, neurons can be protected by neurotrophins, which also keep calcium levels low (21Cheng B. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for neurotrophins in keeping calcium levels from rising too high. More recently, it has been shown that neurotrophins can mediate synaptic plasticity (22Lohof A.M. Ip N. Poo M.-M. Nature. 1993; 363: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), the more or less permanent change in synaptic efficiency that appears to underlie long term potentiation, thought by some to be the biochemical cognate of learning and memory. Synaptic plasticity appears to depend on neurotransmitter release, dependent, in turn, upon neurotrophin-induced calcium influx (23Stoop R. Poo M.-M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3256-3264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So both long and short term actions of the neurotrophins appear to involve regulation of intracellular calcium levels, at least in part through regulating calcium uptake. Indeed, it has been shown directly that NGF can stimulate a small, rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration in PC12 cells (24Alonso A.P. Malgaroli A. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Lazarovici P. Levi B.-Z. Lelkes P. Koizumi S. Fujita K. Matsuda Y. Ozato K. Guroff G. J. Neurosci.

Res. 1992; 33: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and that this increase is accompanied by an NGF-induced increase in calcium uptake (27Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Increased calcium uptake appears to be required for NGF-induced increases in neurotransmitter release (28Nikodijevic B. Creveling C.R. Koizumi S. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of NGF-induced calcium uptake is not well understood. The pharmacological profile of NGF-induced calcium uptake in PC12 cells suggests that a unique calcium channel may be involved (29Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in this process and that phosphorylation of this channel may be required because introduction of phosphatase prevents increased calcium uptake (29Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Beyond that, little information is available. NGF binds to two separate receptors on its target cells, a site with tyrosine kinase activity, p140trk, termed by some the high affinity receptor, and p75NGFR, which appears to signal through the ceramide pathway, thought by some to have lower affinity for NGF. Most of the physiological actions of NGF are mediated by p140trk (30Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar); p75NGFR has recently been associated with regulated cell death (31Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.-A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). To determine which receptor is responsible for NGF-induced calcium uptake, we stably transfected the human p140trk and p75NGFR separately into NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, which do not have endogenous NGF receptors, and examined the effects of NGF on the uptake of radioactive calcium into these transfectants. Full-length human p140trk cDNA sequence was kindly provided by Dr. Andrea Levi and inserted into the pRcCMV vector (Invitrogen). pCMV5-p75 plasmid containing human p75NGFR was kindly proved by Dr. M. V. Chao. The expression vectors containing either human p140trk or human p75NGFR were transfected into 3T3 fibroblasts using calcium phosphate, and stable clones were selected. Stable clones expressing p140trk or p75NGFR were screened by Western blot analysis using either anti-trk203 antibody, a gift from Dr. David Kaplan, or anti-p75NGFR antibody (Promega) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 200 μg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The presence of RNA transcripts was further confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using specific human p140trk and p75NGFR primers. The cells were harvested by scraping on ice and were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was collected by centrifugation and lysed for 30 min on ice in 0.5-1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The total cell lysates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of cell lysate (50 μg) were applied to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polynvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and the membranes were incubated with blocking buffer for 1 h and then with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4°C. The Western blots were analyzed using an enhanced chemiluminescence protein detection kit (Tropix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfectants were grown on collagen/poly-L-lysine (25:1)-coated 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h at 37°C, the cells were washed once with calcium-free, serum-free, antibiotic-free medium and incubated in the same medium for 30 min. After incubation, [45Ca]calcium (1 μCi) was added to each well along with appropriate amounts of NGF, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for another 4 min. The medium was rapidly removed by aspiration, and the cells were washed twice with 3 ml of washing buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 50 mM choline chloride, and 2.5 mM EGTA (final pH, 7.2). The cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of NaOH for at least 2 h, a portion (0.4 ml) of the cell lysate was used for estimation of the radioactivity, and 0.05 ml was used for protein determination. The final counts were normalized by protein concentration. In the course of experiments with PC12 cells (27Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 38Nikodijevic B. Aschkenasy M. Dickens G. Lachance C. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), it became clear that the interaction of NGF with p140trk was not sufficient to explain all the observations. Small but persistent increases in calcium uptake were seen when PC12nnr5 cells, a PC12 variant with little or no p140trk receptors, were treated with NGF. In addition, tyrosine kinase inhibitors were not able to inhibit the NGF effect on calcium uptake completely. The significance of the p75NGFR was predicted by experiments with PC12 cells and BDNF, which interacts with p75NGFR but not with p140trk. A combined average of five such experiments, each done in triplicate, showed that BDNF produced an increase of 22 ± 9.8% in calcium uptake with a p value of <0.001; in another series of four experiments, each also done in triplicate, BDNF produced an increase of 19 ± 15.3% with a p value of <0.05, whereas NGF gave an increase of 27 ± 8.4% with a p value of <0.001. To provide definitive information on which NGF receptor was involved in calcium uptake, the two NGF receptors were transfected separately into 3T3 cells, which have no endogenous NGF receptors. Two stable clones were used for the present studies. One of these clones, 3T3-trkA-WT.11, has 3-4-fold more p140trk receptors than do PC12 cells. NGF can stimulate both p140trk autophosphorylation and Erk phosphorylation in 3T3-trkA cells (data not shown). The presence of p140trk receptors on the cell surface was also confirmed by [125I]NGF binding and immunoblotting using the membrane fraction from 3T3-trkA cells. The other clone, 3T3-p75-L2, has about 50% less p75NGFR receptors than do PC12 cells but many more than in PC12nnr5 cells (Fig. 1). Using the conditions under which NGF stimulates calcium uptake in PC12 cells, we estimated dose-dependent NGF-induced calcium uptake in both 3T3-trkA and 3T3-p75 cells. In both transfectants, but not in untransfected 3T3 cells, NGF can induce increased calcium uptake (Fig. 2) to a level similar to that observed in PC12 cells (27Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although the stimulation in replicate cultures was somewhat variable, usually between 25 and 50% but sometimes as high as 100%. At low concentrations, NGF seems to induce calcium uptake more effectively in 3T3-trk cells than in 3T3-p75 cells, perhaps reflecting the different binding affinities of NGF for the p140trk and the p75NGFR receptors. K-252a, an alkaloid-like kinase inhibitor isolated from the culture broth of Nocardiopsis (32Kase H. Iwahashi K. Matsuda Y. J. Antibiot.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of 3T3-trkA cells with 200 nM K-252a for 30 min can specifically block NGF-induced calcium uptake (Fig. 3). However, a similar pretreatment of 3T3-p75 cells has no effect on NGF-induced calcium uptake. In PC12 cells, K-252a treatment produces a small increase in the uptake of radioactive calcium within 3-4 min (27Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and this increased uptake appears to involve p140trk (38Nikodijevic B. Aschkenasy M. Dickens G. Lachance C. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous data, K-252a treatment of 3T3-trkA cells stimulated a small increase in the uptake of radioactive calcium but had no effect in 3T3-p75 cells (Fig. 4). K-252a-induced calcium uptake is smaller than NGF-induced calcium uptake in 3T3-trkA cells as it is in PC12 cells (27Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). BDNF is another member of the neurotrophin family, which, as stated above, can bind to p75NGFR but not to p140trk. Because NGF can induce calcium influx in 3T3-p75 cells, we examined the effect of BDNF on calcium influx in both 3T3-trk and 3T3-p75 cells. BDNF can increase calcium influx into 3T3-p75 cells, as does NGF, but has no effect on calcium influx into 3T3-trkA cells (Fig. 5). The data presented here clearly show that NGF can increase calcium uptake through both NGF receptors. These data are consistent with those in a recent report suggesting that NGF can increase neurotransmitter release from striatal neurons through the p75NGFR receptor (39Block A. Sirrenberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21100-21107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Clearly, the NGF-induced increases in calcium uptake in 3T3 cells have no biological relevance, the NGF receptors being introduced artificially. But increases of comparable magnitude in PC12 cells are absolutely required for the NGF-induced release of catecholamine neurotransmitters (28Nikodijevic B. Creveling C.R. Koizumi S. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Also there is a growing awareness that capacitative calcium entry plays a central role in many aspects of cell signaling (40Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar), and the amounts of calcium entering the cells by this route appear to be very small indeed. It is important to determine the mechanism(s) by which these receptors act on calcium uptake, because there is evidence that the mechanisms by which calcium enters the cell determines its actions in those cells (41Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). In any case, the present data suggest that both high and low affinity NGF receptors can participate in the calcium-mediated actions of the neurotrophins."

Relaxation or inactivation of myosin is accomplished by a myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCPase) that has a controversial identification and subunit composition (see 5Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In numerous previous studies (for references, see 6Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar), many types of cytosolic MLCPases have been purified exhibiting different specific activities toward phosphorylated myosin or isolated myosin regulatory light chain (ReLC). A common feature of all of these phosphatases seems to be the presence of not only a catalytic (PC) subunit of about 35-38 kDa but also another subunit in the range of 55-72 kDa. The function of the latter subunit has not been established. Initial attempts to classify these serine/threonine phosphatases were not very successful (7Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. Crouch D. Safer B. Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Several years after our initial report on the first myofibrillar MLCPase (8Sobieszek A. Barylko B. Stephens N.L. Smooth Muscle Contraction. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1984: 283-316Google Scholar), we and others again turned our attention to MLCPases from smooth muscle. In our new approach, the phosphatase was purified by CaM affinity chromatography and was shown to be composed of 37-kDa catalytic and 67-kDa targeting subunits (9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The only other myofibrillar phosphatase known so far was purified and partly characterized by Alessi et al. (10Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Although the sequence of all three subunits has been determined, the role of the regulatory subunits is not understood (see 5Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe further results on our myofibrillar smooth muscle protein phosphatase, which is closely associated with MLCKase and myosin filaments and is called, therefore, a kinase- and myosin-associated protein phosphatase (KAMPPase). We show for the first time that this association results in a functional multienzyme complex between these two key regulatory enzymes of smooth muscle. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from DuPont NEN and diluted with cold ATP of special grade (Boehringer Mannheim) to the required specific activity and concentration (13Sobieszek A. J. Mol.

DEAE-Sepharose 6B-CL, Q-Sepharose FF, SP-Sepharose BB, Sephacryl S-200, and CNBr-activated Sepharose-4B were obtained from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Electrophoresis reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. The other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Inhibitors of protein phosphatases such as microcystin-LR and okadaic acid were purchased from LC Service Corp. (Woburn, MA). Turkey gizzard MLCKase (8Sobieszek A. Barylko B. Stephens N.L.

Biol. 1991; 220: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), as well as phosphorylated ReLC and unphosphorylated ReLC of myosin (15Sobieszek A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), were purified as described previously. A 32P-labeled isolated ReLC or intact myosin was prepared as described (9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The buffer (AA) used throughout this study had the following composition: 60 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM imidazole with pH adjusted to 7.5 at 4°C. It was used, with the necessary additions, during protein purification, activity measurements, binding experiments, and all other procedures. Phosphatase activity was measured by the release of 32P from labeled ReLC (or myosin) as described previously (8Sobieszek A. Barylko B. Stephens N.L. Smooth Muscle Contraction. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1984: 283-316Google Scholar). The assays were carried out at 25°C in AA buffer. The concentration of 32P-ReLC light chain was in the range of 50-150 μM. Bovine serum albumin (0.1%) was added as an inert protein carrier. MLCKase assays were carried out as described previously (14Sobieszek A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with intact myosin (or its isolated ReLC) chain as the substrate together with radioactive ATP. More specific details of individual assays are given in the corresponding figure legends. The phosphatase activities were also measured by a simple modification of our MLCKase activity assays (14Sobieszek A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This method was particularly suitable for the activity measurements of the kinase-rich multienzyme complexes. In this case, the 32P-labeling of myosin (or other substrates) only required the addition of radioactive ATP, and the dephosphorylation reaction was initiated by removal of Ca2+ with EGTA. The first time point aliquots (spotted onto 3MM chromatographic paper pieces and dropped into 5% trichloroacetic acid solution) were used for estimation of the MLCKase activity or of the 32P labeling level. From the subsequent time points (after removal of Ca2+), the phosphatase activity was evaluated. An affinity gel centrifugation method was used for identification of the targeting subunit. Approximately 200 μl of CaM affinity gel were placed into 0.45-μm Ultrafree-MC filter units (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Equilibrations, sample applications, washings, and elutions were done by layering 350 μl of a given solution on top of the gel. After a 15-min equilibration, the gels were centrifuged for 15-30 s at 1,000 rpm in a small table top centrifuge. The washes and the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after 7-10-fold concentration of the samples with 5% trichloroacetic acid precipitation. To aid the precipitation and localization of the tiny pellet, 100 μg (10 μl) of the purified ReLC or essential light chain were added as an inert protein carrier. Coupling of ReLC to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and thiophosphorylation of ReLC affinity columns as well as their elutions were performed as described (9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed in 7.5-15 or 9-18% gradient acrylamide minislab gels by the procedure of Matsudaira and Burgess (16Matsudaira P.T. Burgess D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) in the buffer system of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with some improvements as described (18Sobieszek A. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the methods of Gornall et al. (19Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 245-248Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with a protein standard from Bio-Rad. Unless otherwise stated, all purification steps were carried out on ice or in the cold room (4°C). To obtain fraction that contained solely the high molecular weight MLCPase, the 40-55% ammonium sulfate fraction obtained from the myofibrillar MLCKase and MLCPase extract was first subjected to a gel filtration step on an AcA34 column (5.0 × 95 cm) in AA buffer. The fractions containing MLCKase and MLCPase activities eluted together as a relatively wide peak of about 350 kDa. These fractions were further purified on Q-Sepharose FF or DEAE-Sepharose 6B-CL columns as described in the preceding paper (9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although this purification step made it possible to identify the SDS-PAGE bands corresponding to MLCPase catalytic (PC) and targeting (PT) subunits, a satisfactory separation of the kinase and the phosphatase was not obtained. Because of the high affinity of the kinase for CaM and the expected very low affinity of the phosphatase for CaM, a CaM affinity column was used but also failed to separate the kinase from the phosphatase. In our hands, the MLCKase always, and to a varied extent, copurified with the phosphatase. However, the phosphatase, which was not bound to the CaM affinity column, was usually free of the kinase activity. The fraction that is bound to, and eluted from, CaM affinity columns in the presence of Ca2+ is dealt with in the preceding paper (9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The MLCKase preparations eluted from CaM affinity column in the absence of Ca2+ are heavily contaminated by the phosphatase, even when the columns are washed with 0.36 M salt. These MLCKase·MLCPase complexes are the subject of the present report. Better separation of MLCKase and a kinase-phosphatase complex was obtained by application of the 350-kDa kinase-phosphatase fraction to a pair of chromatography columns (strong cation and anion exchanger) connected in tandem. After extensive washing and separate elution of these two columns, we found that most of the kinase was bound by the first column (Fig. 1A), and the reverse was true for the phosphatase. Practically all of the phosphatase activity passed through the first column and was bound by the second column (Fig. 1B). The level of KAMPPase was so high that, despite the addition of 0.5 μM microcystin-LR, the kinase activity was suppressed everywhere except in the fractions from the “ascending” and “descending” tubes outside of the phosphatase peak (Fig. 1B). On SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B), this type of KAMPPase preparation showed the PT and PC subunits and variable amounts of the kinase (130-kDa band). In addition, CaM, tropomyosin (TM), calcimedin (Calc), and other weak bands were also present.Fig. 2SDS-PAGE of the protein separation during cation exchange (A) and anion exchange (B) chromatography. Except for the fraction size, the patterns correspond to those of Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the MLCKase·MLCPase complex eluted from the second anion exchange column was applied to a CaM affinity column, all of the KAMPPase activity was bound by the column, provided that the kinase content was not too low and the losses of the PT subunit resulting from proteolytic degradation were not too high. In the presence of 0.1 mM Ca2+, the activity remained bound even at 360 mM salt but could be eluted together with the kinase with a buffer containing 2 mM EGTA. The four major bands in the eluted complex corresponded to the subunits described previously (Fig. 3, lane i). The four subunits were seemingly tightly associated. No dissociation was observed even after a 3.5-h preincubation in 3.5 M LiBr (in the absence of Ca2+) followed by passage of the complex through a Sephacryl S-200 column in buffer containing 0.5 M LiBr (results not shown). Based on this observation, we believe that MLCKase and MLCPase form a multienzyme complex of the type described for other enzyme systems (21Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 39-41Google Scholar). A similar multienzyme complex was formed after dialysis of the concentrated KAMPPase fraction obtained from the DEAE- or Q-Sepharose columns (Fig. 3, lane k). Both complexes are only partly soluble at physiological salt concentrations and are bound to myosin filaments with relatively high affinity when sedimented through a 5-50% sucrose gradient (results not shown). Consistent with the suggested tight binding of KAMPPase to MLCKase, KAMPPase activity was present in all of the MLCKase preparations, and the bands corresponding to the two phosphatase subunits could be identified on heavily loaded SDS-PAGE gels of purified MLCKase (Fig. 3; compare lanes a and b). The presence of this endogenous KAMPPase activity in MLCKase preparations depended not only on the integrity of the PT subunit but also on the presence of CaM. In addition to the kinase, CaM was also present in the KAMPPase activity peak of the Q-Sepharose column (see Fig. 2B), but it was lost during the next ammonium sulfate concentration step when 0.5 mM EGTA was present in the elution buffer. The presence of phosphatase activity in apparently homogenous MLCKase preparations also was shown in another type of experiment. The kinase undergoes a slow autophosphorylation (22Sobieszek A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11855-11863Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the rate and the maximal level of this autocatalytic reaction are strongly affected by the presence of this endogenous phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 4A, the autophosphorylation (rate and maximal level) could be increased 3-10-fold by adding either okadaic acid or microcystin-LR, two of the most potent protein phosphatase inhibitors (5Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). For standard MLCKase preparation purified from the kinase peak of the DEAE-Sepharose but not passed through CaM affinity columns, the endogenous KAMPPase present may completely inhibit the autophosphorylation. In this case, the addition of 2.5 μM okadaic acid results in a 10-fold increase in the autophosphorylation rate (Fig. 4A). The autophosphorylation also could be decreased by adding the purified KAMPPase or its PC subunit (see 9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This indicates that autophosphorylated MLCKase was a good substrate for the KAMPPase. Because of the presence of endogenous KAMPPase in purified MLCKase preparations, it is apparent that these preparations should also be considered as containing MLCKase·MLCPase multienzyme complexes. These types of preparations, having relatively low phosphatase content, exhibit a characteristic autophosphorylation rate change when the CaM:kinase ratio is optimal for autophosphorylation. The steep initial rise in the CaM-dependent autophosphorylation is followed by a decline (Fig. 4B). The system should, however, approach steady state at which the autophosphorylation level remains constant (e.g. Fig. 4B; CM = 0 μM). The decrease in autophosphorylation indicates that there was an increase in the KAMPPase activity that also depended on CaM. We suggest that as a result of autophosphorylation, the PC subunit may be activated or simply dissociates from the kinase. A similar or related 2-fold increase in the endogenous KAMPPase activity was observed after the addition of CaM to the kinase (Fig. 4B; inset). We have recently shown that the addition of telokin to MLCKase increases the relative concentration of MLCKase dimers (or monomers) and decreases that of the oligomers (23Nieznanski K. Sobieszek A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Since evidence given in the following section indicates that oligomeric species are responsible for association of MLCKase and MLCPase, telokin may facilitate dissociation of the phosphatase or its subunit from MLCKase oligomers. As shown in Fig. 4C, the addition of increasing amounts of telokin to the purified complex resulted in progressive increases in its MLCPase activity. At the same time, telokin had no effect on the phosphatase activity of the purified PC subunit or the PTC holoenzyme (Fig. 4C). We interpret this observation as telokin-induced dissociation of the KAMPPase or its PC subunit from the kinase-phosphatase complex. The kinase-phosphatase complex was subjected to further purification steps, which included hydroxylapatite, gel filtration, and commonly used short (5-cm) γSP-ReLC affinity columns. None of these columns produced any substantial separation of the kinase from the already identified KAMPPase subunits, although several different ionic strengths were used. However, use of a long (0.9 × 60-cm) γSP-ReLC affinity column together with elution by a linear 120-360 mM NaCl gradient resulted in separation of the kinase-free PTC holoenzyme and the kinase-containing multienzyme complex (Fig. 4; see also Fig. 3, lanes e and j). The presence of the PT and PC subunits in both complexes indicates again that the PT subunit acted as the PC targeting subunit for the kinase. The long affinity columns amplified the small differences in the affinity of the complex for the γSP-ReLC light chain by introducing gel filtration effects. Fractionation of the multienzyme complex or its components observed during simple gel filtration chromatography is shown in Fig. 6. In the absence of CaM and at 360 mM salt, some separation between the kinase and the PTC holoenzyme was observed, but not between the PT and PC subunits (Fig. 6A). This indicates that affinity of the PT subunit for the kinase was lower than that for the PC subunit. A similar separation was observed for a MLCKase preparation containing endogenous KAMPPase (Fig. 6B). The elution position of the phosphatase peak corresponded to a molecular mass of about 150 kDa. Under similar conditions, the purified PC subunit eluted as a protein of 65 kDa. In contrast, in the presence of unsaturating CaM levels, there was close comigration of the KAMPPase activity and the absorption of the multienzyme complex (Fig. 6C). The elution position of the purified KAMPPase was not affected by the addition of CaM, indicating that CaM and Ca2+ were not absolutely needed for association of the PC and PT subunits (Fig. 6C), although Ca2+ was definitely needed for CaM binding to the kinase. Thus, the 67-kDa subunit appeared to be targeting not only the kinase but also CaM and could, therefore, act as an anchor for other CaM-binding enzymes. The targeting role of the PT subunit for CaM and MLCKase was also demonstrated in direct binding experiments with our miniature CaM affinity columns (see “Materials and Methods”). The purified C subunit was not bound by CaM (Fig. 7A), but in the presence of the PT subunit most of the PC subunit was bound to the column and eluted at high ionic strength (Fig. 7, B and C). The elution was preceded by washing the miniature columns with the AA buffer containing 0.1 mM Ca2+. Although not all of the PT subunit applied was bound by the miniature columns, the presence of intact kinase enhanced this binding (Fig. 7D). This indicates again that both the kinase and CaM were the targets for the PT subunit. The incomplete binding of the PC subunit in the presence of the PT subunit (Fig. 7, B and C) also could result from the limiting amount of the PT subunit present in the purified preparation loaded onto the CaM affinity columns. Degradation or modification of the PT subunit results in a doublet detected on SDS-PAGE. It is clear from the figures that only the upper band of this doublet binds to the columns. We have previously shown (24Sobieszek A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that MLCKase and CaM are very tightly bound to filamentous smooth muscle myosin. As a result, the addition of Ca2+ and ATP to purified myosin leads to a very rapid phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain. In similar experiments, we showed that the MLCPase was also associated with the same type of myosin preparations. As shown in Fig. 8, after initial rapid phosphorylation, myosin becomes dephosphorylated by this endogenous phosphatase. Both enzymes are simultaneously active, and the resulting phosphorylation rate and extent depended only on the kinase and the phosphatase activities of the myosin. However, as soon as the ATP concentration becomes relatively low, the kinase no longer acts, and the phosphatase activity prevails. This results in biphasic phosphorylation progress curves (Fig. 8). Correspondingly, the duration of the high levels of phosphorylation could be extended by adding microcystin-LR (Fig. 8). At the myosin concentration used (30-50 μM), the consumption of ATP resulting from the parallel action of the two enzymes was very low. Filamentous myosin ATPase was responsible for the rapid depletion of ATP. That the purified MLCKase·MLCPase complex or its PC subunit is very active toward phosphorylated filamentous myosin supports the hypothesis that a similar complex is responsible for the dephosphorylation of myosin filaments in vivo This was shown in our experiments comparing these activities for the three relevant substrates, namely isolated ReLC, filamentous myosin, and actomyosin. In this case, the endogenous MLCKase or MLCPase was removed from the myosin (see 24Sobieszek A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and actomyosin (see 25Sobieszek A. Small J.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 559-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the complex (added before the initiation of the assay) was the only source of both the activities. As shown in Fig. 9, the complex phosphorylated all three substrates up to the maximal levels of 0.7-1.0 mol/mol and at approximately the same high rate. In contrast, the dephosphorylation rates, measured after the addition of EGTA, were very different. Under approximately the same conditions, the filamentous myosin became fully dephosphorylated within the 2-3 min following removal of Ca2+, while the isolated light chain was hardly dephosphorylated at all during the same time. Subsequent experiments showed that the intermediate dephosphorylation rate of actomyosin resulted from blocking of the phosphorylation site by F-actin, a phenomenon also observed with the isolated PC-subunit (data not shown) and which could, perhaps, be related to the latch state of myosin (for references, see 26Murphy R.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). During the last 10-15 years, numerous phosphatases have been purified from smooth muscle (for references, see 9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These phosphatases were not myofibrillar, because they have been extracted from the muscle cytosol. As indicated in the Introduction, the presence of a catalytic subunit of about 37 kDa and another subunit in a range of 58-72 kDa are their common features. Thus, some analogy to our myofibrillar 37- and 67-kDa phosphatase is apparent. The possible relationship between these “old” phosphatases and our myofibrillar phosphatase was discussed in the preceding paper (9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, we will restrict the present discussion to the more recent myofibrillar MLCPase of Alessi et al. (10Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Partial characterization of this phosphatase appeared during the course of our study (10Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar; see also 12Shirazi A. Iizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MLCPase extracted from gizzard muscle myofibrils was shown to contain three subunits; a 130-kDa regulatory subunit, a 37-kDa catalytic subunit, and an unidentified component of 20 kDa. Because Alessi et al. used a method of preparing myofibrils that involved less fragmentation and washing and included a 0.6 M KCl extraction step, there is some uncertainty about comparing their results with ours. It is also not clear whether or not the catalytic subunits observed in the two studies are the same. Our PC subunit eluted as an apparent dimer at low and at high ionic strength, while that of Alessi et al. (10Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) appears to be monomeric. Since both of the enzymes are of a myofibrillar type, have catalytic subunits of the same Mr, and are from gizzard muscle, they must be at least closely related. The presence of the 130-kDa MLCKase band in our multienzyme complex, on the one hand, and of a 130-kDa regulatory subunit in the MLCPase preparation of Alessi et al. (10Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), on the other hand, raises questions. A plausible explanation would be the presence of a 130-kDa subunit comigrating with the kinase on SDS-PAGE gels. Such a subunit would have to bind CaM (as the kinase does) and have some properties similar to this enzyme but be free of MLCKase activity. We consider this possibility as unlikely because the presence of the 130-kDa band in our KAMPPase preparations was always accompanied by high levels of kinase activity. Even a lack of such activity does not necessarily mean that the kinase is completely absent. In such situations, demonstration of the kinase activity required the addition of microcystin-LR to the assay medium and high dilution of the preparations. Further studies are needed to clarify this possible controversy. One of the novel aspects of the present study is our suggestion that the two key regulatory enzymes of smooth muscle form a multienzyme complex. Our observations, including those of the preceding paper (9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), together with those from other groups (references given below when applicable) can be summarized as follows: 1) presence of endogenous MLCPase activity in virtually all apparently homogenous MLCKase preparations (27Tokui T. Ando S. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5173-5179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); 2) copurification of the MLCKase activity with MLCPase during almost all of the purification steps (see also 28Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 3) formation of a kinase-phosphatase complex that bound to the CaM affinity column in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner and which could not be eluted even at high salt concentrations; 4) binding of this complex to filamentous myosin; 5) presence of endogenous MLCKase and MLCPase activities on myosin filaments (3Sobieszek A. Raeburn D. Gienbycz M.A. Airways Smooth Muscle: Biochemical Control of Contraction and Relaxation. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1994: 1-29Crossref Google Scholar, 29Mitsui T. Inagaki M. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16727-16735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 6) common presence of a 67-kDa subunit (for references see the Introduction), which was identified here as a CaM- and MLCKase-targeting subunit. Consistent with this hypothesis is the recent discovery that protein kinase A and protein phosphatase 2B associate together with a common targeting protein of 79 kDa (30Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In addition, our recently published observations on cross-linking of MLCKase (31Babiychuk E.B. Babiychuk V.S. Sobieszek A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6366-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the results of light scattering measurements (32Filenko A.M. Danilova V.M. Sobieszek A. Biophys. J. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) point to properties of smooth muscle MLCKase that are particularly relevant to complex formation. These results indicate that, in solution, the kinase is oligomeric. The kinase dimers are in equilibrium with monomers and oligomers such that, under approximately physiological conditions (5 μM of MLCKase in AA buffer containing 120 mM NaCl), there are approximately 53% dimers, 45% monomers, and 2% oligomers. The very low binding stoichiometry indicates that the phosphatase may bind predominantly to the kinase oligomers. This conclusion is consistent not only with the data showing the effect of telokin or CaM on the multienzyme complex, but also with our light scattering measurements (32Filenko A.M. Danilova V.M. Sobieszek A. Biophys. J. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The determinations of a relative molecular weight by light scattering demonstrates that during elution from the strong cation exchange columns (the conditions facilitating separation of the phosphatase), the kinase is monomeric. This contrasts with the kinase (or the complex) eluted from the CaM affinity column that exhibited the highest relative molecular weight, i.e. the highest oligomer content (16%) (32Filenko A.M. Danilova V.M. Sobieszek A. Biophys. J. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The CaM-dependent targeting of the PC subunit to the MLCKase oligomers is consistent with the previously observed (13Sobieszek A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) high affinity binding (or trapping) of 125I-CaM by these oligomers during gel filtration experiments. In addition, the binding of MLCKase by both cation exchange and anion exchange gels demonstrated in the present study indicates that this enzyme possesses two strong and oppositely charged domains that could be responsible for the observed oligomerization. One of these domains, not involved in the binding to an anion exchanger gel, could bind the PT subunit and, in this way, be responsible for formation of the complex. The regulatory potential was demonstrated by the 10-20-fold stimulation of KAMPPase activity by preincubation with micromolar concentrations of CoCl2 (9Sobieszek A. Babiychuk E.B. Ortner B. Borkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7027-7033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Significantly, this activation was not observed for the multienzyme complex or for the PTC holoenzyme. This indicates not only a great regulatory potential of the targeting subunit but also that the interaction between the subunits is specific. In agreement with a recent study (33Okubo S. Erdödi F. Ito M. Ichikawa K. Konishi T. Nakano T. Kawamura T. Brautigan D.L. Hartshorne D.J. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1993; 7: 295-314Google Scholar), lower and rather variable activation by CoCl2 was observed by us for the endogenous myosin phosphatase. In view of the proteolytic susceptibility of the PT subunit it is not clear whether this can be interpreted as absence of this subunit on filamentous myosin. The presence of the other subunits (i.e. CaM and MLCKase) necessary for association of the complex with myosin was demonstrated previously (24Sobieszek A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In view of the low molar stoichiometry of the kinase to the KAMPPase it is apparent that there is more than sufficient kinase or CaM to fulfill this role. One would expect that the association of the PC subunit within the complex should have more significant regulatory consequences than the commonly observed modification of its specific activity. We suggest that, in general, formation of the complex plays a role in the localization of the MLCPase on the myosin filaments. A possible consequence of the association of the complex with myosin filaments could be a direct, first step inhibition of the kinase by the MLCPase as suggested recently by Johnson and Snyder (4Johnson J.D. Snyder C.H. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although we favor this suggestion, it is clear that this would be difficult to distinguish experimentally from an indirect inhibition resulting from dephosphorylation catalysis by the phosphatase. A CaM-dependent inhibition of the kinase activity at low CaM:MLCKase molar ratios has already been demonstrated (34Sobieszek A. Strobl A. Ortner B. Babiychuk E.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, we concluded previously that the inhibition does not result from dephosphorylation catalysis by the endogenous KAMPPase. This endogenous kinase-phosphatase was, however, responsible for the observed, apparently CaM-dependent, decline of the CaM-dependent autophosphorylation levels of the kinase. Therefore, we conclude that there is a regulatory step that initially permits significant levels of autophosphorylation despite presence of the phosphatase. Elucidation of this initial inactivating step should help in understanding the regulation of the kinase and the phosphatase activities of the multienzyme complex described in the present study.

Adenylosuccinate synthetase (AMPSase) 1The abbreviations used are: AMPSaseadenylosuccinate synthetaseMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. (IMP:L-aspartate ligase (GDP forming), EC 6.3.4.4.) catalyzes the first committed step in the conversion of IMP to AMP in the de novo synthetic pathway for purine nucleotides:IMP + L-aspartate + GTP⇄Mg2+ adenylosuccinate + GDP + PiREACTION 1 adenylosuccinate synthetase matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization. Adenylosuccinate is then cleaved by adenylosuccinate lyase to form AMP and fumarate. AMPSase also plays a role in the salvage and nucleotide interconversion pathways (1Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The enzyme is potentially a target of a natural herbicide (2Heim D.R Cseke C. Gewick B.C. Murdoch M.G. Green S.B Pestic. Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 53: 138-145Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and of a drug used in the treatment of pediatric leukemia (3DeAbreu R.A. Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism in Man VIII. Plenum Press, New York1995: 195-200Google Scholar). Better understanding of the synthetase could support efforts in the design of drugs against human immunodeficiency virus and cancer (4Ahluwalia G. Cooney D.A. Mitsuya H. Fridland A. Flora K.P. Hao Z. Dalal M. Broder S. Johns D.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 22: 3797-3800Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Three different mechanisms have been proposed for the catalytic action of AMPSase (1Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The most widely accepted mechanism involves a 6-phosphoryl-IMP intermediate formed by the nucleophilic attack of the 6-oxo group of IMP on the γ-phosphorus atom of GTP (5Lieberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 223: 327-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Fromm H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 29: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A second nucleophilic attack by the amino group of aspartate on C-6 of 6-phosphoryl IMP displaces the phosphate and forms adenylosuccinate. AMPSase was first purified to homogeneity in 1976 from Escherichia coli (7Stayton M.M. Fromm H.J. Biochem. Biophys. ActaAbstract from the 172nd Annual Meeting of the American Chemical Society, San Francisco, CA, August 1976. American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C.1977: 155Google Scholar) and has since been purified and characterized from many sources (1Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The purA gene, which in E. coli codes for AMPSase, was cloned in 1986 (8Wolfe S.A. Smith J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19147-19153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used in the construction of an overexpression system (9Bass M.B. Fromm H.J. Stayton M.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of AMPSase was determined to 2.8 Å (10Poland B.W. Silva M.M. Serra M.A. Cho Y. Kim K.H. Harris E.M.S. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25334-25342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and later refined to 2.5 and 2.0 Å (11Silva M.M. Poland B.W. Hoffman C.R. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In crystal structures, the enzyme exists as a homodimer. Two nearly independent regions contribute to the interface between the polypeptide chains of the synthetase dimer. Residues putatively involved in the binding of IMP lie at or near the interface between polypeptide chains in the dimeric form of the enzyme. One of the residues, Asp231, may play an important role in holding the subunits in close contact by hydrogen bonding to Arg147 and Lys140 of the 2-fold related subunit. Indeed, when Lys140 and Arg147 were replaced by isoleucine and leucine, respectively, Km(GTP) and Km(IMP) showed significant increases (12Dong Q. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6235-6240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dong Q. Lui F. Myers A.M. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12228-12233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal structures imply that Arg143 is involved in IMP binding to the active site of the symmetry-related subunit of the dimer. Arg143 may also stabilize the interface through at least one hydrogen bond. Slow phase inactivation of AMPSase was observed when guanosine-5′-O-[S-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)] thiophosphate modifies the enzyme at Arg143. Modification of Arg143 is prevented by adenylosuccinate alone or by a mixture of GTP, MgCl2, and IMP (14Moe O.A. Baker-Malcom J.F. Wang W. Kang C. Fromm H.J. Coburn R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9024-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cited findings suggest a direct relationship between dimer formation and AMPSase activity. AMPSase exists as a monomer in solution (15Rudolph F.B. Purification, Properties, and Kinetics of Adenylosuccinate Synthase from Escherichia Coli. 1971; (Ph. D. Thesis, Iowa State University, Ames)Google Scholar), yet the enzyme is a dimer in crystal structures (10Poland B.W. Silva M.M. Serra M.A. Cho Y. Kim K.H. Harris E.M.S. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25334-25342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Silva M.M. Poland B.W. Hoffman C.R. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the level of aggregation of the enzyme in solution and the crystal is the basis of an important question: Does AMPSase function as a monomer or as a dimer? MALDI mass spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and initial rate kinetics were used to determine the state of aggregation and activity of wild-type AMPSase and several interface mutants. Arg143 was replaced with leucine to remove the guanidinium group and yet retain some of the hydrophobic attributes of the original side chain. Mutation of Arg143 to lysine retains the positive charge but limits hydrogen bonding opportunities of the side chain at position 143. Asp231 was replaced with alanine so as to disrupt the Lys140-Asp231 salt link observed in the crystalline dimer. Our findings indicate that the E. coli enzyme dimerizes in response to active site ligands and that on the basis of sequence homology, dimerization may be a property common to all known adenylosuccinate synthetases, regardless of source. GTP, IMP, L-aspartate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. A site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Amersham Corp. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega. E. coli strain XL-1 blue was obtained from Stratagene. E. coli strain purA− H1238 was a gift from Dr. D. Bachman (Genetic Center, Yale University). Other reagents and chemicals used in the experiments were obtained from Sigma if not specified. Recombinant DNA manipulation was performed by using standard procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid containing a 1.8-kilobase BamHI-HindIII fragment from PMS204 ligated into PUC118 was used in the mutagenesis step. All mutagenic oligonucleotide primers used in the experiments were synthesized on a Bioresearch 8570EX automated DNA synthesizer at the DNA Facility at Iowa State University. Mutagenesis was performed according to the protocol provided by Amersham Corp. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the chain termination method (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) at the Iowa State University DNA Facility. The 1.8-kilobase Bam HI-HindIII fragment with the desired mutation was ligated back into PMS204 and transformed into XL-1 blue cells. The plasmids isolated from that strain were used to transform E. coli strain purA− H1238, the strain from which AMPSase was purified. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Concentrations reported here refer to monomers. The wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified as described elsewhere (9Bass M.B. Fromm H.J. Stayton M.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). AMPSase activity was determined as described earlier (20Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of stock solutions of nucleotides were based on their molar extinction coefficients at 253 nm for GTP and 248 nm for IMP. For each enzyme assay, the increase at 290 nm was recorded at 25°C. The enzyme assay solution contained 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.7) and 5 mM MgCl2. When GTP was the variable substrate, the concentration of aspartate was fixed at 5 mM, and the IMP concentration was fixed at 450 μM for wild-type AMPSase and at 12 mM for the mutants. When IMP was the variable substrate, the concentration of GTP was fixed at 300 μM, and aspartate was fixed at 5 mM. When aspartate was the variable substrate, the concentration of GTP was fixed at 300 μM, and the concentration of IMP at 450 μM for the wild-type AMPSase and 12 mM for the mutants. To obtain the values of Kia and Kib, dissociation constants for GTP and IMP, respectively, a 5 × 5 matrix of substrates were used with each enzyme. The enzyme assay solution contained 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.7), 5 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM aspartate and varying GTP and IMP concentrations. The kinetic data were fit to Equation 1 using a program written in Minitab in place of the Omnitab program described by Siano et al. (21Siano D.B. Zyskind J.W. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 170: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar):1v=1Vm[1 + KaA+KbB+KiaKbAB](Eq. 1) It was assumed that the kinetic mechanism for the mutant enzymes was the same as the rapid equilibrium Random mechanism described for the wild-type enzyme (5Lieberman I.

Kib is the dissociation constant for IMP. Circular dichroisim spectra for the wild-type and mutant enzymes were acquired on a JASCO J700 spectropolarimeter equipped with a data processor. Samples (100 μg/ml of enzyme) dialyzed against 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, were placed in a 1-cm cuvette, and data points were collected in 0.1-nm increments. Each spectrum was corrected for background contributions of the buffer and smoothed using the spectropolarimeter program. The data were analyzed by JASCO analysis software or by PSIPLOT. All of the enzymes were dialyzed against 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Samples of 0.5-1.0 μl were loaded with 0.5 μl of freshly made 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid matrix. Bovine serum albumin was used as the internal calibration standard. Data were collected on a Finnigan LASERMAT 2000 MALDI-time of flight mass analyzer in the Protein Facility of Iowa State University and were analyzed by the LASERMAT 2000 data processing software. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge. The temperature of the rotor (AN-60 Ti) was set at 4°C. Rotor speeds were set at 10,000, 14,000, and 18,000. Wild-type and mutant AMPSase samples were prepared in 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at concentrations of 2.9-11.6 μM corresponding to absorbences of 0.2-0.8 (280 nm, 1-cm cuvette). Concentration-dependent equilibrium sedimentation was performed with concentrations of 4.3 and 58 μM, corresponding to A280 nm readings of 0.3 and 4.0. Samples of AMPSase in the presence of ligands were prepared by dialysis overnight against 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mM succinate, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 μM IMP, and 20 μM GTP. Protein samples were centrifuged at least 10 h before the collection of data. Stepwise radial scans were performed at 280 nm for the wild-type and mutant enzymes with and without ligands, and at 280, 295, and 300 nm for the concentration-dependent equilibrium sedimentation. Each reading is the average of 30 points with nominal spacing of 0.001 cm between radial positions. Absorbance readings were measured at 1-h intervals to ensure that equilibrium had been reached. Three scans were averaged, and the data were analyzed by the method of Van Hold and Weischet (22Van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using the “IDEAL” model on the Optima XL-A Analysis Software (version 2.0) to get the apparent molecular mass. The partial specific volume of AMPSase, 0.737 cm3/g, was calculated by the method of Cohn and Edsall (23Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar). Equilibrium sedimentation data for the wild-type and mutant enzymes obtained at three different rotor speeds were analyzed using the “SELF” model in multiple data set analysis program Optima XLA. The association constants (Ka) for the monomer-dimer equilibrium were obtained using the following equation:cr=E+cm,r0exp[M(1−v¯p)ω2(r2−r02)/2RT]+(cm,r0)2Kaexp[2M(1−v¯p)ω2(r2−r02)/2RT](Eq. 2) where cr is the concentration of the protein at a given radial position, cm,ro is the concentration of monomer at a reference position, M is the monomer molecular mass, υ is the partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the angular velocity, r is the radial position in centimeters from the center of rotation, ro is the distance in centimeters from the center of rotation to the meniscus, T is the absolute temperature, R is the gas constant, and E is a correction term for a nonzero baseline. The conversion of Ka into the dissociation constant Kd (μM) is performed as follows:Kd=(2/∈lKa)=24.2/Ka(μM)(Eq. 3) X-ray crystallographic studies suggest that interface residues play an important role in maintaining the quaternary structures of AMPSase (10Poland B.W.

Arg143 in one subunit is ligated to the 5′-phosphoryl of IMP in the active site of the juxtaposed subunit (11Silva M.M. Poland B.W. Hoffman C.R. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol.

Asp231 forms a salt link with Lys140, a residue putatively essential for AMPSase activity as a means of stabilizing subunit-subunit association. Experiments involving mutation of residues Arg143 and Asp231 were undertaken to gain insight into the role of these interface residues. Arg143 and Asp231 are conserved in the nine known AMPSase sequences (8Wolfe S.A. Smith J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19147-19153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mäntsälä P. Zalkin H.

Arg143 was changed to leucine and lysine. Asp231 was mutated to alanine. These mutations altered the charge states of residues and/or hydrogen bonding interactions observed in crystallographic structures while keeping the size of the side chain comparable with that of the original residue. All the mutants were purified by using procedures similar to those for wild-type AMPSase with some modifications. The D231A mutant bound to the phenyl sepharose CL-4B so tightly that it could be eluted only by water. All the enzymes exhibited greater than 95% purity on the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a molecular mass of 48 kDa (data not shown).Table II.Oligonucleotides used in site-directed mutagenesis and sequencingMutantsSequences of primersaUnderlined letters indicate the mismatches.R143LCAGACCGCGAAGTGCTACTTTATCR143KCAGACCGCGTTTTGCTACTTTATCD231ATAAGTACCGTGGGCGATATCCAGSequencing primer for residue 143CTGTGTGAAGCATGTCCSequencing primer for residue 231ATGGCTGTTGCCGACATCa Underlined letters indicate the mismatches. Open table in a new tab Circular dichroisim spectra of the mutant and wild-type enzymes were superimposable (data not shown) from 200 to 260 nm, indicating no global alterations in the secondary structures of the mutants relative to wild-type AMPSase. The kinetic parameters for GTP, IMP, and aspartate with various forms of AMPSase are summarized in Table III. The Km values for aspartate illustrate that the mutants differed little from that of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that Arg143 and Asp231 are not involved in the binding of aspartate. In addition, the mutant and wild-type AMPSases had comparable kcat values; however, Km values for GTP and IMP exhibited significant increases for the mutant enzymes relative to wild-type AMPSase. The Km(GTP) values for R143K, R143L, and D231A showed 2-, 10-, and 20-fold increases, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. On the other hand, even more dramatic changes were observed for the Km values of IMP. Increases in Km(IMP) of 100-, 100-, and 60-fold for the mutants R143K, R143L, and D231A, respectively, were observed relative to that of wild-type AMPSase. In addition, increases in Kia(IMP) of 20-30-fold were also observed for the mutant enzymes, relative to that of the wild-type enzyme. These findings suggest that the residues in question contribute significantly to the binding of both IMP and GTP by stabilizing the dimer through hydrogen bonding, by direct interaction with IMP, or by both. The similar kinetic properties of R143K and R143L mutants with respect to IMP binding suggest that the positive charge of lysine alone did not restore wild-type properties, suggesting a precise hydrogen bonding and stereochemical role for Arg143. The models for R143K and R143L are presented and discussed below (Fig. 1).Table IIIKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant AMPSases from E. coliProteinkcatKm(GTP)Km(IMP)Km(ASP)Kia(GTP)Kib(IMP)s−1μMmMmMμMmMWild type1.00 ± 0.0526.2 ± 2.300.03 ± 0.000.23 ± 0.0438.8 ± 6.400.07 ± 0.01R143K1.04 ± 0.0158.3 ± 6.302.50 ± 0.250.26 ± 0.0531.0 ± 5.921.50 ± 0.34R143L1.01 ± 0.01283 ± 26.22.79 ± 0.130.34 ± 0.06196 ± 37.61.26 ± 0.25D231A0.76 ± 0.02503 ± 41.31.31 ± 0.230.50 ± 0.03197 ± 62.32.04 ± 0.67 Open table in a new tab AMPSase in solution is a monomer (15Rudolph F.B.

Biol. 1995; 254: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We assumed that subunit association might involve interface residues such as Arg143; therefore, experiments were undertaken to evaluate this possibility. The mutant enzymes and wild-type AMPSase were analyzed by MALDI mass spectroscopy. A typical spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. Given the estimated molecular mass of the monomer as 46 kDa, three ionized species were observed from 20 to 110 kDa, corresponding to mass values of 23.4 kDa (M = 46.6 kDa, Z = 2), 46.6 kDa (M = 46.6 kDa, Z = 1), 92.7 kDa (2M = 92.7 kDa, Z = 1). The existence of a 92.7-kDa peak indicates the presence of dimers. Subunit association of wild-type AMPSase was evaluated at three different concentrations (32McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-Associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman, Fullerton, CA1993: 8Google Scholar). Considering the molecular mass of the monomeric and dimeric enzymes, three different centrifugation speeds were utilized (10,000, 14,000, and 18,000). The molecular mass of AMPSase does not depend on either the centrifugation speed or the protein concentration under the conditions tested. Typical equilibrium sedimentation data are shown in Fig. 3a Fig. 3b shows the relationship between wild-type protein concentration and apparent molecular mass. At low concentrations (A280 nm = 0.1), the apparent molecular mass was 45 kDa, which matches the result determined by MALDI mass spectroscopy. At higher concentrations (A280 nm≥ 0.65), the apparent molecular mass approaches 60 kDa, which is between the molecular mass for monomeric and dimeric AMPSase. This observation strongly indicates the existence of a monomer-dimer equilibrium. Dissociation constants for dimer-monomer equilibria of wild-type and mutant AMPSases are shown in Table IV. At micromolar concentrations of enzyme in the absence of ligands, the Kd values are approximately 10 μM for all the enzymes, indicating low concentrations of dimers under these conditions. In the presence of active site ligands, the mutant enzymes exhibited small decreases in Kd values, suggesting a slight increase of dimers, whereas the wild-type enzyme exhibited a large decrease in Kd, implying that virtually all the protein is present as dimer. Active site ligands apparently are less effective in the stabilization of the mutant dimers. Our findings support the important roles played by the interface residues in forming AMPSase dimers.Table IV.Monomer-dimer dissociation constantsEnzymeA280 nmKdaThe dissociation constant in 280 nm absorbance units.KdbThe dissociation constant in μM determined by Equation 3 shown under “Experimental Procedures.”Goodness of fitcGoodness of fit was determined by the χ2 test (32).μMIn the absence of ligandsWild type0.30.46411.20.0304.00.1704.123.54R143K0.30.45210.90.777R143L0.20.3949.530.849D231A0.30.3628.760.207In the presence of ligandsWild type0.44.26 × 10−401.03 × 10−380.00019R143K0.40.1784.311.96R143L0.40.3077.432.07D231A0.40.2085.030.151a The dissociation constant in 280 nm absorbance units.b The dissociation constant in μM determined by Equation 3 shown under “Experimental Procedures.”c Goodness of fit was determined by the χ2 test (32McRorie D.K.

They regulate the expression of seven (classes A-E, G, and H) tetracycline (tc) resistance determinants present in Gram-negative bacteria. In the absence of tc, TetR is bound via an α-helix-turn-α-helix motif (HTH) to tetO In the presence of tc, TetR dissociates rapidly from tetO allowing expression of tc resistance (for a review, see 9Hillen W.

Two crystal structures of the induced TetR(D)·([Mg-tc];)2 complex have recently been solved (10Hinrichs W. Kisker C. Düvel M. Müller A. Tovar K. Hillen W. Saenger W.

These helices must approach each other by 5 Å and at least 50° to be able to bind to B-form DNA (9Hillen W. Berens C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 345-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The inducer, [Mg-tc];, is bound in a deep pocket formed by residues from both monomers in the TetR dimer (10Hinrichs W.

Thus, the tc-bound form would correspond to the closed conformation, and the DNA-binding form may represent the open conformation. Loop movements are often involved in conformational changes in proteins where they contribute to the formation of ligand-binding sites and enzymatically active structures. Owing to their flexibility, these loops are not always defined in crystal structures (12Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland, New York1991: 18-19Google Scholar). In TetR(D), the loop from residues Ala-154 and Pro-167 separating helices α8 and α9 is flexible and leads only to weak electron density in the TetR(D)·([Mg-tc];)2 complex (11Kisker C. Hinrichs W. Tovar K. Hillen W. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Comparison of the residues in this loop in an alignment of TetR sequences (13Berens C. Pfleiderer K. Helbl V. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) shows that it contains a region variable in both primary structure and length (see Fig. 1 for a schematic representation of TetR). Its length ranges from 11 residues in TetR(E) to 18 residues in TetR(C) (11Kisker C. Hinrichs W. Tovar K. Hillen W. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and is the only internal segment of TetR that is variable in length. Substitutions of single amino acids and deletions of 3 and 16 amino acids in this variable loop have shown that it is important for inducibility by tc but not for DNA binding (13Berens C.

Biol. 1995; 247: 260-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of this variable loop in induction by introducing deletions and substitutions in TetR(B). Deletions led to induction deficiency of TetR(B), and the TetR variants bind tc with a reduced affinity. We suggest that these mutations act by interfering with the initial closure of the tc-binding pocket. Chemicals were from Merck (Darmstadt), Serva (Heidelberg), Sigma (München), or Roth (Karlsruhe) and of the highest purity available. Tc was from Fluka (Buchs). Enzymes for DNA restriction and modification were from Boehringer Mannheim, Life Technologies, Inc. (Eggenstein), New England BioLabs (Schwalbach), or Pharmacia (Freiburg). Isolation and manipulation of DNA was as described (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing was carried out according to the protocol provided by Pharmacia for use with T7 DNA polymerase, with [α-32P]dATP from Amersham (Braunschweig). Soluble protein extracts were prepared and analyzed in Western blots as described (13Berens C. Pfleiderer K. Helbl V. Hillen W. Mol.

The plasmids pWH1200, pWH1201, pWH510 (22Altschmied L. Baumeister R. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4011-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), pWH520 (23Berens C. Altschmied L.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1206-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that were used in the in vivo studies have been described. The plasmids pWH1919 and pWH620 are derivatives of pWH520. They differ from pWH520 only in the number of additional single restriction sites in their tetR genes. PWH1919 contains restriction sites for BstXI and MluI (14Hecht B. Müller G. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1206-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), pWH620, in addition to the BstXI and MluI sites, also sites for SauI and NcoI (see below). The plasmid pWH1950 used for overexpression of TetR variants has also been described (24Ettner N. Müller G. Berens C. Backes H. Schnappinger D. Schreppel T. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. J. Chromatogr.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1206-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis have been described. Mutations were introduced into the tetR gene by PCR according to the three-primer method of Landt et al. (26Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The conditions for the first PCR were as follows: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μM dNTP, 3 μM of the primer 1 and the mutagenic primer each, 636 pM pWH1919, 7.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg) in a total reaction volume of 150 μl; 25 cycles: 2 min/94°C, 2 min/45°C, 1 min 30 s/72°C. One third (15 μl) of the purified (Promega Magic PCRpreps, Heidelberg) amplification products from the PCR-I was added to the reaction mixture of the PCR-II (buffer as in PCR-I, 400 μM dNTP, 2.5 μM primer 2, 795 pM pWH1919, 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase in a total reaction volume of 100 μl; same program as in PCR-I). The 352-bp amplification products of the second PCR were purified, digested with NdeI and MluI, and cloned into likewise digested pWH1919 and pWH510. The entire 193-bp NdeI/MluI fragment was sequenced to ensure that only the desired mutation was present. For overexpression, the respective pWH1919 derivative was digested with XbaI and SphI. The resulting 711-bp fragment carrying the mutant tetR gene was ligated into likewise digested pWH1950. A restriction site for NcoI was introduced 18 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon of the tetR(B) gene located on mWH892-SauI by the method of Kunkel et al. (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) and following the experimental procedures of Su and El-Gewely (27ät, Erlangen-NürnbergTovar, K., (1989)Repressor-operator: Wechselwirkungen und repressor induzierte Struktur änderungen der Operator DNA bei Tetrazyklinresistenzgenen. Ph.D. thesis, Friedrich-Alexander Universität, Erlangen-Nürnberg.Google Scholar). The presence of the mutation was verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. The tetR(B) gene with the novel restriction site was cloned as 711-bp XbaI/SphI fragment from replicative form mWH892-SauI/NcoI into likewise digested pWH520. The resulting plasmid was named pWH620. The tetR(E) gene was amplified by PCR (buffer as in PCR-I (see above), 17 nM pWH905 (28ät, Erlangen-NürnbergTovar, K., (1989)Repressor-operator: Wechselwirkungen und repressor induzierte Struktur änderungen der Operator DNA bei Tetrazyklinresistenzgenen.

The resulting 657-bp PCR product was digested with XbaI and NcoI and ligated into likewise digested pWH620. The presence of tetR(E) was verified by sequencing the entire gene. It was cloned as 808-bp EcoRI/SphI fragment from pWH620(E) into likewise digested pWH1200, yielding a pWH510 derivative that was named pWH510(E). Mutations in the HTH motif were amplified by PCR (buffer as in PCR-I (see above), 200 μM dNTP, 1 μM each of the flanking primers, 370 pM of the pWH1411 DNA carrying the respective mutation in the HTH motif (20Wissmann A.

The 815-bp amplification products were purified (Promega Magic PCRpreps), digested with XbaI and SnaBI, and ligated into likewise digested pWH520 or pWH520Δ164-166. The 232-bp PCR product containing the HR44 mutation was also ligated into likewise digested pWH1919NS82, pWH1919PT105, and pWH1919DG178 (14Hecht B. Müller G. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1206-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All PCR products cloned were completely sequenced to ensure that no additional mutations had occurred. DNA binding and inducibility by tc was assayed in E. coli WH207(λtet50). The phage λtet50 contains a tetA-lacZ transcriptional fusion (25Smith L.D. Bertrand K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) integrated in single copy into the WH207 genome (20Wissmann A. Wray Jr., L.V. Somaggio U. Baumeister R. Geissendörfer M. Hillen W. Genetics. 1991; 128: 225-232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. β-Galactosidase activities were determined as described by Miller (31Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar). Four independent cultures were assayed for each strain and measurements repeated at least twice. Derivatives of pWH1950 containing the tetR variants were transformed into Escherichia coli RB791. Cells were grown in 1 liter of LB medium at 37°C in a 2-liter shaking flask, except for the strain containing TetR(E) that was grown at 28°C. The respective TetR variant was overexpressed by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM at an A600≈ 0.9 and incubating the culture for an additional 4 h. Isolation and purification of the protein was as described (24Ettner N. Müller G. Berens C. Backes H. Schnappinger D. Schreppel T. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1996; 742: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, München) and by saturating fluorescence titration with tc. The concentration of tc was determined by UV spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of ε355 = 13320 M−1 cm−1 in 0.1 N HCl (32Takahashi M. Altschmied L. Hillen W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Spex Fluorolog equipped with double Spex 1680 monochromators. The slit width was 2.2 mm for excitation (370 nm) and emission (515 nm), and an internal standard (8 mg/ml rhodamine B (Kodak, Stuttgart) in 1,2-propanediol (Fluka)) was used to correct for intensity fluctuations of the mercury lamp. Association constants K were determined under equilibrium conditions at 37°C as described (33Takahashi M. Degenkolb J. Hillen W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by fluorescence titration with limiting Mg2; concentrations. TetR monomer and tc were provided at equimolar concentrations of 1 μM. Free Mg2; concentrations ranging from 10−11 to 10−5M were adjusted using diluted stock solutions of MgCl2 and K buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, and 5 mM dithiothreitol) containing EDTA as a metal chelator (34Perrin D.D. Dempsey B. Buffers for pH and Metal Ion Control. Chapman and Hill Ltd., London1974Google Scholar). Free Mg2; concentrations ranging from 10−7 to 10−2M were adjusted using diluted stock solutions of MgCl2 and O buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM dithiothreitol) without EDTA. A KM of 2400 M−1 for the association of Mg2; to tc was employed to analyze the titration curves (35Lederer T. Kintrup M. Takahashi M. Sum P.-E. Ellestad G.A. Hillen W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7439-7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The fitting was performed by minimizing S2 = σ(Fexp− Ftheor)2, where Fexp and Ftheor are the experimental and theoretical fluorescence intensities, respectively. Fits with minimal S2 for a given pair of K and were transformed to K for α = 1 (no cooperativity in tc binding) by the equation Kα = 1 = α0.5× Kα. 2M. Kintrup, personal communication. Association rate constants ka were determined at 20, 30, and 40°C as described (32Takahashi M. Altschmied L. Hillen W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with equimolar concentrations of TetR monomer and tc at 25, 50, and 100 nM in F buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM dithiothreitol). All measurements were repeated at least twice. We introduced the set of mutations shown in Fig. 1 into the variable region of TetR(B) to evaluate the importance of its length and sequence for DNA binding and inducibility by tc. Deletion of the residues “DSM” in TetRΔ164-166 caused reduced in vivo inducibility (13Berens C. Pfleiderer K. Helbl V. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To address the importance of these side chains in a “loss of contact” experiment (36Ebright R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), they were changed to alanine (s164AAA). We also mutated these three residues to “PTT” (s164PTT) to investigate the effect of the junction (161-PTTΔPPLL-170) created by the deletion without altering the length of the variable region. To determine the effect of the length of the variable region on TetR(B) activity, we deleted one (Δ162), two (Δ161-162), or three (Δ161-163) residues in the segment between residues Thr-154-Asn-165 that is disordered in the TetR(D)·([Mg-tc];)2 crystal structure (10Hinrichs W. Kisker C. Düvel M. Müller A. Tovar K. Hillen W. Saenger W. Science. 1994; 264: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These residues were also substituted by alanine (TA162, s161AA, s161AAA). To determine the in vivo operator binding activity of the tetR mutants, they were transformed as pWH520 derivatives, which constitutively express TetR at a high level (37Wissmann A. Baumeister R. Müller G. Hecht B. Helbl V. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4145-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), into E. coli WH207(λtet50). Repression of the tetA-lacZ transcriptional fusion and inducibility by tc were determined at 37°C and are shown in the second and third columns of Table I. All tetR variants show wt operator-binding activity in that strain. Class E TetR on pWH620(E) shows a marginally reduced inducibility with 86%β-galactosidase activity compared with TetR(B). The same result was found for TetRs161AAA. All other mutants with substitutions to alanine are fully inducible. The substitution of residues 164-166 to “PTT” leads to partial inducibility. In contrast, all deletions are less efficiently inducible. Variants with deletions of three residues (Δ161-163, Δ164-166) are not inducible; the variant with a deletion of two residues (Δ161-162) is only 2-fold and that with a one residue deletion (Δ162) is 50-fold inducible.Table IIn vivo DNA binding and inducibility by tc of the mutants in the TetR variable regionβ-Galactosidase activity in %tetR variantpWH520 derivativepWH510 derivative>DNA bindingInduction by tcDNA bindingInduction by tcNone100 ± 2.5100 ± 5.3100 ± 4.2100 ± 4.6(B)1 ± 0.092 ± 2.47 ± 0.1101 ± 3.5(E)1 ± 0.086 ± 4.988 ± 4.498 ± 8.8(B)Δ164-1661 ± 0.01 ± 0.111 ± 1.322 ± 1.0(B)s161AAA1 ± 0.088 ± 2.611 ± 0.5101 ± 3.5(B)s164PTT1 ± 0.045 ± 2.213 ± 3.496 ± 5.3(B)Δ161-1631 ± 0.11 ± 0.17 ± 0.247 ± 3.3(B)s161AAA1 ± 0.086 ± 3.08 ± 0.195 ± 5.5(B)Δ161-1621 ± 0.02 ± 0.17 ± 0.374 ± 4.8(B)s161AA1 ± 0.093 ± 1.78 ± 0.498 ± 8.3(B)Δ1621 ± 0.053 ± 4.17 ± 0.698 ± 9.8(B)TA1621 ± 0.095 ± 6.49 ± 0.4102 ± 7.0 Open table in a new tab The DNA-binding activity of all TetR variants and the inducibility of the deletions of two and three residues are at the basal limit of lacZ expression with 1% of the β-galactosidase activity in unrepressed strains. The pWH520-based expression system provides no resolution for large defects in inducibility (15Müller G. Hecht B. Helbl V. Hinrichs W. Saenger W. Hillen W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and slight differences in repression (29Baumeister R. Helbl V. Hillen W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1257-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine differences in the DNA-binding activity and inducibility, we used a second expression system with a better resolution for mutants with wt-like binding activity (29Baumeister R. Helbl V. Hillen W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1257-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mutants were recloned into pWH510 that expresses TetR at an at least 30-fold reduced level (23Berens C. Altschmied L. Hillen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1945-1952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wissmann A. Baumeister R. Müller G. Hecht B. Helbl V. Pfleiderer K. Hillen W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4145-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The repression mediated by wt TetR in WH207(λtet50) at 37°C is only 14-fold in this construct, as compared with 100-fold in the pWH520-background (Table I, column 2). Repression with the pWH510 derivatives is presented in column four of Table I. TetRΔ161-163, TetRΔ161-162, and TetRΔ162 bind tetO with the same efficiency as wt, the other mutations lead to a less than 2-fold reduction in repression. Inducibility by tc was also determined and is shown in column 5 of Table I. The increased sensitivity of the pWH510 derivatives reveals that the TetR variants are inducible to different degrees. Only the deletions of three residues have a TetRS phenotype. They are 2- (Δ164-166) and 7-fold (Δ161-163) inducible. All other TetR variants tested are fully inducible at a lower expression level. The variable loop is clearly not important for DNA binding of TetR, since none of the mutations leads to significantly reduced repression of the tetA-lacZ transcriptional fusion. On the other hand, it is important for the inducibility by tc. Deletions of two and three amino acids lead to impaired inducibility, while none of the substitution mutants has a TetRS phenotype. We thus conclude that the deletions are mainly responsible for the TetRS phenotype. The slightly reduced inducibility of TetRs164PTT demonstrate that the amino acids at the positions deleted contribute to inducibility. Four effects can lead to a TetRS phenotype: (i) an increase in the protein steady-state level, (ii) a super-repressor, (iii) reduced binding of tc, and (iv) failure to release tet operator upon tc binding. Therefore, these questions were addressed. The steady-state levels of the TetR variants encoded by pWH520 derivatives in E. coli WH207(λtet50) were determined. Extracts of soluble protein were prepared from log-phase cultures grown under the same conditions as for the β-galactosidase activity measurements. Aliquots of these extracts, which allow the detection of 2-fold changes in TetR content (data not shown), were analyzed in Western blots for their TetR content. A typical result is shown in Fig. 2. The protein levels of the TetR mutants are either identical to the one of wt, or only slightly reduced. This rules out (i) as a cause of the TetRS phenotype and, in combination with the wt- or lower DNA-binding activity of the mutants (Table I), also eliminates the super-repressor explanation. The TetR variants of classes B and E, as well as the mutants s164PTT, Δ161-163, and Δ164-166 were overproduced and purified to homogeneity. Their binding constants for [Mg-tc]; were determined under equilibrium binding conditions by fluorescence titration with limiting Mg2; concentrations. The method measures the increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of [Mg-tc]; upon binding of TetR and can be used to determine binding constants between 1 × 1011 and 1 × 107M−1 of tc derivatives to TetR (35Lederer T. Kintrup M. Takahashi M. Sum P.-E. Ellestad G.A. Hillen W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7439-7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and of tc to TetR mutants (15Müller G. Hecht B. Helbl V. Hinrichs W. Saenger W. Hillen W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The titration curves obtained are shown in Fig. 3A The lowest free Mg2; concentration needed for fluorescence enhancement of tc is observed for TetR(E). Slightly higher Mg2; concentrations are needed for TetR(B) and TetRs164PTT, in that order, while both TetRΔ164-166 and TetRΔ161-163 require about 100-fold higher Mg2; concentration to show fluorescence enhancement. The best fits with the experimental data were obtained with cooperativity values for α ranging from 0.5 (TetRs164PTT) to 18 (TetR(E)). Varying α between these values changed the least square errors S2 (see “Experimental Procedures”) less than 5-fold (data not shown).

This fusion is initiated by the binding of HIV external and transmembrane envelope glycoprotein complex to the CD4 receptor and also is dependent on the presence of species-specific cofactors on the cell surface (for a review, see 1Moore J.P. Jameson B.A. Weiss R.A. Sattentau Q.J. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRS Press, Boca Raton, Fla1993: 233-289Google Scholar). The external envelope glycoprotein contains the binding site for the CD4 receptor and a hypervariable region of about 36 amino acids referred to as the V3 loop (2Moore J.P. Nara P.L. AIDS. 1991; 5: S18-S33Google Scholar). The transmembrane glycoprotein contains a potential fusion peptide at its amino terminus, which is implicated in the membrane fusion process (3Freed E.O. Myers D.J. Risser R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 190-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The external and transmembrane glycoproteins (gp120/gp41 for HIV-1) are associated in a noncovalent manner to generate a functional complex. The gp120·gp41 complex is essential for binding of HIV particles to the cell membrane, whereas in HIV-infected cells, this complex expressed on the cell surface is responsible for the initiation of cell to cell membrane fusion, leading to the formation of syncytia. The cell surface-expressed gp120·gp41 complex is also responsible for the initiation of cell death by apoptosis in HIV-infected cell cultures (4Hovanessian A.G. Tomei D.L. Cope F.O. Apoptosis II: the Molecular Basis of Apoptosis in Disease. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994: 18-42Google Scholar). The V3 loop plays a critical role in these well-defined functions of the gp120·gp41 complex 1Moore J.P. Jameson B.A. Weiss R.A. Sattentau Q.J. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms.

Virol. 1995; 146: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that it might be implicated in post-CD4 binding events by interacting with specific cell surface proteins (2Moore J.P. Nara P.L. AIDS. 1991; 5: S18-S33Google Scholar). human immunodeficiency virus template assembled synthetic peptide peripheral blood mononuclear cells phytohemagglutinin monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate phycoerythrin fluorescence-activated cell sorting dipeptidyl peptidase IV polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The V3 loop of different HIV-1 and HIV-2 isolates contains a highly conserved RP dipeptide motif at its NH2-terminal end (6Myers G. Korber B. Wain-Hobson S. Jeang K.-T. Henderson L.E. Pavlakis G.N. (eds) Human Retroviruses and AIDS 1994. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1994Google Scholar). In view of this, we have designed and synthesized a construction referred to as template assembled synthetic peptide (TASP) in which templates such as KKKGPKEKGC and KKKKGC were employed to covalently anchor arrays of tripeptides (RPR, RPK, or KPR) at the ∊-amino group of the lysine residues in the templates (7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The pentavalent presentation, 5(RPR)-, 5(RPK)-, or 5[KPR]-TASP molecules, manifested maximum inhibitory activity on infection of cells by HIV-1 and −2 but not by simian immunodeficiency virus isolates, thus emphasizing the specific nature of these TASP inhibitors. In already infected cells, the TASP inhibitors also blocked syncytium formation and the occurrence of apoptosis (7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These observations indicated that these TASP inhibitors block a defined target that should be implicated in the functioning of the gp120·gp41 complex to initiate viral entry, syncytium formation, and apoptosis. Structure and inhibitory activity relationship studies using analogs of 5[KPR]-TASP indicated that the two basic residues Lys and Arg in the tripeptide are essential and can be replaced by each other and that their positively charged side chains play a critical role in the inhibitory structure. Interestingly, replacement of Leu amino acid residues by Asp amino acids or the reduction of the peptide bond between the first two amino acids of the tripeptide generated pseudopeptide-TASP analogs active at submicromolar concentrations on HIV infection (7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By the use of FITC- and biotin-labeled 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP constructs, we demonstrate here that the TASP inhibitors bind specifically to a 95-kDa, cell surface protein (p95). The identity of p95 remains to be elucidated. However, because the TASP inhibitors block both HIV envelope-mediated virus to cell and cell to cell membrane fusion processes and the initiation of apoptosis (7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it can be suggested that p95 is implicated as a potential cofactor of CD4 in the functioning of the gp120·gp41 complex to initiate membrane fusion and thus viral entry. Consistent with this, 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP blocks the binding of HIV particles to CD4+ permissive cells at the same efficiency as an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody. CEM cells (clone 13) derived from human lymphoid cell line CEM and MOLT4-T4 clone 8 cells selected for high level of CD4 expression (both cell lines were provided by L. Montagnier, Institut Pasteur, France) were cultured in suspension RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium). Human HeLa cells were grown in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's medium. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a healthy donor were stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) T cell growth factor (Biotest) (7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All cells were cultured with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated (56°C for 30 min) fetal calf serum. Infection of CEM cells with the HIV-1 Lai isolate was carried out as described previously (7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the assay of the inhibitory effect of the TASP constructs, CEM cells were first incubated (15 min, at room temperature) in the presence of different concentrations of each construct before infection using one synchronous dose of HIV-1 Lai as described before (8Laurent-Crawford A.G. Hovanessian A.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HIV production was estimated at 4 days post-infection (p.i.) by monitoring the HIV-1 major core protein p24 in the culture supernatant (7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The concentration of p24 was measured by p24 Core Profile ELISA (Du Pont). Buffer E contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, aprotinin (1000 units/ml), and 0.5% Triton X-100. Tris-buffered saline contained 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 137 mM NaCl, and 3 mM KCl. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer contained 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Two-fold concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer contained 125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 M urea, 1% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 150 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol (v/v). Buffer GF contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were first washed extensively in PBS before lysis in buffer E (100 μl/3 × 107 cells), and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 5 min). The nuclei-free supernatant was then further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was stored at −80°C. Routinely, cell extracts were prepared 24 h after cell passage. CEM cells (108 cells) were washed with PBS (2 × 25 ml), and the pellet was suspended in 20 ml of PBS containing 10 mMD-glucose and 2 mCi of 125I (100 μCi/ml; Amersham), 2 units of lactoperoxidase, and 2 units of glucose oxidase (Calbiochem-Behring). After 10 min of incubation at 22°C, cells were washed in PBS, and extracts were prepared as above. Synthesis of the different TASP constructs and the measurement of their inhibitory activity on HIV infection were as described previously (7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The following TASP constructs were included in this report: 1) control peptides which manifest no or little activity against HIV infection, such as 5[QPQ]-, 5[KGQ]-, and 5[KER]-TASP; and 2) peptides which are potent inhibitors of HIV entry and infection, such as 5[KPR]- and 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP. For the preparation of the biotin-labeled constructs, biotin was incorporated at the beginning of the synthesis by coupling the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-Lys(Biotin)-OH derivative (Neosystem, Strasbourg, France) on the resin prior to the assembly of the template. Thus the biotinylated TASP constructs were labeled at the COOH terminus of their templates. Crude cell extracts were diluted in 2-fold concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in SDS to be electrophoretically transferred to 0.22 μm polyvinylidene difluoride sheets (Bio-Rad). The electophoretic blots were saturated with casein-based blocking buffer (GENOSYS) overnight at 4°C. In order to further saturate nonspecific binding sites, the blots were first incubated at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 5 μM 5[KER]-TASP. After 2 h, the biotin-labeled 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP (5 μM) was added to this solution, and the blots were incubated for another 2 h at 4°C. The sheets were subsequently washed 3 times (10 min each) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, followed by 2 washes (10 min each) in Tris-buffered saline before revealing biotin by using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex and light-based enhanced chemiluminescence reagents as provided by the manufacturer (Amersham). The enhanced light signal produced was then captured on the autoradiography film (Hyperfilm™-MP from Amersham Corp.). Twenty-four hours after passaging, CEM cells were washed extensively with PBS before incubation (50 × 106 cells/300 μl of FACS buffer) at 4°C for 30 min with different concentrations of the biotin-labeled TASP molecule. Cells were then washed in FACS buffer (2 × 15 ml), and nuclear-free cell extracts were prepared using buffer E (150 μl). Such extracts were first diluted in PBS (600 μl) before the addition of 100 μl of avidin-agarose (ImmunoPure immobilized avidin from Pierce) to capture the biotin-labeled TASP complexed to its cell surface ligand. These suspensions were incubated at 4°C for 2 h, and the avidin-agarose bound proteins were washed batchwise with PBS (5 × 5 ml). Finally, the avidin-agarose pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 2-fold concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer and heated at 95°C for 5 min. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the TASP ligand was revealed by ligand blotting. 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Sigma) by incubating stoichiometric concentrations (2.5 mM) of each product in 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.5, at 20°C for 2 h (in the dark). This solution (400 μl) was then transferred to a Microcon Model 3 filter sieve (Amicon, Inc., MA) with a molecular mass cut-off of 3,000 Da and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min to filter unbound FITC. The concentrated material was diluted 20-fold in distilled water and purified again using the Microcon filter. Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled mAb Ta1 (IgG1; from Coulter, Miami, FL) was used to detect CD26 (9Blanco J. Marié I. Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Krust B. Hovanessian A.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two different FITC-labeled mAbs specific to the CD4 receptor were used, mAbs OKT4 and OKT4A (both IgG1; Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Raritan, NJ). In all experiments, PE-labeled mAb B4 (IgG1), specific for CD19 (Coulter), was used as a control for PE-labeled mAb Ta1, and FITC-labeled mouse isotype control antibody MCG1 (IgG1; Immuno Quality Products) was used as a control for FITC-labeled mAbs OKT4 and OKT4A. Cells were incubated with FITC- or PE-labeled mAbs in the FACS buffer at 4°C for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and fixed in 1% formaldehyde in PBS and applied to an FACS scan flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). For each sample, 10,000 cells were analyzed with Lysis II Software (Becton Dickinson). In order to assay for the binding of FITC- or biotin-labeled TASP inhibitors to a cell surface antigen, different cells were washed in PBS, suspended in FACS buffer (5 × 105 cells/100 μl) containing 0.5 μM FITC-labeled or different concentrations of the biotin-labeled TASP constructs, and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer and fixed in 1% formaldehyde in FACS buffer. The FITC-labeled TASP constructs were analyzed as above, whereas the biotin-labeled TASP constructs were revealed by using streptavidin·FITC complex (Amersham). The fluorescence intensity was monitored by FACS analysis using Lysis II Software (see Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Tables 1 and 2) or Cell Quest™ Software (Becton Dickinson and Macintosh Computer) (see Fig. 5).Fig. 4The high affinity of 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP to bind its cell surface ligand. CEM cells were analyzed by FACS analysis using biotin-labeled 5[KPR]-TASP (at 1, 5, and 10 μM), 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP (at 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 5 μM), and control 5[QPQ]- and 5[KGQ]-TASP (at 20 μM) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The peak C gives the fluorescence of cells incubated with the unlabeled respective TASP constructs (20 μM). The ordinates give the relative cell number, whereas the abscissa give the relative fluorescence intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5The specific binding of 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP to a 95-kDa protein. Crude CEM cell extracts (material corresponding to 106 cells) were analyzed by ligand blotting using biotin-labeled 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP (“Materials and Methods”). To show the specificity of binding, the electrophoretic blots, after saturation with the blocking buffer, were first incubated (4°C, 30 min) with 50 μM unlabeled 5[KGQ]-TASP (A) or 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP (B) before the addition of biotin-labeled 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP (5 μM). The numbers in the middle (200, 97, 68, and 43) show the position of molecular mass (in kDa) protein markers. Note that ligand binding studies shown here and in Fig. 6, Fig. 7 were performed on reducing gels. It should also be noted, however, that similar results were obtained on nonreducing gels, i.e. in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Protease treatment of CEM and MOLT cells was essentially as described previously (10Borrow P. Oldstone M.B.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7270-7281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were washed in PBS and in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mM EDTA before treatment with trypsin (Sigma; 2.5 mg/ml at 20°C for 5 min), proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany; 0.2 mg/ml at 37°C for 30 min), or Pronase E (Sigma, 0.1 mg/ml at 37°C for 45 min). The reactions were stopped by 10-fold dilutions in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were then washed in PBS and FACS buffer and processed for FACS analysis. A Superose 6 column (1.6 × 50 cm) from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. was equilibrated in buffer GF as described before (11Jacotot E. Callebaut C. Blanco J. Krust B. Neubert K. Barth A. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The bed volume was 100 ml. The column was calibrated using extracts (prepared in Buffer E) supplemented with the molecular mass markers catalase, 202 kDa, and bovine serum albumin, 68 kDa. Elution was performed in buffer GF by collecting 1 ml fractions/2 min, with the void volume (V0) and total column elution volume (Vc) at 36 and 114 ml, respectively. Aliquots from each fraction were analyzed by ligand blotting using biotin-labeled 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP. Aliquots were also assayed for dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) activity of CD26 and DPP IV-β by the cleavage of Gly-Pro-para-nitroanilide as described previously (11Jacotot E. Callebaut C. Blanco J. Krust B. Neubert K. Barth A. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, CD26 and DPP IV-β eluted as monomers of 110 and 82 kDa, respectively, and these were used as convenient markers to monitor the elution profile of the TASP ligand p95. CEM cells (300 × 106) were washed in PBS before homogenization to prepare plasma membranes, as described before (11Jacotot E. Callebaut C. Blanco J. Krust B. Neubert K. Barth A. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The presence of TASP ligand p95 was revealed by ligand blotting using aliquots corresponding to material from 108 cells. Recombinant gp120 (Neosystem) was radioiodinated with the Bolton-Hunter reagent (DuPont NEN) according to the technique described by the manufacturer. To study the binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor, CEM cells (5 × 106), which express high levels of CD4, were incubated in the culture medium with 125I-labeled gp120 (50 ng, 10 Ci/mg) at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice in PBS (5 ml), and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by disruption of cell pellets in buffer E (125 μl). Aliquots (25 μl, corresponding to material from 106 cells) were diluted in two-fold concentrated electrophoresis buffer and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The binding of 125I-labeled gp120 to the CD4 receptor was then revealed by autoradiography (12Krust B. Callebaut C. Hovanessian A.G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 11: 1087-1090Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 125I-labeled gp120 band was also quantitated in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). CEM cells (5 × 106) in culture medium (1 ml) were preincubated (at 37°C for 15 min) in the absence or presence of 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP or mAb against CD4 before addition of HIV-1 Lai (corresponding to 25 ng of p24). After incubation at 37°C for 1 h with gentle shaking, cells were diluted 10-fold in the culture medium and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells at 4°C were washed once in RPMI 1640 medium (5 ml) containing 1 mM EDTA and then washed twice in RPMI 1640 medum (2 × 5 ml). Cell extracts were prepared in buffer E (50 μl), the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was assayed for the concentration of p24. It should be noted that under these experimental conditions, the values for the bound virus represent particles bound on the cell surface as well as particles (or cores) entered into cells. We have recently reported that 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP and related TASP-inhibitors block HIV entry and thus infection (7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Such inhibition of viral entry could be demonstrated by different experimental approaches. For example, HIV entry monitored by the intracellular concentration of p24 (HIV-1 major core protein), following 1 h incubation of CEM cells with the virus, is inhibited almost completely in the pesence of 5-10 μM 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP. Similarly, viral entry monitored by the β-galactosidase activity in HeLa/CD4+ cells expressing the bacterial lacZ gene placed under the control of the HIV-1 LTR is inhibited by at least 90% at similar concentrations of 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP (data not shown; as described in 7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Otherwise, addition of 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP after the viral entry process does not affect virus infection, monitored by the production of virus at 4 days post-infection (as shown in Fig. 2 in 7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, we further investigated the timing of the inhibitory effect of 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP during the HIV entry process. Addition of 5 μM 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP to cells 1 h before or together with the virus resulted in more than 90% inhibition of virus production. On the other hand, addition of 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP at 2, and 4 h post-infection reduced its inhibitory effect, and when added at 8 h, there was almost no effect (data not shown; 7Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The period of 8 h is necessary for HIV-1 entry in at least 90% of target cells in the CEM cell culture (8Laurent-Crawford A.G. Hovanessian A.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The effect of 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP on the viral entry process is most probably the consequence of the inhibition of the membrane fusion process. In accord with this, we have previously provided evidence to demonstrate that 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP efficiently blocks the gp120·gp41-mediated membrane fusion observed in cocultures of chronically HIV-1-infected cells with uninfected CD4+ cells (see Fig. 6 in 7Callebaut C.

Lanes 2 to 5, CEM cells were washed and incubated at 4°C for 30 min in FACS buffer (which contained sodium azide) with biotin-labeled control 5[KGQ]- or 5[QPQ]-TASP and anti-HIV 5[KPR]- or 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP constructs. Cells were then washed extensively before preparation of cell extracts. The complexes formed between the biotin-labeled TASP constructs and any cell surface protein were then recovered by purification using avidin-agarose (“Materials and Methods”). The presence of p95 in the purified preparations was then revealed by ligand blotting using biotin-labeled 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP. Lanes 6 to 8, to show the specificity of complex formation between cell surface p95 and biotin-labeled 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP, cells were first incubated (22°C, 10 min) with excess 50 μM unlabeled 5[KPR]-, 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-, and 5[QPQ]-TASP before addition of 5 μM biotin-labeled 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP and recovery of the complex using avidin-agarose (as above). Lane 1, Extract represents the ligand blot analysis of crude CEM cell extracts, material corresponding to 106 cells. In all the other lanes representing the recovery of p95 from the cell surface, the material analyzed corresponded to that from 5 × 106 cells.

In the first set of experiments, cells were incubated with different concentrations of 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP before further incubation with 125I-labeled gp120. Under these experimental conditions, the binding of 125I-labeled gp120 was specific since it was inhibited by anti-CD4 mAb OKT4A, which is known to block the binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor (12Krust B. Callebaut C. Hovanessian A.G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 11: 1087-1090Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Mizukami T. Fuerst T.R. Berger E.A. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The binding of gp120 was not affected at 20 μM 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP, whereas there was a slight inhibition of binding at higher concentrations (Fig. 1A). To investigate the binding of virus to cells, CEM cells were incubated with HIV-1 particles for 1 h. Cells were then washed extensively, and the bound virus (including that which was entered into cells) was estimated by the concentration of p24 in cell lysates. As in the binding of gp120, the binding of virus was specific since it was inhibited (75%) by mAb OKT4A. Interestingly, at 10 μM 5[KΨ(CH2N)PR]-TASP, the binding of HIV particles was also inhib"
https://openalex.org/W1983095882,"A myofibrillar form of smooth muscle myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCPase) was purified from turkey gizzard myofibrils, and it was found to be closely associated with the myosin light chain kinase (MLCKase). For this reason we have named this phosphatase the kinase- and myosin-associated protein phosphatase (KAMPPase). Subunits of the KAMPPase could be identified during the first ion exchange chromatography step. After further purification on calmodulin (CaM) and on thiophosphorylated regulatory myosin light chain affinity columns we obtained either a homogenous preparation of a 37-kDa catalytic (PC) subunit or a mixture of the PC subunit and variable amounts of a 67-kDa targeting (PT) subunit. The PT subunit bound the PC subunit to CaM affinity columns in a Ca2+-independent manner; thus, elution of the subunits required only high salt concentration. Specificity of interaction between these subunits was shown by the following observations: 1) activity of isolated PC subunit, but not of the PTC holoenzyme, was stimulated 10-20-fold after preincubation with 5-50 μM of CoCl2; 2) the pH activity profile of the PC subunit was modified by the PT subunit (the specific activity of the PTC holoenzyme was higher at neutral pH and lower at alkaline pH); and 3) affinity of the holoenzyme for unphosphorylated myosin was 3-fold higher, and for phosphorylated myosin it was 2-fold lower, in comparison with that of the purified PC subunit. KAMPPase was inhibited by okadaic acid (Ki = 250 nM), microcystin-LR (50 nM) and calyculin A (1.5 μM) but not by arachidonic acid or the heat-stable inhibitor (I-2), which suggested that this is a type PP1 or PP2A protein phosphatase.

https://openalex.org/W2032891125,"The degree of hydrophobic exposure in the molecular chaperone GroEL during its cycle of ATP hydrolysis was analyzed using 1,1′-bis(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′disulfonic acid (bisANS), a hydrophobic probe, whose fluorescence is highly sensitive to the environment. In the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM KCl the addition of ATP, but not ADP or AMP-PNP, resulted in a time-dependent, linear increase in the bisANS fluorescence. The rate of the increase in the bisANS fluorescence depended on the concentrations of both GroEL and the probe. The effect could be substantially inhibited by addition of excess ADP or by converting ATP to ADP using hexokinase, showing that the increase in the bisANS fluorescence was correlated with ATP hydrolysis. The rate of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by GroEL was uncompetitively inhibited in the presence of bisANS. This uncompetitive inhibition suggests that the probe can interact with the GroEL-ATP complex. The inability of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, to cause a similar effect is explained by the interaction of bisANS with a transient conformational state of GroEL formed consequent to ATP hydrolysis. It is suggested that this short lived hydrophobic exposure reflects a conformational shift in GroEL that results from electrostatic repulsion between the bound products of ATP hydrolysis, and it plays an important role in the mechanism of the chaperonin cycle.

https://openalex.org/W1991507931,"Abstract Deoxyadenosine kinase (dAK) forms a heterodimer with either deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) or deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and is heterotropically activated 3-5 times by dGuo or dCyd. Expressed alone, dAK is inactive and exhibits no response to dGuo or dCyd; activity and heterotropic response are fully restored upon reassociation with dGK or dCK. However, turnover of independently expressed dGK or dCK is nearly maximal, being further activated only 50-100% upon reassociation with dAK. In neither case is the heterotropic activation due to ligand-induced heterodimer formation. A proline/alanine substitution within a dAK segment homologous to loop G2 of Ras proteins yielded a heterodimer with dAK permanently cis-activated 2-fold, with a corresponding reduction in heterotropic activation by dGuo. A chimeric dAK, with 25% of its C terminus substituted by the homologous sequence from dGK, was inactive alone, and its characteristics were unchanged in the reconstituted heterodimer. Superimposing the Pro/Ala substitution on this chimera also reduced heterotropic activation by half. Cross-linking the dimer by 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was inhibited by ATP, dATP, dGTP, and dAdo, suggesting the proximity of the active site(s) to the interface. These data suggest that dAK depends on dGK or dCK in a manner resembling the reliance of Ras upon GTPase activating protein."
