https://openalex.org/W1560452019,"Carbohydrate binding properties of a new plant lectin (GNA) isolated from snowdrop bulbs were studied using the technique of quantitative precipitation, hapten inhibition, and affinity chromatography on immobilized lectin. Purified GNA precipitated highly branched yeast mannans but did not react with most glucans. Hapten inhibition experiments showed that D-mannose is an inhibitor of GNA-mannan interaction but neither N-acetyl-D-mannosamine nor D-glucose is an inhibitor. Hapten inhibition with various sugars showed that GNA requires the presence of equatorial hydroxyl groups at the C-3 and C-4 positions and an axial group at the C-2 position of the D-pyranose ring. A nonreducing terminal D-mannose residue is necessary for the interaction of oligosaccharides, and oligosaccharides with terminal Man(alpha-1-3)Man units showed the highest inhibitory potency (10-30 times greater than D-mannose) among the manno-oligosaccharides tested. The presence of the hydrophobic p-nitrophenyl aglycone increased the affinity of D-mannose only slightly. Immobilized GNA bound yeast mannan but did not bind glycogen. The behavior of glycoproteins with high mannose type glycan chains depended on the density and the structure of their glycan chains. Glycopeptides which carry Man(alpha 1-3)Man units were retarded on the immobilized GNA column whereas those lacking this unit or with hybrid type glycan chains were not retarded on the column."

However, the early biochemical events remain to be elucidated. In the present studies, we have used phosphorus (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine in vivo, the temporal changes in brain intracellular free Mg2+ concentration following fluid percussion head injury in rats. We report that injury caused a profound and rapid decrease in intracellular free Mg2+ which was significantly correlated with the severity of injury. At high levels of injury, the decrease in intracellular free Mg2+ concentration was associated with a decrease in total Mg2+ concentration as determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Prophylactic treatment with MgSO4 prevented the post-traumatic decrease in intracellular free Mg2+ and resulted in a significant improvement in acute neurological outcome. Because magnesium is essential for a number of critical enzyme reactions, including those of glycolysis, oxidative and substrate level phosphorylation, protein synthesis, and phospholipid synthesis, changes in free Mg2+ after brain trauma may represent a critical early factor leading to irreversible tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W1608564947,"When UV-irradiated cultured diploid human fibroblasts were permeabilized with Brij-58 then separated from soluble material by centrifugation, conservative DNA repair synthesis could be restored by a soluble factor obtained from the supernatant of similarly treated HeLa cells. Extensive purification of this factor yielded a 10.2 S, 220,000-dalton polypeptide with the DNA polymerase and 3'- to 5'-exonuclease activities reported for DNA polymerase delta II (Crute, J. J., Wahl, A. F., and Bambara, R. A. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 26-36). Monoclonal antibody to KB cell DNA polymerase alpha, while binding to HeLa DNA polymerase alpha, did not bind to the HeLa DNA polymerase delta. Moreover, at micromolar concentrations N2-(p-n-butylphenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate (BuPdGTP) and 2-(p-n-butylanilino)-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate (BuAdATP) were potent inhibitors of DNA polymerase alpha, but did not inhibit the DNA polymerase delta. Neither purified DNA polymerase alpha nor beta could promote repair DNA synthesis in the permeabilized cells. Furthermore, under conditions which inhibited purified DNA polymerase alpha by greater than 90%, neither monoclonal antibodies to DNA polymerase alpha, BuPdGTP, nor BuAdATP was able to inhibit significantly the DNA repair synthesis mediated by the DNA polymerase delta. Thus, it appears that a major portion of DNA repair synthesis induced by UV irradiation might be catalyzed by DNA polymerase delta. When xeroderma pigmentosum human diploid fibroblasts were utilized, DNA repair synthesis dependent upon ultraviolet light could be restored by addition of both T4 endonuclease V and DNA polymerase delta, but not by addition of either one alone. This result suggests that cytosol-depleted permeabilized DNA repair-defective human fibroblasts and HeLa DNA polymerase delta might be exploited to provide a functional assay for purifying active DNA repair factors from DNA repair-proficient cells without a preknowledge of their function."
https://openalex.org/W1519370193,"This work was initiated to determine if a specific region of the glucocorticoid receptor determines the formation of the inactive (i.e. non-DNA-binding) 9 S form of the receptor recovered in cytosol preparations. It is known that the murine glucocorticoid receptor of the nti phenotype, which consists of only the carboxyl-terminal 40-kDa peptide containing the DNA-binding and steroid-binding domains separated by a short linker region, is recovered in hypotonic lysates as a 9 S heteromeric complex (Gehring, U., and Arndt, H. (1985) FEBS Lett. 179, 138-142). To further localize the domain required for formation of the 9 S complex, we have determined the sedimentation coefficients of receptors produced in COS-7 cells transfected with several mutants of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene. Deletion of the DNA-binding domain results in a 9 S complex that is somewhat less stable than the wild type receptor during sucrose gradient centrifugation. Deletion of the linker region yields a molybdate-stabilized 9 S complex, but deletion of the entire steroid-binding domain or internal deletion of the amino-terminal two-thirds of this domain yields receptors that are constitutive transcriptional activators and are present in cytosol only in the 4 S form. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the steroid-binding domain contains the features required for formation of the 9 S heteromeric complex, and they are consistent with the proposal that the steroid-binding domain normally represses receptor function."

https://openalex.org/W1487499673,"Isolated cytoplasmic actin of human platelet and pig liver actin, but not rabbit skeletal muscle actin, was ADP-ribosylated by botulinum C2 toxin in the presence of [32P]NAD. Tryptic digestion of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated platelet actin generated two labeled peptides: a soluble peptide covering residues 174-183 and an insoluble fragment containing residues 148-183. Further digestion of these two peptides with thermolysin yielded the same radioactive peptide, which was in both cases peptide 175-177. Amino acid sequence analysis of peptides 174-183 and 175-177 located the ADP-ribosylation on Arg177."
https://openalex.org/W1537045952,"Peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 1-12 of the amino terminal and 480-492 of the carboxyl terminal of the deduced sequence of the glucose transporter were synthesized and used to produce site-specific polyclonal antipeptide sera. In a solid-phase radioimmunoassay, antiserum to the carboxyl terminal recognizes peptide 480-492 and purified human erythrocyte glucose transporter, but not peptide 1-12. Antiserum to the amino terminal recognizes peptide 1-12 but neither peptide 480-492 nor the erythrocyte transporter. The antiserum to the carboxyl terminal specifically immunoblots the Mr 55,000 glucose transporter in erythrocyte membranes and the purified erythrocyte transporter. It also recognizes a Mr 40,000-60,000 polypeptide in membranes of cells derived from different mammalian species and tissues including insulin-sensitive rat adipocytes as well as a Mr 20,000 tryptic fragment of the transporter which contains the site for photolabeling by cytochalasin B. Antiserum to the carboxyl terminal of the transporter binds specifically to leaky erythrocyte membranes but not to intact erythrocytes. This binding is saturable and competitively inhibited by peptide 480-492. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, this antiserum detects glucose transporter protein in permeabilized erythrocytes, but not in intact erythrocytes. These studies provide immunochemical evidence in support of the predicted cytoplasmic orientation of the carboxyl terminus of the glucose transporter, allow us to suggest a spatial relationship of the cytochalasin B binding site to the carboxyl terminal of the glucose transporter and suggest that antisera directed to the carboxyl terminal domain of the protein may be useful for the immunocytochemical localization of the glucose transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1599563939,"Our previous work (Carlier, M.-F., and Pantaloni, D. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 7789-7792) had shown that F-ADP-Pi-actin is a major intermediate in ATP-actin polymerization, due to the slow rate of Pi release following ATP cleavage on filaments. To understand the mechanism of ATP-actin polymerization, we have prepared F-ADP-Pi-actin and characterized its kinetic parameters. 32Pi binds to F-ADP-actin with a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol of F-actin subunit and an equilibrium dissociation constant Kpi of 1.5 mM at pH 7.0 Kpi increases with pH, indicating that the H2PO-4 species binds to F-actin. ADP-Pi-actin subunits dissociate much more slowly from filament ends than ADP-actin subunits; therefore, the stability of filaments in ATP is due to terminal ADP-Pi subunits. The slow rate of dissociation of ADP-Pi-actin also explains the decrease in critical concentration of ADP-actin in the presence of Pi reported by Rickard and Sheterline (Richard, J. E., and Sheterline, P. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 191, 273-280). The effect of Pi on the rate of actin dissociation from filaments is much more pronounced at the barbed end than at the pointed end. Using gelsolin to block the barbed end, we have shown that the two ends are energetically different in the presence of ATP and saturating Pi, but less different than in the absence of Pi. The results are interpreted within a new model for actin polymerization. It is possible that phosphate binding to F-actin can regulate motile events in muscle and nonmuscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1580909044,"In hyaline membrane disease of premature infants, lack of surfactant leads to pulmonary atelectasis and respiratory distress. Hydrophobic surfactant proteins of Mr = 5,000-14,000 have been isolated from mammalian surfactants which enhance the rate of spreading and the surface tension lowering properties of phospholipids during dynamic compression. We have characterized the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of pulmonary proteolipids from ether/ethanol extracts of bovine, canine, and human surfactant. Two distinct peptides were identified and termed SPL(pVal) and SPL(Phe). An oligonucleotide probe based on the valine-rich amino-terminal amino acid sequence of SPL(pVal) was utilized to isolate cDNA and genomic DNA encoding the human protein, termed surfactant proteolipid SPL(pVal) on the basis of its unique polyvaline domain. The primary structure of a precursor protein of 20,870 daltons, containing the SPL(pVal) peptide, was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNAs. Hybrid-arrested translation and immunoprecipitation of labeled translation products of human mRNA demonstrated an Mr = 22,000 precursor protein, the active hydrophobic peptide being produced by proteolytic processing to Mr = 5,000-6,000. Two classes of cDNAs encoding SPL(pVal) were identified. mRNA of approximately 900 bases was identified on Northern analysis of fetal and adult RNA. Human SPL(pVal) mRNA was more abundant in the adult than in fetal lung. The SPL(pVal) gene locus was assigned to chromosome 8."
https://openalex.org/W1544614531,"At alkaline pH, Ca2+ is no longer required for S-100 proteins to inhibit the assembly and to promote the disassembly of brain microtubules in vitro, though the presence of Ca2+ significantly favors the S-100 effects. These effects are inversely related to the microtubule protein concentration and directly related to the S-100 concentration and the pH. Ca2+-independent, pH-regulated inhibition of assembly of phosphocellulose-purified tubulin by S-100 is also described. The microtubule disassembling effect of S-100 is additive to that of alkali (used to raise the pH), and S-100 further disassembles microtubules after alkalinization. Thus the larger inhibitory effect of S-100 on microtubule assembly at alkaline versus acid pH depends on both a decrease in the assembly rate and an increase in the disassembly rate. Together with previous data on this topic, the present findings indicate that S-100 proteins act on microtubule protein in vitro primarily by binding to tubulin, this event being Ca2+-regulated at a given pH, and pH-regulated at a given free Ca2+ concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1582816865,"A protocol has been developed for isolating cholesterol ester-deficient cells from the Chinese hamster ovary cell clone 25-RA. This cell line previously was shown to be partially resistant to suppression of cholesterogenic enzyme activities by 25-hydroxycholesterol and to accumulate a large amount of intracellular cholesterol ester when grown in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Chang, T. Y., and Limanek, J. S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7787-7795). The higher cholesterol ester content of 25-RA is due to an increase in the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis and low density lipoprotein receptor activity compared to wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells, and not due to an abnormal acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase enzyme. The procedure to isolate cholesterol ester-deficient mutants utilizes amphotericin B, a polyene antibiotic known to bind to cholesterol and to form pore complexes in membranes. After incubation in cholesterol-free medium plus an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, 25-RA cells were found to be 50-500 times more sensitive to amphotericin B killing than were mutant cells containing reduced amounts of cholesterol ester. Twelve amphotericin B-resistant mutants were isolated which retained the 25-hydroxycholesterol-resistant phenotype. These mutants did not exhibit the perinuclear lipid droplets characteristic of 25-RA cells, and lipid analysis revealed a large (up to 40-fold) reduction in cellular cholesterol ester. The acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activities of these cholesterol ester-deficient mutants were markedly lower than 25-RA when assayed in intact cells or in an in vitro reconstitution assay. The tightest mutant characterized, AC29, was found to have less than 1% of the parental acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity. These mutants all have reduced rates of sterol synthesis and lower low density lipoprotein receptor activity compared to 25-RA, probably as a consequence of their reduced enzyme activities. Cell fusion experiments revealed that the phenotypes of all the mutants examined are not dominant and that the mutants all belong to the same complementation group. We conclude that these mutants contain a lesion in the gene encoding acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase or in a gene encoding a factor needed for enzyme production."
https://openalex.org/W1534588340,"beta-Adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (ISO), is a potent relaxant of tracheal smooth muscle and inhibits carbachol-induced contraction. The effect of ISO on intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was examined in bovine tracheal smooth muscle strips, employing aequorin as Ca2+ indicator. Surprisingly, 10 microM ISO induces a 5-fold increase in [Ca2+]i which then gradually declines but still remains higher than basal after 1 h of stimulation. The ISO-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is dose-dependent, and the ED50 is approximately 50 nM. The ISO-induced increase in [Ca2+]i is inhibited by a beta-receptor blocker, propranolol, not by an alpha-blocker, phentolamine. The ISO-induced rise in [Ca2+]i is dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, and vasoactive intestinal peptide, which is known to stimulate adenylate cyclase via a specific receptor in this tissue, have similar effects on [Ca2+]i, suggesting that a rise in cyclic AMP concentration mediates this effect of ISO on [Ca2+]i. Pretreatment of muscle with 10 microM ISO inhibits both the initial Ca2+ transient and the contractile response induced by 0.3 microM carbachol. Conversely, in carbachol-pretreated muscle strips, addition of ISO causes a fall rather than a rise in [Ca2+]i, and an inhibition of contraction. These results indicate that ISO has effects on cellular Ca2+ metabolism at more than a single site in bovine tracheal smooth muscle, that these effects are different in control and carbachol-pretreated muscle, and that the relaxing effect of ISO is not due solely to its effect on Ca2+ metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1480164066,"The mammalian cytosolic thymidine kinase is one of a number of enzymes involved in DNA replication whose activities increase dramatically during S phase of the cell cycle. As a first step in defining the mechanisms that control the S phase induction of thymidine kinase activity, we have purified the human enzyme from HeLa cells and raised a specific immune serum against the purified protein. The enzyme was isolated from cells arrested in S phase by treatment with methotrexate and purified to near homogeneity by ion-exchange and affinity chromatography. Stabilization of the purified enzyme was achieved by the addition of digitonin. An electrophoretic Rm of 0.2 in nondenaturing gels characterizes the purified enzyme activity as cytosolic thymidine kinase. The enzyme has a Stoke's radius of 40 A determined by gel filtration and a sedimentation coefficient of 5.5 S determined by glycerol gradient sedimentation. Based on these hydrodynamic values, a native molecular weight of 96,000 was calculated for the purified enzyme. When electrophoresed in denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, the most purified enzyme fraction was found to contain one predominant polypeptide of Mr = 24,000. Several lines of evidence indicate that this polypeptide is responsible for thymidine kinase enzymatic activity. 1) The Mr = 24,000 polypeptide co-migrates with thymidine kinase activity in electrophoretic and sedimentation analyses. 2) A subunit Mr = 25,504 is predicted by the nucleotide sequence of a recently isolated cDNA clone that encodes HeLa thymidine kinase. 3) Mouse LTK- cells transformed with this clone express a cytosolic thymidine kinase activity, as well as a novel Mr = 24,000 polypeptide detectable with immune serum raised against the purified human enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1596987236,"In vivo administration of the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor pyrazole induces a cytochrome P-450 isozyme. The pyrazole-inducible cytochrome P-450 has been purified from rat livers to electrophoretic homogeneity and its biochemical, spectral, and immunological properties characterized. The final preparation had a specific content of 11 nmol of cytochrome P-450/mg of protein. A single band with an apparent molecular weight of 52,000 was observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The absolute spectrum of the isolated pyrazole cytochrome P-450 displayed peaks at 648 and 396 nm, suggestive of a high spin cytochrome. The ethylisocyanide difference spectrum exhibited two maxima, one at 457 nm, the other at 428 nm. Pyrazole and dimethyl sulfoxide produced binding spectra with the purified P-450, with peaks at 425 or 419 nm and troughs at 390 or 386 nm, respectively. K8 values for dimethyl sulfoxide and pyrazole were 21 and 0.04 mM, respectively. The catalytic activity of the pyrazole cytochrome P-450 was elevated with aniline and dimethylnitrosamine (low Km) but not with aminopyrine, benzphetamine, ethoxycoumarin, or ethoxyresorufin as substrates. An antibody against pyrazole cytochrome P-450 recognized a 52,000 molecular weight protein upon reaction with saline microsomes. The intensity of the immunoblot was increased when microsomes isolated from pyrazole, 4-methylpyrazole-, acetone-, or chronic ethanol-treated rats were utilized, but not after phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene treatment. Homology at the amino terminus of 19 amino acids was observed between pyrazole P-450 and the isoniazid-inducible P-450j. Based upon the above catalytic, spectral, and immunological properties, it appears that pyrazole induces a form of cytochrome P-450 which is identical to that induced by ethanol and isoniazid."
https://openalex.org/W1480908057,"Type IX collagen from chick embryonic cartilage is unique among the collagens in that it contains chondroitin sulfate covalently linked to the alpha 2(IX) polypeptide chain. We have isolated and sequenced the glycosaminoglycan-containing peptide released by collagenase digestion from type IX collagen, labeled biosynthetically with [35SO4] and 3H-aminoacids. This peptide was purified by gel filtration and, following chondroitinase ABC digestion, by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence obtained for this peptide has 23 residues, beginning and ending with a collagenous sequence, indicating that it spans an internal noncollagenous domain. Comparison of this sequence with the one predicted from cDNA clone pYN 1738 for the alpha 1(IX)chain and pYN 1731 and pDM 222 for the alpha 2(IX)chain revealed the peptide to be the noncollagenous NC3 domain of alpha 2(IX). The glycosylated sequence Val-Glu-Gly-Ser*-Ala-Asp- of type IX collagen does not have the Ser-Gly normally functioning as the attachment sequence but does have an acidic residue preceding the serine which should improve the acceptability of this sequence for the xylosyltransferase. That it is an adequate acceptor can be inferred from the observation that type IX collagen carries a glycosaminoglycan chain on over 70% of the molecules isolated."
https://openalex.org/W1605154757,"Most mammalian cells receive exogenous folate from the bloodstream in the form of 5-methyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate (CH3-H4PteGlu1). Because this folate derivative is a very poor substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase, the enzyme that adds glutamyl residues to intracellular folates, CH3-H4PteGlu1 must first be converted to tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate (H4PteGlu1), 10-formyltetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate (CHO-H4PteGlu1), or dihydrofolate (H2folate), which are excellent substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetase. Polyglutamylation is required both for retention of intracellular folates and for efficacy of folates as substrates for most folate-dependent enzymes. Two enzymes are known that will react with CH3-H4PteGlu1 in vitro, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase). These studies were performed to assess the possibility that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase might catalyze the conversion of CH3-H4PteGlu1 to CH2-H4PteGlu1. CH2-H4PteGlu1 is readily converted to CHO-H4PteGlu1 by the action of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, and these enzyme activities show very little preference for folypolyglutamate substrates as compared with folylmonoglutamates. We conclude from in vitro studies of the enzyme that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase cannot convert CH3-H4PteGlu1 to CH2-H4PteGlu1 under physiological conditions and that uptake and retention of folate will be dependent on methionine synthase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1591359061,"Several hemolymph proteins ranging in size from 73 to 76 kDa increase to very high levels just prior to metamorphosis in Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera). One of these proteins (pI = 5.8, Mr = 76,000) was selected for a study of hormonal regulation. The appearance of this protein could be suppressed in vivo by topical treatment with the juvenile hormone analog fenoxycarb. An antiserum for this protein was prepared and shown to react selectively with the 76-kDa protein in whole hemolymph. Translation of poly(A)-containing RNA from untreated larvae yielded the 76-kDa protein, whose identity was verified with the antibody, whereas mRNA from juvenile hormone analog-treated larvae did not. These data indicate that juvenile hormone acts to regulate the level of the mRNA of this hemolymph protein."
https://openalex.org/W1527930900,"We have characterized the interaction of bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) with the filamentous (F-)actin of red cell membrane skeletons stabilized with phalloidin. The hydrolysis of [3H]DNA was used to assay DNase I. We found that DNase I bound to a homogenous class of approximately equal to 2.4 X 10(4) sites/skeleton with an association rate constant of approximately 1 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 and a KD of 1.9 X 10(-9) M at 20 degrees C. Phalloidin lowered the dissociation constant by approximately 1 order of magnitude. The DNase I which sedimented with the skeletons was catalytically inactive but could be reactivated by dissociation from the actin. Actin and DNA bound to DNase I in a mutually exclusive fashion without formation of a ternary complex. Phalloidin-treated red cell F-actin resembled rabbit muscle G-actin in all respects tested. Since the DNase I binding capacity of the skeletons corresponded to the number of actin protofilaments previously estimated by other methods, it seemed likely that the enzyme binding site was confined to one end of the filament. We confirmed this premise by showing that elongating the red cell filaments with rabbit muscle actin monomers did not appreciably add to their capacity to bind or inhibit DNase I. Saturation of skeletons with cytochalasin D or gelsolin, avid ligands for the barbed end of actin filaments, did not reduce their binding of DNase I. Furthermore, neither cytochalasin D nor DNase I alone blocked all of the sites for addition of monomeric pyrene-labeled rabbit muscle G-actin to phalloidin-treated skeletons; however, a combination of the two agents did so. In the presence of phalloidin, the polymerization of 300 nM pyrenyl actin on nuclei constructed from 5 nM gelsolin and 25 nM rabbit muscle G-actin was completely inhibited by 35 nM DNase I but not by 35 nM cytochalasin D. We conclude that DNase I associates uniquely with and caps the pointed (slow-growing or negative) end of F-actin. These results imply that the amino-terminal, DNase I-binding domain of the actin protomer is oriented toward the pointed end and is buried along the length of the actin filament."
https://openalex.org/W1545520749,"3-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (3-hydroxy-2-methyl propanoate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.31) was purified 1800-fold from rabbit liver by detergent extraction, differential solubility in polyethylene glycol and (NH4)2SO4, and column chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose, CM(carboxymethyl)-Sepharose, Affi-Gel Blue, and Ultrogel AcA-34. The enzyme had a native Mr of 74,000 and appeared to be a homodimer with subunit Mr = 34,000. The enzyme was specific for NAD+. It oxidized both S-3-hydroxyisobutyrate and R-3-hydroxyisobutyrate, but the kcat/Km was approximately 350-fold higher for the S-isomer. Steady state kinetic analysis indicates an ordered Bi Bi reaction mechanism with NAD+ binding before 3-hydroxyisobutyrate. The enzyme catalyzed oxidation of S-3-hydroxyisobutyrate between pH 7.0 and 11.5 with optimal activity between pH 9.0 and 11.0. The enzyme apparently does not have a metal ion requirement. Essential sulfhydryl groups may be present at both the 3-hydroxyisobutyrate and NAD+ binding sites since inhibition by sulfhydryl-binding agents was differentially blocked by each substrate. The enzyme is highly sensitive to product inhibition by NADH which may play an important physiological role in regulating the complete oxidation of valine beyond the formation of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate."
https://openalex.org/W1575127366,"The secondary structures of three snake venom cardiotoxins (from Hemachatus hemachatus, Naja naja atra, and Naja naja naja), in aqueous solution and in a lipid-bound form, were investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The conformation-sensitive protein infrared bands in the amide I region were analyzed using deconvolution and band-fitting procedures. The spectra of the three cardiotoxins in aqueous buffer are very similar; they indicate a high content of both antiparallel beta-sheet structure and unordered conformation. Moreover, component bands characteristic of turns can also be identified. The binding of cardiotoxins to bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidyl-glycerol results in an increased content of a beta-structure at the expense of the nonordered conformation. It is suggested that lipid-induced conformational transitions to a beta-structure, similar to that observed with cardiotoxins, may be operative also in membrane interaction of other proteins and peptides, particularly with those which have a small tendency to form alpha-helices."
https://openalex.org/W1519094501,The 204-kDa smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) from rat aorta smooth muscle cells was found to be phosphorylated following isolation of myosin from strips of intact aorta as well as from primary cultures of aorta cells. Two-dimensional maps of the tryptic peptides revealed that the phosphate was confined to only three peptides and gave a similar pattern for the MHC isolated from intact aorta strips and cultured cells. This map was quite different from the phosphopeptide map found for the 196-kDa MHC of nonmuscle myosin isolated from the same cell culture. Smooth muscle MHC purified from primary cell cultures was found to contain approximately 0.7 mol of phosphate/mol of MHC while the nonmuscle MHC contained approximately 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of MHC. These observations raise the possibility of an additional regulatory mechanism in smooth muscle operating via MHC phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W1550022465,"Two glycopeptide hydrolases, an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and peptide:N-glycanase (amidase), have been isolated from defatted jack bean meal by standard procedures involving differential solubility and column chromatography. The purified products appear to be free of contaminating proteases and exoglycosidases, and their substrate specificity has been explored with regard to both glycan and peptide structure of the substrates. The endoglycosidase appears to be specific for high mannose glycans; no hydrolysis of either hybrid or complex glycans has been observed. It shows limited activity with two intact glycoproteins, ribonuclease B and yeast invertase, and gives optimal rate with glycopeptides. Free glycan-Asn derivatives are poor substrates in comparison with glycopeptides or glycan-Asn derivatives where the alpha-amino group has been dansylated. The amidase will liberate both high mannose, hybrid, and asialo-complex glycans from both proteins and peptides, but many glycans in intact proteins or in long peptides are resistant to the amidase and become active as substrates only after further proteolytic cleavage. The best substrates appear to be those with the glycosylated asparagine no more than 4-5 residues in from either the NH2- or COOH-terminal end of the peptide. Sialylated glycans do not appear to be released by the amidase."
https://openalex.org/W1510363958,"To investigate the relative importance of each of the ribose 3'-hydroxyl groups of 2-5A (ppp5' A2'p5'A2'-p5' A) in determining binding to and activation of the 2-5A-dependent endonuclease (RNase L), the 3'-hydroxyl functionality of each adenosine moiety of 2-5A trimer triphosphate was sequentially replaced by hydrogen. The analog in which the 5'-terminal adenosine was replaced by 3'-deoxyadenosine (viz. ppp5'(3'dA)-2'p5' A2'p5' A) was bound to RNase L as well as 2-5A itself and was only 3 times less potent than 2-5A as an activator of RNase L. On the other hand, when the second adenosine unit was replaced by 3'-deoxyadenosine (viz. ppp5' A2'p5'(3'dA)2'p5' A), binding to RNase L was decreased by a factor of eight relative to 2-5A trimer and, even more dramatically, there was a 500-1000-fold drop in ability to activate the 2-5A-dependent endonuclease. Finally, when the 3'-hydroxyl substituent was converted to hydrogen in the 2'-terminal residue of 2-5A, a significant increase in both binding and activation ability occurred. We conclude that only the 3'-hydroxyl group of the second (from the terminus) nucleotide residue of 2-5A is needed for effective activation of RNase L."
https://openalex.org/W1529860238,"Abstract In a recent paper, we described the isolation of the first bovine protamine cDNA (BPK59), demonstrating that the gene was autosomal and single copy (Krawetz, S. A., Connor, W., and Dixon, G. H. (1987) DNA 6, 45-57). We have since utilized the BPK59 clone as a probe, to isolate both alleles of the protamine gene from a bovine genomic library constructed in Charon 28. The sequenced alleles are highly homologous and code for identical mRNAs. Unlike the trout protamine genes, the bovine gene is not contiguous as it possesses a single intron. This intron divides the highly variable mammalian carboxyl domain from the conserved protamine basic core. Three tandemly repeated CG-like (enhancer) sequences upstream from the CAAT box have been identified, separated by a conserved spacer region. Their possible role in the transcription of this P1 gene is discussed. The bovine genome immediately surrounding (approximately equal to 20 kilobase pairs) the protamine gene has been mapped and reveals that the sequence flanking the 5' segment of the gene is unique, while the sequence flanking the 3' segment is repetitive."
https://openalex.org/W1608700689,"The C5a receptor has been extracted in an active state from the membranes of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes with the detergents digitonin and beta-dodecyl maltoside. The solubilized receptor exhibits a single class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd = 90 pM, a value similar to that found with intact membranes. Physical studies with the soluble receptor demonstrate that it exists in two forms which differ in molecular mass. Gel filtration experiments with receptor to which C5a has been bound give an apparent molecular mass for the complex of 150-200 kDa. When the experiments were repeated with nonliganded receptor, most of the C5a binding activity eluted with an apparent mass of 150-200 kDa. However, the peak had a pronounced trailing shoulder indicating that, in the nonliganded state, a portion of the receptor population exists in a smaller form, which may be converted to the larger form on binding C5a. The molecular mass of the smaller form, estimated to be 30-70 kDa, is consistent with that of the binding subunit of the receptor. These data imply that the larger form, and therefore the bulk of the solubilized receptor, is oligomeric, a conclusion which is supported by cross-linking studies. When C5a was cross-linked to the soluble receptor two specific complexes with molecular masses of 52 and 95 kDa were formed. The former is the covalent adduct of C5a and the binding subunit of the receptor and the latter appears to be a complex between the 52-kDa species and an additional polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1535091783,"Chloroplast import and processing of two precursor proteins with mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region of the transit peptide were examined in vitro. Deletion mutations were introduced into the 57-amino acid transit peptide of a chloroplast protein, the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, from pea. A mutant, PSd48/57, in which nine carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the transit peptide had been deleted, was imported and processed to a series of 13- to 18-kDa polypeptides including the 14-kDa mature small subunit. In contrast, processing of a mutant, PSd45/57, in which an additional three amino acids had been removed, resulted in a series of polypeptides which did not include the mature small subunit. Whereas PSd48/57 was imported as efficiently as the wild-type precursor, import of PSd45/57 was only 25% as efficient as that of the authentic precursor. The mutant precursor proteins PSd48/57 and PSd45/57 are distinguished by a three-amino acid sequence, Ile-Thr-Ser, located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the transit peptide. We show that all or part of this sequence is required for correct processing."
https://openalex.org/W1608870138,"Chromaffin granule ghosts from bovine adrenal medullae have been used to examine the ability of membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase to interact directly with intravesicular ascorbate and to investigate vectorial electron transfer from external ascorbate across the ghost membrane. Ghosts prepared by a modification of published procedures were shown to be fully active in both dopamine uptake and norepinephrine production. Dopamine uptake is dependent on the presence of a magnesium and ATP ionic complex, is abolished by reserpine, and reaches a steady-state level in the presence of dopamine beta-monooxygenase, ascorbate, catalase, and fumarate. Omission of ascorbate either inside or outside the ghosts greatly enhances dopamine accumulation, which reaches levels of approximately 30 nmol/mg under these conditions. Correspondingly, in the presence of all components, norepinephrine production reached approximately 100 nmol/mg in 30 min of incubation. Norepinephrine production was strictly magnesium-ATP-dependent, inhibited by either reserpine or dopamine beta-monooxygenase inactivation, and was markedly reduced when ascorbate was omitted from either inside or outside the ghosts. In the presence of limiting amounts of internal ascorbate, rapid norepinephrine production occurred which corresponded to the amount of initial ascorbate present, followed by a much slower endogenous norepinephrine production observable after complete depletion of internal ascorbate. The endogenous rate of norepinephrine production likely represents epinephrine-supported dopamine beta-monooxygenase turnover. Taken together, the data demonstrate that facile norepinephrine production by membrane-bound dopamine beta-monooxygenase occurs only when internal ascorbate is present, terminates upon depletion of internal ascorbate, and can only be sustained at a significant rate when reducing equivalents from external ascorbate are available."
https://openalex.org/W1653192006,"Studies were conducted to define the location of components and sequences in heparin with respect to their distance from the peptide linkage in the native proteoglycan. A purified heparin-oligopeptide was linked via its amino terminus to a matrix containing an azo bond and an activated carboxyl group. The polysaccharide chain was maximally degraded, either with heparinase or nitrous acid, and the soluble products were removed. The heparin-oligopeptide fragments that remained on the matrix were released by reductive cleavage of the azo linkage and characterized. The fragments, as well as heparin released without prior degradation, contained serine and glycine as the principal amino acids; the ratio of galactose to xylose was 2:1. The ratio of glucosamine to serine of 33:1 in the undegraded heparin was reduced to 6:1 and 1:1 in the heparinase-treated and nitrous acid-treated products, respectively. The undegraded sample and the fragments contained phosphate in equivalent amounts, demonstrating its presence in the heparin-protein linkage region. The heparin-oligopeptide preparation was also fractionated by gel filtration and high and low molecular weight fractions thus obtained were each linked to the insoluble matrix. The products that were subsequently released were subfractionated on a molecular weight-calibrated column of Sephadex G-200, and eluates were assayed for activity in promoting the neutralization of thrombin and factor Xa by antithrombin. The results revealed a sharp decrease in specific activity in heparin-oligopeptide fractions below Mr = 15,000 indicating that the anticoagulant-conferring segment is located at about 20 disaccharide units away from the peptide linkage region."
https://openalex.org/W1502213519,"Abstract We have investigated the rates of monomer in equilibrium with tetramer self-association of oxygenated beta SH subunits of human hemoglobin A as well as the influence of self-association on the binding kinetics for O2 and CO. A 4 beta in equilibrium with 2 beta 2 in equilibrium with beta 4 assembly pathway can be used to describe the association equilibria and kinetics. We have determined all four elementary rate constants for this assembly pathway at 15 degrees C in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4. These data imply that a significant amount (approximately 17%) of beta 2 can be present. Laser photolysis kinetic studies of O2 binding indicate that the O2 association rate constant is unaffected by the degree of self-association. In contrast, photolysis of beta CO solutions shows an overall rate of CO binding that increases at higher protein concentrations. These data are consistent with a concentration-dependent equilibrium between two protein species with CO association rates differing by a factor of 2.5, but they do not appear to be compatible with a direct assignment of different CO binding rates to the different assembly states. Rather, we believe the data imply that CO binding to beta oligomers is heterogeneous, with both a fast binding and a slow binding form being present in single association states. The fast binding form predominates (approximately equal to 87%) in beta 4, while the beta monomer has very little or none of the fast binding form. We propose that the slow binding component within beta 4 may be those subunits with rotationally disordered hemes (La Mar, G. N., Yamamoto, Y., Jue, T., Smith, K. M., and Pandey, R. K. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3826-3831). The implications of these findings for the use of isolated subunits as models for the subunits within R state hemoglobin tetramers are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1482311306,"We have established a new method for preparing Physarum myosin whose actin-activated ATPase activity is inhibited by micromolar levels of Ca2+. This Ca2+-inhibition is mediated by the Ca2+ binding to the myosin rather than by the Ca2+-dependent modification of the phosphorylated state of the myosin (Kohama, K., and Kendrick-Jones, J. (1986) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 99, 1433-1446). Ca2+-binding light chain (CaLC) has been suggested to be primary importance in this Ca2+ inhibition (Kohama, K., Takano-Ohmuro, H., Tanaka, T., Yamaguchi, T., and Kohama, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 8022-8027). The amino acid sequence of CaLC was determined; it was composed of 147 amino acid residues and the N terminus was acetylated. The molecular weight was calculated to be 16,131. The homology of CaLC in the amino acid sequence with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) light chain and alkali light chain of skeletal muscle myosin were rather low, i.e., 25% and 30%, respectively. Interestingly, however, the CaLC sequence was 40% homologous with brain calmodulin. This amino acid sequence was confirmed by sequencing the cloned phage DNA accommodating cDNA coding CaLC. Northern and Southern blot analysis indicated that 0.8-kilobase pair mRNA was transcribed from a single CaLC gene. This is the first report on the amino acid sequence of myosin light chain of lower eukaryotes and nucleotide sequence of its mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1595445649,"The phlorizin binding properties of luminal membrane vesicles isolated from the LLC-PK1 cells, a continuous epithelial cell line derived from pig kidney, are studied. Scatchard analysis of this binding indicates the existence of a single high affinity sodium-dependent site with KD = 0.4 microM at 266 mM sodium. The specificity properties of this site indicate that it represents the binding of phlorizin to the hexose binding site of the sodium-dependent D-glucose transporter previously identified in this cell line. Both phlorizin equilibrium binding and the rate of phlorizin binding were found to be sigmoidal functions of sodium concentration. A Hill analysis of these data was consistent with a sodium:phlorizin stoichiometry of 2:1 in good agreement with the sodium:glucose stoichiometry already established in these cells. Phlorizin dissociation was also found to be sodium-dependent. On the basis of the phlorizin binding data presented here, a number of models of the binding of phlorizin and sodium to the transporter can be excluded. An analysis of a random binding model consistent with the data is presented. The significance of the LLC-PK1 sodium-dependent D-glucose transporter as a model system for related renal and intestinal transporters is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1606396095,"Hepatic mitoplasts from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats contain cytochrome P-450 which can metabolize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like benzo(a)pyrene. Mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 was partially purified and reconstituted in vitro using adrenodoxin and the adrenodoxin reductase electron transfer system and [3H]benzo(a)pyrene as the substrate. A polyclonal antibody to purified microsomal P-450c (a major 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible form) inhibited the activity of mitochondrial enzyme in a concentration-dependent manner and also reacted with a 54-kDa protein on the immunoblots. A monoclonal antibody having exclusive specificity for P-450c, on the other hand, did not inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity of the mitochondrial enzyme and showed no detectable cross-reaction with the 54-kDa mitochondrial protein. Similarly, two-dimensional analysis and immunodetection using the polyclonal antibody showed distinct molecular properties of the mitochondrial enzyme different from the similarly induced microsomal P-450c with respect to the isoelectric pH. In vitro translation of free polysomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-induced liver, transport of precursor proteins by isolated mitochondria in vitro, and immunoprecipitation with the polyclonal antibody showed the presence of a 57-kDa putative precursor which is transported and processed into mature 54-kDa species. These results present evidence for the true intramitochondrial location of the P-450c-antibody reactive isoform detected in 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rat liver mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1527587909,"The Cu,Co superoxide dismutase derivative, in which the native Zn(II) was replaced by Co(II), was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy at pH 7.0 in the presence of CN- and N-3. Addition of either anion produced large but remarkably different variations in the position of the histidine proton signals bound to the metal cluster. The resonances of the histidines bound to the copper broadened at low CN- concentrations (6 X10(-5)-16.5 X 10(-3) M KCN, in the presence of 1.5 mM protein) and narrowed again, with changed chemical shifts at [KCN] greater than 10(-2) M. At 7 degrees C two resonances split into two pairs of lines as a function of [CN-]. The temperature dependence of these resonances, in the presence of nonsaturating [CN-], suggests a slow exchange between two forms of the protein-bound copper in the presence of the anion. The apparent activation parameters associated with the interconversion of the two species indicate a local conformational change in the presence of CN-. No evidence of temperature dependence was seen in the spectrum in the presence of N-3, which, on the other hand, was fully removed from the copper by addition of CN-. No evidence was obtained for removal by CN- of a histidine bound to the copper as previously reported for low affinity anions at pH 5.5 (Bertini, I., Lanini, G., Luchinat, C., Messori, L., Monanni, R., and Scozzafava, A. (1985) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 107, 4391-4396). These results indicate that CN- has a unique pattern of binding to the enzyme copper. Since catalytic and structural data indicate that CN- is the only appropriate substrate analogue for the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, data from anions with much less affinity may lead to misleading conclusions on the mechanism of anion and substrate binding to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1573942192,"Three kinds of cDNA clones were isolated from a cDNA library synthesized from female rat liver mRNA by cross-hybridization with the P-450(M-1) cDNA as a probe and sequenced. One clone appears to be the previously isolated P-450f cDNA clone with an additional 5'-untranslated and coding sequence which are lacking in the previously reported clone (Gonzalez, F. J., Kimura, S., Song, B.-J., Pastewka, J., Gelboin, H. V., and Hardwick, J. P. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10667-10672), though several nucleotide differences were seen. Another one is for P-450PB-1 mRNA previously isolated, and the last has an almost identical nucleotide sequence to P-450PB-1 (the same report cited above) except for one region of 159 base pairs where the sequence homology between the two is abruptly broken down. This nonhomologous region appears to correspond exactly to the entire eighth exon, estimated by comparison with the gene structure of the related P-450 (P-450(M-1)). This replacement in P-450PB-1 (ps) causes a frameshift in the open reading frame, resulting in the generation of a truncated form of P-450 with a strange replacement block and lacking the heme-binding region. This observation suggests that the mRNA whose cDNA was cloned here was produced from a recombinant gene generated by gene conversion or from alternative splicing of a cryptic exon. Sex- and age-dependent expression of the mRNAs investigated by dot blot analysis revealed that normal- and pseudo-type PB-1 mRNA were expressed in both male and female rat livers, though their age-dependent expression was different in male and female animals. In addition, both the mRNAs were specifically expressed in the female brain of 8 weeks, whereas practically no expression was observed in kidney and lung of both sexes."

They show a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol, and the molecular weights are 68,000 for low Mr kininogen A and 73,000 for low Mr kininogen B. Although the molecular weights and amino acid compositions of the low Mr kininogens are similar, rat submaxillary and urinary kallikreins released bradykinin from low Mr kininogen B, whereas low Mr kininogen A was resistant to these enzymes. The COOH-terminal portion of low Mr kininogen A was isolated after cyanogen bromide treatment, and the amino acid sequence of the COOH-terminal 55 residues including the T-kinin (Ile-Ser-bradykinin) was determined. The COOH-terminal portion consists of two sequences with substitution of 4 residues. One peptide corresponds to alpha 1-major acute phase protein (Cole, T., Inglis, A. S., Roxburgh, C. M., Howlett, G. J., and Schreiber, G. (1985) FEBS Lett. 182, 57-61) and the other to the TI-kininogen predicted from a cDNA study (Furuto-Kato, S., Matsumoto, A., Kitamura, N., and Nakanishi, S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12054-12059). The results demonstrate that there exist at least two kinds of low Mr kininogens with clearly different function in rat plasma: one of them, low Mr kininogen A, is a precursor of T-kinin and is resistant to kallikreins, and the second, low Mr kininogen B, is sensitive to tissue kallikreins and shares properties with bovine and human low Mr kininogens. The results also demonstrate that T-kininogen is a mixture of two isoproteins which correspond to alpha 1-major acute phase protein or TI-kininogen, respectively. We could not detect the low Mr kininogen corresponding to the TII-kininogen predicted from the cDNA study of Furuto-Kato et al."

https://openalex.org/W1617131597,"In cartilage, link protein(s) (LP) stabilize proteoglycan aggregates via their specific association with hyaluronic acid and proteoglycan monomers. Two major link glycoproteins are produced in bovine articular cartilage, designated LP1 (49.5 kDa) and LP2 (44.0 kDa), whereas rat chondrosarcoma produces a single link protein species similar in size to bovine LP2. Although multiple link proteins differ to a significant degree in carbohydrate content, it is not known whether they arise from variable glycosylation of a single common protein core or from complete glycosylation of different protein cores. Biosynthesis of these molecules has been studied under conditions where differences generated by N-linked glycosylation would not be evident. Link proteins were immunoprecipitated 1) from cell-free translation products of total cellular and size fractionated RNA and 2) from cell lysates and medium of cultured chondrocytes using short term radioactive labeling of the protein in the presence and absence of tunicamycin. A 42-kDa link protein precursor is synthesized by cell-free translation of either rat chondrosarcoma or bovine chondrocyte mRNa. An apparently single 41.5-kDa link protein is synthesized with inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin, whereas LP1 and LP2 are the mature products of cultured bovine chondrocytes. The size range of translatable rat chondrosarcoma LP mRNA is 4.0-5.5 kilobase pairs and bovine LP mRNA is 3.0-4.5 kilobase pairs, both much larger than required to encode the link protein molecule. These results suggest that a single link protein precursor gives rise to multiple fully glycosylated forms and that link protein is not synthesized as a significantly larger pro form."
https://openalex.org/W1595635571,"The present study was intended to examine the structure of the rat Leydig cell gonadotropin receptor. Leydig cell suspensions were prepared by either collagenase digestion or mechanical disruption of the testes. The cells were incubated with 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) following which the bound 125I-hCG was covalently cross-linked to the cell surface receptor using a cleavable (dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate] and a noncleavable (disuccinimidyl suberate) cross-linking reagent. The extracted cross-linked membrane proteins were resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions and subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Under nonreducing conditions, three radiolabeled bands, in addition to intact hCG and its alpha-subunit, were detected with apparent molecular weights of 184,000, 136,000, and 103,000. However, under reducing conditions, three radiolabeled bands migrated on the gel corresponding to molecular weights of 144,000, 106,000, and 75,000. The binding of 125I-hCG to the receptor was inhibited by hCG and luteinizing hormone, but not by a number of other peptides or proteins. The radiolabeled bands were not detectable in hCG down-regulated Leydig cells. Furthermore, a similar autoradiographic pattern of 125I-hCG-linked complexes was seen when the 125I-linked receptor complex was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-hCG antibodies followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, evidence was obtained indicating that these three labeled bands were derived from the same molecular species. The data suggests that the hCG receptor in Leydig cell is probably an oligomeric complex with a molecular weight of about 250,000, which is composed of three polypeptide chains of molecular weights 121,000, 83,000, and 52,000 held together through noncovalent forces. Additionally, collagenase treatment of Leydig cells does not appear to alter the autoradiographic pattern of the 125I-hCG-linked receptor."

Control microsomes metabolized triphenylene at a rate of 1.2 nmol/nmol of cytochrome P-450/min. Treatment of rats with PB or MC resulted in a 40% reduction and a 3-fold enhancement in the rate of metabolism, respectively. Metabolites consisted of the trans-1,2-dihydrodiol as well as 1-hydroxytriphenylene, and to a lesser extent 2-hydroxytriphenylene. The (-)-1R,2R-enantiomer of the dihydrodiol predominated (70 to 92%) under all incubation conditions. Incubation of racemic triphenylene 1,2-oxide with microsomal epoxide hydrolase produced dihydrodiol which was highly enriched (80%) in the (-)-1R,2R-enantiomer. Experiments with 18O-enriched water showed that attack of water was exclusively at the allylic 2-position of the arene oxide, indicating that the 1R,2S-enantiomer of the oxide was preferentially hydrated by epoxide hydrolase. Thiol trapping experiments indicated that liver microsomes from MC-treated rats produced almost exclusively (greater than 90%) the 1R,2S-enantiomer of triphenylene 1,2-oxide whereas liver microsomes from PB-treated rats formed racemic oxide. The optically active oxide has a half-life for racemization of only approximately 20 s under the incubation conditions. This study may represent the first attempt to address stereochemical consequences of a rapidly racemizing intermediary metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1571750390,"Abstract We have previously shown that exposure of responding cells to vitamin A leads to profound modifications of chromatin structure as revealed by an increased susceptibility to DNase I digestion, modified patterns of histone acetylation, and impaired synthesis of a nonhistone chromosomal protein (Ferrari, N., and Vidali, G. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 151, 305-310). The present results show that these effects are most probably due to the direct interaction between retinol and chromatin, and analysis of mononucleosomes and higher oligomers obtained from retinol-treated cells shows that retinol is indeed tightly bound to chromatin. Enzymatic digestions of vitamin A containing nucleosomes with proteinase K, phospholipase C, and phospholipase A2 support a model where the final binding of retinol to chromatin is mediated by a lipoprotein: the recognition of the binding sites on DNA being dictated by the proteic component while the hydrophobic retinol is solubilized in the fatty acid moiety."
