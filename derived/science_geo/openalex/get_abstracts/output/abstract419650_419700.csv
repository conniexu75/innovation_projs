Here, we characterize the role of plasmin(ogen) in the complement cascade. Plasminogen binds the central complement protein C3, the C3 cleavage products C3b and C3d, and C5. Plasminogen binds to C3, C3b, C3d, and C5 via lysine residues, and the interaction is ionic strength-dependent. Plasminogen and Factor H bind C3b; however, the two proteins bind to different sites and do not compete for binding. Plasminogen affects complement action in multiple ways. Plasminogen enhanced Factor I-mediated C3b degradation in the presence of the cofactor Factor H. Plasminogen when activated to plasmin inhibited complement as demonstrated by hemolytic assays using either rabbit or sheep erythrocytes. Similarly, plasmin either in the fluid phase or attached to surfaces inhibited complement that was activated via the alternative and classical pathways and cleaved C3b to fragments of 68, 40, 30, and 17 kDa. The C3b fragments generated by plasmin differ in size from those generated by the complement protease Factor I, suggesting that plasmin-mediated C3b cleavage fragments lack effector function. Plasmin also cleaved C5 to products of 65, 50, 30, and 25 kDa. Thus, plasmin(ogen) regulates both complement and coagulation, the two central cascade systems of a vertebrate organism. This complement-inhibitory activity of plasmin provides a new explanation why pathogenic microbes utilize plasmin(ogen) for immune evasion and tissue penetration.

Plasminogen is a 92-kDa single chain human plasma glycoprotein that circulates in plasma as an inactive proenzyme. Plasminogen is composed of an N-terminal preactivation peptide (∼8 kDa), five consecutive disulfide-bonded kringle domains (K1–K5), and a serine protease domain (1.Sottrup-Jensen L. Zajdel M. Claeys H. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Amino-acid sequence of activation cleavage site in plasminogen: homology with “pro” part of prothrombin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Symp. 1997; 212 (discussion 60–45): 46-60PubMed Google Scholar). Plasminogen, which has a plasma concentration of ∼2 μm, is primary synthesized and secreted by liver cells (3.Miyashita C. Wenzel E. Heiden M. Plasminogen: a brief introduction into its biochemistry and function.Haemostasis. 1988; 18: 7-13PubMed Google Scholar). Plasminogen is converted to the active serine protease plasmin by human activators like urokinase-type (uPA) 2The abbreviations used are:uPAurokinase-type plasminogen activatorAPalternative pathwayCPclassical pathwayLPlectin pathwayϵACAϵ-amino caproic acidNHSnormal human serum. and tissue-type plasminogen activators and by bacterial activators, such as staphylokinase and streptokinase (4.Lähteenmäki K.

Plasmin as the key enzyme of the coagulation system dissolves preformed fibrin clots and regulates fibrinolysis and homeostasis. Furthermore, plasmin also degrades components of the extracellular matrix and the basal membrane, including laminin, fibrin, and fibrinogen (5.Lähteenmäki K. Kuusela P. Korhonen T.K. Plasminogen activation in degradation and penetration of extracellular matrices and basement membranes by invasive bacteria.Methods. 2000; 21: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Plasmin also activates matrix metalloproteases and elastase, which regulate wound healing, tissue remodeling, tumor metastasis, and angiogenesis (6.Myöhänen H. Vaheri A. Regulation and interactions in the activation of cell-associated plasminogen.Cell. Mol.

The coagulation system maintains tissue homeostasis, prevents blood clotting, and induces fibrin clot formation upon vessel damage or injury. In addition, the coagulation system as part of the innate immune response aids in host defense against invading microbes and initiates protective inflammatory responses against foreign invaders (7.Amara U. Rittirsch D. Flierl M. Bruckner U. Klos A. Gebhard F. Lambris J.D. Huber-Lang M. Interaction between the coagulation and complement system.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 632: 71-79PubMed Google Scholar). The coagulation cascade is activated at exposed or damaged surfaces, and this activation ultimately leads to platelet aggregation and clot and thrombus formation. Upon vessel injury, the coagulation cascade is also activated, generating the serine protease thrombin, which forms a fibrin clot by converting fibrinogen to fibrin (8.Wolberg A.S. Campbell R.A. Thrombin generation, fibrin clot formation and hemostasis.Transfus. Apher. Sci. 2008; 38: 15-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9.Wolberg A.S. Thrombin generation and fibrin clot structure.Blood Rev. 2007; 21: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Plasmin has an antagonistic effect, and this protease degrades fibrin and dissolves the blood clot (10.Cesarman-Maus G. Hajjar K.A. Molecular mechanisms of fibrinolysis.Br. J.

As damaged and newly exposed surfaces represent sites for complement activation, it is necessary to understand how complement is both activated and regulated at these sites. The complement system represents a central defense system of the human organism that maintains homeostasis. The individual complement components, proteases, and inhibitors are activated in a cascade-like fashion, and the third component, C3, is central for this activation (14.Walport M.J. Complement. First of two parts.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar, 15.Walport M.J. Complement. Second of two parts.N. Engl. J.

Immunol. 2009; 9: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Complement is activated by three major pathways, the alternative (AP), the classical (CP), and the lectin pathway (LP). The AP is spontaneously activated, the CP is initiated by immune complexes, and the LP is triggered by specific carbohydrates, such as mannan, which is exposed on bacterial surfaces. Each of the three pathways generates a C3 convertase that cleaves the central protein C3 (14.Walport M.J. Complement. First of two parts.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar, 15.Walport M.J. Complement. Second of two parts.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). This cleavage generates the anaphylactic and antimicrobial peptide C3a and forms C3b, which is deposited onto any nearby surfaces and acts as an opsonin (18.Thurman J.M. Holers V.M. The central role of the alternative complement pathway in human disease.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Binding of a second C3b protein to the C3 convertase (C3bBb) generates a C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 to generate the anaphylatoxin C5a and C5b (19.Heinen S. Hartmann A. Lauer N. Wiehl U. Dahse H.M. Schirmer S. Gropp K. Enghardt T. Wallich R. Hälbich S. Mihlan M. Schlötzer-Schrehardt U. Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR-1) inhibits complement C5 convertase activity and terminal complex formation.Blood. 2009; 114: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The complement system is tightly regulated by soluble and membrane-bound proteins. Factor H, FHL-1, and the C4b-binding protein are the main soluble complement regulators that act at the level of the C3 convertase (20.Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Hellwage J. Jokiranta S.T. Meri S. Brade V. Kraiczy P. Noris M. Remuzzi G. Factor H family proteins: on complement, microbes and human diseases.Biochem. Soc.

Factor H family proteins and human diseases.Trends Immunol. 2008; 29: 380-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The AP regulator Factor H serves as a cofactor for the serine protease Factor I, which cleaves and inactivates C3b, whereas C4b-binding protein, which is also a cofactor for Factor I, binds C4b and inhibits the CP C3 convertase (22.Gigli I. Fujita T. Nussenzweig V. Modulation of the classical pathway C3 convertase by plasma proteins C4 binding protein and C3b inactivator.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 6596-6600Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 23.Zipfel P.F. Complement and immune defense: from innate immunity to human diseases.Immunol. Lett. 2009; 126: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both the coagulation and the complement cascades of the human organism are tightly connected (24.Peerschke E.I. Yin W. Ghebrehiwet B. Platelet mediated complement activation.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 632: 81-91PubMed Google Scholar). The cross-talk of these two major cascade systems is a focus of ongoing research, and proteases that act in both systems are of special interest. Over 50 years ago, Pillemer et al. (25.Pillemer L. Ratnoff O.D. Blum L. Lepow I.H. The inactivation of complement and its components by plasmin.J. Exp. Med. 1953; 97: 573-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) showed that plasminogen when activated by the staphylococcal staphylokinase cleaves the complement proteins C1, C2, C3, and C4 and inhibits complement activation. Other groups have reported that plasmin by cleaving C3 and C5 generated biologically active anaphylatoxins (7.Amara U. Rittirsch D. Flierl M. Bruckner U. Klos A. Gebhard F. Lambris J.D. Huber-Lang M. Interaction between the coagulation and complement system.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 632: 71-79PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Taylor Jr., F.B. Ward P.A.

Immunol. 2010; 185: 5628-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Similarly, plasma treated with the human plasminogen activator uPa generated a protease that interfered with fibrinolysis (29.Seya T. Nagasawa S. Matsukura M. Hasegawa H. Atkinson J.P. Generation of C3d,g and C3d by urokinase-treated plasma in association with fibrinolysis.Complement. 1985; 2: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, thrombin, the central coagulation protease, cleaves C5 and initiates a fourth complement activation pathway that bypasses C3 (30.Polley M.J. Nachman R. The human complement system in thrombin-mediated platelet function.J. Exp. Med. 1978; 147: 1713-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). So far, an activating role of the two coagulation proteases for the complement cascade was proposed as thrombin degrades the complement proteins C3 and C5 and generates the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a (28.Amara U. Flierl M.A. Rittirsch D. Klos A. Chen H. Acker B. Brückner U.B. Nilsson B. Gebhard F. Lambris J.D. Huber-Lang M. Molecular intercommunication between the complement and coagulation systems.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 5628-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). However, whether these coagulation proteases also allow further processing and even inactivation of the two complement components remains unclear. Both the coagulation and the complement cascades maintain homeostasis, and components of both cascades recognize and eliminate infectious microbes. However, pathogenic microbes, which survive in an immunocompetent host, have found special means to control both host cascades and block the action of effector molecules. Plasminogen as a component of the coagulation system and similarly Factor H, FHL-1, CFHR1, and C4b-binding protein as major soluble regulators of the complement cascade are acquired by a large number of human pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae (31.Hallström T.

Immunol. 2009; 47: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For several pathogens, the corresponding microbial plasminogen-binding proteins have been identified. Plasminogen bound by these microbial proteins is accessible and activated by human as well as microbial activators of plasmin, which cleaves the natural substrates fibrinogen and C3b (39.Zipfel P.F.

The interaction between pathogens and the host coagulation system.Physiology. 2006; 21: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As several microbial and fungal complement evasion proteins bind Factor H and plasminogen (39.Zipfel P.F. Hallström T. Hammerschmidt S. Skerka C. The complement fitness factor H: role in human diseases and for immune escape of pathogens, like pneumococci.Vaccine. 2008; 26: I67-I74Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 45.Sun H. The interaction between pathogens and the host coagulation system.Physiology. 2006; 21: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that plasmin(ogen) has a complement-regulatory role. Therefore, we analyzed whether plasmin inhibits the complement cascade and whether plasminogen binds to human complement proteins. Here, we characterize plasmin as a complement regulator, modulator, and inhibitor. Plasminogen binds several human complement proteins such as C3, C3b, and C5. When activated, plasmin cleaves the central human complement proteins C3b and C5 and generates cleavage fragments that are distinct from those generated by the complement protease Factor I. In addition, plasminogen enhances the cofactor activity of Factor H. Understanding the role of plasmin for complement regulation also provides a basis for novel therapeutic approaches. Human plasminogen, uPa (Hemochrom Diagnostica), and the complement proteins C3, C3b, C3c, C3d, C3a, C5, and Factor H (CompTech) were used for binding studies. Plasmin was generated by incubation of plasminogen and uPa for 15 min at 37 °C. Proteins were identified with goat antiserum specific for plasminogen (Acris Antibodies); complement protein C3, C3d, C5, or Factor H (CompTech); or rabbit antiserum specific for C3a (CompTech). Corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antiserum was purchased from Dako, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin, α2-antiplasmin, from Calbiochem and ϵ-amino caproic acid (ϵACA) Sigma, respectively. Sheep and rabbit erythrocytes were from Rockland. For ligand affinity assays, individual complement proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane (PVDF; Millipore). The membrane was blocked with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 4% milk powder in PBS, and 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C following incubation with plasminogen (20 μg/ml) for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS-T (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20), bound plasminogen was identified by Western blotting with appropriate antiserum and corresponding HRP-conjugated antiserum (46.Skerka C.

A novel short consensus repeat-containing protein is associated with human triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5627-5634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For ELISA, the various proteins (each at 0.5 μg in 50 μl of carbonate-bicarbonate buffer; Sigma) were immobilized onto a 96-well microtiter plate (MaxiSorb, Nunc) overnight at 4 °C. C3 and the various C3 activation fragments (C3b, C3c, C3d, and C3a) were immobilized at equal molar concentrations. After washing three times with PBS-T, wells were blocked with Blocking Buffer I (AppliChem) for 2 h at 37 °C. The appropriate ligand (1 μg in 100 μl of PBS) was added either alone or with the lysine analog ϵACA or NaCl. The various C3 activation fragments were used at equal molar concentrations; i.e. 1 μg was added. After incubation for 1.5 h at room temperature, unbound protein was removed by washing three times with PBS-T, and bound proteins were identified with appropriate antiserum and corresponding HRP-conjugated antiserum. After three additional washing steps, orthophenylenediamine (DakoCytomation) was added, the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 m H2SO4, and the absorption was measured at 492 nm in a microtiter plate reader. For surface plasmon resonance assays, a Biacore 3000 instrument was used. Complement proteins C3b, C3d, and C5 were immobilized via standard amine coupling to the flow cells of a CMD 500m sensor chip as described (34.Kunert A. Losse J. Gruszin C. Hühn M. Kaendler K. Mikkat S. Volke D. Hoffmann R. Jokiranta T.S. Seeberger H. Moellmann U. Hellwage J. Zipfel P.F.

An epitope of elongation factor Tu is widely distributed within the bacterial and archaeal domains.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 11-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The surface of the flow cells was activated, and the analyte diluted in coupling buffer (10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0) was injected until an appropriate level of coupling was reached (∼5000 resonance units). Plasminogen in the absence or presence of 10 mm ϵACA was used as an analyte at the indicated concentrations at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C in 150 mm PBS. In addition, the effect of plasminogen on Factor H binding to immobilized C3b was analyzed by ELISA. Factor H (used at 1 μg/well) and plasminogen were combined at different molar ratios, and then the mixtures were added to immobilized C3b (0.5 μg/well). Following incubation and extensive washing, each serum protein was detected separately with specific antiserum. Cofactor activity of plasminogen was analyzed by measuring Factor I-mediated degradation of C3b by Western blotting. Plasminogen at increasing concentrations (1–10 μg) was added to Factor H (30 ng), Factor I (30 ng), and C3b (0.3 μg). The reaction mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and C3 degradation products were detected using goat C3 antiserum. The intensities of degradation products (β-chain and α′43 band) were analyzed by densitometry (19.Heinen S. Hartmann A. Lauer N. Wiehl U. Dahse H.M. Schirmer S. Gropp K. Enghardt T. Wallich R. Hälbich S. Mihlan M. Schlötzer-Schrehardt U. Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR-1) inhibits complement C5 convertase activity and terminal complex formation.Blood. 2009; 114: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Cleavage of C3b and C5 was assayed in fluid and solid phases. For fluid phase activity, plasminogen (0.5 μg), uPa (0.25 μg), and C3b or C5 (0.5 μg) were mixed in PBS, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The protein degradation was assayed in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml α2-antiplasmin, or 1 mm ϵACA. In control experiments, C3b was incubated with Factor H and Factor I and with plasminogen or uPa. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane, and cleavage products were detected with appropriate antiserum and corresponding HRP-conjugated antiserum. For solid phase activity, plasminogen (0.5 μg in 50 μl of carbonate-bicarbonate buffer) was immobilized onto a microtiter plate overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS-T, blocking buffer (PBS + 0.2% gelatin) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following washing, uPa and C3b (0.5 μg in PBS) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times (0.5, 1, 5, and 24 h), samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to a membrane, and assayed by Western blotting using goat C3 antiserum. To assay the effect of plasmin on each of the three complement pathways, a WiELISA (Wieslab) was used according to the instructions of the supplier.

https://openalex.org/W2055921807,"Current knowledge about elder mistreatment is mainly derived from studies done in Western countries, which indicate that this problem is related to risk factors such as a shared living situation, social isolation, disease burden, and caregiver strain. We know little about prevalence and risk factors for elder mistreatment and mistreatment subtypes in rural China where the elder population is the most vulnerable.In 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among older adults aged 60 or older in three rural communities in Macheng, a city in Hubei province, China. Of 2245 people initially identified, 2039 were available for interview and this was completed in 2000. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data regarding mistreatment and covariates. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors related to elder mistreatment and subtypes of mistreatment.Elder mistreatment was reported by 36.2% (95% CI: 34.1%-38.3%) of the participants. Prevalence rates of psychological mistreatment, caregiver neglect, physical mistreatment, and financial mistreatment were 27.3% (95% CI: 25.3%-29.2%), 15.8% (95% CI: 14.2%-17.4%), 4.9% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.8%) and 2.0% (95% CI: 1.3%-2.6%), respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that depression, being widowed/divorced/single/separated, having a physical disability, having a labor intensive job, depending solely on self-made income, and living alone were risk factors for elder mistreatment. Different types of elder mistreatment were associated with different risk factors, and depression was the consistent risk factor for the three most common mistreatment subtypes.Older adults in rural China self-report a higher rate of mistreatment than their counterparts in Western countries. Depression is a main risk factor associated with most subtypes of mistreatment. Our findings suggest that prevention and management of elder mistreatment is a challenge facing a rapidly aging Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2045056309,"Ibogaine, a hallucinogenic alkaloid proposed as a treatment for opiate withdrawal, has been shown to inhibit serotonin transporter (SERT) noncompetitively, in contrast to all other known inhibitors, which are competitive with substrate. Ibogaine binding to SERT increases accessibility in the permeation pathway connecting the substrate-binding site with the cytoplasm. Because of the structural similarity between ibogaine and serotonin, it had been suggested that ibogaine binds to the substrate site of SERT. The results presented here show that ibogaine binds to a distinct site, accessible from the cell exterior, to inhibit both serotonin transport and serotonin-induced ionic currents. Ibogaine noncompetitively inhibited transport by both SERT and the homologous dopamine transporter (DAT). Ibogaine blocked substrate-induced currents also in DAT and increased accessibility of the DAT cytoplasmic permeation pathway. When present on the cell exterior, ibogaine inhibited SERT substrate-induced currents, but not when it was introduced into the cytoplasm through the patch electrode. Similar to noncompetitive transport inhibition, the current block was not reversed by increasing substrate concentration. The kinetics of inhibitor binding and dissociation, as determined by their effect on SERT currents, indicated that ibogaine does not inhibit by forming a long-lived complex with SERT, but rather binds directly to the transporter in an inward-open conformation. A kinetic model for transport describing the noncompetitive action of ibogaine and the competitive action of cocaine accounts well for the results of the present study."
https://openalex.org/W2011369819,"TRP channels have been associated with cell proliferation and aggressiveness in several cancers. In particular, TRPC1 regulates cell proliferation and motility, two processes underlying cancer progression. We and others have described the mechanisms of TRPC1-dependent cell migration. However, the involvement of TRPC1 in cell proliferation remains unexplained. In this study, we show that siRNA-mediated TRPC1 depletion in non small cell lung carcinoma cell lines induced G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest resulting in dramatic decrease in cell growth. The expression of cyclins D1 and D3 was reduced after TRPC1 knockdown, pointing out the role of TRPC1 in G(1)/S transition. This was associated with a decreased phosphorylation and activation of EGFR and with a subsequent disruption of PI3K/Akt and MAPK downstream pathways. Stimulation of EGFR by its natural ligand, EGF, induced Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+) entry through TRPC1. Ca(2+) entry through TRPC1 conversely activated EGFR, suggesting that TRPC1 is a component of a Ca(2+)-dependent amplification of EGF-dependent cell proliferation."

Results of this study show how transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) down-regulates expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) during EMT-like changes. Treatment with TGF-β1 resulted in a decrease in E-cadherin expression and GnT-III expression, as well as its product, the bisected N-glycans, which was confirmed by erythro-agglutinating phytohemagglutinin lectin blot and HPLC analysis in human MCF-10A and mouse GE11 cells. In contrast with GnT-III, the expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V was slightly enhanced by TGF-β1 treatment. Changes in the N-glycan patterns on α3β1 integrin, one of the target proteins for GnT-III, were also confirmed by lectin blot analysis. To understand the roles of GnT-III expression in EMT-like changes, the MCF-10A cell was stably transfected with GnT-III. It is of particular interest that overexpression of GnT-III influenced EMT-like changes induced by TGF-β1, which was confirmed by cell morphological changes of phase contrast, immunochemical staining patterns of E-cadherin, and actin. In addition, GnT-III modified E-cadherin, which served to prolong E-cadherin turnover on the cell surface examined by biotinylation and pulse-chase experiments. GnT-III expression consistently inhibited β-catenin translocation from cell-cell contact into the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, the transwell assay showed that GnT-III expression suppressed TGF-β1-induced cell motility.

https://openalex.org/W1964344178,"Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells that reside in osseous tissues and resorb bone. Signaling mediated by receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (RANK) and its ligand leads to the nuclear factor of activated T cells 2/c1 (NFAT2 or NFATc1) expression, a critical step in the formation of functional osteoclasts. In addition, adaptor proteins harboring immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, such as DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12), play essential roles. In this study, we identified the gene encoding the lectin Siglec-15 as NFAT2-inducible, and we found that the protein product links RANK ligand-RANK-NFAT2 and DAP12 signaling in mouse osteoclasts. Both the recognition of sialylated glycans by the Siglec-15 V-set domain and the association with DAP12 through its Lys-272 are essential for its function. When Siglec-15 expression was knocked down, fewer multinucleated cells developed, and those that did were morphologically contracted with disordered actin-ring structures. These changes were accompanied by significantly reduced bone resorption. Siglec-15 formed complexes with Syk through DAP12 in response to vitronectin. Furthermore, chimeric molecules consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of Siglec-15 with a K272A mutation and the cytoplasmic region of DAP12 significantly restored bone resorption in cells with knocked down Siglec-15 expression. Together, these results suggested that the Siglec-15-DAP12-Syk-signaling cascade plays a critical role in functional osteoclast formation."
https://openalex.org/W2053575361,"α-L-fucosyl residues attached at the non-reducing ends of glycoconjugates constitute histo-blood group antigens Lewis (Le) and ABO and play fundamental roles in various biological processes. Therefore, establishing a method for synthesizing the antigens is important for functional glycomics studies. However, regiospecific synthesis of glycosyl linkages, especially α-L-fucosyl linkages, is quite difficult to control both by chemists and enzymologists. Here, we generated an α-L-fucosynthase that specifically introduces Le(a) and Le(x) antigens into the type-1 and type-2 chains, respectively; i.e. the enzyme specifically accepts the disaccharide structures (Galβ1-3/4GlcNAc) at the non-reducing ends and attaches a Fuc residue via an α-(1,4/3)-linkage to the GlcNAc. X-ray crystallographic studies revealed the structural basis of this strict regio- and acceptor specificity, which includes the induced fit movement of the catalytically important residues, and the difference between the active site structures of 1,3-1,4-α-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.111) and α-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) in glycoside hydrolase family 29. The glycosynthase developed in this study should serve as a potentially powerful tool to specifically introduce the Le(a/x) epitopes onto labile glycoconjugates including glycoproteins. Mining glycosidases with strict specificity may represent the most efficient route to the specific synthesis of glycosidic bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2094412032,"Adaptive response to hypoxia in nucleus pulposus cells of the intervertebral disc is regulated by the hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Moreover, oxygen-dependent turnover of HIF-1α in these cells is controlled by the prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) family of proteins. Whether HIF homologues control expression of PHDs and whether PHDs control hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) turnover and/or activity under hypoxia is not known. Here, we show that in nucleus pulposus cells, hypoxia robustly induces PHD3 expression and, to a lesser extent, of PHD2 and PHD1. Reporter analysis shows that the hypoxic induction of the PHD2 promoter is HIF-1α dependent, whereas PHD3 promoter/enhancer activity is dependent on both HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Lentiviral delivery of HIF-1α, ShHIF-1α, and ShHIF-1β confirmed these observations. Noteworthy, HIF-1α maintains basal expression of PHD1 in hypoxia at the posttranscriptional level. Finally, loss of function studies using lentiviral transduction of ShPHDs clearly shows that even at 1% O2, PHD2 selectively degrades HIF-1α. In contrast, in hypoxia, PHD3 enhances HIF-1α transcriptional activity without affecting protein levels. To correlate these observations with disc disease, a condition characterized by tissue vascularization, we analyzed human tissues. Increased PHD1 mRNA expression but decreased PHD2 and PHD3 expression is observed in degenerate tissues. Interestingly, the hypoxic responsiveness of all the PHDs is maintained in isolated nucleus pulposus cells regardless of the disease state.

The annulus fibrosus and the cartilagenous end plates enclose a central aggrecan-rich gel-like tissue, the nucleus pulposus, that is sparsely populated with cells. These cells are removed from the systemic circulation. Thus, blood vessels originating in the vertebral body penetrate the superficial region of the endplates. None of these vessels infiltrate the nucleus pulposus. With respect to the annulus, Gruber et al. (3.Gruber H.E. Ashraf N. Kilburn J. Williams C. Norton H.J. Gordon B.E. Hanley E.N.

Recent evidence suggests that HIF-1α and HIF-2α are not redundant and that the relative importance of each of the homologues, in response to hypoxia, varies among different cell types (13.Sowter H.M.

We reported recently that expression of PHD1–3 is higher in cells of the nucleus pulposus than in cells of the annulus fibrosus and that PHD2 controls degradation of HIF-1α in an oxygen-dependent manner (23.Fujita N.

One of the major objectives of this study is to determine whether PHD expression is dependent on oxemic tension and whether regulation is HIF-1α- and/or HIF-2α-dependent in cells of the nucleus pulposus. We show that in nucleus pulposus cells, PHD2 is selectively regulated by HIF-1α, whereas PHD3 is regulated by both the HIF-1α and HIF-2α at the transcript level. Noteworthy, unlike other tissues, hypoxic expression of PHD1 is also dependent on HIF-1α activity. Finally, for the first time, we demonstrate that PHD2 selectively promotes HIF-1α degradation, even under hypoxia. On the other hand, in hypoxia, PHD3 enhances HIF-1 transcriptional activity. Thus, both PHD2 and PHD3 form a regulatory feedback loop with HIF-1 in nucleus pulposus cells, suggesting that they may serve as the oxygen sensors in the nucleus pulposus.

The lentiviral CA-HIF-1α vector, GFP control vector, and TAT expression plasmid were provided by Dr. Karen Westerman, Harvard Medical School. The lentiviral ShHIF-1β construct and control vector were from Dr. John Basile, University of Maryland, MD. Lentiviral ShHIF-1α was from Dr. Andree Yeramian, University of Lleida, Spain. As an internal transfection control, vector pRL-TK (Promega) containing the Renilla reniformis luciferase gene was used. HEK293T cells were provided by Dr. Aviva Symes, and TC28 chondrocytes were from Dr. Mary Goldring. The amount of transfected plasmid, the pretransfection period after seeding, and the posttransfection period before harvesting have been optimized for rat nucleus pulposus cells using the pSV β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega) (11.Agrawal A.

Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C621-C631Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Rat and human nucleus pulposus cells were isolated using a method reported earlier by Risbud et al. (9.Rajpurohit R. Risbud M.V. Ducheyne P. Vresilovic E.J. Shapiro I.M. Phenotypic characteristics of the nucleus pulposus. Expression of hypoxia inducing factor-1, glucose transporter-1 and MMP-2.Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 308: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Nucleus pulposus, HEK293T, and TC28 cells were maintained in DMEM and 10% FBS supplemented with antibiotics. Cells were cultured in a hypoxia workstation (In vivo2 300, Ruskinn, UK) with a mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 for 8–72 h. Cells were transferred to 48-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well one day before transfection. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used as a transfection reagent. For each transfection, plasmids were premixed with the transfection reagent. For measuring the effect of hypoxia on PHD2 or PHD3 reporter activity 24 h after transfection, the cells in some wells were moved to the hypoxia workstation. The next day, the cells were harvested, and a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was used for sequential measurements of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Quantification of luciferase activities and calculation of relative ratios were carried out using a luminometer (TD-20/20, Turner Designs, CA). Total RNA was extracted from rat nucleus pulposus cells using RNAeasy mini columns (Qiagen). Before elution from the column, RNA was treated with RNase free DNase I (Qiagen). The purified, DNA-free RNA was converted to cDNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reactions were set up in triplicate in a 96-well plate using 1 μl of cDNA with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) to which gene-specific forward and reverse PCR primers were added (see supplemental Table 1, synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). PCR reactions were performed in a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. β-actin was used to normalize. Melting curves were analyzed to verify the specificity of the RT-PCR reaction and the absence of primer dimer formation. Amplification efficiencies of the PHD primer sets were determined by generating individual standard curves and were found to be similar (94–96% efficient). Cells were plated in flat-bottom 96-well plates (5 × 103/well) for 24 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, blocked with PBS containing 5% FBS, and incubated with antibodies against PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3 (1:200) (Novus) at 4 °C overnight. As a negative control, cells were reacted with isotype IgG under similar conditions. After washing, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated appropriate secondary antibody (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:50 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview, Japan). Cells were placed on ice immediately and washed with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were prepared using the CellLytic NuCLEAR extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich). All wash buffers and the final resuspension buffer included 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce), NaF (5 mm), and Na3VO4 (200 μm). Proteins were resolved on 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 3% nonfat dry milk in TBST with the anti-HIF-1α or anti-HIF-2α (1:1000, R&D Systems), HIF-1β (1:1000, BD Biosciences), anti-PHD1, or anti-PHD3 antibody (1:1000, Novus); anti-PHD2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-β-tubulin (1:3000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and anti-Lamin A/C (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology). Immunolabeling was detected using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Relative expression levels were determined by quantitative densitometric analysis using one-dimensional image analysis software (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). HEK 293T cells were seeded in 10-cm plates (60 × 106 cells/plate) in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS one day before transfection. Cells were transfected with 9 μg of ShHIF-1α, ShPHD2, and ShPHD3 plasmids, along with 6 μg of psPAX2 and 3 μg of pMD2G using Lipofectamine 2000. CA-HIF-1α and shHIF-1β were used following a method reported earlier (25.Sun Q. Zhou H. Binmadi N.O. Basile J.R.

After 16 h, transfection media were removed and replaced with DMEM with 5% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. Lentiviral particles were harvested at 48 and 60 h post-transfection. Nucleus pulposus cells were plated in DMEM with 5% heat-inactivated FBS one day before transduction. Cells in 10-cm plates were transduced with 5 ml of conditioned media containing viral particles along with 6 μg/ml polybrene. After 24 h, conditioned media was removed and replaced with DMEM with 5% heat-inactivated FBS. Cells were harvested for protein extraction 5 days after viral transduction. A transduction efficiency of 80–90% was achieved as determined from the number of GFP/YFP-positive cells. Lumbar disc tissues were collected as surgical waste from individuals undergoing elective spinal surgical procedures. In line with the Institutional Review Board guidelines of Thomas Jefferson University, informed consent for sample collection was obtained from each patient. Assessment of the disease state was performed using Pfirrmann grading (27.Tian Y.M. Mole D.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Gleadle J.M. Characterization of different isoforms of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase PHD1 generated by alternative initiation.Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 179-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All measurements were performed in triplicate. Data is presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by Student's t test and one way analysis of variance (*, p < 0.05). Real-time RT-PCR analysis shows that PHD2 is the most abundant isoform in nucleus pulposus cells (Fig. 1A). To evaluate whether the expression of PHD1–3 is regulated by hypoxia, we measured their expression in the nucleus pulposus cells under normoxic and hypoxic condition with real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Although mRNA expression of PHD1 showed an increase only at 72 h of hypoxia, PHD3 and, to a lesser extent, PHD2 are significantly up-regulated by 24 h (Fig. 1, B–D). Remarkably, the induction of PHD3 mRNA expression is about 50-fold at 72 h in hypoxia. Western blot analysis and subsequent densitometric analysis confirmed that protein expression is influenced by hypoxia. Thus, the protein level of PHD3 exhibits the most striking hypoxic induction as early as 8 h (Fig. 1, E and H). Although the PHD2 protein level is induced significantly at 24 h (Fig. 1, E–H), an increase in PHD1 is not evident until 72 h (Fig. 1, E and F). We next studied the cellular localization of PHDs in nucleus pulposus cells under normoxia and hypoxia. Immunofluorescence studies indicate that PHD1 is mainly localized to the nucleus, whereas, depending on the pO2, PHD2 and PHD3 are present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Next, using Western blot analysis, we evaluated the expression of PHDs in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of nucleus pulposus cells following 72 h of culture under normoxia or hypoxia. Fig. 2B shows that, in agreement with a previous report, two splice variants of PHD1 are present in the nuclear fraction, whereas only the low molecular weight (40-kDa) variant is detected in the cytoplasm (27.Tian Y.M. Mole D.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Gleadle J.M. Characterization of different isoforms of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase PHD1 generated by alternative initiation.Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 179-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Noteworthy, only the 40-kDa band evidenced hypoxic induction (Fig. 2, B and C). Fig. 2, B and D, shows that PHD2 is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. In hypoxia, there is an increased level of PHD2 in the cytoplasmic fraction. In contrast, PHD3 levels are higher in the nucleus than the cytoplasm. The level in both compartments is robustly induced by hypoxia (Fig. 2, B and E). We further evaluated the relationship between PHD2 transcription and oxygen tension by measuring the activity of the PHD2 promoter under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Also, to evaluate the role of HIF in oxemic regulation of promoter activity, a mutation in the hypoxia responsive element (HRE) is introduced (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows that in nucleus pulposus cells, wild-type promoter activity is significantly induced under hypoxic conditions, whereas the HRE mutation completely abolishes this induction. To evaluate the role of HIF-α homologues in transcriptional regulation, loss and gain of function studies were performed. When HIF-1α expression was suppressed using siRNA, the hypoxic induction of PHD2 promoter activity was abolished completely (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, HIF-2α siRNA has no effect on hypoxic induction of PHD2 promoter activity (Fig. 3D). Similarly, when HIF-1α was cotransfected, wild-type promoter activity is significantly induced, whereas the mutant promoter is unaffected (Fig. 3E). In contrast, overexpression of HIF-2α does not affect either wild-type or mutant promoter activities (Fig. 3F). To study regulation of PHD3 transcription by hypoxia in nucleus pulposus cells, we measured the activity of the PHD3 promoter and/or enhancer. We used 3.5-kb (P3P3.5) and a 1.5-kb (P3P1.5) promoter fragments of PHD3 that contained either two or no HRE sites and an enhancer region of PHD3 (P3A-WT) 12 kb upstream of the transcription site containing a single HRE (19.Pescador N. Cuevas Y. Naranjo S. Alcaide M. Villar D. Landázuri M.O. Del Peso L. Identification of a functional hypoxia-responsive element that regulates the expression of the EGL nine homologue 3 (egln3/phd3) gene.Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A reporter containing both the promoter and enhancer as well as a reporter with mutant HRE enhancer (P3A-MT, P3PA-MT) were also used in the analysis (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows that the promoter activity of P3P3.5 with two putative HREs is induced by hypoxia. There is no change in activation of the P3P1.5 with no putative HRE. Fig. 4C shows that the activity of PHD3 enhancer (P3A-WT) is significantly up-regulated and that this induction is abolished by mutation of single HRE. Furthermore, when we measured the activity of PHD3 promoter in combination with a wild-type or a mutant enhancer (P3PA-WT or P3PA-MT), we found that P3PA-WT activity is significantly induced by hypoxia. In contrast, P3PA-MT is not affected by the low pO2 (Fig. 4D). Next, we evaluated the role of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in the transcriptional regulation of PHD3 expression by performing loss and gain-of-function analysis with the wild-type and mutant PHD3 promoter/enhancer. Fig. 5, A and B, shows that the hypoxic induction of P3PA-WT reporter activity is significantly suppressed by HIF-1α and HIF-2α siRNA in nucleus pulposus cells. On the other hand, the activity of P3PA-WT was significantly induced by cotransfection of both HIF-1α (Fig. 5C) and HIF-2α (D) in a dose-dependent manner. Again, P3PA-MT is unaffected by both the HIF-α homologues (Fig. 5, C and D). To determine whether PHD2 and PHD3 regulation by HIF is cell-type specific, we measured the reporter activities in 293T cells and T/C28 chondrocytes. Supplemental Fig. S1, A and B shows that, similar to nucleus pulposus cells, in both cell types, PHD2 reporter activity is induced by cotransfection of HIF-1α but not HIF-2α, whereas PHD3 reporter activity is up-regulated by both the HIF-α homologues. Moreover, silencing of HIF-2α resulted in suppression of PHD3 but not PHD2 promoter activity in 293T cells under hypoxia (Supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). To measure the effect of stable overexpression of HIF-1α on PHD protein levels, we transduced nucleus pulposus cells with lentivirus expressing CA-HIF-1α. By assessment of GFP-positive cells, we confirmed that the transduction efficiency is more than 80% (Fig. 6A). Real-time RT-PCR analysis shows that mRNA expression of PHD2 and PHD3 but not PHD1 is significantly induced in the cells transduced by LV-CAHIF-1α compared with LV-GFP (Fig. 6B). As expected, Western blot analysis confirms that there is an increased level of HIF-1α protein expression in the transduced cells (Fig. 6C). Moreover, we found that although the HIF-1α-transduced cells show increased PHD2 and PHD3 expression, no change in PHD1 expression in normoxia is seen. Densitometry analysis confirmed that the increase in PHD2 and PHD3"

As a member of S100 proteins, the role of S100A14 in carcinogenesis has not been fully understood. Here, we showed that ectopic overexpression of S100A14 promotes motility and invasiveness of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. We investigated the underlying mechanisms and found that the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 is obviously increased after S100A14 gene overexpression. Inhibition of MMP2 by a specific MMP2 inhibitor at least partly reversed the invasive phenotype of cells overexpressing S100A14. By serendipity, we found that S100A14 could affect p53 transactivity and stability. Thus, we further investigated whether the effect of MMP2 by S100A14 is dependent on p53. A series of biochemical assays showed that S100A14 requires functional p53 to affect MMP2 transcription, and p53 potently transrepresses the expression of MMP2. Finally, RT-quantitative PCR analysis of human breast cancer specimens showed a significant correlation between S100A14 mRNA expression and MMP2 mRNA expression in cases with wild-type p53 but not in cases with mutant p53. Collectively, our data strongly suggest that S100A14 promotes cell motility and invasiveness by regulating the expression and function of MMP2 in a p53-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1979519334,"Objective Assessing the feasibility and efficiency of interventions using ultrasound (US) volume navigation (V Nav) with real time needle tracking and image fusion with contrast enhanced (ce) CT, MRI or US. Methods First an in vitro study on a liver phantom with CT data image fusion was performed, involving the puncture of a 10 mm lesion in a depth of 5 cm performed by 15 examiners with US guided freehand technique vs. V Nav for the purpose of time optimization. Then 23 patients underwent ultrasound-navigated biopsies or interventions using V Nav image fusion of live ultrasound with ceCT, ceMRI or CEUS, which were acquired before the intervention. A CEUS data set was acquired in all patients. Image fusion was established for CEUS and CT or CEUS and MRI using anatomical landmarks in the area of the targeted lesion. The definition of a virtual biopsy line with navigational axes targeting the lesion was achieved by the usage of sterile trocar with a magnetic sensor embedded in its distal tip employing a dedicated navigation software for real time needle tracking. Results The in vitro study showed significantly less time needed for the simulated interventions in all examiners when V Nav was used (p<0.05). In the study involving patients, in all 10 biopsies of suspect lesions of the liver a histological confirmation was achieved. We also used V Nav for a breast biopsy (intraductal carcinoma), for a biopsy of the abdominal wall (metastasis of ovarial carcinoma) and for radiofrequency ablations (4 ablations). In 8 cases of inflammatory abdominal lesions 9 percutaneous drainages were successfully inserted. Conclusion Percutaneous biopsies and drainages, even of small lesions involving complex access pathways, can be accomplished with a high success rate by using 3D real time image fusion together with real time needle tracking."
https://openalex.org/W2041745935,"Agents that activate cannabinoid receptor pathways have been tested as treatments for cachexia, nausea or neuropathic pain in HIV-1/AIDS patients. The cannabinoid receptors (CB(1)R and CB(2)R) and the HIV-1 co-receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, all signal via Gαi-coupled pathways. We hypothesized that drugs targeting cannabinoid receptors modulate chemokine co-receptor function and regulate HIV-1 infectivity. We found that agonism of CB(2)R, but not CB(1)R, reduced infection in primary CD4+ T cells following cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission of CXCR4-tropic virus. As this change in viral permissiveness was most pronounced in unstimulated T cells, we investigated the effect of CB(2)R agonism on to CXCR4-induced signaling following binding of chemokine or virus to the co-receptor. We found that CB(2)R agonism decreased CXCR4-activation mediated G-protein activity and MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, CB(2)R agonism altered the cytoskeletal architecture of resting CD4+ T cells by decreasing F-actin levels. Our findings suggest that CB(2)R activation in CD4+ T cells can inhibit actin reorganization and impair productive infection following cell-free or cell-associated viral acquisition of CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 in resting cells. Therefore, the clinical use of CB(2)R agonists in the treatment of AIDS symptoms may also exert beneficial adjunctive antiviral effects against CXCR4-tropic viruses in late stages of HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2148496054,"The small GTPase Ral is known to be highly activated in several human cancers, such as bladder, colon and pancreas cancers. It is reported that activated Ral is involved in cell proliferation, migration and metastasis of bladder cancer. This protein is activated by Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs) and inactivated by Ral GTPase-activating proteins (RalGAPs), the latter of which consist of heterodimers containing a catalytic α1 or α2 subunit and a common β subunit. In Ras-driven cancers, such as pancreas and colon cancers, constitutively active Ras mutant activates Ral through interaction with RalGEFs, which contain the Ras association domain. However, little is known with regard to the mechanism that governs aberrant activation of Ral in bladder cancer, in which Ras mutations are relatively infrequent. Here, we show that Ral was highly activated in invasive bladder cancer cells due to reduced expression of RalGAPα2, the dominant catalytic subunit in bladder, rather than increased expression of RalGEFs. Exogenous expression of wild-type RalGAPα2 in KU7 bladder cancer cells with invasive phenotype, but not mutant RalGAPα2-N1742K lacking RalGAP activity, resulted in attenuated cell migration in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Ralgapa2 promoted tumor invasion in a chemically-induced murine bladder cancer model. Importantly, immunohistochemical analysis of human bladder cancer specimens revealed that lower expression of RalGAPα2 was associated with advanced clinical stage and poor survival of patients. Collectively, these results are highly indicative that attenuated expression of RalGAPα2 leads to disease progression of bladder cancer through enhancement of Ral activity."
https://openalex.org/W2058058850,"A copper-sensitive operon repressor protein (CsoR) has been identified in Streptomyces lividans (CsoRSl) and found to regulate copper homeostasis with attomolar affinity for Cu(I). Solution studies reveal apo- and CuI-CsoRSl to be a tetramer assembly, and a 1.7-Å resolution crystal structure of apo-CsoRSl reveals that a significant conformational change is necessary to enable Cu(I) binding. In silico prediction of the CsoR regulon was confirmed in vitro (EMSA) and in vivo (RNA-seq), which highlighted that next to the csoR gene itself, the regulon consists of two Cu(I) efflux systems involving a CopZ-like copper metallochaperone protein and a CopA P1-type ATPase. Although deletion of csoR has only minor effects on S. lividans development when grown under high copper concentrations, mutations of the Cu(I) ligands decrease tolerance to copper as a result of the Cu(I)-CsoR mutants failing to disengage from the DNA targets, thus inhibiting the derepression of the regulon. RNA-seq experiments carried out on samples incubated with exogenous copper and a ΔcsoR strain showed that the set of genes responding to copper stress is much wider than anticipated and largely extends beyond genes targeted by CsoR.

For many bacterial organisms, maintaining cellular metal ion homeostasis is an essential requirement for viability. Sophisticated cellular machinery has evolved and consists of an extensive network of specialized proteins and transporters that respond to either metal ion deprivation or overload (1.Ma Z.

Copper is an essential transition metal ion in biology and is required by many proteins and enzymes that function in electron-transfer chemistry and in the catalytic oxidation of substrates. The ability of copper to donate or accept single electrons is also detrimental as “free” cellular copper ions are complicit in a Fenton-like reaction, catalyzing the production of damaging hydroxyl radicals (4.Robinson N.J. Winge D.R. Copper metallochaperones.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 537-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). This deleterious behavior leads to bacteria avoiding copper toxicity through buffering copper in the cytosol very tightly (2.Waldron K.J. Robinson N.J.

Once the buffering capacity for cytosolic copper is exceeded, this is sensed by transcriptional regulatory proteins termed copper sensors that trigger the expression of genes encoding for efflux systems such as copper-exporting P1-type ATPases and copper metallochaperones that act in tandem to return the cytosol to a buffered copper state (3.Waldron K.J.

The filamentous Gram-positive soil-dwelling bacterium Streptomyces is important to both ecological and human welfare and is also one of the model systems for bacterial morphological and physiological development. The morphological differentiation of Streptomyces has three characteristic development stages as follows: 1) formation of branched vegetative mycelium, 2) formation of aerial hyphae, and 3) the production of spores. Concomitant or just before the morphological switch from vegetative to aerial mycelium, the metabolic development is initiated by the production of secondary metabolites. These compounds comprise a large percentage of the clinically useful antibiotics, anti-fungals, and even some of the anti-tumor agents used to date. The bioavailability of copper ions has been shown to be of crucial importance for morphological development in certain streptomycetes (8.Ueda K. Tomaru Y. Endoh K. Beppu T.

Copper dependence is restricted to the reproductive growth phase (aerial mycelium and spores), whereas vegetative growth proceeds under strongly copper -limiting conditions. Evidence from genetic knock-out studies has suggested that secreted cuproproteins or cuproenzymes are needed for the development switch from vegetative to aerial mycelium to occur, but their identification and role in the development switch have not so far been elucidated (10.Worrall J.A.

A metabolic requirement for copper in the bacterial cytosol has not yet been documented; however, in vitro biochemical evidence indicates that this cytosolic tyrosinase-like enzyme (MelD2) is active in the oxidation of mono- and di-phenols (13.Yang H.Y.

The cytosol of Streptomyces coelicolor also contains proteins putatively involved in copper detoxification systems (10.Worrall J.A. Vijgenboom E. Copper mining in Streptomyces. Enzymes, natural products, and development.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27: 742-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two operons have been identified that contain genes encoding for a CopZ-like copper metallochaperone and a CopA-like P1-type ATPase transporter. In certain bacteria, the copA and copZ resistance genes are transcriptionally regulated by a copper sensor protein belonging to the copper-sensitive operon regulator (CsoR) 3The abbreviations used are: CsoRcopper-sensitive operon repressorAASatomic absorption spectroscopyMMminimal agar mediumBCSbathocuproine disulfonateBCAbicinchoninic acidAUCanalytical ultracentrifugation. family (7.Liu T.

Copper mining in Streptomyces. Enzymes, natural products, and development.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27: 742-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the genomic environment of SCO4136 does not contain any known copper resistance genes and instead is located among genes encoding for proteins involved in phosphate transport (10.Worrall J.A. Vijgenboom E. Copper mining in Streptomyces. Enzymes, natural products, and development.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27: 742-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).

The founding member of the CsoR family was discovered in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (CsoRMtb) (7.Liu T. Ramesh A. Ma Z. Ward S.K. Zhang L. George G.N. Talaat A.M. Sacchettini J.C. Giedroc D.P. CsoR is a novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis copper-sensing transcriptional regulator.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Under elevated copper levels, the expression of CsoRMtb was found to be strongly induced, with the binding of Cu(I) triggering the derepression of the rv0967–rv0970 operon in which rv0969 encodes for a P1-type ATPase involved in copper transport and rv0967 for CsoRMtb (7.Liu T.

Examples of CsoR proteins that transcriptionally regulate copZA copper resistance operons have been identified and characterized to varying degrees in Bacillus subtilis (15.Smaldone G.T. Helmann J.D.

Furthermore, a recent report has identified a CsoR member that is not thought to be involved in copper homeostasis but instead appears to function in response to sulfur stress (17.Grossoehme N.

To understand the role copper plays in morphological differentiation and development, it is necessary to understand how cellular copper is handled under normal and elevated conditions. S. coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans both display a distinct dependence on copper for development with that of S. lividans being more pronounced (18.Vijgenboom E.K.B.J.F. Copper and the Morphological Development of Streptomyces, Handbook of Copper Pharmacology and Toxicology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 503-525Google Scholar). They also share a high level of sequence identity and genome organization (19.Jayapal K.P. Lian W. Glod F. Sherman D.H. Hu W.S.

Metabolic and evolutionary insights into the closely related species Streptomyces coelicolor Streptomyces lividans deduced from high resolution comparative genomic hybridization.BMC Genomics. 2010; 11: 682Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the gene numbering of the S. coelicolor genome database is used for S. lividans in this study. Sequence alignment of the S. lividans 4136 gene product with known CsoR orthologues reveals conservation of the amino acids that act as Cu(I)-binding ligands and two amino acids considered important for the Cu(I)-dependent allosteric regulation of DNA binding (Fig. 1). In this study, we have biochemically and structurally characterized the S. lividans 4136 gene product and find it to be a tetrameric CuI-CsoR (CsoRSl). In vivo studies with a genetic knock-out (ΔcsoR) and CsoRSl mutants indicate CsoRSl to be essential for the response of S. lividans to elevated copper levels. Furthermore, we have coupled bioinformatics and RNA-seq experiments to characterize the regulon under the direct control of CsoRSl. RNA-seq data suggest that the regulation of copper homeostasis is much more extensive than only the genes repressed by CsoRSl. The Streptomyces strains used are as follows: S. lividans 1326 (S. lividans 66, stock number 1326 John Innes Collection), S. lividans ΔcsoR (this study), and S. coelicolor A3(2) strain M512 (21.Floriano B. Bibb M. afsR is a pleiotropic but conditionally required regulatory gene for antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The agar media soy flower mannitol, complex medium (R5), minimal agar medium (MM), the liquid complex medium tryptic soy broth with 10% sucrose, and the liquid defined medium NMMP were prepared according to Ref. 22.Kieser T.B. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 1-613Google Scholar. If required, glucose and/or mannitol were added to 0.5%. Agar plates were incubated at 30 °C, and liquid cultures were grown in 250-ml baffled flasks with 0.2-μm vent caps (Corning Glass) with shaking at 160 rpm. Liquid cultures were inoculated with spores to a final concentration of 2 × 107 spores/ml. Spore stocks were obtained from cultures grown on soy flower mannitol plates and stored in 20% glycerol at −20 °C. Growth was recorded by determining the dry biomass from 1.5-ml samples collected in pre-dried Eppendorf tubes, and mycelium was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. After 12–16 h at 105 °C, the dry weight was determined using an analytical balance. The 4136 gene encoding for CsoRSl was deleted in S. lividans 1326 in a two-step process using the CRE-lox system (23.Fedoryshyn M. Welle E. Bechthold A. Luzhetskyy A. Functional expression of the Cre recombinase in actinomycetes.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). First, the gene (nt +4 to 399) was replaced by homologous recombination with an apramycin resistance cassette flanked by loxP sites. For this purpose, the upstream flanking region of SL4136 (−1370 to +3) and the downstream flanking region (+399 to 1680) were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR, including EcoRI, XbaI, XbaI, and HindIII sites, respectively, for cloning purposes. These two fragments and the apramycin resistance cassette flanked by loxP sites were cloned in the delivery vector pWHM3 that is unstable in Streptomyces (24.Vara J. Lewandowska-Skarbek M. Wang Y.G. Donadio S. Hutchinson C.R. Cloning of genes governing the deoxysugar portion of the erythromycin biosynthesis pathway in Saccharopolyspora erythraea (Streptomyces erythreus).J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5872-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Following protoplast transformation, recombinants that were apramycin-resistant but had lost the vector (thiostrepton resistance) were isolated. Second, an unstable plasmid encoding the Cre recombinase was introduced (23.Fedoryshyn M. Welle E. Bechthold A. Luzhetskyy A. Functional expression of the Cre recombinase in actinomycetes.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 78: 1065-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and allowed for the excision of the apramycin resistance cassette on the lox sites. The resulting strain, ΔcsoR, has no coding sequence for CsoRSl and has only a 61-nt “scar,” including two XbaI sites left in the genome. The ΔcsoR strain was analyzed by PCR to confirm the loss of 4136, the apramycin resistance cassette, and vector sequences. Total RNA was isolated with Kirby mix according to standard procedures from mycelium in early log phase grown on NMMP supplemented with 0.5% glucose and mannitol (22.Kieser T.B. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 1-613Google Scholar). Cultures were induced with 400 μm Cu(II) for 2 h followed by total RNA isolation. RNA integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the absence of genomic DNA was checked by PCR. For the removal of ribosomal RNA, an Ambion kit was used. Samples were sent to BaseClear, an independent and accredited service laboratory for DNA-based research, and transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq was carried out. The sequences obtained on an Illumina sequencer were filtered for noncoding RNAs and analyzed with CLCbio bioinformatics software packages using the annotated S. coelicolor genome as reference. Expression values were expressed as reads/kb of exon model/million mapped reads (25.Mortazavi A. Williams B.A. McCue K. Schaeffer L. Wold B. Mapping and quantifying mammalian transcriptomes by RNA-Seq.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (9843) Google Scholar), i.e. dividing the total number of exon reads (in this case one exon per reference sequence) by the number of mapped reads (in Millions) times the exon length (in this case the length of the reference sequence). The DNA sequence (−300 to +3) upstream of SL4136 was obtained from genomic DNA by PCR introducing a flanking EcoRI and BamHI site to facilitate cloning in pIJ2585 digested with the same enzymes (26.van Wezel G.P.

Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 551-556PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, p4136-I, was introduced in strain M512 by protoplast transformation. cultures were grown in triplicate in NMMP medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose, 0.5% mannitol, and 50 μg/ml apramycin. Strain M512 transformed with the empty vector was grown under the same conditions to obtain background readings. Following extraction of mycelium with methanol, the concentration of undecylprodigiosin was quantified from the absorbance at 530 nm and the extinction coefficient of 100,500 liters/mol−1 cm−1 (27.Tsao S.W. Rudd B.A. He X.G. Chang C.J. Floss H.G. Identification of a red pigment from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) as a mixture of prodigiosin derivatives.J. Antibiot. 1985; 38: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The wild type, S. lividans 1326, and the mutant strain ΔcsoR were each transformed with pIJ703 (plasmid harboring the Streptomyces antibioticus melC operon under control of its own promoter). Four independent transformants of each strain were grown in liquid tryptic soy broth with 10% sucrose medium supplemented with 25 μm Cu(II). Tyrosinase activity was determined in spent medium with 10 mm 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, as substrate (28.Lerch K. Ettlinger L. Purification and properties of a tyrosinase from Streptomyces glaucescens.Pathol. Microbiol. 1972; 38: 23-25PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was visualized with N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine as substrate, essentially according to Refs. 29.Green G.N. Gennis R.B.

The 4136 gene was cloned from S. lividans 1326 genomic DNA (supplemental “Materials and Methods”) and overexpressed in Escherichia coli using a pET28a (Kanr) vector (Novagen). This construct, designated pET4136, was transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and single colonies were transferred to 2× YT medium (Melford) with kanamycin (50 μg/liter) (Melford) at 37 °C. Overexpression of the N-terminal His-tagged CsoRSl was induced by 1 m isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Melford) to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the temperature was decreased to 25 °C for overnight incubation. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 500 mm NaCl (Fisher) and 20 mm imidazole (Sigma) at pH 7.5 (Buffer A). The resuspended cell suspension was lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 cell disrupter (Avestin) followed by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A and eluted by a linear imidazole gradient using Buffer B (Buffer A with 500 mm imidazole). A single peak at ∼30% Buffer B was eluted from the column, and fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (Melford), and 4 mm EDTA (Sigma) (Buffer C). Following dialysis, the N-terminal His tag was removed by incubating the protein at room temperature overnight with 125 units of thrombin (Sigma). The protein/thrombin mixture was reapplied to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and the flow-through was collected and concentrated using a Centricon (VivaSpin) with a 5-kDa cutoff at 4 °C for application to a G-75 Sephadex column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer C. Fractions eluting from the major peak of the G-75 column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those deemed of good purity were concentrated and stored at −20 °C until required. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) was used to create the C75A and H100A mutants of CsoRSl. Forward and reverse primers were designed with the respective nucleotide change(s) to create the desired mutation (supplemental “Materials and Methods”), and the pET4136 plasmid was used as template. The respective mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression in S. lividans, the wild type and mutant CsoRSl open reading frames (ORF) were cloned under control of the 4136 promoter and the constitutive ermE promoter. For this purpose, the 4136 promoter region was obtained by PCR from S. lividans 1326 genomic DNA introducing an NdeI site on the ATG start codon of the ORF, and the ermE promoter was obtained from plasmid pHM10a (31.Motamedi H. Shafiee A. Cai S.J. Integrative vectors for heterologous gene expression in Streptomyces spp.Gene. 1995; 160: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The wild type, C75A, and the H100A ORFs were cloned downstream of the promoters in the low copy vector pHJL401 (32.Larson J.L. Hershberger C.L. The minimal replicon of a streptomycete plasmid produces an ultrahigh level of plasmid DNA.Plasmid. 1986; 15: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A Varian Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer and an Applied Photophysics Chirascan circular dichroism (CD) spectrophotometer (Leatherhead, UK) both equipped with a thermostatic cell holder controlled with a Peltier system were routinely used. An extinction coefficient (ϵ) at 280 nm of 3105 m−1 cm−1 was calculated for the CsoRSl monomer. This value was used throughout to determine the concentration of apo-CsoRSl samples. Far-UV CD spectra at 20 °C with 20 μm CsoRSl in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm potassium fluoride, pH 7.0, were acquired in the range 260 to 190 nm. CsoRSl samples for mass spectrometry were diluted 1:20 with a 50% methanol and 1% formic acid solution. Spectra were acquired on a Micomass Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole instrument using the following experimental parameters: capillary voltage 1.7 kV, cone voltage 80–120 V, and cone gas 100 liter/h. Acquisition and processing were carried out using MassLynx software (Waters, Manchester, UK). Metal content was determined with a Unicam 939/959 atomic absorption graphite furnace spectrometer. Apo-CsoRSl samples for experiments with Cu(I) were prepared in an anaerobic chamber (DW Scientific [O2] <2 ppm) by first incubating for 2–3 h with 2 mm DTT followed by desalting using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with either 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, or 10 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl. Free thiol content was determined by the reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) monitored at 412 nm (ϵ = 13,500 m−1 cm−1) (33.Ellman G.L. Tissue sulfhydryl groups.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21365) Google Scholar). Cu(I)Cl (Sigma) was dissolved under anaerobic conditions in 10 mm HCl and 500 mm NaCl and diluted with either MES or MOPS buffer. Cu(I) concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by stepwise addition using a gastight syringe (Hamilton) to a known concentration of the Cu(I)-specific bidentate chelator bicinchoninic acid (BCA) using an extinction coefficient at 562 nm of ϵ = 7900 m−1 cm−1 for [CuI(BCA)2]3 (34.Xiao Z.

Apo-CsoRSl proteins (30–50 μm) were sealed in an anaerobic quartz cuvette (Hellma), and the absorbance change at 240 nm was monitored upon titrating in the Cu(I) solution. Competition assays were set up anaerobically with either BCA or bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) (Sigma). Increasing protein concentrations (0–90 μm) were added to solutions of [CuIL2]3− of defined molar ratio L:Cu(I) ≥3 (to ensure the presence of the 1:2 complex [CuIL2]3− with negligible contribution from the 1:1 complex [CuIL2]−) creating a series of individual solutions with constant [CuI] and [L] and varying [apo-CsoRSl].

In this study, it was verified that PI3K played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity. Suppression of PI3K activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination. And then, the signal cascades that PI3K promoted the ROS liberation was also evaluated. Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, suppressed most of ROS generation in rice seed germination, which suggested that NADPH oxidase was the main source of ROS in this process. Pharmacological experiment and RT-PCR demonstrated that PI3K promoted the expression of Os rboh9. Moreover, functional analysis by native PAGE and the measurement of the 2, 3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazo-lium-5- carboxanilide (XTT) formazan concentration both showed that PI3K promoted the activity of NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, the western blot analysis of OsRac-1 demonstrated that the translocation of Rac-1 from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, which was known as a key factor in the assembly of NADPH oxidase, was suppressed by treatment with PI3K inhibitors, resulting in the decreased activity of NADPH oxidase. Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that PI3K regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination."
https://openalex.org/W2077581746,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), an integral component of caveolar membrane domains, is expressed in several retinal cell types, including photoreceptors, retinal vascular endothelial cells, Müller glia, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. Recent evidence links Cav-1 to ocular diseases, including autoimmune uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, and primary open angle glaucoma, but its role in normal vision is largely undetermined. In this report, we show that ablation of Cav-1 results in reduced inner and outer retinal function as measured, in vivo, by electroretinography and manganese-enhanced MRI. Somewhat surprisingly, dark current and light sensitivity were normal in individual rods (recorded with suction electrode methods) from Cav-1 knock-out (KO) mice. Although photoreceptor function was largely normal, in vitro, the apparent K(+) affinity of the RPE-expressed α1-Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase was decreased in Cav-1 KO mice. Cav-1 KO retinas also displayed unusually tight adhesion with the RPE, which could be resolved by brief treatment with hyperosmotic medium, suggesting alterations in outer retinal fluid homeostasis. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that reduced retinal function resulting from Cav-1 ablation is not photoreceptor-intrinsic but rather involves impaired subretinal and/or RPE ion/fluid homeostasis."

The channel was reported to play an important role in Ca(2+) homeostasis, but its gating mechanisms, functions, and regulation are still under research. Utilizing biophysical and biochemical methods, we characterized two independent domains, Ala-35-Lys-124 and His-291-Gly-382, on the TRPM3 N terminus, responsible for interactions with the Ca(2+)-binding proteins calmodulin (CaM) and S100A1. We identified several positively charged residues within these domains as having a crucial impact on CaM/S100A1 binding. The data also suggest that the interaction is calcium-dependent. We also performed competition assays, which suggested that CaM and S100A1 are able to compete for the same binding sites within the TRPM3 N terminus. This is the first time that such an interaction has been shown for TRP family members."

A model for HA degradation that invokes the activity of both hyaluronidases and exoglycosidases has been advanced.

Herein, we used mouse models to investigate the contributions of the endoglycosidase HYAL1 and the exoglycosidase β-hexosaminidase to the lysosomal degradation of HA. We employed histochemistry and fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis to determine the degree of HA accumulation in mice deficient in one or both enzyme activities. Global HA accumulation was present in mice deficient in both enzymes, with the highest levels found in the lymph node and liver. Chondroitin, a GAG similar in structure to HA, also broadly accumulated in mice deficient in both enzymes. Accumulation of chondroitin sulfate derivatives was detected in mice deficient in both enzymes, as well as in β-hexosaminidase-deficient mice, indicating that both enzymes play a significant role in chondroitin sulfate breakdown. Extensive accumulation of HA and chondroitin when both enzymes are lacking was not observed in mice deficient in only one of these enzymes, suggesting that HYAL1 and β-hexosaminidase are functionally redundant in HA and chondroitin breakdown. Furthermore, accumulation of sulfated chondroitin in tissues provides in vivo evidence that both HYAL1 and β-hexosaminidase cleave chondroitin sulfate, but it is a preferred substrate for β-hexosaminidase.

https://openalex.org/W2057365749,"Background During mouse inner ear development, Notch1 signaling first specifies sensory progenitors, and subsequently controls progenitors to further differentiate into either hair cells (HCs) or supporting cells (SCs). Overactivation of NICD (Notch1 intracellular domain) at early embryonic stages leads to ectopic HC formation. However, it remains unclear whether such an effect can be elicited at later embryonic or postnatal stages, which has important implications in mouse HC regeneration by reactivation of Notch1 signaling. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed comprehensive in vivo inducible overactivation of NICD at various developmental stages. In CAGCreER+; Rosa26-NICDloxp/+ mice, tamoxifen treatment at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) generated ectopic HCs in the non-sensory regions in both utricle and cochlea, whereas ectopic HCs only appeared in the utricle when tamoxifen was given at E13. When tamoxifen was injected at postnatal day 0 (P0) and P1, no ectopic HCs were observed in either utricle or cochlea. Interestingly, Notch1 signaling induced new HCs in a non-cell-autonomous manner, because the new HCs did not express NICD. Adjacent to the new HCs were cells expressing the SC marker Sox10 (either NICD+ or NICD-negative). Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate that the developmental stage determines responsiveness of embryonic otic precursors and neonatal non-sensory epithelial cells to NICD overactivation, and that Notch 1 signaling in the wild type, postnatal inner ear is not sufficient for generating new HCs. Thus, our genetic mouse model is suitable to test additional pathways that could synergistically interact with Notch1 pathway to produce HCs at postnatal ages."
https://openalex.org/W2013584765,"Although few organ systems play a more important role than the kidneys in cytokine catabolism, the mechanism(s) regulating this pivotal physiological function and how its deficiency affects systemic cytokine homeostasis remain unclear. Here we show that elimination of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) expression from mouse kidneys caused a marked elevation of circulating IFN-γ, IL1α, TNF-α, IL6, CXCL1, and IL13. Accompanying this were enlarged spleens with prominent white-pulp macrophage infiltration. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exacerbated the increase of serum cytokines without a corresponding increase in their urinary excretion in THP knock-out (KO) mice. This, along with the rise of serum cystatin C and the reduced inulin and creatinine clearance from the circulation, suggested that diminished glomerular filtration may contribute to reduced cytokine clearance in THP KO mice both at the baseline and under stress. Unlike wild-type mice where renal and urinary cytokines formed specific in vivo complexes with THP, this ""trapping"" effect was absent in THP KO mice, thus explaining why cytokine signaling pathways were activated in renal epithelial cells in such mice. Our study provides new evidence implicating an important role of THP in influencing cytokine clearance and acting as a decoy receptor for urinary cytokines. Based on these and other data, we present a unifying model that underscores the role of THP as a major regulator of renal and systemic immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2096904076,"Decreases in cardiac Na/K-ATPase have been documented in patients with heart failure. Reduction of Na/K-ATPase α1 also contributes to the deficiency in cardiac contractility in animal models. Our previous studies demonstrate that reduction of cellular Na/K-ATPase causes cell growth inhibition and cell death in renal proximal tubule cells. To test whether reduction of Na/K-ATPase in combination with increased cardiotonic steroids causes cardiac myocyte death and cardiac dysfunction, we examined heart function in Na/K-ATPase α1 heterozygote knock-out mice (α1(+/-)) in comparison to wild type (WT) littermates after infusion of marinobufagenin (MBG). Adult cardiac myocytes were also isolated from both WT and α1(+/-) mice for in vitro experiments. The results demonstrated that MBG infusion increased myocyte apoptosis and induced significant left ventricle dilation in α1(+/-) mice but not in their WT littermates. Mechanistically, it was found that in WT myocytes MBG activated the Src/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which further increased phosphorylation of ribosome S6 kinase (S6K) and BAD (Bcl-2-associated death promoter) and protected cells from apoptosis. In α1(+/-) myocytes, the basal level of phospho-BAD is higher compared with WT myocytes, but MBG failed to induce further activation of the mTOR pathway. Reduction of Na/K-ATPase also caused the activation of caspase 9 but not caspase 8 in these cells. Using cultures of neonatal cardiac myocytes, we demonstrated that inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapamycin also enabled MBG to activate caspase 9 and induce myocyte apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2058267856,"B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated antigen (Ag) processing and presentation lead to B cell-T cell interactions, which support affinity maturation and immunoglobulin class switching. These interactions are supported by generation of peptide-MHC class II complexes in multivesicular body-like MIIC compartments of B cells. Previous studies have shown that trafficking of Ag·BCR complexes to MVB-like MIIC occurs via an ubiquitin-dependent pathway and that ubiquitination of Ag·BCR complexes occurs by an Src family kinase signaling-dependent mechanism that is restricted to lipid raft-resident Ag·BCR complexes. This study establishes that downstream Syk-dependent BCR signaling is also required for BCR ubiquitination and BCR-mediated antigen processing and presentation. Knockdown studies reveal that of the two known Syk-binding E3 ubiquitin ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b, only c-Cbl appears to have a central role in BCR ubiquitination, trafficking to MIIC, and ubiquitin-dependent BCR-mediated antigen processing and presentation. These results establish the novel role for Syk signaling and the Syk-binding ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl in the BCR-mediated processing and presentation of cognate antigen and define one mechanism by which antigen-induced BCR ubiquitination is modulated to impact the initiation and maturation of the humoral immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2114690891,"The oncogenic kinase PAK4 was recently found to be involved in the regulation of the G1 phase and the G2/M transition of the cell cycle. We have also identified that PAK4 regulates Ran GTPase activity during mitosis. Here, we show that after entering mitosis, PAK4-depleted cells maintain a prolonged metaphase-like state. In these cells, chromosome congression to the metaphase plate occurs with normal kinetics but is followed by an extended period during which membrane blebbing and spindle rotation are observed. These bipolar PAK4-depleted metaphase-like spindles have a defective astral microtubule (MT) network and are not centered in the cell but are in close contact with the cell cortex. As the metaphase-like state persists, centrosome fragmentation occurs, chromosomes scatter from the metaphase plate and move toward the spindle poles with an active spindle assembly checkpoint, a phenotype that is reminiscent of cohesion fatigue. PAK4 also regulates the acto-myosin cytoskeleton and we report that PAK4 depletion results in the induction of cortical membrane blebbing during prometaphase arrest. However, we show that membrane blebs, which are strongly enriched in phospho-cofilin, are not responsible for the poor anchoring of the spindle. As PAK4 depletion interferes with the localization of components of the dynein/dynactin complexes at the kinetochores and on the astral MTs, we propose that loss of PAK4 could induce a change in the activities of motor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1989585910,"B-1 lymphocytes are the predominant cells in mouse peritoneal cavity. They express macrophage and lymphocyte markers and are divided into B-1a, B-1b and B-1c subtypes. The role of B-1 cells is not completely clear, but they are responsible for natural IgM production and seem to play a regulatory role. An enriched B-1b cell population can be obtained from non-adherent peritoneal cell cultures, and we have previously demonstrated that these cells undergo differentiation to acquire a mononuclear phagocyte phenotype upon attachment to the substrate in vitro. Nevertheless, the B-1 cell response to antigens or adjuvants has been poorly investigated. Because killed Propionibacterium acnes exhibits immunomodulatory effects on both macrophages and B-2 lymphocytes, we analyzed whether a killed bacterial suspension or its soluble polysaccharide (PS) could modulate the absolute number of peritoneal B-1 cells in BALB/c mice, the activation status of these cells and their ability to differentiate into phagocytes in vitro. In vivo, P. acnes treatment elevated the absolute number of all B-1 subsets, whereas PS only increased B-1c. Moreover, the bacterium increased the number of B-1b cells that were positive for MHC II, TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-12, in addition to up-regulating TLR9, CD80 and CD86 expression. PS increased B-1b cell expression of TLR4, TLR9, CD40 and CD86, as well as IL-10 and IL-12 synthesis. Both of the treatments decreased the absolute number of B-1b cells in vitro, suggesting their early differentiation into B-1 cell-derived phagocytes (B-1CDP). We also observed a higher phagocytic activity from the phagocytes that were derived from B-1b cells after P. acnes and PS treatment. The adjuvant effect that P. acnes has on B-1 cells, mainly the B-1b subtype, reinforces the importance of B-1 cells in the innate and adaptive immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2010885105,"The invasion of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Here, we identify an E3 ligase, Traf6 and a de-ubiquitinating enzyme, Cezanne/ZA20D1, as important regulators of this process in organotypic models. Traf6 can promote the formation of Cdc42-dependent F-actin microspikes. Furthermore, Traf6 has a key role in autocrine interleukin-1β signalling in SCC cells, which in turn is required to drive the expression of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα). TNFα acts in a paracrine manner to increase the invasion-promoting potential of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Exogenous TNFα signalling can restore invasion in cells depleted of Traf6. In conclusion, Traf6 has two important roles in SCC invasion: it promotes cell intrinsic Cdc42-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and enables production of the paracrine signal, TNFα, that enhances the activity of CAFs."

In the present study, human liver cancer cell line HepG2, having high intracellular antioxidant levels was chosen for stable overexpression of HABP1. The stable transformant of HepG2, overexpressing HABP1 does not lead to ROS generation, cellular stress, and apoptosis, rather it induced enhanced cell growth and proliferation over longer periods. Phenotypic changes in the stable transformant were associated with the increased “HA pool,” formation of the “HA cable” structure, up-regulation of HA synthase-2, and CD44, a receptor for HA. Enhanced cell survival was further supported by activation of MAP kinase and AKT-mediated cell survival pathways, which leads to an increase in CYCLIN D1 promoter activity. Compared with its parent counterpart HepG2, the stable transformant showed enhanced tumorigenicity as evident by its sustained growth in low serum conditions, formation of the HA cable structure, increased anchorage-independent growth, and cell-cell adhesion. This study suggests that overexpression of HABP1 in HepG2 cells leads to enhanced cell survival and tumorigenicity by activating HA-mediated cell survival pathways.

HA forms part of the ECM by linking HA-binding proteins, “hyaladherins” into the cell matrix network, thereby regulating their behavior like cell adhesion, motility, proliferation, and differentiation (1Toole B.P.

Our laboratory has identified one such hyaladherin, hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1), from rat liver using HA-affinity column chromatography (2D'Souza M. Datta K. Evidence for naturally occurring hyaluronic acid binding protein in rat liver.Biochem. Int. 1985; 10: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). HABP1 is a conserved eukaryotic protein ubiquitously present from yeast to mammals. HABP1, a highly acidic protein with pI 4.5, has a native molecular mass of 68 kDa, generating subunits of 34 kDa on SDS-PAGE (3Gupta S. Datta K. Possible role of hyaluronectin on cell adhesion in rat histiocytoma.Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence of HABP1 shows complete identity with p32, a protein co-purified with the human pre-mRNA splicing factor SF2 and gC1qR, a receptor for the globular head of complement subcomponent 1q (4Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Functional expression of cloned human splicing factor SF2.

Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The gene encoding HABP1 (accession number AF275902) was mapped at chromosome 17p12-p13 by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (7Majumdar M. Datta K. Assignment of cDNA encoding hyaluronic acid-binding protein 1 to human chromosome 17p12-p13.Genomics. 1998; 51: 476-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of HABP1 encodes a proprotein of 282 amino acid residues, which after post-translational cleavage of the first 73 amino acids generates the mature protein of 209 amino acid residues (8Honoré B. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. Leffers H. Cloning and expression of a cDNA covering the complete coding region of the P32 subunit of human pre-mRNA splicing factor SF2.Gene. 1993; 134: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mature protein has a predicted molecular mass of 23.7 kDa from its amino acid sequence but migrates ambiguously at 34 kDa on denaturing gels due to the high ratio of polar to hydrophobic amino acid residues. The crystal structure of HABP1 shows it to be a trimer having a doughnut shaped quaternary structure with an asymmetric charge distribution along its surface that attributes to its functional diversity (9Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Crystal structure of human p32, a doughnut-shaped acidic mitochondrial matrix protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). HABP1 also exhibits structural flexibility influenced by the ionic environment, which plays an important role in its binding toward different ligands (10Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. Structural flexibility of multifunctional HABP1 may be important for regulating its binding to different ligands.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27464-27472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HABP1 has been detected in a number of cellular compartments including the mitochondria, nucleus, and cytoplasm and cell surface where it is shown to interact with many different cellular proteins (11van Leeuwen H.C. O'Hare P. Retargeting of the mitochondrial protein p32/gC1Qr to a cytoplasmic compartment and the cell surface.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2115-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diverse subcellular localization of HABP1, coupled to its various interacting proteins suggest that it could be a component of the trafficking pathway connecting the nucleus, mitochondria, and cytoplasm and the export pathway to the cell surface (11van Leeuwen H.C. O'Hare P. Retargeting of the mitochondrial protein p32/gC1Qr to a cytoplasmic compartment and the cell surface.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2115-2123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HABP1 is highly phosphorylated in transformed fibroblasts and is shown as an endogenous substrate for MAP kinase, which translocates to the nucleus upon mitogenic stimulation (12Majumdar M. Meenakshi J. Goswami S.K. Datta K. Hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1)/C1QBP/p32 is an endogenous substrate for MAP kinase and is translocated to the nucleus upon mitogenic stimulation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of HABP1 in the parent fibroblast cell line has been shown to inhibit cell growth, formation of vacuoles, and induction of apoptosis at 60 h in the absence of media replacement (13Meenakshi J. Anupama Goswami S.K. Datta K. Constitutive expression of hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1/p32/gC1qR) in normal fibroblast cells perturbs its growth characteristics and induces apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Transient expression of HABP1 and its N and C terminus truncated variants in COS-1 cells were found to induce autophagic vacuoles and disruption of the F-actin network indicating a stress condition (14Sengupta A. Tyagi R.K. Datta K. Truncated variants of hyaluronan-binding protein 1 bind hyaluronan and induce identical morphological aberrations in COS-1 cells.Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon constitutive overexpression of HABP1 in fibroblast cell line F111, HABP1 gets accumulated in the mitochondria, which leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis (15Chowdhury A.R. Ghosh I. Datta K. Excessive reactive oxygen species induces apoptosis in fibroblasts. Role of mitochondrially accumulated hyaluronic acid binding protein 1 (HABP1/p32/gC1qR).Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 651-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These observations indicate an important role of HABP1 in cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis induction mediated by excess ROS generation. In view of the existing literature, in the present study, we have chosen an alternative human liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2), which displays high levels of important protective enzymes such as Mn-superoxide dismutase and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, as well as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and thioredoxin reductase (16Murakami C. Hirakawa Y. Inui H. Nakano Y. Yoshida H. Effects of epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate on cellular antioxidative system in HepG2 cells.J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 2002; 48: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as a model system to examine the function of HABP1. Furthermore, to substantiate our data, we have analyzed the HA level, cell survival pathways, and tumor inducing potency of HABP1 in this distinct cellular model system that is constitutively overexpressing HABP1. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, and all antibiotics were from Invitrogen. Primary and secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Sigma, and Cell Signaling Technologies. All chemicals were procured from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. Antibody to HABP1/p32/gC1qR was generated in our laboratory as previously described (5Deb T.B. Datta K.

Plasmid having a Myc-tagged full-length HABP1, pHVL 22, was a gift from Dr. Peter O'Hare (Marie Curie Research Institute Surrey, UK) and has been previously described (12Majumdar M. Meenakshi J. Goswami S.K. Datta K. Hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1)/C1QBP/p32 is an endogenous substrate for MAP kinase and is translocated to the nucleus upon mitogenic stimulation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CYCLIN D1-luciferase reporter construct was provided by Dr. Edith Wang (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). CYCLIN B1-Luciferase reporter construct (hB1-Luci) was a gift from Dr. Kurt Engeland (University of Leipzig, Germany). The dominant-negative AKT construct was a kind gift from Prof. S. Dimmeler (University of Frankfurt, Germany), the CDC25-Luciferase construct was a kind gift from Dr. Guilia Piaggio (Institute Regina Elena, Italy). All cell lines were cultured and maintained in DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml of penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin, and 50 μg/ml of fungizone in tissue culture flasks or dishes. The culture was grown in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transient and stable transfections in cell lines were done using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were collected 40 h post-transfection and processed for lysate preparation for immunoblotting or for immunofluorescence. The cell proliferation assay was done using a CellTiter96 Nonradioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. The protein samples electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted on either nitrocellulose membrane or PVDF by applying a current of 0.8 mA/h in a semi-dry transfer unit or wet-transfer unit. Following transfer the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with the desired primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The PVDF membrane was then washed three times with TBST (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h with 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The bound antibody complexes were detected using the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate system or enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. Cells were grown on coverslips for 24 h in a CO2 incubator and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min. The cells were washed thoroughly with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with primary antibody in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibody. The secondary antibodies used were tagged either with Cy3 (Sigma) or Alexa Fluor 488 and 546 (Molecular Probes). Hoechst 33342 was co-incubated with the secondary antibody to facilitate visualization of the nucleus. Cells were again washed with PBS three times, 5 min each, and mounted in 20% glycerol in PBS. The imaging was done under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with an epifluorescence and Axiocam camera system coupled with axiovision software (Carl Zeiss, Germany) or a Nikon 90i microscope (Nikon Instech Co. Ltd., Japan) using an Evolution QEi digital camera (Media Cybermatric). Cell surface biotinylation was done with Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid pHVL22 was linearized by overnight digestion with BglII restriction enzymes. The linearized plasmid was gel eluted and used for transfection of HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were transfected with HABP1 expression plasmid pHVL22 and pCDNA3.1myc/His (as vector control) and allowed to double once under nonselective conditions. Both plasmids carry the neomycin resistance gene. Later, the cells were supplemented with the complete medium containing 400 μg/ml of geneticin and medium was replaced every third day. After 2 weeks of a selection period individual colonies were isolated and further propagated under selective conditions. Individual clones were screened for the stable expression of HABP1 by indirect immunodetection and Western blotting analysis using anti-HABP1 and anti-Myc antibodies. The cells were grown overnight on coverslips and then washed twice with PBS and fixed with chilled methanol for 15 min followed by staining with hematoxylin-eosin as described earlier (14Sengupta A. Tyagi R.K. Datta K. Truncated variants of hyaluronan-binding protein 1 bind hyaluronan and induce identical morphological aberrations in COS-1 cells.Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For viewing the cells, coverslips were mounted in glycerol, sealed with nail enamel, and observed under phase-contrast microscope (Nikon) fitted with Nikon FX-35W camera. Cells growing on culture dishes were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for a minimum of 4 h to overnight. After washing, cells were again fixed for 2 h in 1% osmium tetraoxide in phosphate buffer at 4 °C. After several washes with PBS, the cells were dehydrated in graded acetone solutions and embedded in CY212 araldite resin. Ultra-thin sections of 60–80-nm thickness were generated using Ultracut E Ultramicrotome and the sections were stained with alcoholic uranyl acetate and lead citrate for appropriate time intervals. The grids were then examined with Transmission Electron Microscope (Morgagni 268 Model, Philips) operated at 80 kV. 1% Agarose was melted and mixed with an equal volume of 2× DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum to get 0.5% agarose in 10% FBS/DMEM. 1.5 ml of this 0.5% agarose in FBS/DMEM was poured in each 35-mm dish as base agar. The dishes were left at room temperature to allow the base agar to solidify. For the top agar, 0.7% agarose was melted and cooled to 40 °C before mixing with 2× DMEM as higher temperatures could lead to cell death. Between procedures the cells were trypsinized and counted. The cell count was adjusted to 2 × 105 cells/ml. For plating, 0.1 ml of cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/ml) was added to 6 ml of DMEM/agarose at 40 °C. 1.5 ml of this was added to each quadruplet plate. The assay plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for 10–14 days. The plates were then stained with 0.5 ml of 0.005% crystal violet for about 3–4 h and the colonies were counted using a dissecting microscope. Intracellular H2O2 production was detected by fluorescence of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (H2DCFDA) (10 μm) incubated under various conditions for 10 min in the dark as previously reported (15Chowdhury A.R. Ghosh I. Datta K. Excessive reactive oxygen species induces apoptosis in fibroblasts. Role of mitochondrially accumulated hyaluronic acid binding protein 1 (HABP1/p32/gC1qR).Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 651-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were counted and 1 × 106 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of cold sulfosalicylic acid, prepared in MQ water containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were kept on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and used for the assay. 50 μl of the sample was mixed with 1 ml of PBS containing 20 μg of NADPH, 60 μg of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), and 1 unit of glutathione reductase. The reaction rate was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 412 nm in a spectrophotometer. The concentration of glutathione in the samples was calculated from the standard curve made of different dilutions of glutathione. Flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning) were coated overnight with 5 mg/ml of HA. 40 μg/ml of BSA was used as a negative control. Cells were counted and 2 × 105 cells in serum-free medium (SFM) were added to each well in triplicates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in CO2 incubator for 60 min. The nonadherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. The adherent cells were fixed by treating with 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min and stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet for 25 min. The cells were washed and solubilized overnight in 1% Triton X-100. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm and the results were corrected by subtraction of the background staining of the underlying matrix. The cells cultured on sterile coverslips were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and washed with 0.1 m glycine for 5 min to quench excess aldehyde. Cells were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 1 min and the excess detergent was washed off with PBS. Following permeabilization, the cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin along with Hoechst for 30 min. After incubation the cells were rinsed with PBS several times and mounted in 15% glycerol in PBS. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like method was adapted as reported earlier (17Kongtawelert P. Ghosh P. A method for the quantitation of hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) in biological fluids using a labeled avidin-biotin technique.Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to measure HA concentrations in the medium of the cultured cells and in cell lysates. Briefly, flat-bottom 96-well tissue culture plates were pre-coated with 0.1 mg/ml of HA (in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 9.6) by overnight incubation. The next day, excess coating solution was removed and the plate was dried with warm air to ensure the adhesion of HA to the wells. Blocking was done for 1 h at RT using 100 μl of 1% BSA in PBS. The plates were then washed with PBS-T and dried with warm air. The samples and HA standards were diluted with 6% BSA in PBS and preincubated at RT for 1 h with an equal volume of 0.05 μg/ml of biotinylated HA-binding protein (Seikagaku) in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.6). 100 μl of samples and standards at multiple dilutions and blanks were added in triplicates to the wells and incubated at RT for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times with PBS-T and dried. 100 μl of streptavidin AP antibody (diluted 1:3,000 in PBS) was added to each well followed by a 1-h incubation at RT. The wells were washed 3 times with PBS-T and dried. For color development, 200 μl of 1 mg/ml of p-nitrophenyl phosphate solution (in 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 9.3), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) was added to the wells. The plates were incubated in the dark for 30 min or until a yellow color appears. The absorbance was taken in an ELISA Reader (BD Biosciences) at 405 nm. The concentration of HA in the samples was calculated against a standard curve of HA. HA purification was carried out using a procedure described earlier (18Bhilocha S. Amin R. Pandya M. Yuan H. Tank M. LoBello J. Shytuhina A. Wang W. Wisniewski H.G. de la Motte C. Cowman M.K. Agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis methods for molecular mass analysis of 5- to 500-kDa hyaluronan.Anal. Biochem. 2011; 417: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An equal number of HepG2 and HepR21 cells were seeded in culture dishes and allowed to grow for 48 h after which the media was removed and the monolayer washed gently with PBS. Subsequently, the cells were treated with 200 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0), containing 250 μg/ml of proteinase K, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm cysteine. After 10 min of incubation, the cells were scraped and collected into microcentrifuge tubes followed by incubation for 5 h at 60 °C. Proteinase K was inactivated by incubation in a boiling water bath for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Supernatant was collected and treated with 4 volumes of 1% cetylpyridinium chloride in 20 mm NaCl for 1 h at room temperature, and the centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min. After discarding the supernatant, the precipitate was washed with 1 ml of water, centrifuged again, and dissolved in 50 μl of 4 m guanidine-HCl. Furthermore, 900 μl of ethanol was added and the tube was kept at −20 °C for 1 h after which each sample was centrifuged and the precipitate was retained and dissolved in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.7). Hyaluronan digestion was carried out using 50 μg/ml of bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH) for 3 h at 37 °C. Equal volumes of both undigested and BTH-digested products derived from two cell lines were loaded onto a 5–20% gradient gel (19Tammi R. MacCallum D. Hascall V.C. Pienimäki J.P. Hyttinen M. Tammi M.

The gel was then stained with 1% Alcian blue in 3% acetic acid, destained, and subsequently stained with silver nitrate (19Tammi R. MacCallum D. Hascall V.C. Pienimäki J.P. Hyttinen M. Tammi M.

Cells were transfected with different promoter-reporter constructs and harvested 24 h post-transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed in the lysates according to the kit protocol (Promega). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's guidelines and subjected to reverse transcription reaction for the first strand synthesis using MuLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) as the primer. The cDNA concentrations were normalized by amplification of a 323-bp GAPDH fragment (used as internal control) using a gene-specific GAPDH primer. The amplification conditions were chosen so that none of the RNAs analyzed reached a plateau at the end of the amplification protocol, i.e. they were in the exponential phase of amplification. Real-time PCR using gene-specific primers was used to quantitate the relative mRNA levels in parental HepG2 and HepR21 cells. The PCR was done in a final volume of 20 μl and consisted of SYBR Green, 2 μl of cDNA, and 100 nm of each forward and reverse primer, PCR amplification was done by denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Thermocycling and fluorescence measurements were done in Mastercycler, Realplex (Eppendorf). Relative quantitation was done by parentizing threshold cycle (Ct) values of each sample gene with Ct values of GAPDH. ΔCt corresponds to the difference between the Ct of the genes of interest and the Ct of GAPDH. Data are presented as fold-change difference (derived by 2−ΔΔCt method) relative to HepG2. The sequence of primers used in the study are: HABP1 forward, 5′-ATCAACTCCCAATTTCGTGGTT-3′, HABP1 reverse, 5′-TCCTCTGGATAATGACAGTCCAA-3′; HYAL2 forward, 5′-GGCGCAGCTGGTGTCATC-3′, HYAL2 reverse, 5′-CCGTGTCAGGTAATCTTTGAGGTACT-3′; HYAL3 forward, 5′-GATCTGGGAGGTTCCTGTCC-3′, HYAL3 reverse, 5′-AGATGCCAGCACTCCTCCT-3′; HAS1 forward, 5′-TCTGTGACTCGGACACAAGGT-3′, HAS1 reverse, 5′-CTACCCAGTATCGCAGGCT-3′; HAS2 forward, 5′-TTCTTTATGTGACTCATCTGTCTCACCGG-3′, HAS2 reverse, 5′-ATTGTTGGCTACCAGTTTATCCAAACGG-3′; HAS3 forward, 5′-CGCAGCAACTTCCATGAGG-3′, HAS3 reverse, 5′ AGTCGCACACCTGGATGTAGT-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-CGAGATCCCTCCAAAATCAAG-3′, GAPDH reverse, 5′-GTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT-3′. Stable transfectants expressing HABP1, tagged at the C terminus with Myc were derived by G418 selection over a period of 3–4 weeks and confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting using anti-Myc and anti-HABP1 antibodies. During clone propagation frequent media change was not required, unlike reported for F111 (13Meenakshi J. Anupama Goswami S.K. Datta K. Constitutive expression of hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1/p32/gC1qR) in normal fibroblast cells perturbs its growth characteristics and induces apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two of the stable transfectants, named clones 6 and 21, showed the most appropriate expression for Myc-tagged HABP1. As the two clones were identical in morphology and growth kinetics, we chose clone 21 for further studies and referred to it as HepR21 hereafter. The clone expressing vector alone was named Hep-Vec. To confirm the expression of Myc-tagged HABP1 in HepR21, the lysates of HepG2 and HepR21 cells were prepared, and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Increased expression of HABP1 (2.6-fold) is evident in HepR21 cells as compared with the HepG2 cells when probed with anti-HABP1 antibody. As the full-length transfected HABP1 is Myc-tagged, on probing with anti-Myc antibody, a band at the HAPB1 position was seen in HepR21 but not in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A). The clone was confirmed by transfecting HepR21 cells with psil 570, a siRNA against HABP1 using Lipofectamine (which is reported to be a highly efficient transfection reagent for HepG2 cells). A decrease in the expression level of Myc-tagged HABP1 was seen in HepR21 cells as compared with mock transfected cells (Fig. 1B) confirming the enhanced expression of HABP1 in the clone due to genomic integration of full-length HABP1. mRNA quantification by real-time PCR also showed an ∼1200-fold increase in HABP1 mRNA levels in HepR21 cells as compared with the parent HepG2 (Fig. 1C). To explore the effect of overexpression of HABP1 on growth kinetics, HepG2, Hep-Vec, HepR21, and HepR6 cells were grown in complete medium and cell growth was monitored by performing a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay for cell proliferation at different time points. HepG2 and Hep-Vec cells had similar growth characteristics in complete media; whereas HepR21 and HepR6 cells had better survival rates (Fig. 1D) over long periods of growth without the change of media. In HepG2 cells, it was observed that cell growth reaches a plateau after 48 h and about 75% of cells die"

In this study, sequences of two mitochondrial genes (COI and cyt b) were determined to investigate the phylogeography and demography of Babina pleuraden, a pond frog endemic to southwestern China. A total of 262 individuals from 22 populations across the entire range of the species were collected. Our results indicate that B. pleuraden comprises five well-supported mitochondrial lineages roughly corresponding to five geographical areas. The phylogeographic structure of B. pleuraden has been shaped primarily by the unique regional responses of the Yunnan Plateau to the rapid uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau occurred c. 2.5 Mya (B phrase of Qingzang Movement) and climatic oscillation during middle Pleistocene (c. 0.64–0.36 Mya), rather than by the paleo-drainage systems. The present wide distribution of the species has resulted from recent population expansion (c. 0.053–0.025 Mya) from multiple refugia prior to the Last Glacial Maximum, corresponding to the scenario of “refugia within refugia”."

One of the fundamental challenges in the control of tuberculosis is therefore to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the onset of latency and/or reactivation. We have attempted to address this problem at the systems level by a combination of predicted functional protein∶protein interactions, integration of functional interactions with large scale gene expression studies, predicted transcription regulatory network and finally simulations with a Boolean model of the network. Initially a prediction for genome-wide protein functional linkages was obtained based on genome-context methods using a Support Vector Machine. This set of protein functional linkages along with gene expression data of the available models of latency was employed to identify proteins involved in mediating switch signals during dormancy. We show that genes that are up and down regulated during dormancy are not only coordinately regulated under dormancy-like conditions but also under a variety of other experimental conditions. Their synchronized regulation indicates that they form a tightly regulated gene cluster and might form a latency-regulon. Conservation of these genes across bacterial species suggests a unique evolutionary history that might be associated with M. tuberculosis dormancy. Finally, simulations with a Boolean model based on the regulatory network with logical relationships derived from gene expression data reveals a bistable switch suggesting alternating latent and actively growing states. Our analysis based on the interaction network therefore reveals a potential model of M. tuberculosis latency."
https://openalex.org/W2146835532,"We earlier established a model of a persistent viral CNS infection using two week old immunologically normal (genetically unmodified) mice and recombinant measles virus (MV). Using this model infection we investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as regulators of the immune response in the brain, and assessed whether the persistent CNS infection can be modulated by manipulation of Tregs in the periphery. CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs were expanded or depleted during the persistent phase of the CNS infection, and the consequences for the virus-specific immune response and the extent of persistent infection were analyzed. Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells predominantly recognising the H-2D(b)-presented viral hemagglutinin epitope MV-H(22-30) (RIVINREHL) were quantified in the brain by pentamer staining. Expansion of Tregs after intraperitoneal (i.p.) application of the superagonistic anti-CD28 antibody D665 inducing transient immunosuppression caused increased virus replication and spread in the CNS. In contrast, depletion of Tregs using diphtheria toxin (DT) in DEREG (depletion of regulatory T cells)-mice induced an increase of virus-specific CD8(+) effector T cells in the brain and caused a reduction of the persistent infection. These data indicate that manipulation of Tregs in the periphery can be utilized to regulate virus persistence in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2031999611,"Prophylactic administration of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) is known to confer protection against lethal sepsis caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei in the mouse model. The mechanisms whereby CpG regulates the innate immune response to provide protection against B. pseudomallei, however, are poorly characterized. In the present study, we demonstrate that intranasal treatment of mice with Class C CpG, results in recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils to the lung at 48 h post-treatment. Mice infected with B. pseudomallei 48 h post-CpG treatment had reduced organ bacterial load and significantly altered cytokine and chemokine profiles concomitant with protection as compared to control animals. CpG administration reduced the robust production of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood, lung and spleen, observed following infection of non-treated animals. Death of control animals coincided with the time of peak cytokine production (day 1-3), while a moderate; sustained cytokine production in CpG-treated animals was associated with survival. In general, CpG treatment resulted in diminished expression of cytokines and chemokines post-infection, though IL-12p40 was released in larger quantities in CpG treated animals. In contrast to CpG-treated animals, the lungs of infected control animals were infiltrated with leukocytes, especially neutrophils, and large numbers of necrotic lesions were observed in lung sections. Therapeutic treatment of B. pseudomallei-infected animals with CpG at 24 h post-infection did not impact survival compared to control animals. In summary, protection of CpG-treated animals was associated with recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils into the lungs prior to infection. These responses correspond with early control of bacterial growth, a dampened inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response, reduced lung pathology, and greatly increased survival. In contrast, a delay in recruitment of inflammatory cell populations, despite a robust production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, was associated with poorly controlled bacterial growth, severe lung pathology, and death of control animals."

The cellular pathways for digesting normal and expanded polyQ sequences in proteins have been the subjects of controversy. Because polyQ sequences are also found normally in a variety of proteins (e.g. TATA-binding proteins and CREB-binding proteins) that turn over without aggregating and causing disease, the cell must contain systems to degrade efficiently polyQ sequences. Presumably, the longer polyQ tracts may cause disease by exceeding the degradative capacity of these cellular systems. The two main proteolytic systems in mammalian cells are the autophagic/lysosomal system and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

A gene network regulating lysosomal biogenesis and function.Science. 2009; 325: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar) has been shown to accelerate the clearance of polyQ proteins and reduce their cell toxicity. Such activators of autophagy have even been proposed as a potential therapy for these neurodegenerative diseases (2.Rubinsztein D.C. The roles of intracellular protein-degradation pathways in neurodegeneration.Nature. 2006; 443: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). These findings all entail that lysosomal enzyme(s) may also have the capacity to degrade these polyQ tracts (17.Williams A. Jahreiss L. Sarkar S. Saiki S. Menzies F.M. Ravikumar B. Rubinsztein D.C. Aggregate-prone proteins are cleared from the cytosol by autophagy. Therapeutic implications.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2006; 76: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although these findings imply that the lysosomal enzymes (unlike proteasomes) are able to hydrolyze completely polyQ sequences, even ones in aggregates (14.Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z.

A gene network regulating lysosomal biogenesis and function.Science. 2009; 325: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar), this capacity has not been systematically studied, and the identity of the lysosomal proteases that can degrade polyQ sequences has not been previously investigated to our knowledge. Their identification would clarify the metabolism and mode of turnover of polyQ proteins, and if their levels limit the rates of polyQ protein clearance, then such enzymes might even be possible therapeutic targets. Lysosomes contain a large variety of enzymes, including many nucleases, lipases, and proteases that can catalyze the complete degradation of cell constituents and engulfed viruses or bacteria. Lysosomal proteases (generally referred to as cathepsins) are acid-optimal enzymes and include both exopeptidases (e.g. the aminopeptidase cathepsin H and the carboxypeptidases cathepsins A and Z) and many endopeptidases, including many cysteine proteases (e.g. cathepsins B, C, F, H, K, L, V, S, and Z), some aspartic proteases (cathepsins D and E), the serine proteases (cathepsins A and G), and a few metalloproteases (18.Brix K. Lysosomal proteases. Revival of the Sleeping Beauty.in: Saftig P. Lysosomes. Springer, New York2005: 50-59Crossref Google Scholar). Most cathepsins are present in all mammalian tissues, whereas others show a specific tissue distribution that has proven important pharmacologically. For example, cathepsin K is especially abundant in osteoclasts, and cathepsin K inhibitors are therefore useful in treating osteoporosis (19.Vasiljeva O. Reinheckel T. Peters C. Turk D. Turk V. Turk B. Emerging roles of cysteine cathepsins in disease and their potential as drug targets.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In these studies, we investigated systematically whether lysosomal proteases can rapidly degrade polyQ proteins and then identified the critical cathepsins that catalyze this process. By using a combination of inhibitors as well as specific RNAi constructs and studies of the recombinant proteins, we found that two cysteine proteases, cathepsins L and Z, are the only lysosomal proteases capable of rapidly hydrolyzing polyQ sequences within peptides, multiple model polyQ proteins, and insoluble polyQ aggregates. These studies indicate that both the proteasomal and the lysosomal pathways involving cathepsins L and Z are implicated in the degradation of polyQ proteins. Moreover, these enzymes appear important in vivo in digesting such polyQ aggregates because depletion of either of these enzymes resulted in increased cell toxicity caused by proteins containing a long polyQ tract, but not a short polyQ sequence or by other aggregation-prone proteins lacking a polyQ repeat. The various polyQ peptides were a kind gift by Prof. Ron Wetzel and were disaggregated, stored, and used as described previously (10.Venkatraman P. Wetzel R. Tanaka M. Nukina N. Goldberg A.L.

The peptide library RYX19NKTL where X is an equimolar mixture of Ala, Asp, Glu, Phe, Gly, His, Ile, Lys, Leu, Met, Pro, Gln, Arg, Ser, Thr, and Val, was a gift from Prof. Frank Momberg. Fluorogenic substrates used for assaying peptidase activities were purchased from Bachem (Basel, Switzerland). The specific peptidase inhibitors leupeptin, bestatin, pefabloc, pepstatin, and E64 were purchased from Sigma, and bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) was a gift from Millenium. Recombinant human cathepsins L, Z, B, S, and H were purchased from R&D Systems. To prepare cytosolic extracts (41.Saric T. Graef C.I. Goldberg A.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 46723-46732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), HeLa cells or mammalian muscle or liver tissues were resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. Cell extracts were prepared by Dounce homogenization with 10 manual strokes on ice. This homogenate was spun first at a low speed of 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove the nuclear fraction and then at a higher speed of 100,000 × g to remove membranous organelles. The resulting supernatant fractions were aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Both the 10,000 × g and 100,000 × g supernatants were tested for cytosolic peptidases at pH 7 to ensure that there was no loss of relevant peptidases by the high speed centrifugation. To prepare the lysosomal extracts (20.Jonas A.J. Cystine transport in purified rat liver lysosomes.Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), fresh mice livers (WT or cathepsin L−/− mice) were homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA and then centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min to remove the nuclear pellet. Supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min to collect the “microsomal” and organelle pellet, which was resuspended, mixed with Percoll (maintaining 20 mm Tris, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.5), and centrifuged for 90 min at 40,000 × g to form a gradient. Lysosomes appeared as a dense band near the bottom of the Percoll gradient and were collected, washed several times to remove Percoll, and then sonicated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and cleared by low speed centrifugation. The resulting supernatant fractions were aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Each of the peptides (15 μm) or proteins (20 μm) was incubated with the respective lysate/enzyme in a 20 μl reaction at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, unless otherwise specified. N termini of new peptides, generated by enzyme digestion, interact with fluorescamine (22.Udenfriend S. Stein S. Böhlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Fluorescamine. A reagent for assay of amino acids, peptides, proteins, and primary amines in the picomole range.Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). After the incubation, 5 μl of each sample were mixed and rotated with 25 μl of fluorescamine solution in acetone (0.3 mg/ml) for 3 min and then diluted with 200 μl of 0.2 m sodium borate at pH 9. 200 μl of each sample were transferred to the 96-well plate and measured with the FLUOstar Galaxy plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Inc., Durham, NC) at an excitation of 380 nm and emission of 480 nm. An equimolar mixture of peptides of known concentration (EAA-NH2, AEAA-NH2, AAEAAG-NH2, AAVVAAG, and TTQRTRALV) was used as the standard to calculate the amount of new peptide products (i.e. new amino groups) generated. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Applied Biosytems Voyager 4036 at the Dana Farber Core Facility), using the linear mode of analysis to increase the sensitivity of detection, as described (10.Venkatraman P. Wetzel R. Tanaka M. Nukina N. Goldberg A.L. Eukaryotic proteasomes cannot digest polyglutamine sequences and release them during degradation of polyglutamine-containing proteins.Mol.

HeLa, HEK293A, NIH3T3, and N1E-115 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The Ub-R-GFP, Ub-R-GFP-Q16, and Ub-R-GFP-Q65 constructs were a kind gift of Prof. Dantuma and have been described previously (8.Verhoef L.G. Lindsten K. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. Aggregate formation inhibits proteasomal degradation of polyglutamine proteins.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2689-2700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Superfect (Invitrogen) and collected for analysis at the indicated times. For inhibitor treatment, HeLa cells were incubated for 16 h in medium containing PS-341 (10 μm), NH4Cl (15 mm), or E64 (100 μm), whereas HEK293A cells (transfected with plasmids for GFP-Htt74Q for 48–72h) were incubated for 24 h with calpastatin peptide (Calbiochem) (1 μm), cathepsin L inhibitor I (Calbiochem) (10 μm), E64 (10 μm), E64d (Sigma) (10 μm), or MDL-28170 (Sigma) (10 μm). Total cell lysates were prepared by sonication in 50 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT and the complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Soluble cell lysates were prepared by low speed centrifugation at 10,000 × g, separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12%), and analyzed by Western blotting. The following antibodies were used for Western blots: anti-myoglobin antibody (Sigma), anti-polyglutamine antibody (Chemicon), anti-actin antibody (Sigma), and anti-GFP antibody (Sigma). NIH3T3 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) for 48 h with plasmids encoding Htt74Q-mCherry (generated and described in Ref. 13.Menzies F.M. Hourez R. Imarisio S. Raspe M. Sadiq O. Chandraratna D. O'Kane C. Rock K.L. Reits E. Goldberg A.L. Rubinsztein D.C. Puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase protects against aggregation-prone proteins via autophagy.Hum. Mol.

N1E-115 cells were transfected with ExGen500 (Fermentas) for 48 h with the plasmids for Htt74Q-mCherry and RNAi, either control or against cathepsin L or Z. The plasmids for Htt23Q or 74Q fused to GFP were a kind gift from Dr. Ron Kopito (Stanford University), whereas the plasmid for SOD1G93A-GFP was obtained from Dr. Piera Pasinelli (Farber Institute for Neurosciences, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Expression plasmids for microRNA targeting cathepsin L or Z genes were created by annealing self-complementary oligonucleotides and cloning into the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector (BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi expression vector, Invitrogen). The oligonucleotides used were as follows: Mmi507307_top_CTPL, 5′-TGCTGAAATCCATCAGGCCTCCGTTAGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACTAACGGAGCTGATGGATTT-3′; Mmi507307_bot_CTPL,5′-CCTGAAATCCATCAGCTCCGTTAGTCAGTCAGTGGCCAAAACTAACGGAGGCCTGATGGATTTC-3′; Mmi558005_top_CTPZ, 5′-TGCTGTCACGATCCTCATCCAGCCTTGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACAAGGCTGGGAGGATCGTGA-3′;Mmi558005_bot_CTPZ, 5′-CCTGTCACGATCCTCCCAGCCTTGTCAGTCAGTGGCCAAAACAAGGCTGGATGAGGATCGTGAC-3′. pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-neg control plasmid (Invitrogen), containing an insert that forms a hairpin predicted not to target any known vertebrate gene, was used as a control. For toxicity assays, lactate dehydrogenase release was measured with the CytoTox 96 kit (Promega). Fluorescence images were collected at the Nikon Imaging Center at Harvard Medical School. Adult CD1 male mice (25–35 g) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (0.2 ml/10 g as 1.2% solution). Using a sterile technique, a 0.5–1.0 cm longitudinal incision was made in the skin overlying the tibialis anterior muscle, and the underlying muscle was exposed by blunt dissection of the surrounding skin. A paddle electrode was then introduced between the muscle and the underlying tibia. Plasmid DNA in sterile saline (40 μl, 25 μg) was injected into the muscle. A second paddle electrode was applied gently over the muscle, and electroporation was performed (12 V, 20-ms duration, 5 pulses, 200-ms intervals), using an ECM830 Electro Square Porator (BTX, Harvard Apparatus). The electrodes were removed, and the skin was closed by suture. Postoperative analgesia was administered every 12 h for the first 24 h with buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously). Additional analgesia was administered thereafter if there was any evidence of continued animal discomfort. The animals were followed for 1 week, after which time they were euthanized by halothane inhalation followed by cervical dislocation, and the muscles were harvested, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane, and stored at −80 °C. 10 μm muscle cryosections were analyzed for GFP/mCherry fluorescence after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and Hoechst staining (10 μg/ml in PBS for 10 min) using a Nikon 80i upright microscope at the Nikon Imaging Center at Harvard Medical School. No gross evidence of necrosis or inflammation as a result of the transfection procedure was noted. Inclusion size and number were analyzed with Metamorph using fixed size and intensity thresholds as described (13.Menzies F.M. Hourez R. Imarisio S. Raspe M. Sadiq O. Chandraratna D. O'Kane C. Rock K.L. Reits E. Goldberg A.L. Rubinsztein D.C. Puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase protects against aggregation-prone proteins via autophagy.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 4573-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A one-way analysis of variance test for multiple comparisons has been applied when distributions of number and size of inclusions were compared. Most data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made using analysis of variance. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Prior studies have established that cytosolic extracts of mammalian cells lack the ability to efficiently digest polyQ sequence (10.Venkatraman P. Wetzel R. Tanaka M. Nukina N. Goldberg A.L. Eukaryotic proteasomes cannot digest polyglutamine sequences and release them during degradation of polyglutamine-containing proteins.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In addition, there is increasing evidence that autophagy and thus lysosomal enzymes are important in the degradation of expanded polyQ-containing proteins (13.Menzies F.M. Hourez R. Imarisio S. Raspe M. Sadiq O. Chandraratna D. O'Kane C. Rock K.L. Reits E. Goldberg A.L. Rubinsztein D.C. Puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase protects against aggregation-prone proteins via autophagy.Hum. Mol.

Aggregate-prone proteins are cleared from the cytosol by autophagy. Therapeutic implications.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2006; 76: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). To determine if lysosomes have a greater capacity to hydrolyze such sequences than cytosolic enzymes, lysosomes from mouse liver were partially purified by differential centrifugation (20.Jonas A.J. Cystine transport in purified rat liver lysosomes.Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and sonicated, and their capacity to hydrolyze several polyQ peptides was studied. The model substrates used in these experiments contain 10–30 glutamine residues with flanking lysine, arginine, or aspartate residues to maintain the polyQ-rich sequence solubility (21.Chen S. Wetzel R. Solubilization and disaggregation of polyglutamine peptides.Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The number of cleavages made in these peptides was assayed by measuring the generation of new terminal amino groups with fluorescamine (22.Udenfriend S. Stein S. Böhlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Fluorescamine. A reagent for assay of amino acids, peptides, proteins, and primary amines in the picomole range.Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Although there was no digestion of b-KKQ10KK and b-KKQ20KK by lysosomal extracts at pH 7, where lysosomal cathepsins are generally inactive (data not shown), at pH 5, these preparations rapidly digested the polyQ peptides (Fig. 1a). In fact, the rate of digestion of Q20RRGRR by the lysosomal extracts at pH 5 was 100-fold greater than the rate of digestion by the cytosolic extracts at pH 7 (Fig. 1a). The lysosomal extracts digested b-KKQ10KK and the longer b-KKQ20KK at similar rates at pH 5. To determine the nature of the digestion products, we used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The lysosomal extracts made multiple cleavages within the polyQ sequence of b-KKQ20KK and generated a variety of fragments, including b-KKQ4, b-KKQ8, Q12KK, and Q16KK (Fig. 1b). These internal cleavages must be due to the actions of one or more lysosomal endopeptidases, although further trimming by amino- or carboxypeptidase(s) is also possible (see below). To test whether the lysosomal extracts can also digest a polyQ sequence in a full-length soluble protein, we used as a model substrate, myoglobin (Mb), in which a Q35 repeat from ataxin 3 has been inserted (23.Tanaka M. Morishima I. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nukina N. Intra- and intermolecular β-pleated sheet formation in glutamine-repeat inserted myoglobin as a model for polyglutamine diseases.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45470-45475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). With this substrate (Mb-Q35), eukaryotic proteasomes degraded the Mb component completely but released the undigested Q35 sequence (10.Venkatraman P. Wetzel R. Tanaka M. Nukina N. Goldberg A.L.

https://openalex.org/W1990986607,"Conjugated linolenic acids (CLNs), 18:3 Δ(9,11,13), lack the methylene groups found between the double bonds of linolenic acid (18:3 Δ(9,12,15)). CLNs are produced by conjugase enzymes that are homologs of the oleate desaturases FAD2. The goal of this study was to map the domain(s) within the Momordica charantia conjugase (FADX) responsible for CLN formation. To achieve this, a series of Momordica FADX-Arabidopsis FAD2 chimeras were expressed in the Arabidopsis fad3fae1 mutant, and the transformed seeds were analyzed for the accumulation of CLN. These experiments identified helix 2 and the first histidine box as a determinant of conjugase product partitioning into punicic acid (18:3 Δ(9cis,11trans,13cis)) or α-eleostearic acid (18:3 Δ(9cis,11trans,13trans)). This was confirmed by analysis of a FADX mutant containing six substitutions in which the sequence of helix 2 and first histidine box was converted to that of FAD2. Each of the six FAD2 substitutions was individually converted back to the FADX equivalent identifying residues 111 and 115, adjacent to the first histidine box, as key determinants of conjugase product partitioning. Additionally, expression of FADX G111V and FADX G111V/D115E resulted in an approximate doubling of eleostearic acid accumulation to 20.4% and 21.2%, respectively, compared with 9.9% upon expression of the native Momordica FADX. Like the Momordica conjugase, FADX G111V and FADX D115E produced predominantly α-eleostearic acid and little punicic acid, but the FADX G111V/D115E double mutant produced approximately equal amounts of α-eleostearic acid and its isomer, punicic acid, implicating an interactive effect of residues 111 and 115 in punicic acid formation."
https://openalex.org/W1998807224,"The obligate intracellular and promiscuous protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii needs an extensive membrane biogenesis that must be satisfied irrespective of its host-cell milieu. We show that the synthesis of the major lipid in T. gondii, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), is initiated by a novel choline kinase (TgCK). Full-length (∼70-kDa) TgCK displayed a low affinity for choline (K(m) ∼0.77 mM) and harbors a unique N-terminal hydrophobic peptide that is required for the formation of enzyme oligomers in the parasite cytosol but not for activity. Conditional mutagenesis of the TgCK gene in T. gondii attenuated the protein level by ∼60%, which was abolished in the off state of the mutant (Δtgck(i)). Unexpectedly, the mutant was not impaired in its growth and exhibited a normal PtdCho biogenesis. The parasite compensated for the loss of full-length TgCK by two potential 53- and 44-kDa isoforms expressed through a cryptic promoter identified within exon 1. TgCK-Exon1 alone was sufficient in driving the expression of GFP in E. coli. The presence of a cryptic promoter correlated with the persistent enzyme activity, PtdCho synthesis, and susceptibility of T. gondii to a choline analog, dimethylethanolamine. Quite notably, the mutant displayed a regular growth in the off state despite a 35% decline in PtdCho content and lipid synthesis, suggesting a compositional flexibility in the membranes of the parasite. The observed plasticity of gene expression and membrane biogenesis can ensure a faithful replication and adaptation of T. gondii in disparate host or nutrient environments."

https://openalex.org/W2042947458,"Dodecins, a group of flavin-binding proteins with a dodecameric quaternary structure, are able to incorporate two flavins within each of their six identical binding pockets building an aromatic tetrade with two tryptophan residues. Dodecin from the archaeal Halobacterium salinarum is a riboflavin storage device. We demonstrate that unwanted side reactions induced by reactive riboflavin species and degradation of riboflavin are avoided by ultrafast depopulation of the reactive excited state of riboflavin. Intriguingly, in this process, the staggered riboflavin dimers do not interact in ground and photoexcited states. Rather, within the tetrade assembly, each riboflavin is kept under the control of the respective adjacent tryptophan, which suggests that the stacked arrangement is a matter of optimizing the flavin load. We further identify an electron transfer in combination with a proton transfer as a central element of the effective excited state depopulation mechanism. Structural and functional comparisons of the archaeal dodecin with bacterial homologs reveal diverging evolution. Bacterial dodecins bind the flavin FMN instead of riboflavin and exhibit a clearly different binding pocket design with inverse incorporations of flavin dimers. The different adoption of flavin changes photochemical properties, making bacterial dodecin a comparably less efficient quencher of flavins. This supports a functional role different for bacterial and archaeal dodecins.

We demonstrate that unwanted side reactions induced by reactive riboflavin species and degradation of riboflavin are avoided by ultrafast depopulation of the reactive excited state of riboflavin. Intriguingly, in this process, the staggered riboflavin dimers do not interact in ground and photoexcited states. Rather, within the tetrade assembly, each riboflavin is kept under the control of the respective adjacent tryptophan, which suggests that the stacked arrangement is a matter of optimizing the flavin load. We further identify an electron transfer in combination with a proton transfer as a central element of the effective excited state depopulation mechanism. Structural and functional comparisons of the archaeal dodecin with bacterial homologs reveal diverging evolution. Bacterial dodecins bind the flavin FMN instead of riboflavin and exhibit a clearly different binding pocket design with inverse incorporations of flavin dimers. The different adoption of flavin changes photochemical properties, making bacterial dodecin a comparably less efficient quencher of flavins. This supports a functional role different for bacterial and archaeal dodecins. Riboflavin-binding proteins (RfbPs) 3The abbreviations used are: RfbPriboflavin-binding proteinDADSdecay-associated difference spectrumHhDodBbacterial H. halophila dodecin (ligand composition not specified)HsDodAarchaeal H. salinarum dodecin (ligand composition not specified)MtDodBbacterial M. tuberculosis dodecinTdDodBbacterial T. thermophilus dodecin. have been characterized in eukaryotes as proteins for storage and transport of riboflavin. RfbPs are high affinity binders, and reduce the photochemical reactivity of the highly reactive riboflavins by efficiently quenching light-induced excited states. Dodecin has recently been identified as a RfbP in archaea, representing the first protein of this function in prokaryotes (1.Bieger B. Essen L.O. Oesterhelt D.

With one ligand per 68 residues, dodecin represents the flavoprotein with highest flavin load known to date. Dodecin has also been found in bacteria where it was characterized as a binder of FMN (2.Grininger M. Staudt H. Johansson P. Wachtveitl J. Oesterhelt D.

Structures revealed a dodecameric fold, providing six identical binding pockets, which each enables binding of two antiparallel arranged flavins between two tryptophan residues building an aromatic tetrade arrangement (Fig. 1A) (1.Bieger B.

Although structurally similar, archaeal and bacterial dodecins differ in their ligand binding spectrum and in the binding site architecture (Fig. 1). Although both share the incorporation of antiparallel stacked flavin dimers, the bacterial dodecin incorporates si-si-stacked pairs of FMN, whereas archaeal dodecin binds re-re-stacked pairs of riboflavin. An alignment of approximately 100 dodecins reflects the separation of bacterial and archaeal dodecin on a sequence level (2.Grininger M. Staudt H. Johansson P. Wachtveitl J. Oesterhelt D. Dodecin is the key player in flavin homeostasis of archaea.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13068-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The physiological function of the bacterial dodecins is still not known. Coenzyme A bound to a TtDodB encouraged speculations toward a bifunctional dodecin storage protein (4.Meissner B. Schleicher E. Weber S. Essen L.O. The dodecin from Thermus thermophilus, a bifunctional cofactor storage protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33142-33154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas due to similarities to the recently identified EmoB, also binding dimers of FMN, it is tempting to speculate that the bacterial dodecin might be able to deliver FMNH2 for redox reactions in partner proteins (8.Nissen M.S. Youn B. Knowles B.D. Ballinger J.W. Jun S.Y. Belchik S.M. Xun L. Kang C. Crystal structures of NADH:FMN oxidoreductase (EmoB) at different stages of catalysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28710-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A broad in vitro and in vivo analysis of HsDodA revealed that archaeal dodecin is a riboflavin storage protein for buffering FMN and FAD concentration during the H. salinarum life cycle. Cellular flavin concentrations and the dodecin expression profile show that dodecin sequesters riboflavin under growth-limiting concentrations and releases riboflavin into the biosynthesis of the physiologically important flavin derivatives FMN and FAD when favorable growth conditions induce metabolic activity (2.Grininger M. Staudt H. Johansson P. Wachtveitl J. Oesterhelt D. Dodecin is the key player in flavin homeostasis of archaea.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13068-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Storage of micromolar amounts of the flavin requires efficient neutralization of the versatile flavin chemical reactivity to not affect the cellular integrity. Interaction with potent reaction partners is prevented by the encapsulation of riboflavins in sealed binding pockets. Preventing flavin photoreactivity is a more difficult task. Whereas primary light-induced activation to excited flavin states cannot be prevented by the protein environment, fast quenching of light-induced excited states has been identified as a strategy to suppress uncontrolled photochemical reactivity. Eukaryotic RfbPs typically bind riboflavin between the aromatic residues of mostly tryptophan- and tyrosine-built triads of stacked aromatic rings. Mechanistically, fast electron transfer from the aromatic moiety to the riboflavin has been proposed to quench the excited state of riboflavin by building a couple of a positively charged amino acid radical and a negatively charged flavin semiquinone (2.Grininger M. Staudt H. Johansson P. Wachtveitl J. Oesterhelt D. Dodecin is the key player in flavin homeostasis of archaea.J. Biol.

Ultrafast electron transfer mechanisms from an aromatic moiety to a photoexcited flavin are not only observed for RfbP, but for other flavoproteins, like for BLUF (blue light sensing using FAD) domains, cryptochromes, and DNA photolyases (10.Liu Z.

Plant Biol. 2011; 62: 335-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Whereas the fast quenching of the riboflavin excited states in dodecin has been suggested to involve electron transfer from the adjacent tryptophan, similar to what has been reported for the eukaryotic RfbPs, the unique dodecin binding site also raises the question of whether the photocycle of dodecin might involve other or additional relaxation channels. What role does tetrade-π-stacking play for the quenching mechanism? Does the ribityl chain affect the quenching mechanism? Do riboflavin-riboflavin-interactions contribute in the quenching mechanism? Do hydrogen bonds to the flavin, e.g. from surrounding water molecules, have an effect on the mechanism? Does the design of the binding pocket have any effect? To address these important questions, we initiated a broad systematic photophysical analysis with several wild-type and mutant dodecins in complex with several flavin ligands, in deuterated and nondeuterated solvents. With the broad set of samples, we achieve a combinatorial approach for identifying the key elements in the HsDodA quenching mechanism. For example, the influence of the ribityl chain was studied with riboflavin versus lumiflavin bound to dodecin; the influence of the staggered arrangement of isoalloxazines with riboflavin versus the single binder FAD; the influence of proton transfer on the quenching reaction with H2O versus D2O buffer solutions; and the influence of magnesium, coordinated at the bottom of the binding pocket, with wild-type versus magnesium-free mutant dodecins. The method of choice to observe fast photophysical processes on a subnanosecond time scale is the femtosecond pump-probe technique, where a short laser pulse starts the reaction and a second time-delayed pulse interrogates the system. Our data show effective fluorescence quenching of riboflavin when embedded into HsDodA, indicating a fast depopulation of the reactive excited state. Because the concept of ultrafast electron transfer between flavins and closely positioned aromates like adenine, tryptophan, and tyrosine is well established in flavin photochemistry (9.Zhong D.

However, in this contribution, the role of the unique dimeric arrangement of the isoalloxazines, the possibility of riboflavin fluorescence self-quenching (21.Grajek H. Gryczynski I. Bojarski P.

(5.Grininger M. Zeth K. Oesterhelt D. Dodecins: a family of lumichrome-binding proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant dodecin from H. salinarum with different flavin cofactors and free riboflavin were measured in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, with 1 m NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2. Dodecin from H. halophila was measured in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, with 300 mm NaCl and 100 mm ectoine. The samples were concentrated to an optical density of 0.25–0.4 at 450 nm. D2O samples were prepared by successive steps of dialysis of dodecameric dodecin against D2O buffer at a pD of 7.9 (22.Glasoe P.K. Long F.A. Use of glass electrodes to measure acidities in deuterium oxide 1,2.J. Phys. Chem. 1960; 64: 188-190Crossref Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). The experimental setup for the pump/probe spectroscopy in the visible spectral range was described in detail elsewhere (23.Huber R. Köhler T. Lenz M.O. Bamberg E. Kalmbach R. Engelhard M. Wachtveitl J. pH-dependent photoisomerization of retinal in proteorhodopsin.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, the pulse source for these experiments was a Clark CPA 2001 femtosecond laser system (central wavelength 775 nm, pulse length 170 fs, pulse energy 800 μJ, repetition rate1 kHz). Excitation pulses were generated by frequency doubling of the laser fundamental in a BBO crystal (388 nm) or by using a noncollinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) (475 nm) (24.Wilhelm T. Piel J. Riedle E. Sub-20-fs pulses tunable across the visible from a blue-pumped single-pass noncollinear parametric converter.Opt. Lett. 1997; 22: 1494-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 25.Riedle E. Beutter M. Lochbrunner S. Piel J. Schenkl S. Sporlein S. Zinth W. Generation of 10- to 50-fs pulses tunable through all of the visible and the NIR.Appl. Phys. B. 2000; 71: 457-465Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Pulses with a central wavelengths of 345 and 440 nm were generated by sum frequency mixing of 775 nm and NOPA pulses in a type I BBO crystal (θ = 36° and 26°, respectively). The energy of the pump pulse was between 25 and 100 nJ. Probe pulses in a spectral range of 430–750-nm pulses were generated in a sapphire window as single filament white light. The cross-correlation width was below 250 fs for the entire investigated spectral range. The continuum pulses were dispersed by two spectrometers (sample and reference) and recorded with two 42-segment diode arrays (multichannel detection), resulting in a spectral resolution of 8 nm. Data acquisition was performed in single shot detection mode as balanced and referenced measurement providing signal-to-noise ratios up to 104. To guarantee nonexcited sample for successive laser shots, the sample was moved in two dimensions. Pure solution was measured as reference to correct for the coherent artifact. UV/visible absorption spectra were taken before and after the time-resolved experiments to ensure that no long lived photoproducts were accumulated. Prior to further analysis, the transient data were corrected for the coherent signals and group velocity dispersion. The coherent signal of the solution can be subtracted from the sample signal (26.Lorenc M. Ziolek M. Naskrecki R. Karolczak J. Kubicki J. Maciejewski A. Artifacts in femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy.Appl. Phys. B. 2002; 74: 19-27Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The delay time zero was determined for all wavelengths employing a procedure (27.Ernsting N.P. Kovalenko S.A. Senyushkina T. Saam J. Farztdinov V. Wave-packet-assisted decomposition of femtosecond transient ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra: application to excited-state intramolecular proton transfer in solution.J. Phys. Chem.

Femtosecond spectroscopy of condensed phases with chirped supercontinuum probing.Phys. Rev. A. 1999; 59: 2369-2384Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar), which uses the temporal evolution of the coherent signal and a least squares fit algorithm. For the quantitative data analysis we employed a kinetic model, which describes the data as sum of exponential decays. A Marquardt downhill algorithm optimizes n global time constants (τi) for all wavelengths simultaneously with wavelength-dependent amplitudes Ai(λ) for each component. The model function assumes Gaussian pump and probe pulses with a (1/e) cross-correlation width tcc. ΔA(t, λ)=∑i=1nAi(λ)⋅exp(tcc24τi2−tτi)⋅12(1+erf(ttcc−tcc2τi))(Eq. 1) The wavelength-dependent fit amplitudes Ai(λ) represent the decay-associated difference spectrum (DADS) for each decay and thus represent the part of the difference spectrum that decays with the corresponding time constant (29.van Stokkum I.H. Larsen D.S. van Grondelle R. Global and target analysis of time-resolved spectra.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1657: 82-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). In this definition, an infinite time constant is equal to a time-independent offset in the transient absorbance changes at positive delay times, and therefore it mainly represents the absorbance change that remains at the maximum delay time in our experiments. Even though the positions of the riboflavin absorption bands are very sensitive to the environment (30.Koziol J. Knobloch E. The solvent effect on the fluorescence and light absorption of riboflavin and lumiflavin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 102: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), only small shifts of the absorption maxima of oxidized flavins have been observed for flavin dimers in solution (21.Grajek H. Gryczynski I. Bojarski P. Gryczynski Z. Bharill S. Kulak L. Flavin mononucleotide fluorescence intensity decay in concentrated aqueous solutions.Chem. Phys. Lett. 2007; 439: 151-156Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and a number of other flavoproteins (31.Ghisla S. Massey V. Lhoste J.M. Mayhew S.G. Fluorescence and optical characteristics of reduced flavins and flavoproteins.Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 32.Massey V. Ganther H. On the interpretation of the absorption spectra of flavoproteins with special reference to d-amino acid oxidase.Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Accordingly, steady-state spectroscopy for dodecin shows that the riboflavin absorption band at 445 nm (S0→S1 transition is only marginally blue-shifted compared with free riboflavin in aqueous solution, and the band at 373 nm (S0→S2 transition) shows no shift of the absorption maximum (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the relation of the two absorption bands changes if riboflavin is bound to HsDodA. Both absorption bands are attributed to π→π* transitions (33.Sun M. Moore T.A. Song P.S. Molecular luminescence studies of flavins. I. The excited states of flavins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The shoulder around 480 nm for bound riboflavin is a common phenomenon observed also for other flavoproteins and probably results from interactions between the π-systems or hydrogen bonding in the binding pocket (32.Massey V. Ganther H. On the interpretation of the absorption spectra of flavoproteins with special reference to d-amino acid oxidase.Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34.Harbury H.A. Foley K.A. Molecular interaction of isoalloxazine derivatives.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1958; 44: 662-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic measurements of riboflavin in aqueous solution and incorporated into diverse dodecin proteins were carried out for different excitation wavelengths to induce distinct electronic transitions and to provide varying excess vibrational energies. Additionally to the excitation of the S0→S1 transition of riboflavin at 476 nm, the low energy wing, and at 440, 388, and 345 nm was chosen to excite the S0→S2 transition at the low and at the high energy wing, respectively. Because transient absorbance changes for the different excitation wavelengths did not show any significant differences, we suggest that the S2→S1 transition is faster than the time resolution of the experiment for bound as well as for free riboflavin. This finding is in agreement with experiments by Stanley and McFarlane, where an internal conversion from S2 to S1 in less than 100 fs for flavins was demonstrated (17.Stanley R.J. MacFarlane A.W. Ultrafast excited state dynamics of oxidized flavins: direct observations of quenching by purines.J. Phys. Chem. A. 2000; 104: 6899-6906Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35.MacFarlane 4th, A.W.

Thus, the discussion of photodynamics is restricted to the 388 nm excitation because the best signal-to-noise ratio was obtained in this experiment. The transient absorbance changes of riboflavin in aqueous solution (17.Stanley R.J. MacFarlane A.W.

The excited state of free riboflavin displayed a lifetime longer than the maximum delay time of the experiment (1.5 ns), consistent with the reported lifetime of about 5 ns (37.Heelis P.F. The photophysical and photochemical properties of flavins (isoalloxazines).Chem. Soc. Rev. 1982; 11: 15-39Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, bound riboflavin showed lifetimes of its difference signals clearly shortened to only a few picoseconds, e.g. the ground state bleach (negative absorbance change at 450 nm). Furthermore, the pattern of positive and negative absorbance changes shows distinctive differences: the intensive negative signal of the stimulated emission at 520–600 nm observed for free riboflavin in aqueous solution is missing for HsDodA-bound riboflavin (2.Grininger M. Staudt H. Johansson P. Wachtveitl J. Oesterhelt D. Dodecin is the key player in flavin homeostasis of archaea.J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2057500830,"Background Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a simple, high-resolution technique to quantify the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), which provides an indirect measurement of axonal damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). This study aimed to evaluate RNFL thickness in patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of MS. Methodology This was a cross-sectional study. Twenty-four patients with CIS suggestive of MS (8 optic neuritis [ON], 6 spinal cord syndromes, 5 brainstem symptoms and 5 with sensory and other syndromes) were prospectively studied. The main outcome evaluated was RNFL thickness at CIS onset. Secondary objectives were to study the relationship between RNFL thickness and MRI criteria for disease dissemination in space (DIS) as well as the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. Principal Findings Thirteen patients had decreased RNFL thickness in at least one quadrant. Mean RNFL thickness was 101.67±10.72 µm in retrobulbar ON eyes and 96.93±10.54 in unaffected eyes. Three of the 6 patients with myelitis had at least one abnormal quadrant in one of the two eyes. Eight CIS patients fulfilled DIS MRI criteria. The presence of at least one quadrant of an optic nerve with a RNFL thickness at a P<5% cut-off value had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 56% for predicting DIS MRI. Conclusions The findings from this study show that axonal damage measured by OCT is present in any type of CIS; even in myelitis forms, not only in ON as seen up to now. OCT can detect axonal damage in very early stages of disease and seems to have high sensitivity and moderate specificity for predicting DIS MRI. Studies with prospective long-term follow-up would be needed to establish the prognostic value of baseline OCT findings."
https://openalex.org/W2029507225,"Human cytidine deaminases APOBEC3F (A3F) and APOBEC3G (A3G) inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) replication. In the absence of HIV-1 Vif, A3F and/or A3G are incorporated into assembling virions and exert antiviral functions in subsequently infected target cells. Encapsidation of A3F or A3G within the protease-matured virion core following their incorporation into virions is hypothesized to be important for the antiviral function of these proteins. In this report, we demonstrated that A3F was quantitatively encapsidated in the mature virion core. In distinct contrast, A3G was distributed both within and outside of the virion core. Analysis of a series of A3F-A3G chimeras comprised of exchanged N- and C-terminal deaminase domains identified a 14 amino acid segment in the A3F C-terminal deaminase domain that contributed to preferential encapsidation and anti-HIV activity. Amino acid residue L306 in this C-terminal segment was determined to be necessary, but not sufficient, for these effects. Amino acid residue W126 in the N-terminal deaminase domain was determined also to contribute to preferential encapsidation and antiviral activity of A3F. Analysis of the A3F (W126A L306A) double mutant revealed that both residues are required for full anti-HIV function. The results reported here advance our understanding of the mechanisms of A3F virion encapsidation and antiviral function and may lead to innovative strategies to inhibit HIV-1 replication."

We hypothesized that inhaled NO (iNO) would induce EPC mobilization and therefore promote lung repair in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Healthy piglets were randomized into four groups (n = 6): Control (Con; mechanical ventilation only); ARDS (established by oleic acid infusion and mechanical ventilation); ARDS plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; 10 µg/kg/d subcutaneously); ARDS plus NO inhalation (iNO; 10 ppm). EPCs and mobilizing cytokines were assayed at different time points (baseline, 0, 24, 72 and 168 h) and injury reparation was assessed at 168 h. Compared to the Con group, the levels of EPCs were increased in bone marrow but not in blood in the ARDS group at 24 h. Compared to the ARDS group, inhaled NO induced a rapid elevation in the number of CD34(+)KDR(+), KDR(+)CD133(+) and CD34(+)KDR(+)CD133(+) EPCs in blood (2163±454 vs. 1094±416, 1302±413 vs. 429±244, 1140±494 vs. 453±273 cells/ml, respectively, P<0.05), and a reduction in the percentage of KDR(+)CD133(+) cells in bone marrow. Lung CD34, CD133, VEGF, VEGF receptor 2, endothelial NO synthase mRNA, and VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 protein expression levels were augmented in the iNO group, but not in the G-CSF group, compared to ARDS. Furthermore, iNO treatment reduced vascular permeability, increased pulmonary vessel density, and alleviated pulmonary edema and inflammation compared to ARDS treatment. Plasma VEGF, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and bone marrow NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) were significantly higher in the iNO group compared to the ARDS group at 72 h.These results suggest that iNO induces mobilization of EPCs from bone marrow into circulation, contributes to vascular repair, and thereby alleviates lung damage."
https://openalex.org/W1894641575,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a key regulatory molecule with pleiotropic effects on cell growth, migration, and invasion. As a result, impairment of proper TGF-β signaling is central to tumorigenesis and metastasis. The TGF-β receptor V (TGFBRV or LRP1) has been shown to be responsible for TGF-β-mediated cell growth inhibition in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The LRP1 adapter protein GULP mediates internalization of the various LRP1-specific ligands, and we hypothesize that GULP acts as a novel regulator of TGF-β signaling in ovarian cells. CHO cells that overexpress exogenous GULP (FL) demonstrate enhancement in growth inhibition, migration, and invasion from TGF-β treatment, whereas cells that lack GULP (AS) show impairment of growth inhibition and decreased migration and invasion. The enhanced TGF-β response in FL cells was confirmed by a prolonged TGF-β-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation, whereas a shortening of the phosphorylation event is observed in AS cells. Mechanistically, the presence of GULP retains the TGF-β in a signaling-competent early endosome for enhanced signaling. To address this mechanism in a physiological setting, TGF-β insensitive ovarian adenocarcinoma cells (HEY) have a very low GULP expression level, similar to the observation made in a wide selection of human ovarian adenocarcinomas. Transfection of GULP into the HEY cells restored the TGF-β responsiveness, as measured by SMAD3 phosphorylation and impairment of cell growth. Because GULP expression positively regulates TGF-β signaling leading to growth inhibition, this may represent an attractive target to achieve TGF-β responsiveness in ovarian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013435761,"In a recent study we described the second periplasmic loop P2 of the transmembrane protein MalF (MalF-P2) of the maltose ATP-binding cassette transporter (MalFGK(2)-E) as an important element in the recognition of substrate by the maltose-binding protein MalE. In this study, we focus on MalE and find that MalE undergoes a structural rearrangement after addition of MalF-P2. Analysis of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) shows that binding of MalF-P2 induces a semiopen state of MalE in the presence and absence of maltose, whereas maltose is retained in the binding pocket. These data are in agreement with paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments. After addition of MalF-P2, an increased solvent accessibility for residues in the vicinity of the maltose-binding site of MalE is observed. MalF-P2 is thus not only responsible for substrate recognition, but also directly involved in activation of substrate transport. The observation that substrate-bound and substrate-free MalE in the presence of MalF-P2 adopts a similar semiopen state hints at the origin of the futile ATP hydrolysis of MalFGK(2)-E."
https://openalex.org/W2068521479,"The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) amplicon is frequently amplified in numerous human cancers including gliomas. PIKE-A, a proto-oncogene that is one of the important components of the CDK4 amplicon, binds to and enhances the kinase activity of Akt, thereby promoting cancer progression. To define the roles of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction in glioblastoma multiform (GBM) progression, we used biochemical protein/protein interaction (PPI) assays and live cell fluorescence-based protein complementation assays to search for small peptide antagonist from these proteins that were able to block their interaction. Here, we show that disruption of the interaction between PIKE-A and Akt by the small peptides significantly reduces glioblastoma cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. Disruption of PIKE-A/Akt association potently suppressed GBM cell proliferation and sensitized the cells to two clinical drugs that are currently used to treat GBM. Interestingly, GBM cells containing the CDK4 amplicon were more responsive to the inhibition of the PIKE-A/Akt interaction than GBM cells lacking this amplicon. Taken together, our findings provide proof-of-principle that blocking a PPI that is essential for cancer progression provides a valuable strategy for therapeutic discovery."
https://openalex.org/W1987605401,"Genomic islands (GIs), frequently associated with the pathogenicity of bacteria and having a substantial influence on bacterial evolution, are groups of “alien” elements which probably undergo special temporal–spatial regulation in the host genome. Are there particular hallmark transcriptional signals for these “exotic” regions? We here explore the potential transcriptional signals that underline the GIs beyond the conventional views on basic sequence composition, such as codon usage and GC property bias. It showed that there is a significant enrichment of the transcription start positions (TSPs) in the GI regions compared to the whole genome of Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli. There was up to a four-fold increase for the 70% GIs, implying high-density TSPs profile can potentially differentiate the GI regions. Based on this feature, we developed a new sliding window method GIST, Genomic-island Identification by Signals of Transcription, to identify these regions. Subsequently, we compared the known GI-associated features of the GIs detected by GIST and by the existing method Islandviewer to those of the whole genome. Our method demonstrates high sensitivity in detecting GIs harboring genes with biased GI-like function, preferred subcellular localization, skewed GC property, shorter gene length and biased “non-optimal” codon usage. The special transcriptional signals discovered here may contribute to the coordinate expression regulation of foreign genes. Finally, by using GIST, we detected many interesting GIs in the 2011 German E. coli O104:H4 outbreak strain TY-2482, including the microcin H47 system and gene cluster ycgXEFZ-ymgABC that activates the production of biofilm matrix. The aforesaid findings highlight the power of GIST to predict GIs with distinct intrinsic features to the genome. The heterogeneity of cumulative TSPs profiles may not only be a better identity for “alien” regions, but also provide hints to the special evolutionary course and transcriptional regulation of GI regions."

Although nearly all therapeutic agents developed to date target proteins, it is now widely recognized that only a minority of proteins are capable of being targeted by the two established classes of therapeutic agents, small molecules and biologicals (1.Hopkins A.L. Groom C.R. The druggable genome.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar). The realization that the majority of proteins are considered intractable toward targeting by established agents has fueled efforts to develop the therapeutic potential of alternative classes of cellular targets, with RNA being the object of most intensive investigation (2.Lagoja I.M.

Herdewijn P. Use of RNA in drug design.Expert Opin. Drug Discov. 2007; 2: 889-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This mode of intermolecular engagement requires that the target sequence be minimally tied up in competing intramolecular base-pairing interactions. Identifying such accessible elements in an RNA target presents a challenge, as the folding landscape of RNA shows remarkable complexity, with a wide variety of noncanonical pairing motifs augmenting canonical Watson-Crick base-pairing (6.Hendrix D.K. Brenner S.E. Holbrook S.R. RNA structural motifs. Building blocks of a modular biomolecule.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2005; 38: 221-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Neither the structural nature of these folds nor the energetic cost of gaining access to particular sites is readily predictable. Thus, the discovery of targetable sites is best accomplished through experimental analysis of ensembles of candidate nucleic acid binders.

Efforts along these lines to date have involved sparse sampling of ligand sequence space, with at most 320 candidate sequences examined per study, these having been designed on the basis of Watson-Crick complementarity to prospective docking sequences on the RNA target of interest. Microarrays representing all possible ligand sequences would serve the valuable function of providing a more unbiased and comprehensive approach, but these have not been available to date. With the relatively long sequences (>15 nt 6The abbreviations used are:ntnucleotideRIPtideRNA-interacting polynucleotidehTRhuman telomerase RNARNPribonucleoproteinDMT5′-dimethoxytritylFAM6-carboxyfluoresceinFPfluorescence polarizationTRAPtelomeric repeat amplification protocol.) of unmodified DNA oligonucleotides typically required to form a stable Watson-Crick pairing with RNA targets, the total number of candidate sequences (4n, where n equals the number of nucleobases in the oligonucleotide) greatly exceeds the capacity of even the highest density microarrays presently available. The use of nucleoside analogs can boost target affinity, thereby reducing the length of the candidate ligands and hence overall library size, but the use of such analogs requires the development of dedicated methods for fabrication for high density microarrays.

Kuimelis R.G. Barone D. Cuppoletti A. Ciccolella P. Spence E. Afroz F. Bury P. Chen C. Chen C. Pao D. Le M. McGee B. Harkins E. Savage M. Narasimhan S. Goldberg M. Rava R. Fodor S.P. Photolithographic synthesis of high density DNA probe arrays. Challenges and opportunities.J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B. 2007; 25: 2537-2546Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This method (supplemental Fig. S1) differs from that used in the manufacture of Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays, which employs 2′-deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites bearing a photodeprotectable 5′-protecting group. 5′-DMT-2′-OMe phosphoramidites were used as monomers for the on-chip synthesis of the RIPtide microarrays, with a photogenerated acid being used to remove the 5′-DMT group during chain extension. The silica substrate for the arrays was first silanized and then reacted with a hexaethyleneglycol derivative (used as a spacer between the oligonucleotides and the array surface) before the initial nucleic acid coupling step. Then a film containing the photoacid generator was coated onto the substrate, aligned, and exposed in the stepper to the first mask, giving rise to the photogenerated acid for the first detritylation. The film was then removed, and the substrate was processed in a cell flow in which the first DMT-protected phosphoramidite monomer was added. Subsequent steps of capping, oxidation, and washes were carried out, and the process was repeated using the next mask and the next oligonucleotide in the sequence (supplemental Fig. S1). After the synthesis was completed, substrates were treated with a solution of organic base to remove protecting groups from the RIPtides. Wafers were rinsed, spin-dried under nitrogen, and diced into individual chips. The final density of full-length RIPtide on these microarrays was ∼30–50 pmol/cm2, with a feature size of 17.5 μm. The chips also included a checkerboard for grid alignment consisting of the 13-mer 2′-OMe sequence 5′-ACGGTAGCATCTT-3′, which allows hybridization with the commercial Affymetrix Oligo B2 (5′-biotin-GTCAAGATGCTACCGTTCAG-3′). 5′-End Cy3-labeled PKWT and PKWT-1 were purchased from Dharmacon. RNAs fragments of >50 nt were obtained by in vitro transcription from a dsDNA template generated by PCR from a pRc/CMV vector containing hTR (Collins laboratory) in the presence of aminoallyl-UTP, as described in the supplemental material. Transcription was performed at 37 °C using T7-RNA polymerase, 4 mm NTPs, 1 unit/ml yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase, RNase inhibitor, and 10× transcription buffer. After DNase I treatment (15–30 min, 37 °C) and purification by denaturing PAGE, the target RNA was labeled with Cy3-NHS ester (Amersham Biosciences, 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 8.5, 50% DMSO/H2O, 1 h). Excess dye was removed by ethanol precipitation, and the RNA was then purified and desalted. A specific probe (Oligo B2, Affymetrix) was first hybridized to the checkerboard to provide a grid alignment guide. Briefly, 250 pm oligonucleotide B2 was hybridized to the RIPtide chip for 16 h at 45 °C and then stained using streptavidin/phycoerythrin. Cy3-labeled RNAs were refolded by heating at 95 °C for 3 min followed by slowly cooling to room temperature in 1× array buffer (50 mm potassium PBS, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, pH 7.4). Denaturing polyacrylamide gels (6%) were run as control experiments to check for RNA integrity under the buffer conditions employed for refolding and after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, RNA samples were also tested after refolding by native gel electrophoresis (6%) to confirm the presence of a major RNA folded population (supplemental Fig. S2). 100 nm folded RNAs were incubated with the RIPtide chips at 37 °C for 1 h. The arrays were washed and scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip 3000 7G scanner, and microarray images were analyzed using GeneChip Operating Software (Affymetrix Inc.). After raw fluorescence values were averaged, a list of the top 100 hits was extracted (supplemental material) and aligned against the target RNA sequence using Perl scripts developed in-house. The RIPtide sequences were aligned against the target RNA sequence (>60% sequence identity) to identify putative binding sites. The oligonucleotide sequences were aligned at every possible register of the RNA sequence, and the similarity (S) was calculated at each register, based on complementarity between the oligonucleotide and RNA sequences (Equation 1),S=nN(Eq. 1) where n is the number of complementary bases, and N is the length of the RIPtide. This is essentially the Jaccard similarity coefficient, except when the oligonucleotide hangs off the RNA sequence. The RIPtide was allowed to hang off the RNA sequence on the ends, and in these cases, the number of matching bases was divided by the length of the oligonucleotide (not the number of bases that overlap, in contrast to the Jaccard similarity coefficient) to generate a similarity score. Only canonical Watson-Crick base pairing was considered, and commonly occurring wobble pairs, such as the G·U wobble pair (36.Varani G. McClain W.H. The G·U wobble base pair. A fundamental building block of RNA structure crucial to RNA function in diverse biological systems.EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), were not taken into account. Alignment was achieved at the position with maximum similarity between the oligonucleotide and RNA sequence, and the center of where the oligonucleotides sequence mapped to the RNA sequence was recorded. For example, if the RIPtide oligonucleotide mapped to RNA bases 11–15, 13 was the center. In the cases of RIPtides with an even number of bases, the resulting value for the center was rounded up. The number of oligonucleotides centered on each RNA base was calculated and plotted, as shown in Fig. 3. From these plots, groups of RIPtides emerged, as denoted by peaks spanning ∼2–3 adjacent RNA bases. These groups of oligonucleotides were manually clustered based on where major peaks started and stopped. Although this clustering step could have been automated based on the number of RIPtides targeting adjacent bases (i.e. in a similar manner to which peaks are identified on a chromatogram plot), it was unnecessary to automate this process because only a handful of clusters was apparent upon visual inspection of where the highest affinity RIPtides (according to microarray experiments) mapped onto the RNA sequence. FAM-labeled RIPtides were synthesized on a 3′-(6-fluorescein) CPG support (Glen Research) using a MerMade 12 (BioAutomation) DNA synthesizer, purified with Poly Pak-II (Glen Research) cartridges, and compositionally verified by MALDI-TOF MS. Unlabeled full-length hTR was prepared by in vitro transcription. After DNase I treatment and ethanol precipitation, hTR was purified using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen). Unlabeled PKWT and PKWT-1 were purchased from Dharmacon. FAM-labeled RIPtides (5 nm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of folded RNA at 37 °C for 2 h, after which FP was recorded at 25 °C using a SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices) plate reader. For mapping of hTR-RIPtide-binding sites, full-length hTR transcripts incorporating two consecutive base mutations (to their complementary bases) were generated through site-directed mutagenesis on the pRc/CMV plasmid, using a QuickChange-XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and confirmed by sequencing. Telomerase-positive cells were either purchased from ATCC (DU145 and HEK293) or provided in the Chemicon TRAP kit (HeLa). Cell extracts were prepared from cell pellets by detergent lysis with 1× CHAPS buffer (Chemicon). Purified RIPtides were incubated with the extract for 1 h at 37 °C prior to the TRAP assays. Extension of the fluorescent artificial substrate (37.Herbert B.S. Hochreiter A.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nonradioactive detection of telomerase activity using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) by telomerase was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C, followed by amplification with 30 PCR cycles (34 °C 30 s, 59 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 1 min). The extension products were separated on 10% native polyacrylamide gels, and bands were visualized by fluorescence imaging and quantified using ImageQuantTM (GE Healthcare). Several controls were included in the design of the experiments as follows: a positive control (untreated cell lysate), negative controls (buffer only, heat-inactivated, or RNase-treated cell extracts), and PCR amplification control (60 μm of RIPtide added after telomerase elongation and before PCR step). For cell-based TRAP assays, DU145 cells were transfected with 0.2% LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) and 165 nm RIPtide for a period of 24 h. Cells were harvested, counted, lysed with 1× CHAPS lysis buffer, and normalized by total protein concentration (Bradford assay). Our goal at the outset was to develop a microarray platform that would enable a structurally unbiased screen to identify RIPtides that bind with high affinity to a folded RNA target (Fig. 1) and ultimately to use the RIPtides thus identified to modulate the activity of the target RNA in cells. As cell permeability of oligonucleotides decreases as a function of length (38.Loke S.L. Stein C.A. Zhang X.H. Mori K. Nakanishi M. Subasinghe C. Cohen J.S. Neckers L.M.

In addition, we incorporated 2′-OMe substituents on all of the RIPtides displayed on the microarray (Fig. 1, A and B), a modification known to increase oligonucleotide affinity for RNA targets (42.Freier S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2004107368,"DREAM is a Ca2+-dependent transcriptional repressor highly expressed in neuronal cells. A number of genes have already been identified as the target of its regulation. Targeted analysis performed on cerebella from transgenic mice expressing a dominant active DREAM mutant (daDREAM) showed a drastic reduction of the amount of transcript of Ca2+-activated nucleotidase 1 (CANT1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi resident Ca2+-dependent nucleoside diphosphatase that has been suggested to have a role in glucosylation reactions related to the quality control of proteins in the ER and the Golgi apparatus. CANT1 down-regulation was also found in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells stably overexpressing wild type (wt) DREAM or daDREAM, thus providing a simple cell model to investigate the protein maturation pathway. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the down-regulation of CANT1 is associated with reduced protein secretion and increased degradation rates. Importantly, overexpression of wtDREAM or daDREAM augmented the expression of the EDEM1 gene, which encodes a key component of the ER-associated degradation pathway, suggesting an alternative pathway to enhanced protein degradation. Restoring CANT1 levels in neuroblastoma clones recovered the phenotype, thus confirming a key role of CANT1, and of the regulation of its gene by DREAM, in the control of protein synthesis and degradation.

DREAM (downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator) 3The abbreviations used are:DREAMdownstream regulatory element antagonist modulatorCANTCa2+-activated nucleotidaseERendoplasmic reticulumERADenhanced ER-associated protein degradationDREdownstream regulatory element. is a Ca2+-dependent multifunctional protein that belongs to the KChIP subfamily of neuronal calcium sensors.

DREAM is highly expressed in a number of tissues, among them the central nervous system, thyroid gland, testis, and thymus and early in vitro studies have described specific target genes for DREAM repression in the brain, the immune system, and in the thyroid gland (1.Carrión A.M.

The transcriptional action of DREAM requires its binding to a downstream regulatory element (DRE) in the promoter of target genes. The binding is regulated by the level of nuclear Ca2+, by the interaction with other nucleoproteins such as the cAMP response element modulator and CREB, and by the PIK3 pathway (14.Sanz C.

Mutation of key amino acids within any of the three functional EF hands (a fourth EF hand is not operational) results in a protein insensitive to Ca2+ that will block DRE- and CRE-dependent transcription (1.Carrión A.M.

Introducing a second mutation at the CREB-interacting domain in DREAM results in the double mutant daDREAM that acts as a dominant active repressor blocking specifically DREAM target genes as reported (13.Savignac M. Mellström B. Bébin A.G. Oliveros J.C. Delpy L. Pinaud E. Naranjo J.R. Increased B cell proliferation and reduced Ig production in DREAM transgenic mice.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 7527-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule cells from transgenic mice expressing daDREAM show reduced expression level of the plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform 3 (NCX3), the major Ca2+ extrusion system in these neurons (16.Gomez-Villafuertes R. Torres B. Barrio J. Savignac M. Gabellini N. Rizzato F. Pintado B. Gutierrez-Adan A. Mellström B. Carafoli E. Naranjo J.R. Downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator regulates Ca2+ homeostasis and viability in cerebellar neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10822-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that in human neuroblastoma clones stably overexpressing wtDREAM or daDREAM, the ER Ca2+ content is drastically reduced, through both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms. In addition to a modest reduction in NCX3 levels, which was possibly responsible for inhibiting capacitative Ca2+ influx and thus ER store refilling, we observed a marked up-regulation of the InsP3R transcript levels, which could have been responsible for increasing the ER Ca2+ leak. DREAM also acts non-transcriptionally to modulate ER Ca2+ content, and we have shown that it does so by directly interacting with presenilin 2 (PS2) in a Ca2+-independent manner, potentiating the PS2-promoted efflux of Ca2+ from the ER (3.Fedrizzi L.

In the present study we searched for changes in the expression of genes related to protein folding and degradation in cerebella of daDREAM mice to identify other Ca2+-related gene targets of DREAM regulation. We found a strong repression of the transcript of CANT1 (calcium-activated nucleotidase 1), an ER-Golgi resident Ca2+-dependent nucleoside diphosphatase (17.Kuhn N.J. White A.

The repression was also documented both at the mRNA and at the protein level in wtDREAM and daDREAM stable clones of neuroblastoma cells. qPCR and Western blot also revealed the up-regulation of EDEM1, an α-mannosidase-like protein, that regulates the disposal of misfolded protein from the ER (21.Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P.

EDEM as an acceptor of terminally misfolded glycoproteins released from calnexin.Science. 2003; 299: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This is in line with previously reported findings that showed an up-regulation of EDEM1 transcript in B cells of daDREAM mice (13.Savignac M. Mellström B. Bébin A.G. Oliveros J.C. Delpy L. Pinaud E. Naranjo J.R. Increased B cell proliferation and reduced Ig production in DREAM transgenic mice.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 7527-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to study a possible impairment in the protein folding machinery using neuroblastoma clones stably expressing DREAM as cell models. Pulse-chase experiments monitoring the maturation of the folding competent substrates BACE501 and wild type α1-antitrypsin (α1AT-WT) and the folding-defective substrate α1-antitrypsin Null Hong-Kong variant (α1AT-NHK) demonstrated that the reduction of CANT1 levels selectively delayed the secretion rate of the soluble α1AT-WT and, conversely, enhanced ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) of the α1AT-NHK variant, its folding-defective counterpart. Interestingly, the folding kinetic of the membrane-bound BACE501 was not affected, suggesting the intriguing possibility of a substrate dependent activity of CANT1. Because CANT1 is a Ca2+-binding protein, it appeared interesting to investigate the possibility that it could directly affect Ca2+ homeostasis. We thus measured intracellular Ca2+ with the recombinant Ca2+-sensitive aequorin targeted to the Golgi apparatus and ER lumen. The measurements have revealed that CANT1 overexpression enhanced the levels of free Ca2+ in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that it may play a role in Ca2+ homeostasis, but it had no effect on ER Ca2+ levels. In summary, our data, in addition to identifying CANT1 as a novel gene subjected to DREAM regulation, demonstrate that the CANT1 activity is essential to the correct ER protein folding and degradation processes. Interest in these findings is heightened by the recent discovery of CANT1 mutations in Desbuquois dysplasia, a skeletal disorder presenting defects in the endochondral ossification process (23.Huber C. Oulès B. Bertoli M. Chami M. Fradin M. Alanay Y. Al-Gazali L.I. Ausems M.G. Bitoun P. Cavalcanti D.P. Krebs A. Le Merrer M. Mortier G. Shafeghati Y. Superti-Furga A. Robertson S.P. Le Goff C.

The molecular mechanism responsible for this phenotype is still unknown, even if it has been proposed to be due to an impairment of proteoglycans synthesis: our evidence of a link between CANT1 deficiency and enhanced protein degradation supports this possibility.

Total RNA from mice cerebella and neuroblastoma cell culture was prepared using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). First-Strand cDNA synthesis was performed by using SuperScript™ II RT (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 to 5 μg of total RNA were incubated with 1 μl of Oligo(dT) (500 μg/ml), 1 μl of dNTP Mix (10 mm each) and sterile distilled water to a final volume of 12 μl. The mixture was heated at 65 °C for 5 min and quickly chilled on ice before adding 4 μl of 5× First-Strand Buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 m DTT, and 1 μl of RNaseOUT™ (40 units/μl). The mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 2 min before adding 1 μl (200 units) of SuperScript™ II RT to reach a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The reaction was performed at 42 °C for 50 min and then inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. The cDNA was used as a template for amplification in qPCR. Quantification of calnexin, calreticulin, Bip, CHOP, EDEM1, and Xbp1 and β-actin in mice cerebella was done using specific primers and Taqman MGB probes (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX). The results are normalized by parallel amplification of β-actin. For CANT1 and EDEM1 quantification in neuroblastoma cell clones, qPCR was performed on a Rotor-Gene 3000 platform (Corbet Research, Sydney, Australia). The PCR cycling parameters were: 94 °C for 7 min, 45 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. An amount of cDNA corresponding to 1–10 ng of total RNA was amplified in 25 μl of a mixture containing 12.5 μl of Platinum SYBR-Green qPCR SuperMix-UGD (Invitrogen) and 2 μl primer mixture (2.5 μm each) for each sample. Primers were designed using Primer3 software. The primers used were: for CANT1, forward, 5′-AACACCGACGACCAGATCATT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCTTCGTATTTCACGCTTCCG-3′ and for EDEM1, forward, 5′-AGTCAAATGTGGATATGCTACG-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACAGATATGATATGGCCCTCAG-3′. The relative amount of amplified DNA was calculated as described (24.Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25420) Google Scholar), using β-actin or hypoxantine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) cDNAs as endogenous control. The HPRT primers used were: forward, 5′-TTGGATACA GGCCAGACTTTGTT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTG AAGTACTCATTATAGTCAAGGGCATA-3′. The β-actin primers used were: forward 5′-AGAGCTACGAGCTGCCTGAC-3′, reverse 5′-GTAGTTTCGTGGATGCCACAG-3′. SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), in 75 cm2 flasks; before transfection, the cells were seeded onto 13-mm glass cover slips and allowed to grow to 80% confluence. Transfection with 0.7 μg of plasmid DNA (or 0.5:0.5 μg in co-transfections) was carried out using TransFectin Lipid Reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instruction. AEQ measurements were performed 36 h later. Cells plated for Western blot were collected 24–36 h after transfection. Stable wtDREAM and daDREAM clones were generated as previously described (3.Fedrizzi L. Lim D. Carafoli E. Brini M. Interplay of the Ca2+-binding protein DREAM with presenilin in neuronal Ca2+ signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27494-27503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and maintained in the same conditions as control SH-SY5Y cells. To generate down-regulated CANT1 clones, SH-SY5Y cells were grown in a 6-well tissue culture plate to a 50–70% confluence in antibiotic-free DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The day after, cells were either transfected with 4 μg of Control shRNA plasmid (sc-108060, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or CANT1 shRNA plasmid (sc.94075-SH, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) by following the instructions of the manufacturer. 48 h after transfection cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with fresh medium. The day after, the medium has been replaced with fresh medium containing 7 μg/ml puromycin (the lowest concentration that kills 100% of non-transfected cells in 3–5 days after the beginning of puromycin selection) to select stable cells for shRNA plasmid DNA-mediated inhibition of CANT1 expression. Approximately every 2–3 days, the medium was replaced with freshly prepared selective medium. After 2 weeks from the beginning of the selection, shRNA CANT1 plasmid pooled clones were used for subsequent experiments. SH-SY5Y cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) for 20 min, washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 10 min in PBS supplemented with 50 mm NH4Cl. Cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washed with 1% gelatin (type IV, from calf skin) in PBS for 1 h. The coverslip was processed for the CANT1 staining with a specific polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Prof. Terence L. Kirley, University of Cincinnati) at a 1:20 dilution in PBS. Staining was carried out with AlexaFluor488 or AlexaFluor594 secondary antibodies (1:100 dilution in PBS; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). To reveal calreticulin or GM130 signal the coverslips were also incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin antibody (Stressgene) or with a mouse monoclonal anti-GM130 antibody (BD Biosciences) and AlexaFluor594 or AlexaFluor488 secondary antibody, respectively. Fluorescence was analyzed with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with a 12-bit digital cooled camera (Micromax-1300Y, Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ) or by Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Cells were excited separately at 488 nm or 594 nm, and the single images were recorded. Images were acquired using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA) or Leica AS software. SH-SY5Y cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested from the culture plates in ice-cold Tris/EDTA buffer. Lysis was performed by three cycles of freeze (−70 °C) and thaw (37 °C). Loading of the samples was normalized for the total content of cellular proteins determined by the Bradford assay. 40 μg of each sample were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE Tris/HCl gel and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Pure soluble CANT1 (Fig. 2B, lane 1) and overexpressed recombinant CANT1 (Fig. 2B, lane 5) were used as internal controls for antibody specificity and protein migration. Tunicamycin treatment was performed by incubating 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 15 h in cell culture medium under CO2 atmosphere. Western blots were performed using the polyclonal antibody anti-CANT1 (diluted 1: 500 in PBS) and the rabbit polyclonal anti-EDEM1 antibody (Sigma, at 1:1000 dilution in PBS). Detection was carried out by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and 30 min. The proteins were visualized by the chemiluminescent reagent ImmunStar HRP (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis was performed by using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis software (Kodak Scientific Imaging System, New Haven, CT). Means of densitometric measurements of at least four independent experiments, normalized by the endogenous β-actin values, were compared by Student's t test. Cells were starved for 30 min in Met/Cys free medium, pulsed for 10 min with 100 μCi of 35S-labeled Met/Cys in an 1 ml starvation medium/dish, and chased for the times indicated in the figures with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 mm cold Met/Cys. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared by solubilization of cells in 800 μl/dish ice-cold 2% CHAPS in Hepes-buffered saline, pH 6.8, containing 20 mm ice-cold N-ethylmaleimide and protease inhibitors (HBS). Cell extracts were prepared by 10 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using an anti-HA antibody (Sigma, 2 μg), which recognizes the HA epitope present in substrates in the case of BACE501 and α1AT-NHK, or using a specific antibody in the case of α1AT-WT substrate (Sigma, 2 μg). Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding protein A beads (Sigma), 1:10 (w/v) swollen in HBS) and the selected antibody to the cell extracts. The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed three times with HBS, 0.5% CHAPS, and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Gels were also exposed to BioMax (Eastman Kodak Co.) films and scanned. Relevant bands were quantitated by ImageJ software. ER and Golgi apparatus Ca2+ content had to be drastically reduced before the reconstitution of functional low affinity erAEQ and goAEQ (25.Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R.

Rizzuto R. The Golgi apparatus is an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ store, with functional properties distinct from those of the endoplasmic reticulum.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5298-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To this end the cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in KRB (Krebs Ringer modified buffer: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 37 °C), supplemented with 5 μm coelenterazine n (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), the SERCA pump inhibitor 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (tBuBHQ, 10 μm) and 600 μm EGTA. After this incubation, the cells were washed extensively with KRB supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mm EGTA, and transferred to the chamber of a purpose-built luminometer. The coverslip with transfected cells was then placed in the thermostated chamber in close proximity to a low-noise photomultiplier. The experiments were terminated by lysing the cells with 100 μm digitonin in a hypotonic Ca2+-rich solution (10 mm CaCl2 in H2O), to discharge the remaining AEQ pool. The light signal was collected and calibrated off-line into Ca2+ concentration values, using a computer algorithm based on the Ca2+ response curve of wt and mutant AEQs as previously described (27.Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Transfected aequorin in the measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c). A critical evaluation.J. Biol.

Statistical differences were evaluated by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. DREAM regulates several genes involved in protein synthesis and protein degradation in transgenic B cells overexpressing the daDREAM mutant (13.Savignac M. Mellström B. Bébin A.G. Oliveros J.C. Delpy L. Pinaud E. Naranjo J.R. Increased B cell proliferation and reduced Ig production in DREAM transgenic mice.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 7527-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To better understand the physiological significance of this regulation we decided to search for changes in the expression of genes related to protein folding and degradation in the cerebellum, an area where DREAM regulates Ca2+ homeostasis and the survival of granule cells in culture by controlling the expression of the NCX3 sodium-calcium exchanger (16.Gomez-Villafuertes R. Torres B. Barrio J. Savignac M. Gabellini N. Rizzato F. Pintado B. Gutierrez-Adan A. Mellström B. Carafoli E. Naranjo J.R. Downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator regulates Ca2+ homeostasis and viability in cerebellar neurons.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10822-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Comparative qPCR analysis of the basal expression of potential target genes in wild type and transgenic cerebellum revealed a significant down-regulation of the transcripts of the protein chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, and BiP (immunoglobulin-binding protein; Grp78) as well as a significant induction of EDEM1 (Fig. 1). Calreticulin and calnexin are key components of the protein folding machinery and BiP and EDEM1 are key components of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway that plays a key role in the recognition and extraction of terminally misfolded polypeptides from the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle. Enhanced levels of EDEM1 are associated with accelerated degradation of misfolded glycoproteins (21.Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P.

https://openalex.org/W2089071458,"Background To explore the molecular basis of the different ultrasonic patterns of the human endometrium, and the molecular marker basis of local injury. Methodology/Principal Findings The mRNA and protein expression of FKBP52, progesterone receptor A (PRA), progesterone receptor B (PRB), and HB-EGF were detected in different patterns of the endometrium by real-time RTPCR and immunohistochemistry. There were differences in the mRNA and protein expression of FKBP52, PRB, and HB-EGF in the triple line (Pattern A) and homogeneous (Pattern C) endometrium in the window of implantation. No difference was detected in PRA expression. After local injury, the mRNA expression of HB-EGF significantly increased. In contrast, there was no difference in the mRNA expression of FKBP52, PRB, or PRA. The protein expression of FKBP52, PRB, and HB-EGF increased after local injury. There was no difference in the PRA expression after local injury. Conclusions PRB, FKBP52, and HB-EGF may be the molecular basis for the classification of the ultrasonic patterns. HB-EGF may be the molecular basis of local injury. Ultrasonic evaluation on the day of ovulation can be effective in predicting the outcome of implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2133800480,"Seasonal timing of reproduction and the number of clutches produced per season are two key avian life-history traits with major fitness consequences. Female condition may play an important role in these decisions. In mammals, body condition and leptin levels are correlated. In birds, the role of leptin remains unclear. We did two experiments where we implanted female great tits with a pellet releasing leptin evenly for 14 days, to manipulate their perceived body condition, or a placebo pellet. In the first experiment where females were implanted when feeding their first brood offspring we found, surprisingly, that placebo treated females were more likely to initiate a second brood compared to leptin treated females. Only one second brood fledged two chicks while five were deserted late in the incubation stage or when the first egg hatched. No difference was found in female or male return rate or in recruitment rate of fledglings of the first brood, possibly due to the desertion of the second broods. In our study population, where there is selection for early egg laying, earlier timing of reproduction might be hampered by food availability and thus nutritional state of the female before egg laying. We therefore implanted similar leptin pellets three weeks before the expected start of egg laying in an attempt to manipulate the laying dates of first clutches. However, leptin treated females did not initiate egg laying earlier compared to placebo treated females, suggesting that other variables than the perceived body condition play a major role in the timing of reproduction. Also, leptin treatment did not affect body mass, basal metabolic rate or feeding rates in captive females. Manipulating life history decisions using experimental protocols which do not alter individuals' energy balance are crucial in understanding the trade-off between costs and benefits of life history decisions."
