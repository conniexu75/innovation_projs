https://openalex.org/W1484882395,"Mutations caused by oxidative DNA damage may contribute to human disease. A major product of that damage is 8-hydroxyguanine (oh8Gua). Because of differences in experimental design, the base pairing specificity of oh8G in vivo is not completely resolved. Here, oh8dGTP and DNA polymerase were used in two complementary bacteriophage plaque color assays to examine the mutagenic specificity of oh8Gua in vivo. The first is a reversion assay that detects all three single-base substitutions caused by misreading of guanine analogues inserted at a specific site. oh8Gua at that site gave a mutation frequency of 0.7%. Twenty-two of the 23 mutations were G→T substitutions. The second assay, a forward mutation assay, tests the mispairing potential of any altered nucleotide 1) during incorporation as substrate nucleotide, and 2) after multiple incorporations into a single-stranded DNA gap region of M13mp2. Substituting oh8dGTP for dGTP during polymerization produced 16% mutants; two classes of mutations were observed, both caused by pairing of oh8Gua with A. Seventy-six of 78 mutations were A→C substitutions, and two were G→T substitutions. These assays thus illustrate mutagenic replication of oh8Gua as template causing G→T substitutions and misincorporation of oh8Gua as substrate causing A→C substitutions, both caused by oh8Gua.A mispairs."
https://openalex.org/W2130144581,"The amyloid A4 or beta peptide is a major component of extracellular amyloid deposits that are a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease. We synthesized a series of peptide analogs of the A4/beta peptide which are progressively longer at their carboxyl termini, including 42- and 39-residue peptides which represent the major forms of the A4/beta peptide in senile plaque and the hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis form, respectively. All peptides tested, beta 1-28 through beta 1-42, formed amyloid-like fibrils and previously unreported thin sheet-like structures which stained with thioflavin T and Congo Red. The solubility of beta 1-42 and shorter peptides was pH and concentration dependent, with a broad insolubility profile in the pH range of 3.5-6.5 and at concentrations above 0.75 mg/ml. Only peptides of 42 residues or longer were significantly insoluble at pH 7.4. beta 1-47 and beta 1-52 peptides are highly insoluble in aqueous media but are soluble at 40 mg/ml in the alpha helix-promoting solvent, 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the beta 1-42 peptide migrates as a series of higher molecular mass aggregates whereas shorter peptides migrate as monomers. Aggregation is also dependent on pH, peptide concentration, and time of incubation in aqueous medium. These results indicate that the length of the hydrophobic carboxyl terminus of the A4/beta peptide is important in determining the solubility and aggregation properties of the A4/beta peptide and that acid pH environment, high peptide concentration, and long incubation time would be predicted to be important factors in promoting amyloid deposition."
https://openalex.org/W1494656326,"Products generated by the digestion of human aggrecan with recombinant human stromelysin have been purified and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and C-terminal peptide isolation. N-terminal analysis of chondroitin sulfate-bearing fragments revealed a clearly identifiable sequence initiating at residue Phe342 of human aggrecan, providing evidence for a cleavage site at the Asn341-Phe342 bond located within the interglobular domain. This cleavage site, which separates the G1 domain from the remainder of the molecule, was confirmed by isolation from the liberated G1 domain of a C-terminal tryptic peptide with the sequence YDAICYTGEDFVDIPEN (in which the C-terminal residue is Asn341). This peptide was also isolated from tryptic digests of hyaluronan-binding proteins (A1D4 samples) prepared by CsCl gradient centrifugation of extracts of mature human articular cartilages. Since these A1D4 samples contain G1 domain which accumulates as a result of aggrecan catabolism in vivo, these results clearly indicate that stromelysin cleaves the Asn341-Phe342 bond of human aggrecan in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1543414021,"Complementary DNAs encoding the mouse GLUT3/brain facilitative glucose transporter have been isolated and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that mouse GLUT3 is composed of 493 amino acids and has 83 and 89% identity and similarity, respectively, to the sequence of human GLUT3. In contrast to human GLUT3 mRNA, which can be readily detected by RNA blotting in all human tissues that have been examined, mouse GLUT3 mRNA was only present at significant levels in brain. In situ hybridization showed differential expression of GLUT3 mRNA in several regions of adult mouse brain. Specific expression was observed in the hippocampus, with GLUT3 mRNA levels being higher in areas CA1 to CA3 than in the dentate gyrus. It was also detected in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum and in the cerebral cortex, with higher expression in the piriform cortex than in other regions of the cortex. Antisera to mouse GLUT3 immunoblotted a series of proteins of 45-50 kDa in mouse brain plasma membranes. These results are consistent with GLUT3 being a neuronal glucose transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1560517732,"Abstract Freeze-thawed rat liver mitochondria were extensively washed with potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and the residue was extracted with 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) sodium cholate, 0.5 M KCl. The four beta-oxidation enzyme activities of the washes and the last extract were assayed with substrates of various carbon chain lengths. Our data suggest that the last extract contains a novel acyl-CoA and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. A novel acyl-CoA was purified. The molecular masses of the native enzyme and the subunit were estimated to be 150 and 71 kDa, respectively. One mole of enzyme contained 2 mole of FAD. These properties and immunochemical properties of the enzyme differed from those of three other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases: short-, medium-, and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Carbon chain length specificity of the enzyme differed from that of other acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. The enzyme was active toward CoA esters of long- and fatty acids, but not toward those of medium- and short-chain fatty acids. The specific enzyme activity was greater than 10 times that of long-chain acyl-CoA when palmitoyl-CoA was used as substrate. We propose the name very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase for this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1531681292,"Platelet glycoprotein (GP) V is a Mr 82,000 plasma membrane protein of unknown function that is cleaved by the potent platelet agonist, thrombin, to yield a Mr 69,500 fragment (GPVf1). Platelet GPIb, a disulfide-linked alpha beta heterodimer (Mr 160,000) that forms a noncovalent complex with GPIX (Mr 22,000), functions as the platelet adhesion receptor for surface-bound von Willebrand factor. Association between GPV and GPIb-IX has been suggested by the finding that both proteins are deficient in the Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a bleeding disorder characterized by giant platelets and defective interaction with von Willebrand factor. Here we report that GPV and GPIb-IX are coprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against GPV, GPIb, or GPIX when platelets are solubilized in the mild detergent, digitonin. Treatment of digitonin immunopreciptates with the nonionic detergent, Nonidet P-40, released GPV from anti-GPIb and anti-GPIX mAb precipitates and GPIb-IX from the anti-GPV mAb precipitate. Removal of the Mr 45,000 amino-terminal part of GPIb alpha by treatment with elastase did not abrogate association of GPV with GPIb-IX, showing that the leucine-rich repeat sequences in GPIb alpha are not required for complex formation. Binding studies with 125I-labeled mAbs showed the presence of 24,370 GPIb-IX complexes and 11,170 molecules of GPV/platelet (n = 5). These data show that the leucine-rich glycoproteins GPV and GPIb-IX form a noncovalent complex in the platelet membrane. GPV may play a role in the interaction of platelets with von Willebrand factor."
https://openalex.org/W1559964797,"Mouse ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant enzyme used for determination of the binding site for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and of the residues modified in the inactivation of the enzyme by the enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). The pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding lysine in mouse ODC was identified as lysine 69 of the mouse sequence by reduction of the purified holoenzyme form with NaB[3H]4 followed by digestion of the carboxymethylated protein with endoproteinase Lys-C, radioactive peptide mapping using reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and gas-phase peptide sequencing. This lysine is contained in the sequence PFYAVKC, which is found in all known ODCs from eukaryotes. The preceding amino acids do not conform to the consensus sequence of SXHK, which contains the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding lysine in a number of other decarboxylases including ODCs from E. coli. Using a similar procedure to analyze ODC labeled by reaction with [5-14C]DFMO, it was found that lysine 69 and cysteine 360 formed covalent adducts with the inhibitor. Cysteine 360, which was the major adduct accounting for about 90% of the total labeling, is contained within the sequence -WGPTCDGL(I)D-, which is present in all known eukaryote ODCs. These results provide strong evidence that these two peptides form essential parts of the catalytic site of ODC. Analysis by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides containing the DFMO-cysteine adduct indicated that the adduct formed in the enzyme was probably the cyclic imine S-(2-(1-pyrroline)methyl)cysteine. This is readily oxidized to S-((2-pyrrole)methyl)cysteine or converted to S-((2-pyrrolidine)methyl)cysteine by NaBH4 reduction. This adduct is consistent with spectral evidence showing that inactivation of the enzyme with DFMO does not entail the formation of a stable adduct between the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the enzyme, and the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1580182982,"Protein import into chloroplasts is initiated by a binding interaction between a precursor protein and the surface of the outer envelope. The binding step was previously shown to be energy-dependent (Olsen, L. J., Theg, S. M., Selman, B. R., and Keegstra, K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6724-6729). We took advantage of the broad nucleotide specificity of the energy requirement for binding to investigate the site of the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) requirement. GTP supported precursor binding to chloroplasts. It was not converted to ATP, as determined by direct ATP measurements, and was not transported across the inner envelope. Thus, GTP supported binding from either the intermembrane space or outside the outer membrane. To distinguish between an intermembrane space and an external NTP requirement, we experimentally manipulated the NTP levels inside and outside chloroplasts. Internally generated ATP was able to support binding in the presence of an external membrane-impermeant ATP trap. Therefore, since GTP supported binding from either the intermembrane space or outside the chloroplast, and ATP supported binding from either the intermembrane space or the stroma, we concluded that the site of NTP utilization for precursor binding to chloroplasts was the intermembrane space between the two envelope membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1531773957,"Oxidized (ox-) low density lipoproteins (LDL) is characterized by the formation of lipid peroxides and their decomposition to reactive aldehydes which covalently link to apoB in LDL. These chemical changes are believed to be responsible for the enhanced recognition of ox-LDL by receptors on macrophages in culture. When oxidation is extensive, particle aggregation also occurs. The aim of this study was to characterize aggregation formation and how this influences the interaction of ox-LDL with macrophages in culture. When LDL was oxidized by incubating at 500 micrograms of protein/ml with 10 microM Cu2+ at 20 degrees C for up to 25 h, time-dependent increases in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, conjugated diene content, electrophoretic mobility, and fluorescence at 360 excitation/430 emission were found. Particle aggregation increased in parallel with several parameters of oxidation and increased with increasing incubation temperatures and LDL concentrations used. When evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, apoB fragments of reproducible sizes and higher molecular weight species appeared after mild oxidation of LDL. The percent of total apoB remaining aggregated in sodium dodecyl sulfate was 50-80% at high degrees of oxidation, whereas it was far less in LDL that had been aggregated without chemical modification. This suggested that intermolecular cross-linking of apoB had occurred during oxidation of LDL at high concentrations. Degradation of ox-LDL in mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) increased in parallel with the degree of oxidation and with particle aggregation but reached a plateau after 12 h. Results from cross-competition studies in MPM with soluble and insoluble portions of extensively ox-LDL and with acetyl-LDL were consistent with uptake of soluble ox-LDL via both the scavenger receptor and another receptor on MPM, and uptake of the insoluble ox-LDL by an alternative mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1594358926,"We have analyzed the expression, phosphorylation, and localization of the ribosomal DNA transcription factors UBF1 and UBF2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells in response to serum deprivation. In vivo labeling experiments demonstrate that UBF1 and UBF2 are phosphoproteins. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the in vivo labeled proteins demonstrate that UBF is phosphorylated on serine residues. Following serum deprivation there is no alteration in the cellular levels of UBF1 and UBF2 as determined by Western blotting, but there is an 80% reduction in the level of phosphorylation of UBF compared with logarithmically growing cells. Following serum deprivation there is a redistribution of UBF between the nucleolus, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm. Phosphatase-treated UBF demonstrated a reduced ability to rescue transcription by RNA polymerase I from the rDNA spacer promoter in vitro. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of UBF is a prerequisite for transactivation of RNA polymerase I."
https://openalex.org/W1524999431,"Glycoprotein (GP) IIb is the alpha subunit of platelet integrin GPIIb-IIIa. Analysis of the primary structure of this subunit has indicated the presence of four stretches of amino acid residues that are highly conserved among various integrin alpha subunits and that have been suggested to be putative calcium-binding sites. To verify the Ca(2+)-binding capacity of these conserved domains and their implication in integrin adhesive functions, a fragment corresponding to the amino acid sequence of GPIIb from positions 171 to 464 was expressed. The nucleotide sequence coding for this GPIIb domain was generated by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into the pTG1924 expression vector, and expressed in Escherichia coli strain TGE901. The recombinant protein was purified by gel exclusion chromatography and used in equilibrium dialysis experiments. The results demonstrate that the four binding sites can be occupied by Ca2+. Two classes of binding sites can be detected, including two sites with a Kd of 30 microns and two sites of lower affinity with a Kd of 120 microns. Interaction of Ca2+ with these two classes of sites was inhibited by a large excess of Mg2+ or Mn2+, suggesting that these cations are competitive for the same sites on GPIIb. Thus, the four Ca(2+)-binding sites of GPIIb are not similar and exhibit different affinities for divalent ions. To verify the functional implication of these Ca(2+)-binding sites, the effect of Ca2+ on the binding of fibrinogen to the recombinant protein was analyzed using a solid-phase assay. The results indicate that optimal fibrinogen binding occurs when the four calcium-binding sites are occupied and establish the functional importance of this Ca(2+)-binding domain in the ligand-binding activity of GPIIb."
https://openalex.org/W1511697093,"The structure and flexibility of saccharides have a profound and specific influence in several biological processes such as protein protection and the maintenance of conformational integrity, and in recognition events involving viruses, enzymes, and lectins. To establish the structural bases of these phenomena, we describe herein the extensively refined 2.3-A resolution x-ray structure of a biantennary octasaccharide of the N-acetyllactosamine type, complexed to isolectin I from Lathyrus ochrus. The two octasaccharides are located in clefts at each end of the long axis of the lectin. The conformations of both the lectin and the saccharide are slightly modified upon binding. The complex is stabilized by numerous hydrogen bonds, many of them involving water molecules. It is also stabilized by van der Waals interactions, including some with aromatic residues. A more general model of a possible lectin-glycoprotein interaction is also proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1504884224,"Cytochrome b558 is an important constituent of the superoxide-generating system in neutrophils and B lymphocytes. In this paper, the topology of the cytochrome in human neutrophil membrane was studied using antibodies raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to various regions in the large and small subunits of the cytochrome. The antibodies recognized the cytochrome subunits in immunoblots and the cytochrome in situ. An antibody raised against residues 150-172 in the large subunit (anti-L123) bound to intact neutrophils, indicating that this region is exposed to the outside of the cells. In contrast, antibodies raised against any of the carboxyl-terminal regions of the large and small subunits (anti-LC and anti-SC, respectively) or the amino-terminal region of the small subunit (anti-SN), bound to neutrophils only after the cells were made permeable by freezing and thawing. The region close to the carboxyl terminus of the large subunit was digested by extracellularly added papain and, as a result, an 18-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment was detected. Thus the carboxyl-terminal region of the large subunit is cytoplasmic and/or buried in the membrane, and the region around residues 369-398 is exposed on the cell surface. In contrast to the large subunits, the small subunit in neutrophils was resistant to any of the proteinases tested, although the subunit in membrane or Triton-solubilized preparation was digestible with papain. These results indicate that the large subunit of cytochrome b558 is a transmembrane protein with at least two regions exposed on the cell surface and that the carboxyl terminus of this subunit and both termini of the small subunit are exposed to the cytoplasmic side."
https://openalex.org/W1506926943,"The Ku protein is composed of two polypeptide subunits, p70 and p80, and binds DNA ends in vitro. Previous studies suggested that p70 and p80 are physically associated in vivo, although such an association may have been mediated by DNA. We have now utilized full-length Ku polypeptides synthesized in vitro to examine the association of p70, p80, and linear DNA to form a complex. In gel filtration chromatography, p70 migrates as a 70-kDa structure, whereas p80 migrates at 150 kDa. Co-translation of the two cDNAs yields complexes which migrate at 300 kDa and contain equimolar quantities of the p70 and p80 polypeptides, providing direct evidence that p70 and p80 assemble into a complex in the absence of DNA. To demonstrate that this recombinant protein complex binds DNA, we developed a radiolabeled protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay. When radiolabeled proteins synthesized in vitro were incubated with linear DNA and fractionated in a nonreducing, nondenaturing gel, a band representing a complex of p70, p80, and the DNA was seen. Formation of this Ku-DNA complex required free DNA ends, and binding to DNA ends was not observed with individual p70 or p80 subunits. DNA binding was not reconstituted by mixing the individual subunits together. These studies thus demonstrate that it is the complex of p70 and p80, not individual p70 or p80, which possesses the DNA binding properties previously described for native Ku protein. These results provide new information about the assembly, structure, and DNA binding properties of the Ku protein."
https://openalex.org/W1565671914,"Crystallins are structural proteins responsible for establishing the remarkable optical properties of the lens. Yet many of these highly conserved proteins are also expressed in nonocular tissues, where they have alternative functions apparently unrelated to their structural role in the lens. Here we report that lens alpha-crystallins, some of which function as heat-shock proteins in other tissues, are modified with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). An in vitro enzymatic assay that transfers [3H]Gal to terminal GlcNAc moieties labels alpha A and alpha B crystallins in lens homogenates from man, rhesus monkey, rat, cow, and rhea (an ostrich-like bird). O-Linkage of the saccharide is demonstrated by sensitivity to base-catalyzed beta-elimination and resistance to peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment. Chromatographic analyses of the beta-elimination products and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of [3H]Gal-labeled tryptic peptides confirm the saccharide structure. Isoelectric focusing of [3H]Gal-labeled bovine lens proteins reveals the presence of O-GlcNAc on all four alpha-crystallin subunits, A1, A2, B1, and B2. Electrospray mass spectrometry of bovine alpha-crystallin demonstrates the presence of a single O-GlcNAc substitution on alpha A2. Gas-phase protein sequencing and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of the major radiolabeled tryptic peptide from bovine alpha-crystallin reveal that GlcNAc is attached to the alpha A subunits at serine 162. This post-translational modification may play an important role in the molecular organization of lens alpha-crystallin."
https://openalex.org/W1505805443,"Mammalian hibernation is a unique physiological adaptation that allows the sustainment of life under extremely low body temperatures. In the chipmunk, we found four proteins related specifically to hibernation. These proteins started to diminish in concentration in the blood before and disappeared during hibernation. These proteins reappeared in the blood as hibernation ceased and remained during nonhibernation. The complete or partial amino acid sequences of the four proteins showed that three (27-, 25-, and 20-kDa) were previously unknown, whereas another (55-kDa) is highly homologous with alpha 1-antitrypsin. The three novel proteins are homologous, indicating that they are a family. In the NH2-terminal regions of these proteins, a collagen-like amino acid sequence is present, whereas in their COOH-terminal regions, two sequences, Ser-Ala-Phe-Ala-Val-Lys and Val-Trp-Leu-Glu, are conserved. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and gel permeation chromatography under denaturating conditions revealed that the four proteins form a 140-kDa complex in the plasma fraction. The novel proteins were detected in blood of another hibernator, the ground squirrel, but not in rodent nonhibernators, namely tree squirrels and rats. The present finding is the first identification of a hibernation-specific protein. The presence of specific proteins in hibernators suggests the involvement of genetic factors in the control of hibernation. These proteins provide valuable tools for understanding molecular mechanisms of mammalian hibernation."
https://openalex.org/W1524794243,"Cell division requires an accurate partitioning of cytoplasmic organelles. The segregation of vacuoles in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisaie occurs at a specific time in the cell cycle and is spatially targeted to the small bud. Several yeast vac mutants have been isolated which are defective in this process. We have now cloned the VAC1 gene, corresponding to the first of these mutants, vac1-1. This gene encodes a protein of 515 amino acids, without homolog in the current data bases. It contains neither long hydrophobic stretches nor a classical leader peptide. The most notable aspect of the sequence is the presence of three zinc fingers. Yeast in which the VAC1 gene has been entirely deleted are viable. However, they grow more slowly than wild-type cells and only form microcolonies when grown on glycerol at 37 degrees C. These yeast are defective in vacuole segregation at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. The vac1 mutant was previously shown to mislocalize carboxypeptidase Y to the cell surface, suggesting that Vac1p is involved in more than one vesicular traffic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1495573542,"Besides genistein and daidzein, which are active inducers of the nodYABCSUIJ operon in Bradyrhizobium japonicum, soybean seeds also excrete compounds that are not inducers of the nodYABCSUIJ genes but enhance induction of this operon in the presence of a suboptimal genistein concentration. This synergism was studied in detail, and specific compounds were identified in seed exudate which specifically induce the nodD1 gene but not the nodYABCSUIJ operon. Therefore, our current hypothesis is that the observed synergism is caused by a specific induction of nodD1. The specific nodD1 inducers from soybean seed extract have been purified and characterized chemically. They appear to be derivatives of genistein, glycitein, and daidzein with glucose, malonyl, and acetyl groups attached. Both root and seed exudate appear to contain these compounds, with the seed being the major source. No hydrolysis of these compounds to their aglycone forms was detected in the presence of B. japonicum. A model for nod gene induction in B. japonicum is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2165892124,"The three-dimensional structure of the thyroid hormone metabolite, 3,3'-diiodo-L-thyronine (3,3'-T2), complex with human serum transthyretin (TTR) has been refined to R = 18.5% for 8-2 A resolution data. This is the first detailed description of a thyroid hormone metabolite binding to a thyroid transport protein. The four TTR monomeric subunits form a tetramer in the same manner as the native transthyretin reported earlier (Blake, C. C. F., Geisow, M. J., Oatley, S. J., Rerat, B., and Rerat, C. (1978) J. Mol. Biol. 121, 339-356). The two hormone binding sites of the TTR tetramer are occupied by 3,3'-T2. A statistical disorder model for the ligand was applied with a 50% occupancy to account for the discrepancy between the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry of the binding sites and the lack of such symmetry for 3,3'-T2. The bound metabolite has an overall transoid conformation with the either bridge intermediate between skewed and perpendicular. The hormone metabolite is bound 3.5 A deeper and with a different orientation in the channel than observed for thyroxine (T4), thereby revealing the presence of another set of halogen binding sites close to the center of the tetramer. When compared with the binding of T4, these data show that the 3-iodine of 3,3'-T2 occupies the same site as the 3'-iodine of T4, and the metabolite 3'-iodine occupies the water site observed in the T4 complex. The binding affinity of 3,3'-T2, which is 100-fold lower than that of T4, reflects the lack of the second pair of iodine atoms interacting in the channel. In order to understand the tighter binding of T4 observed in the Ala-109----Thr mutant, modeling studies were carried out that indicate that this modification could shorten the contacts between thyroid hormone iodines and residues 108-110 of the binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1640067147,"The alterations in the absorption and fluorescence spectra observed for the polyene antibiotics filipin and nystatin in the presence of cholesterol are due to an exciton interaction (polyene aggregates) and cannot be attributed to a specific sterol-antibiotic complex. Filipin and nystatin molecules partition into the sterol aggregates, these structures being very efficient to induce exciton interaction; the observed splitting profile indicates that the chromophores are in a stacked arrangement (parallel transition dipoles). For filipin incorporated in lipid bilayers, the sterol is able to induce the same type of aggregate, at variance with nystatin."
https://openalex.org/W1557047917,"Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are a family of 14-15-kDa proteins found in many mammalian cell types in high abundance. Although their precise physiological role remains hypothetical, the transfer of free fatty acids (ffa) to intracellular membrane sites is believed to be an important function of FABP. To better understand the role of FABP in this process, we have examined how the rate of ffa transfer from liver FABP (L-FABP) to model membranes is influenced by variations in ffa structure and properties of the aqueous phase. The rate of transfer of fluorescent anthroyloxy ffa to model acceptor membranes was monitored using a resonance energy transfer assay. The results show that a monounsaturated ffa transfers 2-fold more rapidly than a saturated ffa of equivalent chain length, and a two-carbon increase in acyl chain length results in a 3-fold decrease in transfer rate. The transfer rate decreases logarithmically with increasing ionic strength, suggesting that the aqueous solubility of the ffa is an important determinant of its dissociation rate from L-FABP. Fatty acid binding and the relative partition of n-(9-anthroloxy) ffa to L-FABP as compared with phospholipid membranes both decrease as pH decreases, indicating that ionized but not protonated ffa bind to L-FABP. The rate of ffa transfer from L-FABP to membranes increases approximately 4-fold with increasing pH, suggesting that ionization of the ffa carboxyl group is also an important determinant of the transfer process. Analysis of the dependence of the transfer rate on temperature demonstrates that the delta G++ of the activated state for ffa transfer arises from both enthalpic and entropic processes. These studies demonstrate that the rate of transfer of long chain ffa from L-FABP to membranes is substantially affected by aqueous phase variables as well as properties of the ffa ligand itself."
https://openalex.org/W2146604249,"There have been many reports demonstrating the specific association of several heat shock proteins with unliganded steroid hormone receptors. However, little evidence to date has been proposed to link steroid receptor action with the heat shock response in cells. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect of heat and chemical stress on glucocorticoid receptor subcellular localization in mouse L929 cells and in a stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell line (WCL2) which over-expresses the mouse glucocorticoid receptor. When WCL2 cells are exposed to 43 degrees C, there is a time-dependent decrease in glucocorticoid receptor hormone-binding capacity in the cytosolic fraction of these cells that correlates with a decrease in amount of glucocorticoid receptor protein. Analysis of both cytosolic and nuclear fractions for glucocorticoid receptor protein via quantitative Western blotting reveals that the unliganded glucocorticoid receptor of non-shocked L929 and WCL2 cells is localized primarily in the cytosolic fraction, whereas unliganded receptor of heat-shocked cells is found almost exclusively in the nuclear fraction. A similar shift to nuclear localization for unliganded glucocorticoid receptor is noted in L929 and WCL2 cells subjected to chemical shock (sodium arsenite). As treatment of these cells with glucocorticoid hormone also results in glucocorticoid receptor that is tightly bound within the nuclear fraction, it is speculated that heat and chemical stress provide a hormone-independent mechanism by which glucocorticoid receptor is transformed to the high affinity nuclear-binding state characteristic of the hormone-bound, transcriptionally active receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2156628127,"Two abundant fatty acid-binding proteins (MFB1 and MFB2) were isolated from the midgut cytosol of larval Manduca sexta. As isolated, MFB1 and MFB2 were found to contain bound fatty acids in a 1:1 molar stoichiometric ratio. Immunological screening demonstrated that MFB1 and MFB2 were restricted to the midgut in a gradient distribution, with MFB1 more concentrated in the anterior two-thirds of the midgut and MFB2 more concentrated in the posterior two-thirds of the midgut. MFB1 exchanged fatty acid more readily than did MFB2. MFB1 was about 2% and MFB2 about 12% of the cytosolic protein in the midgut. cDNA clones for MFB1 and MFB2 both encode proteins of 131 amino acids that are rich in lysine and acidic residues. Analysis of the amino acid sequence alignment of the MFBs with six mammalian fatty acid-binding proteins revealed a number of shared features: 9 conserved glycines, presumably important in turns of the beta-strands; a basic amino acid in a position corresponding to the residue reported to participate in binding the carboxyl group of the fatty acid (Arg in MFB1 and Lys in MFB2); and conservation of many of the residues important in binding the aliphatic portion of the fatty acid."
https://openalex.org/W1504644349,"The H2a subunit of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor is rapidly degraded from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when expressed in CHO15B cells. We have reconstituted ER degradation of H2a in semipermeable cells. At least the initial step in degradation (a proteolytic cleavage inhibited by N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone and L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone) can occur in vitro in the presence of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate or in the absence of ATP and postnuclear supernatant, conditions that do not allow vesicular transport of subunit H1 from the ER to the Golgi. We conclude that vesicular transport from the ER is not required for ER degradation of H2a to occur and thus that it takes place in the ER itself."
https://openalex.org/W1488950927,"The surface of Aeromonas salmonicida is covered by a tetragonal paracrystalline array (A-layer) composed of a single protein (A-protein, Mr = 50,778). This array is a virulence factor. Cells containing A-layer and isolated A-layer sheets specifically bound laminin and fibronectin with high affinity. Binding by cells was inactivated by selective removal of A-layer at pH 2.2, and neither isogenic A-layer-deficient A. salmonicida mutants nor tetragonal paracrystalline array producing Aeromonas hydrophila and Aeromonas sobria strains bound either matrix protein. Laminin binding was by a single class of high affinity interactions (cell Kd = 1.52 nM), whereas fibronectin bound via two classes of interactions, one being similar to that of laminin (cell Class 2 interaction Kd = 6.6 nM). This interaction with both proteins was partly hydrophobic. The Class 1 fibronectin interaction was of lower affinity (cell Kd = 218 nM) and distinct. Purified A-protein inhibited binding of both matrix proteins to A-layer, and trypsin cleavage localized the matrix-protein binding region to the N-terminal major trypsin-resistant structural domain of A-protein. Monoclonal antibody inhibition studies showed that A-protein was folded such that Fabs of only one of two antibodies with epitopes mapping C-terminal to this trypsin-resistant peptide was capable of blocking binding."
https://openalex.org/W1534523906,"In the human disease alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency, some variants of human alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor are not secreted. These secretory variants contain frameshift mutations leading to products with normal amino acid sequences to the points of the mutations followed by short, aberrant C-terminal sequences and then premature termination (Nukiwa, T., Takahashi, H., Brantly, M., Courtney, M., and Crystal, R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11999-12004; Sifers, R. N., Brashears-Macatee, S., Kidd, V. J., Muensch, H., and Woo, S. L. C. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7330-7335; Curiel, D., Brantly, M., Curiel, E., Stier, L., and Crystal, R. G. (1989) J. Clin. Invest. 83, 1144-1152). To examine possible causes for lack of secretion of these null variants, we have altered the alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor cDNA to encode a series of abbreviated forms of this protein that retain authentic sequences to the points of truncation. Examination of the fates of these shortened proteins in transiently transfected Cos 1 cells indicates that the aberrant C-terminal sequences in the naturally occurring variants are not responsible for their lack of secretion and show that truncation prior to Pro391 prevents movement from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and therefore secretion. These truncated forms of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor do not form inclusion bodies in the endoplasmic reticulum, rather they are degraded, probably by the pre-Golgi pathway. Our results support the idea that a sequence of at least 391 of the normal 394 residues is essential for the secretion of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor and suggest that residue 391 plays an especially important role, perhaps in allowing or directing proper folding or as part of a transport signal, in the secretion of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1597723737,"Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) by cells of the arterial wall or in the presence of copper ions was shown to result in the peroxidation of its fatty acids as well as its cholesterol moiety. LDL incubation with cholesterol oxidase (CO) resulted in the conversion of up to 85% of the lipoprotein unesterified cholesterol (cholest-5-en-3-ol) to cholestenone (cholest-4-en-3-one) in a dose- and time-dependent pattern. Plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) could be similarly modified by CO. In cholesterol oxidase-modified LDL (CO-LDL), unlike copper ion-induced oxidized LDL (Cu-Ox-LDL), there was no fatty acids peroxidation, and lipoprotein size or charge as well as LDL cholesteryl ester, phospholipids, and triglycerides content were not affected. CO-LDL, however, demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to oxidation by copper ions in comparison to native LDL. Upon incubation of CO-LDL with J-774 A.1 macrophage-like cell line, cellular uptake and degradation of the lipoprotein was increased by up to 62% in comparison to native LDL but was 15% lower than that of Cu-Ox-LDL. Similarly, the binding of CO-LDL to macrophages increased by up to 80%, and cellular cholesterol mass was increased 51% more than the mass obtained with native LDL. Several lines of evidence indicate that CO-LDL was taken up via the LDL receptor: 1) Excess amounts of unlabeled LDL, but not acetyl-LDL (Ac-LDL), effectively competed with 125I-CO-LDL for the uptake by cells. 2) The degradation of CO-LDL by various types of macrophages and by fibroblasts could be dissociated from that of Ac-LDL and was always higher than that of native LDL. 3) A monoclonal antibody to the LDL receptor (IgG-C7) and a monoclonal antibody to the LDL receptor binding domains on apoB-100 (B1B6) inhibited macrophage degradation of CO-LDL. The receptor for Cu-Ox-LDL, which is not shared with Ac-LDL, was also partially involved in macrophage uptake of CO-LDL, since Cu-Ox-LDL demonstrated some competition capability with CO-125I-LDL for its cellular degradation. CO-LDL cellular degradation was inhibited by chloroquine, thus implying lysosomal involvement in the cellular processing of the lipoprotein. Incubation of macrophages with LDL in the presence of increasing concentrations of cholestenone resulted in up to 52% enhanced lipoprotein cellular degradation suggesting that the cholestenone in CO-LDL might be involved in the enhanced cellular uptake of the modified lipoprotein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1679623396,"The leukocyte integrin complement receptor type III (CR3, CD11b/CD18) binds the C3 cleavage product iC3b. Many other integrins bind their ligands via an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) triplet. Both the RGD-containing C3 peptide 1390TRYRGDQDATMS1401 (pro-C3 numbering) and the RGD-like fibrinogen peptide GGAKQAGDV, which binds to the platelet integrin glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, were shown to inhibit the iC3b-CR3 interaction, suggesting that this binding is also RGD-mediated (Wright, S.D., Weitz, J.I., Huang, A. J., Levin, S.M., Silverstein, S.C., and Loike, J.D. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 7734-7738). However, unlike other integrin-ligand interactions, that of CR3 and iC3b is unaffected by the hexapeptide GRGDSP, and substitutions in the RGD triplet of C3 from other species appear to be tolerated. It was, therefore, proposed (Grossberger, D., Marcuz, A., du Pasquier, L., and Lambris, J.D. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 1323-1327) that the highly conserved DATMS portion of the inhibitory C3 peptide may have been responsible for its binding. To address these inconsistencies and directly assess the role of the 1390-1401 segment within the complete iC3b molecule in mediating binding to CR3, a human C3 cDNA was altered by site-directed mutagenesis and the expressed recombinant proteins were examined in a CR3-specific assay. Replacement of RGD by AAA did not abolish rosetting of the corresponding iC3b-coated erythrocytes to human CR3-bearing leukocytes. In addition, mutant iC3b molecules in which the positively charged R1391 (corresponding to K in the fibrinogen peptide) and the highly conserved 1397DATMS sequence were replaced by Q and NAAMA respectively, were still bound by CR3. We conclude that the iC3b-CR3 interaction is not mediated by the RGD triplet or its neighboring residues."
https://openalex.org/W1538046787,"The effects of the steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone on peptidylarginine deiminase protein-L-arginine iminohydrolase, EC 3.5.3.15) levels in adult ovariectomized mouse uterus were studied. The amount of the enzyme in the uterus was considerably diminished by ovariectomy. When the mice were injected with a variety of estrogenic compounds, 17 beta-estradiol-3-benzoate, which was the most potent stimulator of uterine cell proliferation among the estrogens tested, dramatically elevated the enzyme formation of the uterus in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Results of immunohistochemistry with the antiserum against mouse peptidylarginine deiminase demonstrated that the induction of the enzyme by the estradiol exclusively occurred at the luminal and glandular epithelia, corresponding with the previous findings in the normal estrous cycle. Furthermore, administration of the estradiol significantly increased the content of mRNA coding for peptidylarginine deiminase in uterus, indicating the evidence of regulation in pretranslation. On the other hand, progesterone alone did not restore the enzyme level of the ovariectomized mouse, but moderated the action of estrogen when given in concert with estrogen. Thus, the expression of peptidylarginine deiminase in luminal and glandular epithelia of mouse uterus is controlled by the amount of the steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone."
https://openalex.org/W1493391036,"A polyclonal antiserum raised against an oligopeptide with an amino acid sequence corresponding to a sequence of the myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) from mouse macrophages and rat brain recognizes the 80-kDa C-kinase substrate from Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Using this antiserum for quantitative determination of the 80-kDa MARCKS-related protein, we found that the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces a rapid down-regulation of this protein in the fibroblasts. In accordance with earlier reports, TPA causes phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein which can be inhibited by staurosporine. Staurosporine also suppresses the TPA-induced down-regulation, possibly indicating that the down-regulation of the MARCKS-related protein is dependent on its phosphorylation by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1577892321,"Clinical and experimental data indicate that activated oxygen species interfere with vascular endothelial cell function. Here, the impact of extracellular oxidant injury on the fibrinolytic response of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells was investigated at the protein and mRNA levels. Xanthine (50 microM) and xanthine oxidase (100 milliunits), which produces the superoxide anion radical (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), was used to sublethally injure HUVE cells. Following a 15-min exposure, washed cells were incubated for up to 24 h in serum-free culture medium. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen, and PAI-1 activity were determined in 1.25 ml of conditioned medium and t-PA and PAI-1 mRNA in the cell extracts of 2 x 10(6) HUVE cells. Control cells secreted 3.9 +/- 1.3 ng/ml (mean +/- S.D., n = 12) within 24 h. Treatment with xanthine/xanthine oxidase for 15 min induced a 2.8 +/- 0.4-fold increase (n = 12, p less than 0.05) of t-PA antigen secretion after 24 h. The t-PA antigen was recovered predominantly in complex with PAI-1. The oxidant injury caused a 3.0 +/- 0.8-fold increase (n = 9, p less than 0.05) in t-PA mRNA within 2 h. Total protein synthesis was unaltered by xanthine/xanthine oxidase. The oxidant scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase, in combination, abolished the effect of xanthine/xanthine oxidase on t-PA secretion and t-PA mRNA synthesis. Xanthine/xanthine oxidase treatment of HUVE cells did not affect the PAI-1 secretion in conditioned medium nor the PAI-1 mRNA levels in cell extracts. Thus extracellular oxidant injury induces t-PA but not PAI-1 synthesis in HUVE cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588478340,"Cell-surface proteins are transported through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus en route to the plasma membrane. Previously, we have identified three point mutations in the insulin receptor gene that impair transport of the mutant receptors to the cell surface: Asn15→Lys, His209→Arg, and Phe382→Val. Furthermore, these mutations impair post-translational processing steps that normally occur as the receptors are transported through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. In this study, we have demonstrated that the unprocessed Arg209 and Val382 mutant proreceptors are bound to the immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) in the endoplasmic reticulum. This was demonstrated by the fact that monoclonal anti-BiP antibody coimmunoprecipitated the mutant proreceptors. Moreover, when ATP was added to the immunoprecipitates, the mutant proreceptors were released from BiP. In contrast, neither the normal human insulin receptor nor the Lys15 mutant proreceptor was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-BiP antibody. It seems likely that the Lys15 receptor also binds BiP, but that the affinity was too low to resist dissociation during the stringent washing of the immunoprecipitate. In conclusion, these observation are consistent with the hypothesis that binding to BiP explains the impaired transport of mutant receptors through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1569694755,"The hormone insulin is synthesized in the beta cell of the pancreas as the precursor, proinsulin, where the carboxyl terminus of the B-chain is connected to the amino terminus of the A-chain by a connecting or C-peptide. Proinsulin is a weak insulin agonist that possesses a longer in vivo half-life than does insulin. A form of proinsulin clipped at the Arg65-Gly66 bond has been shown to be more potent than the parent molecule with protracted in vivo activity, presumably as a result of freeing the amino terminal residue of the A-chain. To generate a more active proinsulin-like molecule, we have constructed an proinsulin molecule where the carboxyl terminus of the A-chain is connected to the amino terminus of the B-chain by the C-peptide, leaving the critical Gly1 residue free. Transformation of Escherichia coli with a plasmid coding for A-C-B human proinsulin led to the stable production of the protein. By a process of cell disruption, sulfitolysis, anion-exchange chromatography, refolding, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, two forms of the inverted proinsulin differing at their amino termini as Gly1 and Met0-Gly1 were identified and purified to homogeneity. Both proteins were shown by a number of analytical techniques to be of the inverted sequence, with insulin-like disulfide bonding. Biological analyses by in vitro techniques revealed A-C-B human proinsulin to be intermediate in potency when compared to human insulin and proinsulin. The time to maximal lowering of blood glucose in the fasted normal rat appeared comparable to that of proinsulin. Additionally, we were able to generate fully active, native insulin from A-C-B human proinsulin by proteolytic transformation. The results of this study lend themselves to the generation of novel insulin-like peptides while providing a simplified route to the biosynthetic production of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1543721422,"A full length cDNA clone for bovine dopamine beta-hydroxylase was expressed in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells by stable transformation of this cell line with a plasmid expression vector. The recombinant protein exhibited dopamine beta-hydroxylase enzyme activity and was found in both the soluble and membrane fractions of the secretory vesicle. Immunoprecipitation of cell extracts from recombinant cell lines with dopamine beta-hydroxylase antisera followed by fractionation on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two subunits, which migrated to relative molecular masses of 76 and 78 kDa. The recombinant protein co-fractionated with neurotransmitter when subcellular structures were separated by sucrose gradient density centrifugation, suggesting that the protein was routed to the secretory vesicles. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity in those sucrose gradient fractions presumed to contain secretory vesicles was resistant to treatment with trypsin unless the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 was also present to disrupt membrane structure. The 76- and 78-kDa isoform were each found in both the membrane and soluble fractions of the secretory vesicle. Treatment of cultured cells with nerve growth factor or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cyclic AMP alters the relative distribution of the subunits such that the 76-kDa form predominates. The subcellular distribution of a dopamine beta-hydroxylase cDNA clone lacking the first 16 nucleotide residues was also determined. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by this cDNA would be deleted of the first 13 residues of the signal sequence, which were reported to be present in the membrane-bound form, but not the soluble form, of native dopamine beta-hydroxylase (Taljanidisz, J., Stewart, L., Smith, A. J., and Klinman, J. P. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 10054-10061). Immunoprecipitable dopamine beta-hydroxylase derived from expression of the deleted cDNA was found in both the membrane-bound and soluble fractions of the secretory vesicle. These experiments demonstrate that the membrane-bound and soluble forms of dopamine beta-hydroxylase are derived from one primary translation product, which is also sufficient to produce enzyme activity. In addition, the amino-terminal amino acids encoding residues 1-13, which compose the hydrophilic region of the signal sequence, are not necessary for the biogenesis of membrane-bound dopamine beta-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1547503812,"The activation kinetics of single chain urinary-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA) by plasmin have been studied in detail. Nonstandard Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed. To explain our results, we propose a model in which plasmin can exist in two conformations of lower activity (kcat/Km = 1.4 x 10(6) M-1 s-1) or higher activity (kcat/Km = 16.7 x 10(6) M-1 s-1) depending on whether a lysine binding site is occupied or free, respectively. These kinetic studies demonstrate that scu-PA interacts at this binding site (KD approximately 30 nM) and so is able to act as both a substrate and effector in this reaction. Binding was also demonstrated between scu-PA and Glu- or Lys-plasminogen at a high affinity site (KD approximately 65 nM), sensitive to the presence of lysine analogs. This suggests that scu-PA may be almost completely bound to plasminogen in plasma under normal physiological conditions and provides a possible explanation for the fibrin specificity of this activator, as discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1540461268,"4'-Azidothymidine (ADRT) is a novel nucleoside analog, that selectively inhibits human immunodeficiency virus replication in human lymphocytes. Unlike the dideoxyribonucleoside analogs and 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), ADRT retains the 3'-hydroxy group. The pathways of ADRT metabolism were elucidated by determining: (i) the kinetics of the interactions of ADRT and its metabolites with enzymes of thymidine metabolic pathways, (ii) the pool sizes of phosphorylated metabolites, and (iii) the nature of ADRT incorporation into human DNA. ADRT is not a substrate for thymidine phosphorylase, but is metabolized by kinases. Thymidine kinase phosphorylates ADRT to ADRT monophosphate (ADRT-MP). For this enzyme, ADRT has a Ki value of 5.2 microM, in comparison to a Km value of 0.7 microM for thymidine. The Km value of ADRT toward thymidine kinase is 8.3 microM and the rate of ADRT phosphorylation is 1.4% that of thymidine phosphorylation. ADRT-MP has a low affinity toward thymidylate kinase (a Ki value of 28.9 microM versus a Km value of 0.56 microM for thymidylate), and toward thymidylate synthase (a Ki value of 180 microM versus a Km value of 8 microM for deoxyuridylate). The results suggest that ADRT can be activated effectively by cellular kinases without significant interference of normal thymidine metabolism. In cultured human lymphocytes (A3.01, H9, and U937 cells), ADRT was phosphorylated efficiently to ADRT 5'-triphosphate (ADRT-TP), which is the major metabolite of ADRT. The intracellular concentrations of ADRT-TP ranged from 1 to 3.3 microM after 24 h of incubation with 2 microM of ADRT and the half-life of ADRT-TP varied from 3 to 6 h. Although ADRT-TP is a poor competitive inhibitor against dTTP toward DNA polymerases alpha and beta with Ki values of 62.5 and 150 microM, respectively. ADRT-MP was found to be internally incorporated into cellular DNA. The extent of ADRT-MP substitution for dTMP in DNA was 1 in 6979 for A3.01 cells incubated with 2.9 microM ADRT for 24 h. Internal incorporation of ADRT-MP contrasts with the mechanism of other 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogs (i.e. AZT, ddC, ddI, d4T...), which are DNA chain terminators. This finding indicates that a 3'-deoxy structure in a nucleoside analog is not a prerequisite for anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity."

The activation of the enzyme, purified from Escherichia coli, is titratable with GTP. The initial rate of APS formation is increased 116-fold at a saturating concentration of GTP. The enzyme exhibits a GTPase activity that is stimulated by ATP and further enhanced by SO4; however, SO4 alone does not significantly stimulate GTP hydrolysis. The larger subunit of ATP sulfurylase, encoded by cysN, contains a GTP-binding consensus sequence common to other known GTP-binding proteins. This is the first evidence that the sulfate activation pathway is a metabolic target for regulation by a GTPase."
https://openalex.org/W1600454185,"In a patient with Leprechaunism, we have characterized a new mutation in the insulin receptor substituting Arg for Gly at position 31. The proband, the mother, and the maternal grandfather were heterozygous for the mutation. Fibroblasts of the proband show a strongly reduced number of high affinity insulin receptors on the cell surface, whereas fibroblasts of the healthy mother and grandfather show moderately reduced insulin receptor numbers. In the other family members neither the binding defect nor the Arg31 mutation was found. The Arg31-mutant receptor was overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In these cells the mutant alpha beta-proreceptor was not proteolytically cleaved and no transport to the cell surface took place. The proreceptor was unable to bind insulin and to undergo autophosphorylation. In addition, the proreceptor was not recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against conformation-dependent epitopes. These findings suggest that the Gly31 to Arg31 mutant is involved in the insulin receptor dysfunction seen in the Leprechaun patient. The mutation seems to alter the conformation of the receptor in such way that the transport of the proreceptor to the Golgi compartment, where proteolytical processing occurs, is inhibited."

When these structures are compared with the refined 1.8-A structure (R = 0.204) of the fully active aspartic acid-containing enzyme (Martin, P.D., Doscher, M.S., and Edwards, B. F. P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15930-15938), numerous and widespread changes, much greater in number and magnitude than the small structural variations noted previously between the semisynthetic complex and RNase A, are found to have occurred. These changes include the movement of the loop containing residues 65-72 away from the active site, a more or less generalized relocation of crystallographically bound water molecules, and a number of rearrangements in the hydrogen bonding network at the active site. Most changes are far removed from the immediate site of the modifications and are distributed essentially throughout the molecule. The details of many of these changes are unique to each analog. In the asparagine analog, a destabilization in the positioning of active site residue His-119 also appears to have occurred."
https://openalex.org/W1588613452,"Circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic studies have shown that the secondary structure of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) is very similar to that of epidermal growth factor (EGF). The infrared spectra revealed a minor difference between the two proteins, in particular in the beta-sheet structure. A large difference was observed with CD between the two proteins in the apparent conformation each adopts when the disulfide bonds are reduced. Reduced TGF-alpha showed a distinct alpha-helical conformation only at a high trifluoroethanol concentration, whereas reduced EGF assumed an alpha-helical conformation in the absence of trifluoroethanol. This indicates that these two proteins adopt different secondary structures in the absence of disulfide bonds, although they assume similar folding structures in their presence. These data suggest that the disulfide bonds to a large degree dictate the conformation of these two proteins. Additionally, differences in the dynamic behavior between EGF and TGF-alpha were also observed. Infrared experiments showed that the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rate is much higher for TGF-alpha than for EGF, indicating that TGF-alpha is a more flexible molecule. The rate of reduction of the disulfide bonds by dithiothreitol was also faster for TGF-alpha. Therefore, it can be concluded that although EGF and TGF-alpha have a similar overall conformation, TGF-alpha is a more flexible molecule than EGF."
https://openalex.org/W1512528772,"To characterize the mechanisms determining tissue-specific ceruloplasmin gene expression during development, the rat ceruloplasmin gene was isolated in a series of overlapping phage clones. The 5'-flanking region was characterized and the transcription initiation site was identified by primer extension and RNase protection. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this region revealed a typical eukaryotic promotor structure, but no obvious homology with cis-acting elements previously characterized as determining tissue-specific gene expression. Transient expression of chimeric ceruloplasmin-reporter gene constructs containing up to 5200 base pairs (bp) of the 5'-flanking region revealed that sequences 732 bp upstream of the start nucleotide were sufficient to confer hepatocyte-specific expression. The region from -393 to -348 was determined by deletion analysis to contain a positive-acting element, and includes sequence partially homologous to the rat albumin D site. Mobility shift analysis revealed that this region specifically binds a heat-labile nuclear protein from rat liver and from newborn but not adult rat lung. Binding to this region was competed by oligonucleotides corresponding to the albumin D site, but not by oligonucleotides corresponding to binding sites for the hepatocyte transcription factors HNF-1, HNF-3, HNF-4, and C/EBP. These data indicate that ceruloplasmin gene expression is determined in part by a cis-acting region 393 bp upstream of the transcription start site, which binds a previously uncharacterized nuclear protein. The tissue distribution of this nuclear protein suggests that it plays a role in directing ceruloplasmin gene expression in lung and liver during development."
https://openalex.org/W1481594380,"In this report we have examined the ability of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) to induce the activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in the cell line C3HA, a murine 3T3-like cell line which is normally resistant to TNF-induced cytolysis but can be sensitized with inhibitors of transcription and translation. Our results show that TNF is normally unable to induce the activity of PLA2 in this cell, as measured by the release of [3H]arachidonic acid. We find, however, that in the presence of either actinomycin D (Act D) or cycloheximide (CHI), TNF is indeed able to induce phospholipase activity and that the TNF-induced activation of PLA2 occurs 2-4 h before the onset of 51Cr release. The release of [3H]arachidonic acid was inhibited by 40-50% by pretreatment with 1 microM dexamethasone. Treatment with dexamethasone also inhibited cytolysis by 40-50% indicating that the CHI-dependent, TNF-induced activation of PLA2 is a cause, not an effect of cytolysis. The ability of TNF to induce the activity of PLA2 was also tested in two other cell types which are resistant to TNF except in the presence of Act D or CHI: SK-MEL-28, a human melanoma-derived cell line, and pVBETK-1cl15.2, an SV40-transformed murine L cell line. Our results were the same, treatment with a combination of Act D and TNF or CHI and TNF was required to cause activation of PLA2."
https://openalex.org/W1482283694,"The reversible conversion between D-glucose 6-phosphate and D-fructose 6-phosphate catalyzed by yeast phosphoglucoisomerase was studied by phase sensitive two-dimensional 13C-[1H] EXSY NMR spectroscopy at 150.869 and 125.759 MHz, using 13C-enriched substrates in the C2 position of the D-hexose 6-phosphates. The shape of the build-up curves of the cross-peaks associated with the 13C2 resonances of the alpha- and beta-anomers of both D-[2-13C]glucose 6-phosphate and D-[2-13C]fructose 6-phosphate reveals that phosphoglucoisomerase selectively catalyzes the reversible conversion between alpha-D-[2-13C]glucose 6-phosphate and beta-D-[2-13C]fructose 6-phosphate. Quantitative analysis of the build-up curves by three different methods allowed us to conclude that phosphoglucoisomerase not only selectively channels the latter isomerization but also considerably accelerates the anomerization of both D-hexose 6-phosphates. The rate constants of anomerization were indeed much higher in the presence than in the absence of enzyme. The major finding in the present study consists in the anomeric specificity of phosphoglucoisomerase toward the beta-anomer of D-fructose 6-phosphate both as a substrate and a product, contrary to previous proposals. This finding supports recent evidence suggesting the direct channelling of beta-D-fructose 6-phosphate from phosphoglucoisomerase to phosphofructokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1481543695,"The gene that encodes a proteoglycan peptide core rich in serine and glycine (SG-PG) is selectively expressed by hematopoietic cells that store in their cytoplasmic granules negatively charged proteoglycans bound ionically to numerous positively charged proteins. With deletion analysis, a negative transcription regulatory element was located between residues -250 and -190 of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse SG-PG gene, and a positive regulatory element was located between residues -118 and -81. The negative regulatory element was dominantly active in fibroblasts that do not express the SG-PG gene whereas the positive regulatory element was dominantly active in hematopoietic cells that do express the SG-PG gene. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to demonstrate that the proximal element within the gene's atypical promoter resided between residues -40 and -20. As assessed by gel mobility shift analyses, the nuclei of rat basophilic leukemia-1 cells and rat-1 fibroblasts contain a number of trans-acting factors that interact with the positive and negative cis-acting regulatory elements of the SG-PG gene. Furthermore, some of these trans-acting factors appear to be different for the two cell types. These studies on cell types that do and do not express the SG-PG gene indicate that transcription of this proteoglycan peptide core gene is regulated constitutively by both positive and negative cis-acting elements located 5' of an atypical promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1512889229,"To determine the kinetics of human low density lipoproteins (LDL) interacting with LDL receptors, 125I-LDL binding to cultured human fibroblasts at 4 degrees C was studied. Apparent association rate constants did not increase linearly as 125I-LDL concentrations were increased. Instead, they began to plateau which suggested that formation of initial receptor-ligand complexes is followed by slower rearrangement or isomerization to complexes with higher affinity. To test this, 125I-LDL were allowed to associate for 2, 15, or 120 min, then dissociation was followed. The dissociation was biphasic with the initial phase being 64-110-fold faster than the terminal phase. After binding for 2 min, a greater percentage of 125I-LDL dissociated rapidly (36%) than after association for 15 min (24%) or 120 min (11%). Neither the rate constants nor the relative amplitudes of the two phases were dependent on the degree of receptor occupancy. Thus, the duration of association, but not the degree of receptor occupancy affected 125I-LDL dissociation. To determine if binding by large LDL, which is predominantly via apolipoprotein (apo) E, also occurs by an isomerization mechanism, the d = 1.006-1.05 g/ml lipoproteins were fractionated by ultracentrifugation. In contrast to small LDL which bound via apoB-100 and whose dissociation was similar to that of unfractionated LDL, large LDL dissociation after 2, 15, or 120 min of binding did not show isomerization to a higher affinity. This suggests that large and small LDL bind by different mechanisms as a result of different modes of interaction of apoE and apoB-100 with LDL receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1560668197,"T-cell activation is a complex process mediated by cell membrane molecules including the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), adhesive molecules, and cytokine receptors that collectively produce an increase in intracellular Ca2+, and activation of protein kinase C that initiate a genetic program resulting in immunologic function and irreversible differentiation. To understand how these cell membrane events are translated into a genetic regulatory cascade resulting in T-cell function, we have developed an in vitro transcription system, derived from Jurkat T-cells, which demonstrates inducible, cell-type-specific transcription following T-cell stimulation. Nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, which activate protein kinase C and mimic physiological activation through the T-cell antigen receptor, transcribe an interleukin-2 (IL-2) enhancer (-326 to +24) template 5-fold more efficient than nuclear extracts from resting T-cells and severalfold more efficient than extracts from Jurkat cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or ionomycin alone. Further results demonstrate that in vitro transcription of the IL-2 enhancer is T-cell specific since nuclear extracts from rat liver and stimulated HeLa cells are unable to induce IL-2 transcription. The activation-dependent, T-cell-specific in vitro transcription system described here should facilitate the dissection of signals that emanate from the T-cell surface resulting in IL-2 transcription and T-cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1514105849,"The alpha-subunit of Gi-2, in addition to that of Gs (GTP-binding proteins involved in adenylate cyclase inhibition and stimulation, respectively) was ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin in HL-60 cell membranes when a chemotactic receptor was stimulated by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), and the sites modified by cholera and pertussis toxins on the alpha-subunit of Gi-2 were different (Iiri, T., Tohkin, M., Morishima, N., Ohoka, Y., Ui, M., and Katada, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21394-21400). In order to investigate how the functions of Gi-2 were modified by cholera toxin, the ADP-ribosylated and unmodified proteins were purified from HL-60 cell membranes that had been incubated in the presence and absence of cholera toxin, respectively. The modified Gi-2 displayed unique properties as follows. 1) The ADP-ribosylated alpha-subunit had a more acidic pI than the unmodified one, leading to a partial resolution of the modified Gir2 trimer from the unmodified protein by an anion column chromatography. 2) When the purified proteins were incubated with [gamma-32P]GTP, the radioactivity was more greatly retained in the modified Gi-2 than in the unmodified protein. 3) The actual catalytic rate (kcat) of GTP hydrolysis was, indeed, markedly inhibited by cholera toxin-induced modification. 4) There was an increase in the apparent affinity of Gi-2 for GDP by cholera toxin-induced modification. 5) The modified Gi-2 exhibited a low substrate activity for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. 6) A high-affinity fMLP binding to HL-60 cell membranes was more effectively reconstituted with the ADP-ribosylated Gi-2 than with the unmodified protein. These results suggested that the agonist-fMLP receptor complex was effectively coupled with the ADP-ribosylated Gi-2, resulting in the GTP-bound form, and that the hydrolysis of GTP on the modified alpha-subunit was selectively attenuated. Thus, cholera toxin ADP-ribosylated Gi-2 appeared to be not only a less sensitive pertussis toxin substrate but also an efficient signal transducer between receptors and effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1529961550,"When in situ perfused rat livers were administered tracer or physiologic concentrations of [35S]cysteine, a zone III (perivenous) predominance of uptake was observed in either antegrade or retrograde single-pass perfusion, as determined by quantitative densitometry of autoradiographs of liver section. This pattern remained unchanged from 30 s to 5 min observed. At higher supraphysiologic doses a more uniform acinar distribution of cysteine uptake was observed. Uptake rates of cysteine in antegrade perfusion indicated an apparent saturable component at low but physiologic cysteine concentrations. That uptake rather than metabolic trapping accounts for this perivenular pattern was supported by finding identical zonal distribution under conditions in which GSH and protein synthesis were markedly inhibited. Furthermore, increasing or decreasing hepatic cysteine pool sizes did not affect the extraction or zonation. These results suggest that a low Km transport system for cysteine is localized in zone III of the hepatic acinus."
https://openalex.org/W1528464768,Vanadate was used as a substrate analogue to modify and subsequently localize active site serine residues of isocitrate lyase from Escherichia coli. Irradiation of the enzyme on ice with UV light in the presence of vanadate resulted in inactivation. Inactivation was prevented by the substrates glyoxylate or Ds-isocitrate and to a much lesser extent by succinate. Reduction of photoinactivated isocitrate lyase by NaBH4 partially restored enzyme activity. The photomodified enzyme was labeled by reduction with NaB[3H]4 in the presence and absence of the substrates succinate plus glyoxylate. Highly differential labeling of serine residues 319 and 321 in the absence of substrates suggests their importance in the action of isocitrate lyase. These residues are highly conserved in all five known sequences of this enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W1528913275,"We have analyzed the structure and DNA-binding characteristics of the IgH enhancer-binding regulatory protein NF-mu NR. We estimate that there are at least 5000 molecules of NF-mu NR protein/nucleus of non-B cells, based on the yield of active protein following purification. Purified NF-mu NR exists as a tetramer of 40-kDa subunits, even in the absence of its DNA-binding substrate. The protein complex binds to four binding sites flanking the immunoglobulin heavy chain mu enhancer core. Separately, individual sites bind to the tetrameric complex with affinities varying over a 100-fold range. However, when a low affinity site and a high affinity site are present on the same DNA molecule, both are occupied at the same NF-mu NR concentration; thus, there is a strong cooperative interaction between binding sites. The tetrameric structure provides a mechanism for binding cooperativity in which initial binding is mediated through a high affinity site on the DNA molecule followed by the engagement of the low affinity site juxtaposed to adjacent protein subunits. The presence of multiple binding sites flanking the mu enhancer core may reflect the influence of NF-mu NR binding on enhancer three-dimensional structure, transcription factor binding, and/or nuclear matrix interactions for cell type-specific enhancer function."
