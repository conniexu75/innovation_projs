https://openalex.org/W2056215835,"Abstract The proteins involved in protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions to form the core structure of nuclear 40S hnRNP particles in HeLa cells have been identified and characterized. Through complete analysis of nuclear extracts on sucrose density gradients and controlled salt dissociation of particle proteins, six lower molecular weight polypeptides are identified as the protein constituents of the 40S ribonucleoprotein complex which appears in the electron microscope as 210 A spherical particles. 40S hnRNP particles isolated from Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts show a strikingly similar protein composition to the human cells. The proteins are specifically associated with rapidly labeled nonribosomal nuclear RNA. Particle proteins from HeLa cells migrate in polyacrylamide gels as three groups of closely spaced doublets (groups A, B and C) and are present in a simple fixed stoichiometry. The group C proteins (C 1 and C 2 of 42,000 and 44,000 daltons) interact directly with RNA to form a smaller high salt-resistant RNP complex. The group A proteins (A 1 and A 2 of 32,000 and 34,000 daltons) are major nuclear proteins and constitute 60% total particle protein mass. These two proteins are basic with isoelectric points near 9.2 and 8.4, respectively, and are characterized by an unusual amino acid composition, including high glycine (25%) and the unusual modified basic residue identified as N G ,N G -dimethylarginine. The major particle proteins (A 1 and A 2 ) interact electrostatically with nucleic acids and apparently function structurally in the packaging and stabilization of hnRNA in a manner analogous to the histones in chromatin υ bodies. The similarity in protein composition of core RNP particles from different cell types (especially in the basic proteins, A 1 , A 2 and B 1 ) is consistent with a conserved particle structure and function in eucaryotes."

In contrast to the effects of ganglionic blockade in fed controls, similar blockade in fasted animals is without significant effect on [3H]-norepinephrine retention or endogenous norepinephrine in the heart. These data are consistent with suppression of centrally mediated sympathetic activity in the fasted state. The decrease in norepinephrine turnover during fasting is completely reversed by 1 day of refeeding."
https://openalex.org/W2035767489,"Systemic and intracerebroventricular administration of analgesic doses of morphine resulted in large increments of spontaneous multiple unit activity in the periaqueductal gray matter of the awake rat. Intracerebroventricular injection of methionine enkephalin gave analgesia in only 8 of 19 rats, but in all 8, and in no others, increased periaqueductal multiple unit firing was also seen. These findings support the view that the periaqueductal gray matter is actively involved in endogenous mechanisms of analgesia. A striking observation was that enkephalin caused electrographic and behavioral epileptic phenomena in most animals. This observation together with other recent findings suggests that endogenous enkephalin may play some role in epileptogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2081134321,"Epidermoid cervical carcinoma cells (CaSki line) have been established in continuous culture. When leukocytes from cervical cancer patients were incubated with CaSki culture fluid concentrates, inhibition of leukocyte migration was observed in more than 70 percent of the patients tested. By contrast, significantly less inhibition was observed with normal donor leukocytes or leukocytes from patients with other types of cancer. These results were consistent with the expression of tumor-associated antigen by CaSki cells. Analysis of the serum from the donor of the cell line at the time of tumor biopsy, and of CaSki culture fluids, demonstrated the presence of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin."

https://openalex.org/W2022854533,"After injection of [3H]dihydrotestosterone, a major testosterone metabolite, radioactivity is concentrated in nuclei of certain cells in the midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata, cerebellum, and spinal cord. While there is some overlap between androgen and estrogen target neuron distribution, certain motor neurons appear to be selectively labeled by androgen; in contrast, estrogen localization prevails in sensory neurons. These results may help to explain why male sexual behavior in some rodents is not fully activated with dihydrotestosterone alone but in addition requires estradiol, a testosterone metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1999027562,Bacterial behavior is shown to be modulated through a simple on-off switching device which directs migration toward favorable conditions and away from unfavorable ones. The behavioral response is controlled by a rudimentary memory which allows the bacteria to sense gradients over time. The memory can be explained by a biochemical system involving a response regulator whose level relative to a threshold controls flagellar function. The level of the response regulator is itself controlled by factors such as enzyme levels and environmental stimuli. The molecular basis of the model appears to be relevant to more complex hormonal and neural signaling systems.

Nanogram concentrations of the growth hormones potentiated erythropoietin-stimulated erythropoiesis, but not granulopoiesis, in a species-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2005730002,"When the horseshoe crab is kept in constant darkness, the lateral eye produces larger electroretinographic and optic nerve responses at night than during the day. These circadian rhythms are mediated by synchronous bursts of efferent impulses in the optic nerve trunk. The endogenous efferent activity appears to increase both the gain and the quantum catch of the photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2046943604,"The use of high-pressure liquid chromatographic separation in conjunction with laser-induced fluorescence detection permits the analysis of trace fluorescent species at new limits of sensitivity. This technique was applied to the carcinogens aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2, which were linearly quantitated to 7.5 × 10-13 gram. The procedure consists of forming more fluorescent aflatoxin derivatives, eluting the aflatoxins from a reverse-phase column, focusing the 325-nanometer output of a helium-cadmium ion laser into a suspended droplet of the eluent, and measuring the resulting fluorescence using phase-sensitive detection."
https://openalex.org/W2043472514,"The A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) influenza virus which has not been isolated from man for several years, was recently isolated from pigs in Hong Kong. Influenza viruses similar to A/Victoria/3/75, which are currently circulating in man, were also isolated from pigs. Both above-mentioned viruses could be transmitted readily from pig to pig in experimental studies. The isolation of influenza viruses similar to A/Hong Kong/68 from pigs in 1976 suggests that pigs may serve as a potential reservoir for future human pandemics as well as a possible source of genetic information for recombination between human and porcine strains of influenza virus."
https://openalex.org/W2038583974,"Studies of the mechanism of benzo[a]pyrene metabolism to reactive diol epoxides and of their disposition indicate that the metabolic intermediates of the activation pathways, 7,8-epoxide and trans-7,8-diol, as well as the two stereoisomeric diol epoxides are all optically active. Benzo[a]pyrene is converted to optically active 9,10-epoxides of (-)trans-7,8-diol by three enzymatic steps: (i) stereospecific oxygenation at the 7,8 double bond of benzo[a]pyrene by the mixed-function oxidases to essentially a single enantiomer of 7,8-epoxide, (ii) hydration of the 7,8-epoxide by epoxide hydratase to an optically pure (-)trans-7,8-diol, and (iii) stereoselective oxygenation by the mixed-function oxidases at the 9,10 double bond of the (-) trans-7,8-diol to optically active r-7,t-8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene and optically active r-7,t-8-dihydroxy-c-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene in a ratio of approximately 10 to 1."

https://openalex.org/W2048919579,"Abstract From livers of estrogen-stimulated female Xenopus toads, large quantities of estrogen-induced, poly(A)-containing RNA could be isolated, showing the same characteristics as vitellogenin mRNA obtained from hormone-treated males. Using cDNA hybridization, vitellogenin mRNA was monitored in the cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing RNA of the liver of male toads during 13 days of primary and the initial phase of secondary stimulation with estrogen. During primary stimulation, low amounts of vitellogenin mRNA, not exceeding 0.18% of the cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing RNA, were first detected after 12 hr of hormone treatment, and vitellogenin mRNA was found to increase on the average to 34% of the cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing RNA on the seventh day of hormone treatment. After 3 days of primary stimulation, accumulation of vitellogenin mRNA leveled off, showing no significant increase in the cytoplasm up to 13 days of hormone treatment. As judged from incorporation of 32 PO 4 into blood plasma proteins of males during primary stimulation, vitellogenin was first detected after 1 day, and its synthesis was found to increase dramatically until the thirteenth day of hormone treatment. This implies that there is a coincidence between appearance and extent of synthesis of vitellogenin and the abundance of vitellogenin mRNA in the cytoplasm, but there is evidence that during later phase of primary stimulation (day 3–13), the increase in synthesis of vitellogenin cannot be attributed anymore to a significant accumulation of vitellogenin mRNA. In male Xenopus, estrogen-induced synthesis of vitellogenin is no more detectable 41 days after hormone injection, and the concentration of vitellogenin mRNA was found to be"

The more publicity given to the story, the greater the rise in motor vehicle deaths thereafter. This rise apparently occurs because suicide stories stimulate a wave of imitative suicides, some of which are disguised as motor vehicle accidents."
https://openalex.org/W1994883725,"REPRODUCTIVE competition for females among males of a given species can take many forms, some of which (like mating plugs) may place constraints on the mating opportunities of males and intensify competition for available females. I have studied the reproductive behaviour of two garter snake species (Thamnophis sirtalis and T. butleri) in the field for 5 years. They do not exhibit pair-bonding, paternal care of offspring, territoriality, or intrasexual combat. Sexual selection in this mating system should favour males which compete to locate, court and mate with the maximum number of females1. Yet I have observed numerous solitary female Thamnophis within the same time periods and areas in which other females were being vigorously courted, often by several males. I have previously observed that the anterior cloaca of any recently mated female Thamnophis contains a copulatory plug which occludes the oviductal orifices2. The plug evidently is formed by the copulating male after sperm transfer. I interpreted this as a form of intrasexual competition in which the successfully copulating male makes the female temporarily unavailable to other males and reduces the likelihood of multiple inseminations. Some reports3,4 indicate that multiple inseminations are possible. I present here evidence from the field that male garter snakes recognise females with a copulatory plug and behave as if these females were unavailable."

https://openalex.org/W2063369566,Addition of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabinol to an incubation medium containing decapsulated mouse testes caused a significant reduction in the accumulation of testosterone in the medium. This result suggests that the reported effects of cannabis on male sexual and reproductive function may result from direct inhibition of testicular steroidogenesis by both psychoactive and nonpsychoactive constituents of marihuana.

[D-Trp8]-Somatostatin is eight to ten times more potent than somatostatin in inhibiting insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone secretion. [D-Trp8, D-Cys14]-Somatostatin is more potent than [D-Cys14]-Somatostatin, but retains its relative selectivity in being a more potent inhibitor of the secretion of glucagon and growth hormone than of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W2070059627,Optical diffraction and image reconstruction can be used to correlate the electron microscope image of the biological membrane with its electron density projection. Such correlation shows that a single purple membrane particle contains 9 to 12 protein molecules--63 to 84 transmembrane alpha helices--a complexity two to ten times greater than that previously suggested for membrane particles.
https://openalex.org/W2086055541,"The defensive secretions of some chrysomelid beetles belonging to the genera Chrysolina, Chrysochloa, and Dlochrysa contain complex mixtures of cardenolides. The spectral data for some of these compounds suggest that they are monohydroxylated digitoxigenin derivatives linked to a pentose (such as xylose or arabinose). Evidence indicates that the beetles do not sequester these steroid glycosides from their host plants."
https://openalex.org/W1967091860,"Acanthocephalan males have cement glands associated with the vas deferens, secretions from which seal the female vagina with a cap after copulation and so prevent subsequent insemination. Homosexual rape results in the male victim having the genital region sealed off with cement and effectively removed from the reproductive population. Sperm and cement are transferred to females during copulation, but apparently only cement is transferred to males during homosexual rape. Acanthocephalans conform to a parental investment model, and we interpret the evolution of the cement gland and sexual behavior as the result of sexual selection."
https://openalex.org/W2002409896,"From ovaries dissected from developing and emerged adults of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, two substances having high molting hormone activity were isolated. One of these was identified as 2-deoxy-alpha-ecdysone by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Although this compound had previously been isolated from the fern Blechnum minus and postulated to be the precursor of alpha-ecdysone, it had not been obtained from insect material. The compound is also contained in the form of a conjugate in ovaries as well as in diapausing silkworm embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2094657145,We report the presence of serum cryoimmunoglobulins in patients with attacks of a newly described epidemic arthritis--Lyme arthritis--and in some patients with a characteristic skin lesion--erythema chronicum migrans--that sometimes precedes the onset of the arthritis. Seven patients who had cryoimmunoglobulins at the time of the skin lesion have developed arthritis; four patients without them have not. The cryoglobulins in patients with the skin lesion consisted primarily of immunoglobulin M (IgM); those in patients with arthritis often included both IgM and IgG. These findings support the hypothesis that a common origin exists for the skin and joint lesions and suggest that circulating immune complexes may have a pathogenetic role in Lyme arthritis.

To assess the degree of asymmetry, the x-ray diffraction data from the membrane have been analyzed for possible electron-density profiles. A recent theory predicts that only a limited number of profiles are consistent with the continuous diffraction data, and two possible profiles have been found. Both profiles indicate that the protein molecules span a lipid bilayer in the membrane. Both profiles are asymmetric; there are more lipid molecules in one half of the membrane than in the other, and the bacteriorhodopsin molecule shows a slight complementary asymmetry."

HeLa cells or human lymphoblasts display only a single HPRT spot located at the same position as the most basic of the hemolyzate HPRT spots. This suggests that the most basic spot is the form initially synthesized, and the more acidic hemolyzate HPRT spot (a pseudoisozyme) is probably derived from the first by an age-related modification (for example, deamidation).
