https://openalex.org/W2100231995,"General anesthetics are widely used in clinical practice. On the molecular level, these compounds have been shown to modulate the activity of various neuronal ion channels. However, the functional relevance of identified sites in mediating essential components of the general anesthetic state, such as immobility and hypnosis, is still unknown. Using gene-targeting technology, we generated mice harboring a subtle point mutation (N265M) in the second transmembrane region of the beta3 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. In these mice, the suppression of noxious-evoked movements in response to the intravenous anesthetics etomidate and propofol is completely abolished, while only slightly decreased with the volatile anesthetics enflurane and halothane. beta3(N265M) mice also display a profound reduction in the loss of righting reflex duration in response to intravenous but not volatile anesthetics. In addition, electrophysiological recordings revealed that anesthetic agents were significantly less effective in enhancing GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents, and in decreasing spontaneous action potential firing in cortical brain slices derived from mutant mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a single molecular target, and indeed a specific residue (N265) located within the GABA(A) receptor beta3 subunit, is a major determinant of behavioral responses evoked by the intravenous anesthetics etomidate and propofol, whereas volatile anesthetics appear to act via a broader spectrum of molecular targets."

However, superoxide generation by NOX1 has been difficult to demonstrate. Here we show that NOX1 generates superoxide when co-expressed with the p47 phox and p67 phox subunits of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase but not when expressed by itself. Since p47 phox and p67 phox are restricted mainly to myeloid cells, we searched for their homologues and identified two novel cDNAs. The mRNAs of both homologues were found predominantly in colon epithelium. Differences between the homologues and the phagocyte NADPH oxidase subunits included the lack of the autoinhibitory domain and the protein kinase C phosphorylation sites in the p47 phox homologue as well as the absence of the first Src homology 3 domain and the presence of a hydrophobic stretch in the p67 phox homologue. Co-expression of NOX1 with the two novel proteins led to stimulus-independent high level superoxide generation. Stimulus dependence of NOX1 was restored when p47 phox was used to replace its homologue. In conclusion, NOX1 is a superoxide-generating enzyme that is activated by two novel proteins, which we propose to name NOXO1 (NOX organizer 1) and NOXA1 (NOX activator 1).

https://openalex.org/W2151868528,"The 37-kDa protein annexin 1 (Anx-1; lipocortin 1) has been implicated in the regulation of phagocytosis, cell signaling, and proliferation and is postulated to be a mediator of glucocorticoid action in inflammation and in the control of anterior pituitary hormone release. Here, we report that mice lacking the Anx-1 gene exhibit a complex phenotype that includes an altered expression of other annexins as well as of COX-2 and cPLA2. In carrageenin- or zymosan-induced inflammation, Anx-1-/- mice exhibit an exaggerated response to the stimuli characterized by an increase in leukocyte emigration and IL-1beta generation and a partial or complete resistance to the antiinflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. Anx-1-/- polymorphonuclear leucocytes exhibited increased spontaneous migratory behavior in vivo whereas in vitro, leukocytes from Anx-1-/- mice had reduced cell surface CD 11b (MAC-1) but enhanced CD62L (L-selectin) expression and Anx-1-/- macrophages exhibited anomalies in phagocytosis. There are also gender differences in activated leukocyte behavior in the Anx-1-/- mice that are not seen in the wild-type animals, suggesting an interaction between sex hormones and inflammation in Anx-1-/- animals."
https://openalex.org/W1966092430,"During mammalian cell division, DNA methylation patterns are transferred accurately to the newly synthesized DNA strand. This depends on maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity. DNA methylation can affect chromatin organization and gene expression by recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Here we show that the methyl-CpG binding protein, MeCP2, interacts directly with the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1. The region of MeCP2 that interacts with Dnmt1 corresponds to the transcription repressor domain which can also recruit HDACs via a corepressor, mSin3A. Dnmt1 can form complexes with HDACs as well as MeCP2. Surprisingly, the MeCP2-Dnmt1 complex does not contain the histone deacetylase, HDAC1. Thus, Dnmt1 takes the place of the mSin3A-HDAC1 complex, indicating that the MeCP2-interacting Dnmt1 does not bind to HDAC1. Further, we demonstrate that MeCP2 can form a complex with hemimethylated as well as fully methylated DNA. Immunoprecipitated MeCP2 complexes show DNA methyltransferase activity to hemimethylated DNA. These results suggest that Dnmt1 associates with MeCP2 in order to perform maintenance methylation in vivo. We propose that genome-wide and/or -specific local DNA methylation may be maintained by the Dnmt1-MeCP2 complexes, bound to hemimethylated DNA.

The occurrence of DNA methylation is closely connected with chromatin organization by both histone acetylation and methylation, which are catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HDACs) 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; CRID, co-repressor-interacting domain; TRD, transcription repressor domain; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; RFTS, replication foci targeting sequence; MBD, methyl-CpG binding domain; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and methyltransferases, respectively (8Burgers W.A.

A maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1, preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA after DNA replication (9Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat.

Therefore, the patterns of DNA methylation in the genome are maintained by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity of Dnmt1, allowing inheritance of appropriate DNA methylation patterns. Targeted disruption of Dnmt1 causes partial loss of genomic methylation that leads to lethality (2Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R.

The carboxyl-terminal region of Dnmt1 transfers methyl groups fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine to cytosines in CpG dinucleotides. It is thought that an N-terminal region of Dnmt1 regulates Dnmt1 function by protein-protein interactions with factors such as PCNA (11Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which are associated with DNA replication, histone deacetylation, and gene expression during the cell cycle. Methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBDs) bind DNA, including methylated CpG dinucleotides. MBDs are involved in chromatin organization and gene silencing via recruitment of HDACs (16Wade P.A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Individual MBDs have specific methylated DNA binding properties and interact with transcriptional repressors and chromatin remodeling factors (5Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5486) Google Scholar). MeCP2, the first cloned Methyl-CpG binding protein, binds to single CpG dinucleotides that are symmetrically methylated (17Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), whereas other MBDs have little or no binding activity to single symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotides (18Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Thus, MeCP2 possesses higher affinity for all or most of the methylated CpG sites than other known MBDs. MeCP2 represses gene expression by recruiting mSin3A, which interacts with HDAC1 (19Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar,20Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of MeCP2 is ubiquitous, and its expression is relatively abundant (21D'Esposito M. Quaderi N.A. Ciccodicola A. Bruni P. Esposito T. D'Urso M. Brown S.D. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Coy J.F. Sedlacek Z. Bachner D. Delius H. Poustka A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutations of the MeCP2 gene cause loss of body weight and a neurological disorder in the mouse, which is consistent with MECP2 mutations in Rett syndrome (23Guy J. Hendrich B. Holmes M. Martin J.E. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 24Chen R.Z. Akbarian S. Tudor M. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). This indicates that MeCP2 is not essential for development but participates in epigenetic control of neuronal function. Dnmt1 does not contain a methyl-CpG binding domain common to the MBD family (18Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), raising the question of how this enzyme is recruited to hemimethylated DNA and how it replicates the methylation pattern. We tested the hypothesis that the pattern of DNA methylation is replicated through recruitment of Dnmt1 by MeCP2, which binds to the methylated cytosine of the template DNA. Here we show that Dnmt1 interacts with MeCP2 directly, and this interaction is mainly dependent upon the transcription repressor domain (TRD) of MeCP2. The Dnmt1-MeCP2 complex does not include HDAC1 but has maintenance methyltransferase activity. Moreover, MeCP2 can preferentially associate with both hemimethylated and fully methylated DNA under a physiological salt concentration condition. These results suggest that both Dnmt1 and MeCP2 may contribute to maintenance of DNA methylation during DNA replication by multiple regulatory machineries including various protein-protein interactions. We subcloned rat Dnmt1 cDNA (25Kimura H. Takeda T. Tanaka S. Ogawa T. Shiota K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) into pCS2+MT (26Endo T.A.

Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar) and then cloned Myc-tagged rat Dnmt1 cDNA and rat Dnmt1 cDNA into pcDNA3 to produce pcDNA3-Myc-Dnmt1. We cloned rat MeCP2 cDNA and internal deletion constructs (ΔMBD, ΔCRID, and ΔTRD) into pCMV2-FLAG (Sigma). Individual domains of rat MeCP2 were cloned into pGEX 4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) by PCR using appropriate sets of primers. We cloned mouse HDAC1 cDNA into pHM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using PCR from pCI-HDAC1-myc (gift from Dr. C. Seiser) to produce pHM-HA-mouse HDAC1. We verified all constructs by DNA sequencing. We maintained cell lines in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transfection of 293T, we seeded 4 × 105 cells before the procedure and transfected them with DNA (21 μg) using a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (27Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). The culture medium was changed 6 h after transfection, and the cells were incubated for an additional 42 h before harvest. We transiently transfected 293T cells in culture dishes (60-mm diameter) with appropriate expression vectors including pME18S SRα-Rb (gift from Dr. T. Yamamoto) and harvested cells 48 h after transfection. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm at 4 °C. Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the cell pellets, and the cells were lysed by pipetting and then placed for 30 min on ice. Cleared whole cell extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation for 1 h on ice. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed using anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-Rb (C-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the mixture was rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (1 ml). The precipitates or cleared extracts were then subjected to Western blot analysis. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk. We incubated the membrane at room temperature for 1 h with appropriate antibodies described above in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.5% skim milk. The blots were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody and washed in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoreactive bands were revealed using an ECL Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reprobing, blotted membrane was treated with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C. The membrane was washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk. The membrane was subjected to antibody reactions as described above. We expressed GST and GST fusion proteins inEscherichia coli XL1-blue using the pGEX vector system and purified protein from crude bacterial lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). We carried outin vitro transcription/translation using the TNT system (Promega). Myc-Dnmt1 was translated in vitro from pCS2+MT-Dnmt1. We performed pull-down assays by preincubating GST or GST fusion protein and glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% skim milk) at room temperature. After 10 min, in vitrotranslated proteins were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times in the ice-cold binding buffer without 0.5% skim milk. Pelleted beads were suspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. Alternatively, we transiently transfected 293T cells in culture dishes (100-mm diameter) with pcDNA3 (30 μg) or pcDNA3-Myc-Dnmt1 (30 μg), and the cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection and then lysed. GST or GST fusion protein was added into the lysate and incubated for 1 h on ice. Subsequently, glutathione-Sepharose beads were added and incubated with a rotary for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer three times. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Myc antibody (9E10). We transiently transfected 293T cells in culture dishes (90-mm diameter) with pCMV2-FLAG vector or pCMV2-FLAG-MeCP2 (30 μg) and collected cells 48 h post-transfection. We lysed cells in Nonidet P-40 buffer for 30 min at 4 °C and removed debris by centrifugation. The cleared lysates (total protein amount 1 mg) were then subjected to each DNA binding reaction for 1 h at 4 °C using 6 μg (30 μmol) of double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to E-cadherin CpG nucleotide sequences (28Rhee I. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Lengauer C. Herman J.G. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Baylin S.B. Schuebel K.E. Nature. 2000; 404: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) (Sigma Genosys Japan KK). These were either nonmethylated, hemimethylated (on either the sense strand or on the antisense strand), or fully methylated, and all were biotinylated at the 5′-ends. The sense strand has the sequence 5′-CCAGCCCGGCCCGACCCGACCGCACCCGGCGC-3′ (portion of methylated cytosines are underlined). Methylated oligonucleotides were generated at specific portions by using methylated precursors. Streptavidin-magnetic beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to collect the biotinylated oligonucleotides with binding proteins, and incubation was continued with a rotary for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (1 ml) and were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody (M2). We transfected 293T cells with either Myc-Dnmt1 and FLAG-MeCP2 expression vectors, empty vector, and FLAG-MeCP2 expression vectors, empty vector alone, or FLAG-Dnmt1 expression vector. Cells were lysed using Nonidet P-40 buffer as described above. After immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody, beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and then the precipitates were assayed for methyltransferase activity in a 100-μl reaction solution containing a 32-bp hemimethylated oligonucleotide substrate (500 ng (25 pmol)), which is the same as described above (28Rhee I. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Lengauer C. Herman J.G. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Baylin S.B. Schuebel K.E.

After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C or 4 °C, we removed unincorporated nuclides with Sephadex G-50 spin column (AmershamBiosciences) and determined incorporation of radioactivity in ASCII solvent (Amersham Biosciences) by liquid scintillation counting (13Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The majority of MeCP2 is concentrated on heterochromatin in the genome (29Nan X. Tate P. Li E. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Lysis under high salt concentration conditions results in extraction of all MeCP2 in the cell (17Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). However, a high salt extraction also disrupts weaker affinity interactions. The extraction conditions used here take advantage of excluding MeCP2 associated with tightly condensed chromatin such as heterochromatin and of selecting MeCP2 associated with relatively loose chromatin such as during DNA replication. In previous reports, an interaction of Dnmt1 with PCNA (11Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), DMAP1 (12Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), HDACs (19Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar), and Rb (15Pradhan S. Kim G.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) has been shown under the same physiological salt condition. To test an interaction of Dnmt1 with MeCP2, we co-transfected 293T cells with plasmid encoding Myc-tagged, full-length rat Dnmt1 (Myc-Dnmt1) and FLAG-tagged, full-length rat MeCP2 (FLAG-MeCP2). Then we lysed the cells using a lysis buffer with a typical physiological salt concentration and carried out immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody, followed by Western blot analysis using the anti-Myc antibody. Dnmt1 and MeCP2 interactedin vivo (Fig. 1, Aand B, lanes 4 and 8), and Dnmt1 was not immunoprecipitated in the absence of MeCP2 (Fig. 1,A and B, lanes 3 and7). Endogenous MeCP2 was detectable under the same salt condition in mouse primary cells using an anti-MeCP2 antibody (data not shown). We then determined whether MeCP2 can bind directly to Dnmt1in vitro by means of a GST pull-down assay using seven kinds of bacterially expressed and purified GST fusion MeCP2 proteins; GST 1–76, 77–161 (MBD), 162–206 (CRID), 207–310 (TRD), 311–403, 404–491, and wild type (residues 1–491) (Fig. 1 C). Three separate domains of MeCP2, as well as full-length MeCP2 protein, were able to bind to in vitro translated full-length Dnmt1 (Fig. 1 D, lanes 4–6 and 9). These associations were specific because Dnmt1 failed to bind to GST alone (Fig. 1 D, lane 2). To confirm that the GST-fused individual domains of MeCP2 and full-length MeCP2 can bind to Dnmt1 prepared from mammalian cells, we transfected 293T cells with an empty vector or Myc-Dnmt1 expression vector. We lysed the cells and carried out GST pull-down assays using the lysate, followed by Western blot analysis using the anti-Myc antibody. Three domains (MBD, CRID, and TRD) of MeCP2 and full-length MeCP2 bound full-length Dnmt1 (Fig. 1 E). These associations were specific because GST alone failed to bind to Dnmt1 (Fig. 1 E, lane 4). Dnmt1 was not detectable from the lysate transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1 E, odd-numbered lanes). These results indicate that Dnmt1 binds directly to MeCP2 in vitro (Fig. 1, D and E). Moreover, three different functional domains of MeCP2 could bind to Dnmt1 (Fig. 1,D (lanes 4–6) and E(lanes 8, 10, and 12)). Dnmt1 possesses regulatory domains in the N-terminal region (10Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar), which can form complexes with many proteins (e.g. DMAP1 (12Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), PCNA (11Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), Rb (14Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), and RFTS (30Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar)). We next examined which domain of Dnmt1 binds to MeCP2 by GST pull-down assay using several Dnmt1 constructs with serial deletions from the C terminus. A bipartite nuclear localization sequence has previously been identified in the N-terminal region (NLS; residues 171–201, rat Dnmt1) (Fig. 2 A) (30Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). All Dnmt1 constructs could be localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2 A). Lysates from 293T cells transfected with the mutant Dnmt1 constructs were provided to the assay. Most Dnmt1 fragments (residues 1–1,622, 1–1,414, 1–1,203, 1–1,014, 1–807, 1–608, 1–428, and 1–327) bound to GST-full-length MeCP2, and the three individual domains of MeCP2 (Fig. 2 B). The binding activity of fragment 1–327 to MBD was weaker than others. In contrast, Dnmt1 constructs 1–263 and 1–201 bound incompletely to the MeCP2 protein (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that residues 264–326 of Dnmt1 are necessary for the interaction with MeCP2. The MBD, CRID, and TRD domains of MeCP2 can bind independently to Dnmt1 (Fig. 2 B). To examine which domain plays a central role for an interaction with Dnmt1 in vivo, we generated a series of FLAG-tagged internal deletion mutants of MeCP2 (FLAG-MeCP2, -ΔMBD, -ΔCRID, and -ΔTRD), all of which localize in the nucleus (Fig. 3 A). We co-transfected 293T cells with Myc-Dnmt1 and with empty vector, FLAG-MeCP2, FLAG-ΔMBD, FLAG-ΔCRID, or FLAG-ΔTRD. We lysed the cells and carried out immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody, followed by Western blot analysis using the anti-Myc antibody. Full-length Dnmt1 and MeCP2 interacted as in Fig. 1 A (Fig. 3 B,lanes 1 and 2, column 1). Dnmt1 interacted specifically with ΔMBD and ΔCRID (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 4), but the interaction of Dnmt1 with ΔTRD decreased strikingly (Fig. 3 B, lane 5, column 4). These results indicate that the TRD plays a central role for an interaction of Dnmt1 with MeCP2 in vivo. Deletion of MBD reduced the binding activity to Dnmt1 (Fig. 3 B,lane 3, column 2). This may suggest that MBD also contributes for an interaction of MeCP2 and Dnmt1. A previous study has reported that Dnmt1 associates with HDAC1 (13Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). MeCP2 also interacts with HDAC1 by forming a corepressor complex including mSin3A (19Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar, 20Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). In our system, Dnmt1, MeCP2, and Rb all interacted with HDAC1 (Fig. 3 C). To examine whether a Dnmt1-MeCP2 complex includes HDAC1, we co-transfected 293T cells with plasmids containing FLAG-MeCP2, Myc-Dnmt1, and HA-HDAC1. Immunoprecipitates using anti-FLAG antibody from lysates including FLAG-MeCP2, Myc-Dnmt1, and HA-HDAC1 did not include HA-HDAC1 (Fig. 3 D, lane 7), whereas immunoprecipitates from lysates with FLAG-MeCP2 and HA-HDAC1 included HA-HDAC1 (Fig. 3 D, lane 6). These results suggest that an interaction of Dnmt1 with MeCP2 is stronger than that of mSin3A with MeCP2, and the Dnmt1-MeCP2 complex excludes HDAC1 from both Dnmt1-HDAC1 and MeCP2-mSin3A-HDAC1 components. If the interaction of Dnmt1 with MeCP2 is involved in replicating patterns of methylation, MeCP2 would be predicted to bind to hemimethylated DNA as well as to fully methylated DNA. We used synthetic biotinylated oligonucleotides corresponding to the in vivo CpG island of the E-cadherin gene (28Rhee I. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Lengauer C. Herman J.G. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Baylin S.B. Schuebel K.E. Nature. 2000; 404: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) to investigate this. We confirmed that hemimethylated double-stranded oligonucleotides do not form a hairpin loop structure in the methylated strand using DNA electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions and by oligonucleotide secondary structure predictions using Vector NTI software (data not shown). By means of an in vitro DNA pull-down assay (Fig. 4 A), we found that MeCP2 bound not only to fully methylated oligonucleotides but also to hemimethylated ones (Fig. 4 B). These associations were specific because MeCP2 failed to bind to the nonmethylated oligonucleotides of the same sequence (Fig. 4 B) (17Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). This interaction led us to consider that the Dnmt1-MeCP2 complex could be associated with maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity. To test this idea, we performed transfections with either FLAG-MeCP2 and empty vector or FLAG-MeCP2 and Myc-Dnmt1 expression vectors. We lysed the cells, immunoprecipitated FLAG-MeCP2 with anti-FLAG antibody from the lysates, and then assayed the immunoprecipitates for maintenance methyltransferase activity. Immune complexes from cells transfected with FLAG-MeCP2 and Myc-Dnmt1 expression vectors possessed higher methyltransferase activity than cells transfected with FLAG-MeCP2 expression and empty vectors (Fig. 4 C, columns 1 and 2). Immunoprecipitates of Dnmt1 were also assayed as a positive control and indicated sufficient enzymatic activity in this system (Fig. 4 C, columns 3 and 4). Methyltransferase activity of Dnmt1 to hemimethylated DNA is ∼50-fold higher than de novomethyltransferase activity (9Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Thus, these results indicate that MeCP2-interacting Dnmt1 has significant maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity and that MeCP2 does not vanish Dnmt1 enzymatic activity. When this enzymatic reaction was also tested at 4 °C, maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity was equal to that of cells transfected with an empty vector (data not shown). DNA pull-down assay and methyltransferase assay were performed using the same hemimethylated double-stranded oligonucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”). These results indicate that hemimethylated double-stranded oligonucleotides do not become fully methylated by endogenous MeCP2 under the DNA pull-down condition. Our data indicate a direct interaction between Dnmt1 and MeCP2. This interaction prevents the association of HDAC1 with MeCP2. MeCP2 associates with hemimethylated as well as fully methylated DNA in vitro. The MeCP2-Dnmt1 complex possesses maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity that is dependent upon Dnmt1, demonstrating that the Dnmt1-MeCP2 complex could be involved in maintenance of DNA methylation. Histone deacetylase activity associates with Rb (31Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), Dnmt1 (13Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), and MBD proteins such as MeCP2 (19Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar), MBD1 (32Ng H.H. Jeppesen P. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and MBD2 (33Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Thus, Rb, Dnmt1, and MBDs complexes have histone deacetylase activity. Our findings suggest that histone deacetylation at least partly mediates various nucleosomal events such as chromatin integrity and gene regulation. We propose that histone deacetylase is not essential for maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity in the Dnmt1-MeCP2 complex. An N-terminal domain of Dnmt1 interacts with cell cycle-related molecules such as PCNA (11Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) and Rb (14Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Wolffe A.P. Nat.

The RFTS domain of Dnmt1 supports foci formation in the nucleus (30Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The MeCP2 interaction domain of Dnmt1 is near the RFTS, and deletion of the RFTS (amino acids 328–378) reduces, but does not eliminate, interaction with MeCP2 (Fig. 2). These results suggest that interaction of the two may be supported by the RFTS. Subcellular localization of Dnmt1 may be regulated by interplay of the MeCP2 interaction domain and RFTS. The connection between DNA methylation and histone acetylation will mainly affect chromatin organization by maintaining a stable epigenetic state and remodeling chromatin, but the enzymatic activity of DNA methyltransferase itself may be regulated by molecules such as MeCP2 that bind to DNA. Some studies suggest that the Dnmt1 enzymatic reaction may take place at classical replication foci (30Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), but little is known about the molecular mechanism of how CpG methylation is maintained. The discovery that Dnmt1 directly interacts with MeCP2 will help us to understand this issue. In proliferating cells, expression of Dnmt1 is induced as DNA synthesis approaches (34Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies and our data imply a mechanism by which DNA methylation is maintained as described below (Fig. 5). First, Dnmt1 is recruited to replication foci by DMAP1 and/or PCNA (11Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 12Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). When replication forks with the PCNA clamp structure progress (35Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), MeCP2 bound to symmetrically methylated DNA is released. Free MeCP2 reassociates with hemimethylated, newly synthesized DNA. Dnmt1 interacts with MeCP2, recognizes the complementary nonmethylated CpG dinucleotides, and transfers a methyl group by the enzymatic reaction. Then MeCP2 may change its conformation promptly. Finally, MeCP2 would bind to fully methylated CpG dinucleotides to maintain gene silencing and chromatin structures by recruitment of HDACs (33Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). In our model of maintenance of DNA methylation, these properties of DNA binding activity and interaction with some molecules may be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation during DNA replication. In this regard, we found that both Dnmt1 and MeCP2 are phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo. 2H. Kimura and K. Shiota, unpublished data. MeCP2 possesses at least two kinds of modification states in vivo.2 Thus, Dnmt1 might require MeCP2 to carry out genome-wide and/or local maintenance DNA methylation. Although mutations of DNA methyltransferase and methyl-CpG-binding protein family genes affect loss of DNA methylation in development (36Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or cellular function (23Guy J. Hendrich B. Holmes M. Martin J.E. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 24Chen R.Z. Akbarian S. Tudor M. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), little is understood regarding which protein complexes are involved in those processes. Our discovery implicates that Dnmt1 and MeCP2 may interplay in related pathways in both DNA methylation and histone modification. An interaction of Dnmt1 and MeCP2 is dependent upon the TRD in the C-terminal region of MeCP2in vivo. Therefore, the MBD of MeCP2 within the complex could bind hemimethylated DNA, targeting Dnmt1 activity to MeCP2-responsive genes. One important question that remains to be answered about the Dnmt1-MeCP2 interaction is whether there is a specific target for the genome or other molecules to be involved in DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. Future studies of the functions of complexes formed by DNA methyltransferases and methyl-CpG binding domain proteins will be required to determine which complexes are responsible for tissue-specific organization and remodeling of chromatin structure and gene regulation by DNA methylation and histone modification in normal development and epigenetic diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2140797812,"Carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) and homocarnosine (gamma-aminobutyric acid-L-histidine) are two naturally occurring dipeptides with potential neuroprotective and neurotransmitter functions in the brain. Peptidase activities degrading both carnosine and homocarnosine have been described previously, but the genes linked to these activities were unknown. Here we present the identification of two novel cDNAs named CN1 and CN2 coding for two proteins of 56.8 and 52.7 kDa and their classification as members of the M20 metalloprotease family. Whereas human CN1 mRNA and protein are brain-specific, CN2 codes for a ubiquitous protein. In contrast, expression of the mouse and rat CN1 orthologues was detectable only in kidney. The recombinant CN1 and CN2 proteins were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified to homogeneity. CN1 was identified as a homodimeric dipeptidase with a narrow substrate specificity for Xaa-His dipeptides including those with Xaa = beta Ala (carnosine, K(m) 1.2 mM), N-methyl beta Ala, Ala, Gly, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (homocarnosine, K(m) 200 microM), an isoelectric point of pH 4.5, and maximal activity at pH 8.5. CN2 protein is a dipeptidase not limited to Xaa-His dipeptides, requires Mn(2+) for full activity, and is sensitive to inhibition by bestatin (IC(50) 7 nM). This enzyme does not degrade homocarnosine and hydrolyzes carnosine only at alkaline pH with an optimum at pH 9.5. Based on their substrate specificity and biophysical and biochemical properties CN1 was identified as human carnosinase (EC ), whereas CN2 corresponds to the cytosolic nonspecific dipeptidase (EC )."
https://openalex.org/W2122935525,"Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is an enzyme responsible for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin both in vitro andin vivo. The unique functions of the individual members of this multigene family have been difficult to ascertain because of highly conserved catalytic domains and overlapping tissue expression patterns. To address this problem of functional and structural redundancy and to determine the role of LOX in the development of tissue integrity, Lox gene expression was deleted by targeted mutagenesis in mice. Lox-targeted mice (LOX−/−) died soon after parturition, exhibiting cardiovascular instability with ruptured arterial aneurysms and diaphragmatic rupture. Microscopic analysis of the aorta demonstrated fragmented elastic fiber architecture in homozygous mutant null mice. LOX activity, as assessed by desmosine (elastin cross-link) analysis, was reduced by ∼60% in the aorta and lungs of homozygous mutant animals compared with wild type mice. Immature collagen cross-links were decreased but to a lesser degree than elastin cross-links in LOX−/− mice. Thus, lysyl oxidase appears critical during embryogenesis for structural stability of the aorta and diaphragm and connective tissue development.

Thus, lysyl oxidase appears critical during embryogenesis for structural stability of the aorta and diaphragm and connective tissue development. Lysyl oxidases are a group of enzymes whose members continue to be discovered and their functions defined. Classically, lysyl oxidase (LOX, 1The abbreviations used are: LOXlysyl oxidaseBAPNβ-aminopropionitrileMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidDHLNLdihydroxylysinonorleucineHLNLhydroxylysinonorleucine EC 1.4.3.13) is a copper-containing monoamine oxidase extracellular enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the epsilon amino group of specific lysine residues in collagen and elastin to reactive aldehyde groups (1Kagan H.M. Trackman P.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This oxidative deamination of lysine produces reactive “allysine” residues (lysine aldehyde residues), which participate in the formation of covalent cross-links. In vitro, LOX can convert various non-peptidyl amine substrates to their corresponding aldehydes. Two lines of evidence support the role of lysyl oxidase in cross-linking of collagen and elastin. First, lysyl oxidase(s), presumably LOX, has been extracted from bovine aortas using 6 m urea and used as an reagent to demonstrate elastin and collagen cross-linking by tritium release using immature elastin and collagen substrates (2Jordan R.E.

Second, administration of β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a naturally occurring inhibitor of lysyl oxidases, results in lathyrism, presumably due to impaired collagen and elastin cross-linking (4Siegel R.C.

Messenger RNA expression of all human lysyl oxidase family members appears to be most abundant in adult tissues by Northern blotting (Table I). Under normal conditions, human LOX mRNA expression is low in most tissues with 442 molecules/picogram embryonic skin fibroblast total RNA or about 8% of the mRNA molecules that encode for β-actin (29Hamalainen E.R. Kemppainen R. Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Vaheri A. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21590-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). LOXL1 mRNA expression appears greater than LOX mRNA expression in many adult mouse tissues, while expression of LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 mRNA appears to be low overall.Table ILysyl Oxidase family member comparisonFamily memberHuman Chr.Mouse Chr.mRNA and protein sizeHighest mRNA levels, adult tissue distributionProtein domains% similarity to LOX LO domain% similarity to LOXL2 LO domainLOX5186.8, 4.8 kb 417 AALung, skeletal muscle, kidney, heartLO10063LOXL11592.4 kb 574 AALung, heart, spleen, skeletal muscle, pancreasLO8563LOXL28144.0 kb 774 AALung, thymus, skin, testis, ovary4 SRCR, LO58100LOXL3263.3 kb 753 AAHeart, uterus, testis, ovary4 SRCR, LO6578LOXL410193.5 kb 756 AASkeletal muscle, testis, pancreas4 SRCR, LO6279 Open table in a new tab The cDNA of lysyl oxidase encode proteins with ∼60–85% similarity within the catalytic region to LOX (Table I). Human LOX has the shortest open reading frame of 417 amino acids, while human LOXL2 has the longest, encoding 774 amino acids. All five members of the lysyl oxidase family contain the catalytic lysyl oxidase domain (“LO domain”) comprising ∼205 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. The LO domain consists of 4 conserved histidine residues that coordinate copper binding and contains conserved lysine and tyrosine residues that form the cofactor lysyl-tyrosine quinone. The three newest members, LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4, also have four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains that mediate ligand binding in many other proteins. Table I summarizes LOX steady state mRNA tissue expression. Thus, while all LOX family members appear to have the structural requirements to be active enzymes, recombinant proteins have not been generated to assess activity. Lysyl oxidase (presumably LOX) has been purified from bovine aorta. Of note, protein expression was also low with mg amounts purified from kilograms tissue (30Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Bovine aortic lysyl oxidase has been shown to cross-link both collagen and elastin substrates and other amine substrates in vitro. With a multiplicity of lysyl oxidase-like enzymes, the contribution of any individual gene product to substrate cross-linking and tissue integrity is unknown. To further complicate the situation, mRNA expression patterns of different lysyl oxidases overlap in many tissues. To better understand the contribution of LOX to extracellular matrix formation and tissue development, LOX-deficient mice were generated by targeted mutagenesis. In this report, we demonstrate that mice homozygous for the targeted Lox allele (LOX−/−) die at parturition (or within the first hours of life). LOX−/− mice are of equal weight and size to their littermate controls, but die following birth trauma, cardiovascular events, and/or diaphragmatic rupture. These results suggest that LOX is required for extracellular matrix development in specific tissues. BAC clones were obtained by hybridizing a 129/SvJ filter library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) using a cDNA probe from the 3′-untranslated region of the Loxgene. Positive clones were further screened by an exon 1 oligo probe, and a 5-kb HindIII fragment containing exons 1–4 was cloned into litmus 29 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). This 5-kbHindIII fragment was reduced in size by digestion withBssHII. This size reduction permitted mutagenesis at the ATG codon where the ATG codon and surrounding bases were converted to aNotI restriction sites by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). TheBssHII fragment was then replaced, and again, reduced in size by digestion with NdeI and XhoI (polylinker). The 480-bp outside probe generated by PCR is located between the NdeI site and the 3′ HindIII site. The 5′ HindIII site was now unique and an additional 2.3-kb 5′ HindIII fragment (isolated from the sameLox containing BAC clone) was added to the construct. The PGK-Neo (phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin phosphotransferase) cassette was cloned into an EcoRV site of a modified pBS246 vector (Invitrogen). In the modified pBS246 vector, the 5′ LOXP region was modified to a LOXP′ site, and the 3′ LOXP site was left unmodified (the LOXP′ and LOXP sites were incorporated for future gene replacement experiments). A NotI fragment of the modified pBS246 vector including the PGK-Neo cassette was cloned into the NotI site of the mutagenized ATG initiation codon of the Lox gene construct. This construct deletes the ATG initiation codon and replaces it with the PGK-Neo cassette in the opposite transcriptional orientation. Correctly targeted RW4 embryonic stem cells (129/SvJ), carrying this mutation (frequency of five percent), were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and chimeric mice were produced. This mutation was transmitted into the germline and mice homozygous for this mutation (LOX−/−) were generated in a mixed 129/SvJ × C57BL/6 background. DNA from mice tails was prepared by standard techniques (31Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 6.1-6.62Google Scholar). The DNA was digested withHindIII, size-fractionated on an agarose gel, and alkali-transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. TheLox outside probe was labeled by random primer extension using [α-32P]dCTP, denatured, hybridized to the DNA-containing membrane, washed, and autoradiograms were perform as described by Hornstra and Yang (31Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA from whole mice embryos was isolated using the Poly(A)+ pure RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Thirty micrograms of mRNA was size-fractionated on formaldehyde-MOPS-agarose gel, SSC-transferred to a nylon membrane, and UV cross-linked. The blot was sequentially hybridized to cDNA probes of the Lox gene,Loxl gene, and Gapdh gene as described above in Southern blotting. Gross dissection, microscopy, and photography of mutant animals were performed at ×5–10 magnifications. Perinatal mice were sacrificed; the thorax and abdomen were gently dissected and were perfused through the left ventricle with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by Histochoice fixative. The mice were fixed in Histochoice for 2–3 days and processed into slides. Hematoxylin and eosin and Hart's elastic stains were performed on both transverse and sagittal sections. For electron microscopy, perinatal animals were prepared as above except that 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline was used for fixation. The thoracic aorta was removed and incubated overnight in glutaraldehyde at 4 °C. Fixed aortas were processed at the Washington University electron microscopy core facility. Aortas were stained with tannic acid in addition to standard processing, thin-sectioning, and staining. Tissue samples from perinatal mice were collected from the thoracic aorta and total lung. Tissue samples containing from 0.05 to 1 mg of protein were placed in secure-lock centrifuge tubes containing 500 μl of 6 n HCl at 100 °C for 24 h. The hydrolysates were evaporated to dryness in a Savant vacuum concentrator and re-dissolved in 200 μl of water. Desmosine was quantified by radioimmunoassay in 10–40 μl of sample as described previously (33Starcher B. Green M. Scott M. Respiration. 1995; 62: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hydroxyproline was determined in 20–80 μl of sample by amino acid analysis on a Beckman 6300 analyzer. Protein was determined in 1–10 μl of the hydrolysate using a ninhydrin-based assay (34Starcher B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The small tissue samples obtained at birth were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and reduced with sodium borohydride as described previously (35Light N.D. Bailey A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), prior to hydrolysis in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 16 h. The hydrolysate was eluted from a CF1 cellulose column (Whatman) to separate the cross-linking amino acids from the standard amino acids. The cross-linking amino acids were then quantified using an amino acid analyzer (Alpha Plus, Amersham Biosciences, Loughborough, UK) using a modified gradient configured for maximum separation of the cross-links (36Sims T.J. Bailey A.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 582: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The location of the cross-links had previously been confirmed with authentic compounds. Quantification was based on the ninhydrin color and known leucine equivalents. A gene-targeting vector was designed to eliminate Loxexpression by converting the translation initiation codon (ATG) into a translationally inactive NotI restriction site and inserting the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter driving the neomycin antibiotic resistance gene (PGK-Neo) (Fig.1A). This construct was electroporated into embryonic stem cells (129/SvJ), and clones undergoing homologous recombination were injected into blastocysts. Resulting chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6J mice yielding germ line transmission of the targeted allele. Breeding of heterozygous null LOX mice resulted in 0 of 400 animals that were homozygous for the targeted allele at 3 weeks of age. Timed matings were set up to determine the fate of LOX−/− mice. LOX−/− mice were observed by genotype late in gestation and at parturition with proper Mendelian inheritance (Fig. 1B). Grossly, LOX−/− mice were of similar size to wild type and heterozygous littermates at late gestation and parturition, except the LOX−/− mice died shortly after delivery. Examination of total embryo Poly(A)+ RNA by Northern analysis demonstrated essentially absent levels of the LOX mRNA (Fig. 1C) in LOX−/− mice. LOXL1 mRNA expression was detectable in total embryos, without compensatory changes in the absence of LOX. Wild type and LOX−/− mice were of similar size, limb length, musculature, and overall gross morphology. Major differences were found in the thorax and abdomen in lox−/−versus wild type mice (Fig.2, A and B). The diaphragm was often ruptured in LOX−/− mice, allowing herniation of abdominal contents into the thorax. In Fig.2B, the liver and stomach, no longer constrained by the diaphragm, displaced the heart from the mid-chest and compressed the lungs. In contrast, the diaphragm in wild type mice distinctly separated the thorax and abdominal contents. Following removal of the sternum and anterior distal ribs (Fig. 2, C andD), the wild type mice had an intact diaphragm, while in LOX−/− mice we observed the muscular rim of the diaphragm connected to the body wall, but only fragments of the central tendon were visible. This suggests a critical weakness in the tensile strength of the collagen-rich central tendon of the diaphragm. Diaphragmatic rupture was found to be either unilateral (left or right) or bilateral in different mice. Diaphragmatic rupture occasionally occurred in LOX−/− mice in the last days of gestation but most frequently occurred at birth when the animals started breathing. Most lox−/− mice had hemothorax and/or hemoperitoneum. The descending aorta of LOX−/− mice was always markedly tortuous (Fig. 2D). This contrasted with the uniformly straight path of the aorta in heterozygous and wild type mice (Fig.2C). The aortic curvature in the LOX−/− mice represents a lengthening of the aorta in vivo in the absence of LOX. While LOX is critical for aorta and diaphragmatic development, other organs, including the limbs and skeletal system of LOX−/− mice, appeared grossly normal. Microscopic analyses of transverse sections from neonatal mice stained with trichrome demonstrated similar morphology between the wild type and LOX−/− mice at low power (×40) in the skin, musculature, vertebrae, and lungs (Fig.3, upper panels). Higher power view (Fig. 3, lower panels, ×200) of the lungs following Hart's elastic stain revealed less prominent staining of elastic fibers around blood vessels (labeled V) and conducting airways (labeled C) in the LOX−/− mice as compared with wild type mice. Light microscopy (×400) of the descending thoracic aorta demonstrated significant abnormalities at term in the absence of LOX (Fig.4). Hematoxylin and eosin staining shows areas of disrupted smooth muscle cell contact in the LOX−/− mice (clear spaces, arrows), not observed in the wild type (arrow). trichrome staining reveals discontinuity of collagen (arrow) in the aortic lamellae as well as impaired continuity of smooth muscle cells in the LOX null aorta, while the wild type aorta had concentric blue lamellae and cohesive cell contact (arrow). Hart's elastic stain demonstrates a well developed internal elastic lamina and concentric lamellae in wild type (arrow). LOX−/− mice, however, had a fragmented and discontinuous internal elastic lamina with similarly fragmented and irregular lamellae (arrow). Aorta wall thickness was more variable and often significantly thinner in LOX−/− than in wild type mice. Histologically, elastin fiber abnormalities in LOX−/− mice appear as early as E14.5 and progress in parallel with the development of elastic fibers (data not shown). Aortic rupture is a late event in development occurring most frequently in the perinatal period. Defects in the aortas of full-term LOX−/− mice were even more pronounced when examined by transmission electron microscopy stained with tannic acid to accentuate the extracellular matrix (Fig.5). In wild type mice, the internal elastic lamina just below the luminal endothelial cell layer is well developed with a nearly continuous thick band of elastin (upper arrows). Proceeding away from the lumen, nearly linear and continuous concentric lamellae are visualized between cell layers (lower arrows). In contrast, the internal elastic lamina is poorly developed, fragmented, and discontinuous in LOX−/−mice (upper arrows). The concentric lamellae are similarly fragmented and discontinuous with increased space between smooth muscle cells in the LOX−/− mice (lower arrows). Only irregular collections of matrix were seen between the LOX−/− cells, and some of the cells appeared less polarized when compared with wild type. Collagen fibers were of similar diameters in all genotypes (data not shown). These histological abnormalities in the LOX−/− mice likely predispose to the aortic rupture with hemothorax and hemoperitoneum that was observed. LOX activity was assessed by quantifying elastin cross-linking using a desmosine radioimmunoassay (33Starcher B. Green M. Scott M. Respiration. 1995; 62: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in tissue samples from litters of full-term mice. Compared with wild type mice, LOX+/− mice had 86 and 103% of desmosine in aorta and lung tissues respectively. LOX−/− mice had only 39% of the desmosine cross-links in aortic hydrolysates and 45% of the desmosine in lung hydrolysates when compared with wild type (TableII). Thus, desmosine analysis agrees with the ultrastructural studies in documenting decreased elastin content.Table IIDesmosine, elastin cross-linking in aorta and lungAortaLungLOX+/+n = 5846 ± 164 (100)103 ± 26 (100)LOX+/−n = 7729 ± 129 (86)106 ± 14 (103)LOX−/−n = 6327 ± 77 (39)2-ap < 0.05 as compared with wild type using t test.46 ± 7 (45)2-ap < 0.05 as compared with wild type using t test.2-a p < 0.05 as compared with wild type using t test. Open table in a new tab Hydroxyproline was measured by amino acid analysis from litters of full-term mice to quantify collagen content in aortic and lung hydrolysates. LOX−/− mice aortas had 74%, and lungs had 68% hydroxyproline content as compared with wild type mice. Heterozygous LOX (LOX+/−) aortas and lungs had 97 and 93% of hydroxyproline content as wild type mice (TableIII). Immature collagen cross-links were analyzed in both the whole body and lungs of mice. As shown in TableIV, there are statistically significant decreases in DHLNL (dihydroxylysinonorleucine), and HLNL (hydroxylysinonorleucine) of 43 and 39%, respectively, in LOX−/−, as compared with wild type total body collagen cross-links. Collagen cross-link data are normalized to moles of collagen as determined by hydroxyproline content. In LOX+/− mice, DHLNL is 100% of wild type, while HLNL is only 64% of wild type content. This could represent a greater role for LOX in HLNL cross-links, with a decrement observed with quantitative reduction in LOX (50%) in heterozygous mice. Collagen cross-link data from the lungs was also determined. The analysis of E20.5 lungs was at the limit of assay detection and showed only a trend toward decreased HLNL in heterozygote and homozygous null mice (14 and 32%, respectively). Lung DHLNL was not different between the genotypes. These data demonstrate a quantitative reduction of elastin-derived cross-links, collagen content, and immature collagen cross-links in LOX−/− mice, all of which support and help explain the phenotypic abnormalities observed. Yet, incomplete loss of collagen and elastin cross-linking likely explains the fact that not all organs were grossly abnormal.Table IIIHydroxyproline, collagen content in aorta and lungAortaLungLOX+/+n = 5150 ± 29 (100)30 ± 8 (100)LOX+/−n = 6146 ± 39 (97)28 ± 4 (93)LOX−/−n = 5111 ± 20 (74)21 ± 3 (68)3-ap < 0.05 as compared with wild type using a t test.3-a p < 0.05 as compared with wild type using a t test.

Open table in a new tab LOX gene targeting results in decreases in both collagen and elastin cross-links in vivo, confirming the catalytic capacity of LOX demonstrated in vitro. Despite the presence of five lysyl oxidase enzymes, LOX deficiency is lethal, suggesting that other lysyl oxidases are unable to effectively compensate during development for the physiological stresses associated with parturition and life ex utero. LOXL1 mRNA does not increase to compensate for LOX deficiency in the total embryo. The inability of the other lysyl oxidases to compensate may relate to either distinct substrate specificities of individual enzymes or temporally and spatially unique expression patterns. The consequences of decreased lysyl oxidase activity appear most significant in the development of the aorta and diaphragm, two organs where tensile strength requirements increase significantly at birth (37Nichols D.G. Cameron D.E. Greeley W.J. Lappe D.G. Ungerleider R.M. Wetzel R.C. Critical Heart Disease in Infants and Children. Mosby-Yearbook, Inc., St. Louis, MO1995: 18-22Google Scholar). LOX−/− mice survive in utero, probably due to feto-maternal circulation, low systemic blood pressure, and low intrathoracic pressure. At parturition, the fetus is subjected to many physiologic stresses, including physical trauma from passage through the birth canal, increased systemic blood pressure (37Nichols D.G. Cameron D.E. Greeley W.J. Lappe D.G. Ungerleider R.M. Wetzel R.C. Critical Heart Disease in Infants and Children. Mosby-Yearbook, Inc., St. Louis, MO1995: 18-22Google Scholar), and conversion of liquid filled to air filled lungs with the onset of breathing requiring diaphragmatic contraction. It is precisely at this time shortly after birth when the majority of LOX−/− mice die, likely due to the inability to handle increased stress placed on the vascular bed and diaphragm. Although elastin cross-links were significantly decreased in the aorta and lungs of LOX−/− mice, they were not completely eliminated. This suggests that other enzyme(s) participate in cross-linking elastin to produce the ∼40% of desmosine that remain in these organs. Whether LOX catalyzes a specific subset of lysine residues within tropoelastin or whether it contributes 60% of total activity on random cross-links is not known. LOX−/− mice also have 40% reduced immature collagen cross-links (DHLNL and HLNL) in the whole mouse. Although the exact relationship between collagen cross-links and tensile strength is unknown, 40% overall reduction in cross-linking could certainly impair mechanical strength, particularly if it were greater in individual tissues. The combined reduction in elastin and collagen cross-linking resulted in loss of structural integrity of the aorta. Impaired collagen cross-linking most likely explains the diaphragmatic abnormalities, since this is the major matrix component of this tissue. Due to the small size of these organs at birth, detection of collagen cross-links in these individual tissues was below the sen"
https://openalex.org/W2162899067,"Intracellular targets of the ubiquitous second messenger cAMP are located at great distances from the most widely studied source of cAMP, the G protein responsive transmembrane adenylyl cyclases. We previously identified an alternative source of cAMP in mammalian cells lacking transmembrane spanning domains, the ""soluble"" adenylyl cyclase (sAC). We now demonstrate that sAC is distributed in specific subcellular compartments: mitochondria, centrioles, mitotic spindles, mid-bodies, and nuclei, all of which contain cAMP targets. Distribution at these intracellular sites proves that adenylyl cyclases are in close proximity to all cAMP effectors, suggesting a model in which local concentrations of cAMP are regulated by individual adenylyl cyclases targeted to specific microdomains throughout the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2157669984,"A new gene, termed klotho, is associated with the suppression of several aging phenotypes. Because high expression of klotho gene was detected in the brain, it would be plausible that klotho gene is involved in the regulation of brain aging. We investigated the changes in mnemonic function accompanying aging in klotho mutant mice. Cognitive function measured by novel-object recognition and conditioned-fear tests in klotho mutant mice was normal at the age of 6 wk, but markedly impaired at the age of 7 wk. Lipid (malondialdehyde) and DNA (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) peroxide levels in the hippocampus of klotho mutant mice increased at the age of 5 wk, 2 wk before the development of cognition deficits. Pro-death Bax increased, whereas anti-death Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL decreased, and apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the hippocampus of klotho mutant mice at the age of 7 wk. A potent antioxidant, a-tocopherol, prevented cognition impairment and lipid peroxide accumulation and decreased the number of apoptotic cells in klotho mutant mice. These results suggest that oxidative stress has a crucial role in the aging-associated cognition impairment in klotho mutant mice. Klotho protein may be involved in the regulation of antioxidative defense."
https://openalex.org/W1980957444,"We have recently reported that osteopontin (OPN) stimulates tumor growth and activation of promatrix metalloproteinase-2 (pro-MMP-2) through nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-mediated induction of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in murine melanoma cells (Philip, S., Bulbule, A., and Kundu, G. C. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 44926–44935). However, the molecular mechanism by which OPN activates NFκB and regulates pro-MMP-2 activation in murine melanoma (B16F10) cells is not well defined. We also investigated the mechanism of action of curcumin (diferulolylmethane) on OPN-induced NFκB-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2 in B16F10 cells. Here we report that OPN induces phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB (IκBα) by inducing the activity of IκB kinase (IKK) in these cells. OPN also induces the nuclear accumulation of NFκB p65, NFκB-DNA binding, and transactivation. However, curcumin a known anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic agent suppressed OPN-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation by inhibiting the IKK activity. Moreover, our data revealed that curcumin inhibited the OPN-induced translocation of p65, NFκB-DNA binding, and NFκB transcriptional activity. The OPN-induced pro-MMP-2 activation and MT1-MMP expression were also drastically reduced by curcumin. Curcumin also inhibited OPN-induced cell proliferation, cell migration, extracellular matrix invasion, and synergistically induced apoptotic morphology with OPN in these cells. Most importantly, curcumin suppressed the OPN-induced tumor growth in nude mice, and the levels of pro-MMP-2 expression and activation in OPN-induced tumor were inhibited by curcumin. To our knowledge, this is the first report that OPN induces NFκB activity through phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα by activating IKK that ultimately triggers the activation of pro-MMP-2 and further demonstrates that curcumin potently suppresses OPN-induced cell migration, tumor growth, and NFκB-mediated pro-MMP-2 activation by blocking the IKK/IκBα signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2129515932,"Cells can release membrane components in a soluble form and as membrane vesicles. L1, an important molecule for cell migration of neural and tumor cells, is released by membrane-proximal cleavage, and soluble L1 promotes cell migration. Release of L1 is enhanced by shedding inducers such as phorbol ester and pervanadate, but it is also enhanced by depletion of cellular cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD). How such different compounds can induce shedding is presently unknown. We show here that ADAM10 is involved in L1 cleavage, which occurs at the cell surface and in the Golgi apparatus. MCD and pervanadate treatment induced the release of microvesicles containing full-length L1 and the active form of ADAM10. L1 cleavage occurred in isolated vesicles. L1-containing microvesicles could trigger haptotactic cell migration. Only the neural L1 form carrying the RSLE signal for clathrin-dependent endocytosis was recruited and cleaved in vesicles. Phorbol ester treatment activated L1 cleavage predominantly at the cell surface. Our results provide evidence for two pathways of L1 cleavage, based on ADAM10 localization, that can be activated differentially: 1) direct cleavage at the cell surface, and 2) release and cleavage in secretory vesicles most likely derived from the Golgi apparatus. The findings establish a novel role for ADAM10 as a vesicle-based protease."
https://openalex.org/W2147270124,"Collagen-I, which predominates in the neomatrix of fibrotic liver, regulates hepatocyte and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) phenotypes. Recovery from liver fibrosis is accompanied by hepatocyte regeneration, matrix degradation, and HSC apoptosis. Using mice bearing a mutated collagen-I gene (r/r mice), which confers resistance to collagenase degradation, we have investigated the hypothesis that collagen-I degradation is critical to HSC apoptosis and hepatocyte regeneration during recovery from liver fibrosis. During a 28-day recovery period after 8 wk of CCl4 treatment, wild-type (WT) livers had significantly (43%) decreased hydroxyproline (OHP) content. In r/r livers, however, OHP content remained elevated at peak fibrosis levels. Expressed markers of activated HSC (alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen-I), elevated at peak fibrosis, dropped to control levels in WT livers after 28 days but remained raised in the r/r livers. Moreover, relative to WT livers, r/r livers had significantly reduced stellate cell apoptosis and hepatocyte regeneration during the recovery period. Using extracted collagen-I from each genotype as culture substrata, relative to r/r, we show that WT collagen-I promotes hepatocyte proliferation via stimulation of integrin alpha(v)beta3. Failure to degrade collagen-I critically impairs HSC apoptosis and may prevent the effective restoration of hepatocyte mass in liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2153983785,"Diabetic macular edema, resulting from increased microvascular permeability, is the most prevalent cause of vision loss in diabetes. The mechanisms underlying this complication remain poorly understood. In the current study, diabetic vascular permeability (blood-retinal barrier breakdown) is demonstrated to result from a leukocyte-mediated Fas-FasL-dependent apoptosis of the retinal vasculature. Following the onset of streptozotocin-induced diabetes, FasL expression was increased in rat neutrophils (P<0.005) and was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in Fas expression in the retinal vasculature. Static adhesion assays demonstrated that neutrophils from diabetic, but not control, rats induced endothelial cell apoptosis in vitro (P<0.005). The latter was inhibited via an antibody-based FasL blockade (P<0.005). In vivo, the inhibition of FasL potently reduced retinal vascular endothelial cell injury, apoptosis, and blood-retinal barrier breakdown (P<0.0001) but did not diminish leukocyte adhesion to the diabetic retinal vasculature. Taken together, these data are the first to identify leukocyte-mediated Fas-FasL-dependent retinal endothelial cell apoptosis as a major cause of blood-retinal barrier breakdown in early diabetes. These data imply that the targeting of the Fas-FasL pathway may prove beneficial in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2150393859,"Megalin is an endocytic receptor highly expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidney. Recently, we demonstrated that this receptor is essential for the renal uptake and conversion of 25-OH vitamin D3 to 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, a central step in vitamin D and bone metabolism. Unfortunately, the perinatal lethality of the conventional megalin knockout mouse model precluded the detailed analysis of the significance of megalin for calcium homeostasis and bone turnover in vivo. Here, we have generated a new mouse model with conditional inactivation of the megalin gene in the kidney by using Cre recombinase. Animals with a renal-specific receptor gene defect were viable and fertile. However, lack of receptor expression in the kidney results in plasma vitamin D deficiency, in hypocalcemia and in severe bone disease, characterized by a decrease in bone mineral content, an increase in osteoid surfaces, and a lack of mineralizing activity. These features are consistent with osteomalacia (softening of the bones) as a consequence of hypovitaminosis D and demonstrate the crucial importance of the megalin pathway for systemic calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2009895779,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is able to kill a broad spectrum of tumor cells but appears to be nontoxic to most normal cells. Because there are conflicting data about the hepatotoxicity of TRAIL, we investigated the physiological function of TRAIL and its receptors in the liver. Hepatocytes are sensitive for FasL- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in vitro, but TRAIL induces no apoptosis in healthy livers in vivo. Using mouse models of adenoviral hepatitis and livers of patients with hepatitis infection, we could demonstrate that apoptosis in virally infected hepatocytes is mediated by TRAIL receptor DR5 and TRAIL. In contrast to FasL, TRAIL-mediated apoptosis of hepatocytes in vivo is triggered through viral infection. The TRAIL receptor/ligand system enables the organisms to specifically kill virus-infected hepatocytes, whereas normal uninfected hepatocytes in vivo are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Overexpression of TRAIL in the liver after viral infection is not dependent on lymphocytes, natural killer, or Kupffer cells, which indicates that the TRAIL receptor/ligand system is a paracrine mechanism of hepatocytes against virally infected cells. Our results suggest that TRAIL might be used not only for cancer therapy but also for therapy of patients with viral hepatitis to selectively eliminate infected hepatocytes and limit viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W2148244353,"We investigated the mechanism of the anti-fibrotic effects of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the kidney, with respect to its effect on connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a down-stream, profibrotic mediator of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). In wild-type (WT) mice with 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx), HGF and TGF-beta1 mRNAs increased transiently in the remnant kidney by week 1 after the Nx, returned to baseline levels, and increased again at weeks 4 to 12. In contrast, CTGF and alpha1(I) procollagen (COLI) mRNAs increased in parallel with HGF and TGF-beta1 during the early stage, but did not re-increase during the late stage. In the case of TGF-beta1 transgenic (TG) mice with 5/6 Nx, excess TGF-beta1 derived from the transgene enhanced CTGF expression significantly in the remnant kidney, accordingly accelerating renal fibrogenesis. Administration of dHGF (5.0 mg/kg/day) to TG mice with 5/6 Nx for 4 weeks from weeks 2 to 6 suppressed CTGF expression in the remnant kidney, attenuating renal fibrosis and improving the survival rate. In an experiment in vitro, renal tubulointerstitial fibroblasts (TFB) were co-cultured with proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). Pretreatment with HGF reduced significantly CTGF induction in PTEC by TGF-beta1, consequently suppressing COLI synthesis in TFB. In conclusion, HGF can block, at least partially, renal fibrogenesis promoted by TGF-beta1 in the remnant kidney, via attenuation of CTGF induction."

The sole exception is a fork with a 5′ single-stranded tail, which is cleaved in the lagging strand template. break-induced replication DNA replication complexes (replisomes) routinely encounter blockages in the DNA that they are copying (1Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 53-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Obstructions include transcription complexes, DNA repair complexes and bulky DNA lesions (e.g. pyrimidine dimers). It is imagined that the cellular response to each type of blockage differs according to parameters that have yet to be clearly defined. In principle if the blockade is another protein complex it would make sense for the replisome to suspend synthesis until the obstruction has moved out the way. However, simply waiting for a blocking lesion to be removed may not be an option for the replisome since it may itself be blocking repair complexes from accessing the damaged DNA. In such circumstances polymerases that are able to function on damaged templates can be recruited (2Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). InEscherichia coli these polymerases are error-prone and therefore appear to be used only when there is an excess of DNA damage (3Berdichevsky A. Izhar L. Livneh Z. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 917-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in eukaryotes some of these polymerases are not inherently mutagenic and therefore they may be used more readily (2Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 17-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). If the lesion is in the lagging template strand then synthesis of the relevant Okazaki fragment may be skipped resulting in a lesion-containing DNA gap that is dealt with by post-replication repair (4West S.C. Cassuto E. Howard-Flanders P. Nature. 1981; 294: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Alternatively lesions in either the leading or lagging template strand may provoke the partial or complete disassembly of the replisome followed by the spontaneous or enzyme-driven reversal of the replication fork (5Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B.

Microbiol. 2000; 38: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fork reversal (also referred to as fork regression) involves the unwinding of nascent strands and re-pairing of parental strands. This may serve both to provide room for lesion repair and/or a means of unfettering nascent strands to act in a template switching mechanism for the bypass of the lesion (10Higgins N.P. Kato K. Strauss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Depending on the extent of fork reversal either one or both nascent strands are extruded from the fork. In the latter case this will result in the formation of a Holliday junction when the strands anneal. In order for replication to restart reversed forks have to be reset. This can be achieved either by the removal of the extruded DNA by a nuclease or reverse branch migration of the junction point by a DNA helicase (6Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B.

This is based on the observation that an rqh1− mutant's chromosome segregation defects, which are induced by replication fork stalling, are partially suppressed by the E. coli Holliday junction resolvase RusA (11Doe C.L. Dixon J. Osman F. Whitby M.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It would appear that in the absence of Rqh1 at least some Holliday junctions at stalled replication forks remain unprocessed and so impede sister chromatid segregation. Mus81-Eme1 is related to the XPF-ERCC1 and Rad1-Rad10 family of heteromeric structure-specific endonucleases that function in nucleotide excision repair, DNA interstrand cross-link repair and recombination (23Enzlin J.H. Scharer O.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2045-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell.

These phenotypes are suppressed by RusA suggesting that Mus81-Eme1 cleaves Holliday junctions, and thereby provides an alternative to Rqh1 for processing junctions formed at stalled replication forks (18Doe C.L.

Indeed both S. pombe and human Mus81, purified from their endogenous cells, cleave Holliday junctions in vitro (19Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.-H.L. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates 3rd, J.R. Russell P.

However, when purified from E. coli cells, Mus81-Eme1 and its homologue from S. cerevisiae Mus81-Mms4 exhibit only low levels of Holliday junction cleavage activity, whereas they cleave fork substrates very well (18Doe C.L.

Chen X.-B. McGowan C.H. West S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These observations have prompted the suggestion that Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 may cleave stalled replication forks before they have fully reversed to form a Holliday junction (18Doe C.L. Ahn J.S. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32753-32759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5577-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of Mus81-Eme1's potential for processing DNA junctions at stalled replication forks, we have tested its ability to cleave a variety of fork substrates made from oligonucleotides and χ DNA molecules. Cleavage sites have also been mapped and a direct comparison with Mus81-Mms4 made. From this study we show that both Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 cleave structures that are expected to form when a replication fork reverses. Cleavage always occurs between 3 and 6 bp 5′ to the junction point and in most cases is targeted to the equivalent of the leading strand template. The one exception to this rule is a substrate that mimics a replication fork that has reversed to expose only its nascent lagging strand, which is cleaved in the equivalent of the lagging strand template. The potential significance of these data for fork processing in vivo is discussed. Mus81-Eme1 and NLS-RusA-GFP were purified as described previously (18Doe C.L. Ahn J.S. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32753-32759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Mus81-Mms4 was purified as described below. Amounts of protein were estimated by a modified Bradford assay using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as the standard. The concentration of NLS-RusA-GFP is expressed as moles of monomers. Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 are assumed to be heterodimers and therefore their concentrations represent moles of heterodimers. S. cerevisiae MUS81 andMMS4 were amplified by PCR from a genomic DNA template using primers that incorporate suitable restriction sites 5′ and 3′ of their open reading frames to facilitate cloning. MUS81 was cloned as an NdeI-BamHI fragment into pT7-7 to make pMW566, and MMS4 was cloned as anNdeI-EcoRI fragment into pET14b (Novagen) to make pMW567. A fragment containing the T7 phage Ø10 promoter andMUS81 gene was then amplified by PCR from pMW566 using primers that incorporate terminal SphI sites, and cloned into a unique SphI site upstream of the T7 phage Ø10 promoter in pMW567 to make pMW571. 100 ml ofE. coli BL21-RIL cells (Stratagene) containing pMW571 were grown with aeration at 25 °C in Luria-Bertani broth containing 125 μg/ml carbenicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At a cell density corresponding to an OD600 of 0.5 Mms4, containing an N-terminal His6 tag, and Mus81 were induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After a 2.5 h induction the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer H (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 mNaCl, 10% glycerol) and frozen at −80 °C until required. Frozen cells were thawed at room temperature and then mixed on ice with protease inhibitors, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Triton X-100 before lysis by passage through a French pressure cell at 30,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation at 43,700 × g for 50 min the supernatant was loaded directly onto a 1-ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen), which was washed with 30 ml of Buffer H + 50 mm imidazole before eluting bound Mus81-Mms4 with 2 ml of Buffer H + 200 mm imidazole. Mus81-Mms4 was then stored as aliquots at −80 °C. Oligonucleotides 2, 5–8, 10–11, and 14 used to make the fork substrates have been described previously (18Doe C.L. Ahn J.S. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. J.

Oligonucleotides were supplied by Sigma-Genosys Ltd. and were purified by electrophoresis through a 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, full-length bands being cut out and extracted from the gel by soaking in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) overnight. F1–F6 were made by annealing the appropriate combination of oligonucleotides as follows: F1, oligonucleotides 2, 5 11, and 14; F2, oligonucleotides 2, 8, 10, and 15; F3, oligonucleotides 2, 5, 7, and 14; F4, oligonucleotides 2, 5, 6, and 11; F5, oligonucleotides 2, 5 and 11; and F6, oligonucleotides 2, 5 and 14. The procedures for annealing and substrate preparation have been described previously (28Whitby M.C. Dixon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35063-35073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Parsons C.A. Kemper B. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9285-9289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA substrates were labeled at the 5′-end of one of their component oligonucleotides as indicated using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. χ, χKpn, and χSmasubstrates were made as described by McGlynn and Lloyd (8McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). χ, χKpn, and χSma cleavage reactions (10 μl) contained DNA and enzyme as indicated in reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. They were stopped by the addition of one-fifth volume of stop mixture (2.5% SDS, 200 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml proteinase K) followed by a further 15 min at 30 °C to deproteinize the mixture. Reaction products were then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 0.8% agarose gel in Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer at 100 V for 80 min. The cleavage reactions (30 μl) in Figs. 3 and 5 contained 10 nm of either Mus81-Eme1 or Mus81-Mms4 as indicated, and between 0.4 and 3.6 nm of junction DNA (depending on the oligonucleotide that is labeled), in the same reaction buffer as above. Reactions were incubated and stopped as above, and the products analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% native polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer at 200 V for 2 h and 15% denaturing gels containing 7m urea. For native gels, deproteinated reactions were mixed with loading dye and loaded directly onto the gel. For denaturing gels, reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in gel-loading buffer (0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 10 mmEDTA, pH 7.5, 97.5% (v/v) formamide), and denatured by boiling for 2 min before loading onto the gel. To map cleavage sites reaction products were run alongside Maxam-Gilbert sequence ladders of the appropriate labeled oligonucleotide. A 1.5-base allowance was made to compensate for the nucleoside eliminated in the sequencing reaction.Figure 5Mapping the cleavage sites in F3, F4, and F6.

Arrows indicate the major cleavage sites for Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The cleavage reactions (20 μl) in Fig. 4 A contained the indicated amount of Mus81-Eme1 and 0.3 nm of junction DNA (labeled in oligonucleotide 5) in reaction buffer. Reactions were incubated, stopped, and then analyzed by electrophoresis through a native polyacrylamide gel as described above. For measurement of the rates of cleavage shown in Fig. 4 B, 60-μl reactions were set-up as above, and 10-μl aliquots withdrawn and stopped at the indicated times. The data shown are the means of two independent experiments. All gels were dried onto 3 mm Whatman paper and analyzed by phosphorimaging using a Fuji FLA3000. Previously we have shown that Mus81-Eme1 cleaves small synthetic Holliday junctions (X-12) relatively poorly compared with fork substrates (18Doe C.L. Ahn J.S. Dixon J. Whitby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32753-32759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). X-12 contains only a 12-bp homologous core in which the junction crossover point branch migrates, and therefore could in theory be cleaved inefficiently by Holliday junction resolvases that are affected by sequence context. To see if Mus81-Eme1 can cleave more efficiently Holliday junctions that are contained within larger regions of homology, χ DNA, with a 312 bp homologous core, was used (Fig.1 A). The E. coliHolliday junction resolvase RusA efficiently resolves this structure generating four nicked duplex DNA species (Fig. 1 B,lane f). In comparison Mus81-Eme1 resolves χ DNA relatively inefficiently converting less than 5% of the available substrate into duplex products at the highest concentration of enzyme used (Fig. 1 B, lane d). To directly compare Mus81-Eme1's ability to cleave Holliday junctions versus replication forks, χKpn and χSma substrates were generated by restriction of χ DNA in a common duplex arm at (χSma) or close (χKpn) to the boundary with the homologous core sequence (Fig. 2, A andB). χSma can either resemble a Holliday junction or a replication fork depending on where its junction point branch migrates. In contrast χKpn retains a small heterologous region at the end of the cleaved arm, which obstructs formation of a replication fork substrate. Like χDNA, χKpn is cleaved inefficiently by Mus81-Eme1 (Fig.2 C, lanes b–d). In contrast Mus81-Eme1 cleaves χSma relatively well, generating 3.2- and 0.95-kb duplex products (Fig. 2 C, lanes g–i). The prevalence of these cleavage products and relative absence of 2.4- and 1.75-kb duplex bands indicates that Mus81-Eme1 has a strong bias toward cleaving χSma in what would be the leading strand template if this were a true replication fork (Fig. 2 D). To see if this cleavage bias is a conserved feature of homologues of Mus81-Eme1, we purified S. cerevisiae Mus81-Mms4 and tested it on both χKpn and χSma (Fig. 2 E). Mus81-Mms4, like Mus81-Eme1, cleaves χKpnrelatively poorly compared with χSma (compare lanes c and f) and generates almost exclusively 3.2- and 0.95-kb duplex products from its cleavage of χSma(lane f). To more precisely determine the sites at which Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 cleave fork substrates, a synthetic replication fork called F1, made from short (∼50 nucleotides) oligonucleotides, was used (Fig.3 D). Four preparations of F1 were made, each labeled in a different oligonucleotide, and tested for cleavage by Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 (Fig. 3 A). Like χSma F1 is cleaved by both Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 in the equivalent of the leading strand template to detach one of its duplex arms. Analysis of the reaction products on a denaturing gel shows that both enzymes cut at the same sites (Fig. 3 C,lanes c and d), which map mainly to positions between 3 and 6 bp 5′ of the junction point in oligonucleotide 2 (Fig.3 D). More minor cut sites are also detected up to 11 bp 5′ of the junction point in the same oligonucleotide (Fig.3 C, lanes c and d and data not shown). Slight differences in site preference between Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 are apparent, as well as some minor cut sites that appear to be exclusive to one or other of the enzymes (e.g. Fig.3 C, lanes n and o). To confirm that the cleavage bias observed using F1 is not dictated by the nucleotide sequence we constructed a further fork substrate called F2 (Fig.3 E). F2 consists of the same nucleotide sequences as F1 but differs by the strand that is discontinuous at the junction point and therefore which strand is assigned as the leading strand template. F2, like F1, is cleaved by both Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 in the leading strand template, the major cut sites being between 3 and 6 bp 5′ of the junction point in oligonucleotide 8 (Fig. 3 B, Cand E). From these data we conclude that Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 cleave replication fork substrates in a specific manner that is directed by the structure of the substrate and seemingly independent of its nucleotide sequence. It is hypothesized that a key role for Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 is to cleave stalled and reversed replication forks and thereby facilitate the break-induced restart of replication (18Doe C.L.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Blocked replication forks can in principle form a number of different structures depending on which template strand is blocked, whether the lagging strand polymerase can uncouple from the leading strand polymerase, and whether the fork reverses to allow the re-pairing of template strands. The occurrence of these aberrant structures in vivo has recently been confirmed by electron microscopy (30Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). To test Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 on structures that resemble different types of stalled/reversed replication fork, substrates F3 to F6 were made (Fig.4 A). F3 and F4 resemble replication forks that have reversed to expose either a 3′ (leading nascent strand) or 5′ (lagging nascent strand) single-stranded tail respectively. F6 resembles a fork in which the lagging strand polymerase continued synthesis despite the leading strand being blocked. Finally, F5 resembles a normal replication fork since, unlike the other substrates (including F1 and F2), it does not contain an equivalent of the nascent lagging strand juxtaposed at the junction point. Substrates F3, F4, and F6 are cleaved at least as well as F1 by both Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). In contrast little or no cleavage of F5 was detected (Fig.4 A, lanes n–p and data not shown). A comparison of the rates of cleavage of these substrates shows that F3 and F6 are cleaved at least 2-fold faster than either F1 or F4 (Fig. 4 B). The same strategy for mapping the cleavage sites in F1 and F2 was employed for determining the cleavage sites in F3, F4, and F6. Like F1, both F3 and F6 are cleaved predominantly in oligonucleotide 2 at positions 3–6 bp 5′ of the junction point (Fig.5 A, lanes c andg, B, and C and data not shown). However, little or no cleavage in this strand is detected for F4 (Fig.5 A, lane e and data not shown). Instead F4 is cleaved predominantly in oligonucleotide 5 4 bp 5′ of the junction point, which in this substrate is the equivalent of the lagging strand template (Fig. 5 A, lane l, D and data not shown). Mus81-Eme1 and its homologue from S. cerevisiaeMus81-Mms4 have both been implicated in cleaving DNA junctions at stalled replication forks in order to facilitate some kind of break-induced replication (BIR)1 (18Doe C.L.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the ability of recombinant SpMus81-Eme1 and ScMus81-Mms4 to cleave various different DNA junctions that resemble those that are expected to form at stalled replication forks following complete or partial disassembly of the replisome. We confirm that these recombinant enzymes cleave Holliday junctions relatively poorly compared with three- or four-way DNA junctions that already contain some kind of strand discontinuity at the junction point. Furthermore, our side-by-side comparison of Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 shows that these enzymes have the same substrate specificity. They also cut at the same sites, albeit their preferred cleavage sites are in some cases slightly different. These data have enabled us to speculate on the mode of action of Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 in vivo (see below). The stalling of replication forks by depletion of dNTPs or blockage in the DNA template appears to be a frequent event. What happens to the replisome when it stalls is largely unknown. In many cases its integrity and potential for further replication appears to be maintained by cell cycle checkpoint kinases such as Rad53 in S. cerevisiae (31Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioli A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M. Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 32Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In the absence of RAD53 stalled forks are converted into a range of abnormal structures, including junctions with extensive single-stranded gaps, reversed forks with extruded single-stranded tails, and reversed forks where the two nascent strands have annealed to form a Holliday junction (30Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). However, under certain circumstances, for example replication fork blockage by a bulky lesion in the DNA, fork reversal may be actively encouraged to provide room for DNA repair and/or a template for replicative bypass of the lesion (10Higgins N.P. Kato K. Strauss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Subsequently the DNA junction formed by fork reversal would have to be removed and a means found to restart replication. Our in vitro analysis of Mus81-Eme1 and Mus81-Mms4 substrate specificity reveals how these enzymes are well suited for processing most of the abnormal structures that can form when the replisome disassembles (Fig. 6). Reassuringly neither Mus81-Eme1 nor Mus81-Mms4 can efficiently cleave a normal replication fork structure (Fig. 6 A). A blockage in the leading strand can result in the uncoupling of the two polymerases (33Cordeiro-Stone M. Zaritskaya L.S. Price L.K. Kaufmann W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13945-13954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to generate the structure shown in Fig. 6 B,i. This can be cleaved by Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 resulting in the detachment of the leading strand arm (Fig. 6 B,ii). However, if fork reversal ensues before Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 has had a chance to act then the 5′-end of the nascent lagging strand would be exposed to generate the structure shown in Fig. 6 B,iii. Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 would be able to cleave this structure but incisions would be redirected to the lagging strand template causing the detachment of the lagging strand arm. Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 would also be able to cleave a reversed fork with the 3′-end of the nascent leading strand exposed; however, here cleavage would occur in the leading strand template resulting in the detachment of the leading strand arm (Fig. 6 C, ii-iii). However, if the fork reverses to the point at which a Holliday junction is formed then Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 may either act inefficiently or not at all (Fig.6 B, v and C, iv). This suggests that there may be a limited window of opportunity for Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 to cleave a replication fork undergoing reversal. Of course even if a Holliday junction is formed its branch migration could regenerate the substrates that are cleaved well by Mus81-Eme1/Mms4. Breaking a replication fork, as envisaged in Fig. 6, B and C, is potentially hazardous to the cell in at least two ways: (i) a single non-repaired double-strand break can be lethal, and (ii) recombination, which is necessary to repair the break, can be prone to generating genomic rearrangements (34Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may be why enzymes like Rqh1 are so important for genomic stability with their potential for resetting reversed replication forks and thereby avoiding fork cleavage (11Doe C.L. Dixon J. Osman F. Whitby M.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2751-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C.

A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is clear that in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes recombination plays an important role in restarting replication at non-origin sites (16Haber J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 271-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Kuzminov A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In E. coli two models have been invoked to explain how fork reversal, and the formation of a Holliday junction, can be used to load recombinases at the stalled fork. The first model says that the Holliday junction formed when the fork reverses is cleaved by RuvABC to generate a double-stranded end. This end then acts as a substrate for RecBCD, which generates a 3′ single-stranded tail for RecA to load onto (6Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 17Kuzminov A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Homologous pairing and strand invasion then ensues to make a D-loop in which the invading 3′-end primes leading strand synthesis, and where the PriA protein can bind and orchestrate primosome reassembly for lagging strand synthesis (37Marians K.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The second model avoids the formation of a single-end break by RecBCD processing the free DNA end formed by the reversal of the fork. Subsequent invasion of the re-annealed parental duplex can then occur before cleavage of the Holliday junction by RuvABC (6Seigneur M. Bidnenko V. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Cell. 1998; 95: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 17Kuzminov A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In eukaryotes, which of these pathways is used may be inconsequential for genome stability since cohesion between sister chromatids should ensure that collapsed forks are accurately repaired by recombination (38Hartsuiker E. Vaessen E.L. Carr A.M. Kohli J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6660-6671Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, if the second model is favoredin vivo, then Mus81-Eme1/Mms4's bias for cleaving reversed forks like F3 and F4 (i.e. in the parental strand that is complementary to the exposed single-strand) means that junction resolution will not collapse the fork (Fig. 6 D). Clearly for this to work cleavage would have to be delayed until strand invasion had occurred. The interaction of S. pombe Mus81 with the forkhead-associated-1 (FHA1) domain of Cds1 (a homologue of Rad53), and its Cds1-dependent phosphorylation in the presence of hydroxyurea (24Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), point to a potential way in which its cleavage activity might be controlled. Where Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 collapses the replication fork repair would probably depend on BIR, although this may involve activities that are distinct from normal BIR (26Kaliraman V. Mullen J.R. Fricke W.M. Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2730-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this respect it may be relevant that the products of fork cleavage by Mus81-Eme1/Mms4 contain small single-stranded gaps and 5′ flaps (Fig. 6, B andC), and therefore would require further processing before ligation. This means that a strand discontinuity could persist in the intact chromatid that might play a role in directing the way in which the replication fork is repaired. Future studies will be required to ascertain the validity of this idea as well as determining the types of stalled replication forks that are actually targeted by Mus81-Eme1/Mms4in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2162575108,"The proliferation, differentiation, and protein synthesis of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play important roles in vascular remodeling. Here, we compared the genetic programming and signaling of SMCs in collagen matrix as a three-dimensional (3-D) environment and on a two-dimensional (2-D) surface. By using DNA microarrays with 9600 genes, we showed that 77 genes were expressed more than twofold and 22 genes were less than one-half in 3-D matrix, when compared with the 2-D condition. The higher expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) in 3-D matrix suggests that p21 may be responsible for the lower proliferation rate in 3-D matrix. The expression level of collagen I was higher in 3-D matrix, suggesting that SMCs in 3-D matrix have increased matrix synthesis. In addition, SMCs in 3-D matrix had less stress fibers and focal adhesions, and a lower level of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Overexpression of FAK attenuated the expression of p21 and collagen I in 3-D matrix, suggesting that FAK functions as a molecular switch for cell cycle regulation and matrix synthesis. The information generated in this study helps to elucidate the molecular basis of the modulation of SMC phenotypes by the extracellular matrix."

We previously found that BACE1 also cleaved a membrane-bound sialyltransferase, ST6Gal I. By BACE1 overexpression in COS cells, the secretion of ST6Gal I markedly increased, and the amino terminus of the secreted ST6Gal I started at Glu41. Here we report that BACE1-Fc chimera protein cleaved the A-ST6Gal I fusion protein, or ST6Gal I-derived peptide, between Leu37 and Gln38, suggesting that an initial cleavage product by BACE1 was three amino acids longer than the secreted ST6Gal I. The three amino acids, Gln38-Ala39-Lys40, were found to be truncated by exopeptidase activity, which was detected in detergent extracts of Golgi-derived membrane fraction. These results suggest that ST6Gal I is cleaved initially between Leu37 and Gln38 by BACE1, and then the three-amino acid sequence at the NH2 terminus is removed by exopeptidase(s) before secretion from the cells.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5135) Google Scholar). Aβ, a 39–43-amino acid peptide, is a proteolytic product derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The β-secretase initially generates the NH2 terminus of Aβ, cleaving APP to produce a soluble NH2-terminal fragment (APPsβ) and a 12-kDa COOH-terminal fragment (C99) that remains membrane bound. C99 is further cleaved by γ-secretase, resulting in the production of pathogenic Aβ peptide (2De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F.

Indeed, APP substitution of Leu at the P1 position for Met together with substitution of Asn at the P2 for Lys, a Swedish mutation of familial Alzheimer's disease, clearly facilitates BACE1-dependent cleavage and induces rapid progression of pathological symptoms. In this article we describe in vitro cleavage of ST6Gal I-derived peptide or protein by BACE1. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats, maintained in specific-pathogen free conditions, were purchased from the Shizuoka Agricultural Cooperative Association for Laboratory Animals (Shizuoka, Japan). Tissue culture media and reagents, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Lipofectin, were purchased from Invitrogen. Protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. CDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose was a gift from Dr. K. J. Colley (University of Illinois at Chicago). Columns for DNA purification were obtained from Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). PCR was performed using LA Taq polymerase (Sigma). Protein molecular weight standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. BACE inhibitor, KTEEISEVN(Sta)VAEF (in which Leu was substituted with statine (Sta) for the P1 position of an APP analogue peptide), was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). A polyclonal antibody, Q38, which specifically recognizes the NH2 terminus of ST6Gal I-Q38 form, was prepared by immunizing a synthetic peptide, QAKEFQC, conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (23Saido T.C. Iwatsubo T. Mann D.M. Shimada H. Ihara Y. Kawashima S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 457-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). For the transient transfection experiment, ST6Gal I FLAG-pSVL, protein A ST6Gal I-pcDSA, and BACE Fc-pEF were constructed as described previously (19Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K.

To generate ST6Gal I FLAG-pcDSA, polymerase chain reaction was performed using ST6Gal I FLAG-pSVL templates with primer 1 (5′-CGCGAATTCAAGAAAGGGAGCGACTATGA-3′) and primer 2 (5′-GCGCTCGAGGCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCC-3′). PCR product purified with the QIAEX II Gel extraction system (Qiagen Inc.) was digested withEcoRI and XhoI and then ligated into the pcDSAEcoRI-XhoI site. STK40A FLAG-pcDSA was generated from ST6Gal I FLAG-pcDSA using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen) with primer 3 (5′-CTTACACTGCAAGCAGCAGAGTTCCAGATGCCC-3′) and primer 4 (5′-GGGCATCTGGAACTCTGCTGCTTGCAGTGTAAG-3′) (24Kitazume-Kawaguchi S.

COS-7 or rat hepatoma FTO2B cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum were plated on 100- or 150-mm tissue culture dishes and grown in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until 50–70% confluent. Cells were transfected using Lipofectin and Opti-MEM I. Expression of proteins was typically allowed to continue for 24 to 48 h. To analyze the soluble secreted form of ST6Gal I-FLAG, COS cells were transfected with rat ST6Gal I FLAG-pSVL. At 48 h after transfection, soluble ST6Gal I-FLAG secreted in the media was pulled down with M2-agarose (Sigma) and analyzed by immunoblotting using either the E41 (1:500), Q38 (1:500), or anti-ST6Gal I polyclonal antibody (1:1000). Pre-absorption of the E41 antibody was performed using peptide EFQMPKC (10 μg/ml) or FQMPKC (10 μg/ml). Horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel, 1:1000) was used as a secondary antibody, and chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for detection (19Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Rat hepatoma FTO2B cells that endogenously express ST6Gal I at a high level were transfected with human BACE1-myc-pcDNA3.1 or the control vector. At 48 h after transfection, soluble ST6Gal I secreted in the media was immunoprecipitated with anti-ST6Gal I rabbit polyclonal antibody. One-third of the immunoprecipitant was used for detection with the anti-ST6Gal I antibody, and the rest of sample was used for detection with the E41 antibody. Each sample was treated with Laemmli sample buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar), subjected to 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with either anti-ST6Gal I or the E41 polyclonal antibody. Rat plasma (200 μl) was diluted with the buffer containing 10 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.1% Triton CF-54, and 0.15m NaCl. Protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) was added to the mixture and rotated for 30 min to remove adhesive proteins. After the beads were removed by centrifugation, 20 μl of CDP-hexanolamine-agarose was then added to pull down sialyltransferase proteins. After rotation for 16 h, beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Sialyltransferase proteins immobilized to the beads were analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-ST6Gal I or the E41 polyclonal antibody. When protein A-ST6Gal I-FLAG or protein A-STK40A FLAG was used as a substrate, both BACE1-Fc and protein A-ST6Gal I fusion proteins were purified from 20 ml of culture media of COS cells that transiently expressed these proteins by absorbing them in 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose and IgG-Sepharose (50% suspension in phosphate-buffered saline), respectively. These preparations of BACE1-Fc and protein-A-ST6Gal I were mixed, resulting in a final volume of 20 μl, which comprised 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) and protease inhibitors for possible contaminating proteases associated with Sepharose beads (Complete (Roche), 10 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μm amastatin). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with rotation. The reaction was then terminated, and the product was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody. When peptides were used as substrates for assay, BACE1-Fc was purified from 50 ml of culture medium of COS cells. Each peptide (0.1 mm) was incubated for 16 h in 50 μl of the reaction mixture as described above. KTEEISEVN(Sta)VAEF (0.1 μm, Bachem) was used as a β-secretase inhibitor. After the incubation the reaction mixture was centrifuged to remove immobilized BACE1-Fc. The products were separated on a reversed-phase HPLC C30-UG-5 column (4.6-mm i.d. × 250 mm, Nomura Chemical Co., Japan) using a Waters model 600E HPLC system, equipped with a Senshu model SSC-5200 (Tokyo, Japan) UV detector. The sample, applied to the column equilibrated in 10% acetonitrile, was then eluted with a gradient of 10–50% acetonitrile for 40 min. The elution rate was 1 ml/min. For MALDI-TOF MS analysis, peptide DYEALTLQAKEFQMPKSQE was incubated with BACE1-Fc in a 5-fold scale, and each peak, separated by HPLC, was collected manually. Protein A-ST6Gal I-FLAG, prepared from 120 ml of culture medium, was cleaved by BACE1-Fc, and the soluble proteins yielded were precipitated with 75% ice-cold ethanol at −20 °C for 16 h. An aliquot of the precipitant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with silver nitrate (Daiichikagaku, Tokyo, Japan). The rest of the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electrical blotting to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore). After staining with Coomassie Blue, the band of soluble ST6Gal I-FLAG (∼49 K) was excised, and its amino-terminal amino acid sequence was determined with a Procise 492 cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). ST6Gal I- or ST6Gal IK40A-Q38 form that starts at Gln38 was prepared by cleaving protein A-ST6Gal I-FLAG or protein A-ST6Gal IK40A-FLAG by BACE1 in vitro as described above. The Q38 form protein as a substrate was mixed with a microsomal fraction (10 μg of protein) or rat Golgi membrane (10 μg of protein) pretreated with 1% of Triton X-100. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH4.5) containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Incubation was terminated by the addition of a Laemmli sample buffer (25Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Kabata S. Arita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15696-15703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the incubation mixture was subjected to 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and then the separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The ST6Gal I-FLAG protein was detected by anti-FLAG antibody, and E41 form was detected by the E41 antibody. Several protease inhibitors such as amastatin, bestatin, 1,10-phenanthrolin, and EDTA were added to the reaction mixture to for the purpose of examining their inhibitory potency. Previously, we used ST6Gal I as a model molecule for studying how glycosyltransferases are cleaved and secreted from the cells (24Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsuji S. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that BACE1 was responsible for the cleavage and secretion of ST6Gal I, i.e. overexpression of BACE1 together with rat ST6Gal I in COS cells increased the secretion of a soluble ST6Gal I, which had a Glu41-Phe42-Gln43-Met44-Pro45-Lys46sequence at the NH2 terminus of soluble ST6Gal I (19Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We prepared a polyclonal antibody, E41, that recognized the NH2-terminal sequence of soluble ST6Gal I. In the present study, the specificity of the E41 antibody was further characterized by a pre-absorption experiment showing that the antibody was absorbed by the peptide EFQMPK but not by FQMPK (Fig.1A). Using the E41 antibody, we also examined the secretion of endogenous ST6Gal I in rat hepatoma FTO2B cells, which express high levels of the ST6Gal I protein. Soluble ST6Gal I, immunoprecipitated with anti-ST6Gal I antibody from the media of FTO2B cells, was detected with the E41 antibody (Fig.1B). With BACE1 overexpression in FTO2B cells, the ST6Gal I secretion markedly increased, and the increased soluble enzyme was also recognized by the E41 antibody. A similar form of soluble ST6Gal I was also present in rat plasma. The plasma enzyme was partially purified using CDP-hexanolamine-agarose resin and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. The plasma enzyme reacted with the E41 antibody as well as anti-ST6Gal I antibody (Fig. 1C). By pre-absorption of E41 antibody with peptide EFQMPK, E41 staining of the plasma enzyme was reduced (data not shown). These data suggest that in vivocleavage and secretion of endogenous ST6Gal I are also mediated by BACE1. We confirmed that the secreted ST6Gal I starts at Glu41in vivo as well as in cultured cells (19Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), but in vitro studies by others (21Turner III, R.T. Koelsch G. Hong L. Castanheira P. Ermolieff J. Ghosh A.K. Tang J.

We therefore analyzed BACE1-dependent cleavage of a peptide substrate, DYEALTLQAKEFQMPKSQE, which corresponds to Asp31∼Glu49 of ST6Gal I sequence. The peptide substrate was incubated with purified BACE1-Fc chimera, and the products yielded were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. We detected two peptide peaks as products, the retention times of which corresponded to those of authentic peptides, DYEALTL and QAKEFQMPKSQE (Fig.2, A andB). These products were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis, and their protonated molecular ions, [M+H]+, were observed at m/z 824 and 1451 (TableI and Fig. 2, C andD). Several other peaks (marked with an asterisk) in the HPLC chromatogram were also observed in the control reaction mixture without peptide substrate and shown by MALDI-TOF MS analysis to be non-peptide components. We did not detect peptide peaks corresponding to DYEALTLQAK and EFQMPKSQE on HPLC and MALTI-TOFMS analyses. This result indicates that BACE1-Fc cleaves the peptide substrate exclusively between Leu37 and Gln38.Table ISummary of MALDI-TOF MS analysisPeptide substrate DYEALTLQAKEFQMPKSQEFragmental pattern 1DYEALTLQAKEFQMPKSQE Calculated mass [M + H]+8241-aAtomic mass unit.14501-aAtomic mass unit.

Open table in a new tab We further characterized the cleavage of the ST6Gal I peptide, by comparison with those of APPwt (KTEEISEVKMDAEFRHDSG) and APPsw (KTEEISEVNLDAEFRHDSG) peptides, which cover the β-cleavage site of APP. The APPsw peptide was the more preferable substrate (Fig. 3). BACE1-Fc cleaved ST6Gal I peptide with higher efficiency than APPwtpeptide. By the addition of a BACE inhibitor at 0.1 μm, cleavage of the STGal I peptide, as well as that of the APPsw peptide, was inhibited nearly 50%. When mutant substrate ST-LA was used, in which Leu at the P1 position was replaced by Ala, cleavage efficiency was reduced to 40% compared with the wild-type substrate (ST-WT), suggesting that the Leu residue in the ST6Gal I peptide is recognized as a preferable amino acid at the P1 position. This result is consistent with those reported previously by others (21Turner III, R.T. Koelsch G. Hong L. Castanheira P. Ermolieff J. Ghosh A.K. Tang J. Castenheira P. Ghosh A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10001-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Gruninger-Leitch F. Schlatter D. Kung E. Nelbock P. Dobeli H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4687-4693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar); Leu at the P1 position in the APP sequence is recognized preferentially by BACE1. We also examined BACE1-dependent cleavage of protein A-ST6Gal I-FLAG chimera, which lacked a transmembrane domain, instead containing a signal peptide plus protein A and COOH terminally tagged with FLAG. The Protein A-ST6Gal I chimera was reported to have sialyltransferase activity (25Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Kabata S. Arita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15696-15703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting that the catalytic domain was correctly folded as a native enzyme. The chimeric protein was incubated with BACE1-Fc. The cleaved protein was purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 4) and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for sequencing. Micro-sequence analysis revealed that the NH2-terminal sequence of the soluble protein was exclusively qAKEFQMpks, where lowercase letters indicate ambiguous identification (the first cycle of amino acid also contained Gly, most likely derived from the transfer buffer which contained a large amount of glycine). Thus, protein A-ST6Gal I-FLAG was cleaved exclusively between Leu37 and Gln38, as was the case with the peptide substrate. We also examined whether BACE1 recognized Lys40at P3′ in the ST6Gal I sequence. We constructed a mutant substrate in which Lys40 of protein A-ST6Gal I-FLAG was replaced with Ala. BACE1-Fc cleaved the protein A-ST6Gal IK40A-FLAG with efficiency similar to the wild type protein (Fig. 5). When we took a time course to compare the cleavage efficiency between these protein A-ST6Gal I proteins in detail, protein A-ST6Gal IK40A-FLAG was cleaved at almost the same efficiency as the wild type (data not shown). These results suggest that Lys40 of ST6Gal I is not critical for BACE1 recognition. Our results described above suggest that BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I between Leu37 and Gln38; the cleaved product (Q38 form) was three amino acids longer than the secreted one (E41 form). We speculated that the three-amino acid QAK sequence of the Q38 form was removed by endogenous exopeptidase(s) before secretion, and hence we set up an assay for detecting possible exopeptidase activity. As a substrate for the assay we used the Q38 form of ST6Gal I, which had been prepared by cleavage of protein A-ST6Gal I-FLAG with BACE1-Fc. When the substrate was mixed with detergent extracts of a microsomal fraction of COS cells, its NH2-terminal QAK sequence was trimmed to generate the E41 form of ST6Gal I, which was detected by the E41 antibody (Fig. 6A). This suggests that the extracts contained protease activity, as we had expected. The protease activity was not detected by adding the microsomal fraction without detergent treatment. As shown in Fig.6B, we also detected such a protease activity in the detergent-solubilized Golgi fraction prepared from rat livers (27Leelavathi D.E. Estes L.W. Feingold D.S. Lombardi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 124-138Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the protease was localized mainly in the Golgi apparatus and its catalytic domain faces the luminal side. To rule out the possibility that the protease has endoprotease activity, we added protein A-ST6Gal I-FLAG as substrate to the detergent-solubilized Golgi fraction as the enzyme fraction to see whether the ST6Gal I E41 form was produced. Because we did not detect the production of ST6Gal I E41 form, we surmised that the protease in the Golgi fraction is a kind of exopeptidase that acts on ST6Gal I-Q38 form. We also confirmed that BACE1 itself has no trimming activity, because we did not detect production of the ST6Gal I-Q38 form without detergent-solubilized Golgi fraction (Fig. 6B). Thus we demonstrate the presence of luminal exopeptidase activity that trims the NH2-terminal QAK-sequence of the Q38 form. To further characterize the trimming activity, we tested the sensitivity of the putative peptidase to the various aminopeptidase inhibitors (Table II). As both EDTA and 1,10-pheananthroline significantly inhibited the peptidase activity at 1 mm, the enzyme seems to have metallopeptidase-like character. Moreover, we found that bestatin, but not amastatin, significantly inhibits the activity. These results suggest that the protease that trims NH2-terminal QAK sequence of ST6Gal I-Q38 form belongs to the bestatin-sensitive metalloaminopeptidase.Table IIEffect of various protease inhibitors on the exopeptidase activityInhibitorConcentrationResidual activitymm%Amastatin1.0265Bestatin1.0671,10-Phenanthroline1.062EDTA1.085ST6Gal I-FLAG Q38 form was incubated with detergent-solubilized Golgi membrane fraction (10 μg of protein) in the presence or absence of 1 mm protease inhibitors. The reaction products were then analyzed by immunoblotting with both the anti-FLAG and the E41 antibodies. The amounts of total ST6Gal-FLAG substrate and the product E41 form were quantitated using an LAS 1000 chemiluminescence analyzer (Fuji). Values are the average of relative residual activity obtained from the three independent experiments when E41 form/total substrate was taken as 100% in the control sample. Open table in a new tab ST6Gal I-FLAG Q38 form was incubated with detergent-solubilized Golgi membrane fraction (10 μg of protein) in the presence or absence of 1 mm protease inhibitors. The reaction products were then analyzed by immunoblotting with both the anti-FLAG and the E41 antibodies.

Values are the average of relative residual activity obtained from the three independent experiments when E41 form/total substrate was taken as 100% in the control sample. We show here that BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I between Leu37 and Gln38. Although amino-terminal sequencing analysis showed that most of soluble secreted ST6Gal I started at Glu41, there might be small amount of soluble ST6Gal I starting at Gln38. We prepared an antibody that specifically recognizes the NH2 terminus of ST6Gal I-Q38 form. This Q38 antibody failed to detect soluble secreted ST6Gal I from COS cells, even though E41 antibody did detect the soluble ST6Gal I (Fig. 7). The results indicate that secreted ST6GalI start mostly at Glu41. A simple explanation for the efficient conversion from ST6Gal I-Q38 form to E41 form is that the amount of exopeptidase activity exceeds that of the substrate. An alternative idea is that exopeptidase-dependent trimming may be a prerequisite for secretion. The latter speculation is supported by our previous cellular experiment (19Kitazume S. Tachida Y. Oka R. Shirotani K. Saido T.C. Hashimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13554-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) in which a ST6Gal IK40A mutant expressed in COS cells was poorly secreted (40% of wild type level), although this mutation did not affect in vitro BACE1-dependent cleavage (Fig. 5). The mutation may affect exopeptidase-dependent trimming and then the secretory process. We therefore compared the exopeptidase activity toward ST6Gal I-Q38 form with that for its K40A mutant. Exopeptidase cleavage rate of the K40A mutant was half of wild type protein over a particular time course; i.e.when we set the cleavage rate of wild type after a 2-h incubation as 100%, the cleavage rate of K40A was 46%. After a 1-h incubation, the cleavage rate of the wild type was 40% and that of K40A was 17% (Fig. 8). These results suggest that K40A mutation reduces the efficiency of the exopeptidase activity. In the present experiment, we used ST6Gal I peptide and protein A-ST6Gal I-FLAG as substrates for BACE1, both of which were cleaved between Leu37 and Gln38. The observation fits other previous reports (20Citron M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Turner III, R.T. Koelsch G.

Science. 2000; 290: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) showing that BACE1 prefers bulky hydrophobic residues at the P3 position also correspond well with the presence of Leu at the P3 of ST6Gal I, suggesting that BACE1-Fc preferably recognizes the Leu35-Thr36-Leu37 sequence of ST6Gal I and cleaves exclusively at this site. This cleavage is also supported by our own previous cellular experiment, in which replacement of Leu37 with Ala (ST6Gal IL37A), an unfavorable substitution for BACE1 cleavage in vitro, significantly reduced the secretion from the cells (61 ± 20% of the control level, p < 0.05). Taken together, we speculate that BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I between Leu37 and Gln38 inside the cells and generates the Q38 form of soluble ST6Gal I as an initial product. Our data suggest that luminal exopeptidase activity is involved in the trimming of the NH2-terminal flanking sequence of Q38 form (Fig. 6). A proposed model for ST6Gal I processing and secretion is summarized in Fig. 9. In some cases, exopeptidase activities are critical for the processing of luminal proteins as well as physiologically important peptides (29Chesneau V. Pierotti A.R. Barre N. Creminon C. Tougard C. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2056-2061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Serwold T. Gaw S. Shastri N. Nat.

It is notable that the main portion of soluble ST6Gal I secreted from the cells is the E41 form (24Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsuji S. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); we did not detect the Q38 form in the culture medium (Fig. 7), suggesting that the Q38 form generated by BACE1 is efficiently converted to the E41 form before secretion. Moreover, our previous observation, in which a ST6Gal IK40A mutant expressed in COS cells was poorly secreted (24Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Dohmae N. Takio K. Tsuji S. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), supports the idea that the mutation may affect exopeptidase-dependent trimming and then the secretory process. Indeed, the present data indicate that the K40A mutation somewhat reduces exopeptidase trimming efficiency. At present, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that an additional unveiled mechanism other than the ST6Gal I cleavage process exists to regulate the ST6Gal I secretion. The data presented here suggest that the exopeptidase has a bestatin-sensitive metalloprotease-like character. Because we used a crude Golgi membrane fraction as an enzyme source in this study, purification of this exopeptidase will be required for further characterization in the future. Identification and characterization of the exopeptidase will be important for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cleavage and secretion of ST6Gal I.

This discontinuous staining was confirmed in other cell types and also corroborated in A549 cells stained with the thiol-reactive dye mercury orange. The selectivity of antibody binding was confirmed by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)-dependent inhibition of GSH synthesis. However, confocal visualization of antibody-stained A549 cells in the z-plane revealed the majority of the peri-nuclear staining intensity in the upper half of the cell to be associated with mitochondria, as confirmed by double staining for cytochrome oxidase. Integration of the confocal signals from the nuclear and cytosolic regions halfway down the z-plane showed that the GSH concentrations of these compartments are close to equilibrium. Confirmation of the relatively high levels of mitochondrial glutathione was provided in cells treated with BSO and visualized in z-section, revealing the mitochondrial GSH content of these cells to be well preserved in apposition to near-complete depletion of cytosolic/nuclear GSH. Localized gradients within the cytosolic compartment were also visible, particularly in the z-plane. The antibody also provided initial visualization of the compartmentalization of protein-GSH mixed disulfides formed in A549 cells exposed to diamide. Discontinuous staining was again evident, with heavy staining in membrane blebs and in the nuclear region. Using FACS analysis of anti-GSH antibody-stained Jurkat T lymphocytes, we also demonstrated population variations in the cellular compliment of GSH and protein-GSH mixed disulfides, formed in response to diamide. In addition, we showed cell-cycle variation in GSH content of the cells, with the highest levels of GSH associated with the G2/M mitotic phase of the cell cycle, using double staining with propidium iodide. Similar FACS analyses performed in isolated mitochondria presented a considerable variation in GSH content within mitochondria of uniform granularity from the same preparation."

These transporters (i.e. PEPT1, PEPT2, PHT1, and PHT2) are operationally similar in that they are electrogenic, coupling substrate influx to proton movement down an inwardly directed electrochemical proton gradient. PEPT1 was the first one cloned, from a rabbit intestinal cDNA library (1Fei Y.-J. Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Romero M.F. Singh S.K. Boron W.F.

This is the only POT in the intestine and is responsible for the absorption of small peptides arising from digestion of dietary proteins.

Two newer members of the POT family were cloned from a rat brain cDNA library, the peptide/histidine transporters PHT1 (5Yamashita T. Shimada S. Guo W. Sato K. Kohmura E. Hayakawa T. Takagi T.

J. 2001; 356: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These transporters are unique in that they transport both small peptides and histidine. PHT1 displayed a high affinity for histidine when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and was expressed strongly in the brain and eye. In contrast, PHT2 was expressed primarily in the lymphatic system and detected faintly in the brain. Their homology to either rat PEPT1 or PEPT2 was weak (less than 25% amino acid identity). Interestingly, a third peptide transporter was cloned from rat brain but found to be identical to that of rat kidney PEPT2 (19Wang H. Fei Y.-J. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C967-C975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Still, the physiological role of POT members in the brain remains to be determined. The presence of multiple peptide transporters within the brain has generated substantial interest regarding their precise anatomical location, role in neuropeptide homeostasis, pharmacologic potential, and relative importance. Preliminary studies from our laboratory indicate that PEPT2, but not PEPT1, is present in rat choroid plexus epithelial cells in primary culture and thatPEPT2 is functionally active at the apical membrane surface (20Shu C. Shen H. Teuscher N.S. Lorenzi P.J. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, our studies in isolated rat choroid plexus suggest that PEPT2 has a major role in the uptake of 5-aminolevulinic acid (21Novotny A. Xiang J. Stummer W. Teuscher N.S. Smith D.E. Keep R.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), GlySar (22Teuscher N.S. Novotny A. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Y.). 2001; 18: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (i.e. on the order of 30–60%). However, these results are far from conclusive. In this regard, targeted disruption of thePEPT2 gene in mouse would allow one to determine the significance of this POT relative to others present in brain (i.e. PHT1 and PHT2 but not PEPT1). The generation of transgenic PEPT2-deficient mice would also provide a powerful tool to probe the physiological and pharmacological functions of PEPT2 in other cells types or tissues. In this study, we have developed heterozygous and homozygousPEPT2-deficient mice, and we clearly demonstrated thatPEPT2−/− mice have impaired uptake of dipeptide in choroid plexus relative to that observed in wild-type animals. Almost all of the uptake of GlySar was eliminated in null mice, demonstrating for the first time that, under the experimental conditions of this study,PEPT2 is the primary member of the peptide transporter family responsible for trafficking of peptides/mimetics at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. To clone the mouse PEPT2 gene, a partial complementary DNA probe was prepared by PCR after reverse transcription of total RNA isolated from mouse kidney. The PCR primer sequences were designed on the basis of homology between human, rat, and rabbitPEPT2 cDNA sequences (2Boll M. Herget M. Wagener M. Weber W.M. Markovich D. Biber J. Clauss W. Murer H.

The resulting 2065-bp partial cDNA fragment corresponds to the region of thePEPT2 transporter protein extending from the putative first membrane-spanning domain through the carboxyl terminus. This probe was used to screen a mouse ES-129/SvJ BAC genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis). Hybridizing BAC clones were isolated, restriction-mapped, and partially sequenced. To create a targetedPEPT2 gene with an in-frame lacZ reporter gene under the control of the endogenous PEPT2 gene promoter, a 3.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing exon 1 was subcloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). Then a 300-bp PCR fragment (ClaI-KpnI) was generated to create a novel KpnI site in the translation start codon (ATG) of thePEPT2 gene. DNA sequence of the PCR fragment was identical to the original sequence of PEPT2 genomic clone except for the KpnI site. The 300-bp PCR fragment (ClaI-KpnI) was utilized as a linker to the upstream 2.9-kb PEPT2 gene fragment (EcoRI-ClaI). The entire 3.2-kb 5′ homologous arm of PEPT2 gene was then inserted into theKpnI-NheI sites upstream of the lacZreporter gene in the pNZTK2 vector (gift of Dr. Richard Palmiter). The 4.4-kb 3′ PEPT2 genomic fragment, including exons 4 and 5, was cloned downstream of the Neo cassette in pNZTK2. Thus, genomic sequence from the amino terminus to the second transmembrane domain (5.2-kb fragment) was deleted in the PEPT2 gene targeting vector. The targeting vector was linearized at a unique AscI site and then electroporated into 129/SvJ/R1 ES cells (Stem Cell Facility of the University of Michigan). The stably transfected cells were selected by culturing in G418 and ganciclovir. Targeted ES cell clones were identified by the presence of a 3.3-kb PCR product using the PCR primers indicated by arrows in Fig. 1 B (Expand Long Template PCR System, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR-positive clones were expanded and confirmed by Southern analysis using the 3′ outside probe and 5′ inside probe shown in Fig. 1 B. Targeted ES cells were introduced into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. Male chimeras were mated with C57BL/6 females (the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) to identify germ line-competent chimeras capable of transferring the genetically modified ES cell genome to their offspring. The targetedPEPT2 allele was detected in offspring of these crosses by PCR and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies using the 5′ probe shown in Fig. 1 B. Offspring carrying the mutant allele were intercrossed to obtain animals that were homozygous for targeted mutation (PEPT2−/−). Northern analyses were performed as described previously (24Shen H. Smith D.E. Brosius III, F.C. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 49: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from mouse kidney using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). The total RNA (25 μg/lane) was then resolved on a 1% agarose formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized at high stringency with 32P-labeled oligolabeled cDNA probes corresponding to various coding regions ofPEPT2. Total RNA was isolated from mouse choroid plexus with Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was reverse-transcribed as described previously (14Smith D.E. Pavlova A. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Yang T. Huang Y.G. Schnermann J.B. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1998; 15: 1244-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using oligo(dT) as a primer. PCR was performed with the PEPT2 primers (Fig. 1 A): 5′ primer, ATTGCCTTCATCGTGGTGAATGAATTCTGCGA-3′; 3′ primer, ACCAAGAA(T/G)ACAAGGCTCTGATGACTTGCTG-3′); and β-actin control primers, 5′ primer, AACCGCGAGAAGATGACCCAGATCATGTTT, and 3′ primer, AGCAGCCGTGGCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTC. PCR was initiated at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles (denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s), and terminated by a final extension of 7-min duration. Apical membrane vesicles were prepared from the kidneys ofPEPT2+/+, PEPT2+/−, and PEPT2−/− mice, as described previously for rabbit renal apical membrane vesicles (25Akarawut W. Lin C.-J. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 684-690PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lin C.-J. Akarawut W. Smith D.E. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1999; 16: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The membrane proteins were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PEPT2 antibody raised against a purifiedPEPT2 GST fusion protein, as described previously (15Shen H. Smith D.E. Yang T. Huang Y.G. Schnermann J.B. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F658-F665PubMed Google Scholar). Whole tissue choroid plexus uptake studies were performed in 30–50-day-old-mice, as described previously in rats for 5-aminolevulinic acid (21Novotny A. Xiang J. Stummer W. Teuscher N.S. Smith D.E. Keep R.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and GlySar (22Teuscher N.S. Novotny A. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 494-499PubMed Google Scholar). Lateral ventricle and fourth ventricle choroid plexuses were harvested from anesthetized mice, weighed, and transferred to bicarbonate artificial cerebrospinal fluid buffer (127 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaHCO3, 2.4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 1.1 mmCaCl2, 0.85 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm Na2SO4, and 5 mmglucose (pH 7.4)) which was continuously bubbled with 5% CO2, 95% O2. After 5 min of recovery, the choroid plexuses were transferred to 0.95 ml of Tris-MES buffer (147 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 0.5 mmKH2PO4, 1.1 mm CaCl2, 0.85 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmNa2SO4, 5.0 mm glucose, and 10 mm Tris, and/or MES (pH 6.5)) and continuously bubbled with 100% O2 for 0.5 min. Transport was initiated by addition of 0.05 ml of Tris-MES buffer which contained ∼0.2 μCi of [14C]GlySar and 0.2 μCi of [3H]mannitol (an extracellular marker), resulting in a final GlySar concentration of 1.9 μm. Transport was terminated after 5 or 30 min by transferring the plexuses to ice-cold buffer and filtering under reduced pressure. The filters (118-μm mesh, Tetko, Kansas City, MO) were washed three times with the same buffer. The filters and choroid plexuses were then soaked in 0.33 ml of 1 m hyamine hydroxide (a tissue solubilizer) for 30 min before the addition of scintillation mixture (Cytoscint) and counting with a dual-channel liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 3801; Fullerton, CA). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of four experiments, unless otherwise noted. Each experiment consisted of choroid plexuses (i.e. lateral and fourth) pooled from two animals. Statistical comparisons were made between litter-mate wild-type (Pept2+/+) and homozygous transgenic mice (Pept2−/−) at each time point (i.e. 5 and 30 min) using a two-sample t test. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. The Pept2gene spanned ∼33 kb as reported previously by Rubio-Aliaga et al. (10Rubio-Aliaga I. Boll M. Daniel H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and was totally contained within the BAC construct 22021 (Fig. 1 A). To inactivate the Pept2 gene, we constructed a targeting vector in which the 3.2 kb of 5′ promoter/enhancer and untranslated sequence and 4.4 kb of sequence encoding part of intron 3, exons 4 and 5, intron 4, and part of intron 5 of the murine Pept2 gene were cloned into the appropriate sites of pNZTK2 (Fig. 1 B). A LacZ construct was inserted immediately 3′ to the Pept2promoter/enhancer region. The targeted construct was used to disrupt the Pept2 gene in 129/SvJ/R1 ES cells (Fig. 1, Cand D). The resulting disrupted gene lacked the sequence that encoded the first 112 amino acids of the PEPT2polypeptide. Germ line transmission of the targeted gene resulted in mice heterozygous for the disrupted Pept2 gene on a mixed background of C57BL/6 and 129/SvJ/R1. The heterozygote animals were mated to produce Pept2 null animals (Fig. 1 E). Of the initial 182 pups born, 44, 100, and 38 animals hadPept2−/−, Pept2+/−, and Pept2+/+ genotypes, respectively (i.e. a ratio of 24:55:21%). Average litter size was 10 pups, with normal gender distribution. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that PEPT2 mRNA expression was absent in the kidneys from Pept2−/− mice and that expression in thePept2+/− mice was ∼50% of the levels found inPept2+/+ mice (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, RT-PCR analysis showed no detectable PEPT2 mRNA in choroid plexus from Pept2−/− mice (Fig. 2 B). Immunoblots showed complete absence of immunoreactive PEPT2in kidney brush border vesicle preparations from Pept2−/− animals. Protein levels in renal apical membranes ofPept2+/− mice were ∼50% of that found inPept2+/+ animals (Fig. 2 C). The amount of protein obtained from the mouse choroid plexus was too small to evaluate by immunoblotting. PEPT1 is an oligopeptide transporter with ∼50% homology to PEPT2. PEPT1 is expressed in kidney along the apical membrane of epithelia in the proximal portion of the proximal tubule, whereas PEPT2 is expressed in the more distal portion of the proximal tubule (15Shen H. Smith D.E. Yang T. Huang Y.G. Schnermann J.B. Brosius III, F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F658-F665PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether there was any compensatory up-regulation of thePept1 gene in Pept2−/− animals. Immunoblotting showed only a minor increase in PEPT1 expression betweenPept2−/− and Pept+/+ animals (Fig. 3). Pept2−/− mice appeared normal and grew to normal adult weight (Table I). Base-line blood and urine chemistries were comparable with those from Pept2+/+ animals (Table I). There was no obvious behavioral or neurological phenotype. Gross and light microscopic morphology of the kidneys and choroid plexus appeared normal. Choroid plexus weights did not vary betweenPept2−/− and Pept+/+ mice.Table IBase-line characteristics of PEPT2+/+, PEPT2+/−, and PEPT−/− micePept2+/+ (n)Pept2+/− (n)Pept2−/− (n)Body WeightMale, 7–8 weeks (g)25.6 ± 0.7 (21)24.9 ± 0.8 (21)25.3 ± 0.5 (21)Female, 7–8 weeks (g)19.9 ± 0.4 (21)19.5 ± 0.4 (21)19.9 ± 0.6 (21)SerumGlucose (mg/dl)146.7 ± 8.0 (22)191.4 ± 11.3 (18)168.1 ± 6.4 (19)Sodium (mmol/liter)152.1 ± 0.6 (22)149.8 ± 1.1 (18)153.4 ± 0.8 (20)Potassium (mmol/liter)5.2 ± 0.9 (22)6.2 ± 0.5 (18)5.8 ± 0.3 (20)Chloride (mmol/liter)116.9 ± 0.9 (22)116.5 ± 0.8 (18)119.0 ± 0.5 (20)CO2(mmol/liter)14.5 ± 0.8 (22)15.6 ± 1.2 (17)15.7 ± 0.6 (20)Alkaline Phosphatase (units/liter)100.2 ± 8.8 (21)88.0 ± 7.8 (11)98.3 ± 6.9 (17)ALT (units/liter)79.9 ± 27.6 (18)79.0 ± 22.4 (11)74.1 ± 11.0 (16)Calcium (mg/dl)8.5 ± 0.1 (22)8.8 ± 0.1 (17)8.9 ± 0.1 (18)Protein (g/dl)5.0 ± 0.1 (20)4.8 ± 0.1 (11)4.9 ± 0.1 (17)Albumin (g/dl)2.1 ± 0.1 (18)2.1 ± 0.1 (11)2.1 ± 0.1 (16)Bilirubin (mg/dl)0.5 ± 0.1 (18)0.5 ± 0.1 (11)0.6 ± 0.1 (15)AST (units/liter)215 ± 24 (21)217 ± 25 (14)225 ± 29 (17)Results are means ± S.E.

Based on functional studies of GlySar uptake in rat choroid plexus whole tissue (22Teuscher N.S. Novotny A. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 494-499PubMed Google Scholar), phenotypic analyses were performed at either 5 or 30 min to approximate linear and plateau conditions, respectively. As also shown in the previous study, a Tris-MES buffer (pH 6.5) is optimal to probe the proton-dependent uptake mechanisms of relevant oligopeptide transporters. As shown in Fig. 4, virtually all of the uptake of GlySar in choroid plexus tissue was eliminated in Pept2 −/− mice. In this regard, only 10.9 and 3.9% of the residual activity was still present at 5 and 30 min, respectively (p < 0.001 for both analyses). Cellular, molecular, and physiological studies have made major contributions toward our understanding of transport phenomena and the role of membrane transporters. However, these experimental approaches are often limited by their in vitro design and lack of blood supply, overlapping substrate specificities, and contribution of multiple transport systems, some of which are unknown at the time of study. As a result, it is difficult, if not impossible, to define the function of a single specific protein and its significance in relation to other possible proteins that are present in the tissue or organ of interest. Such is the situation in brain in which multiple oligopeptide transporters are present (e.g. PEPT2, PHT1, and PHT2). A detailed description of PEPT2 mRNA distribution in the rat nervous system was first reported by Berger and Hediger (27Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Anat. Embryol. 1999; 199: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). By using nonisotopic in situ hybridization techniques, they found that PEPT2 was expressed in brain by astrocytes, subependymal cells, ependymal cells, and epithelial cells of choroid plexus. In a subsequent study using immunoblot analyses and immunofluorescent confocal microscopy, Shu et al. (20Shu C. Shen H. Teuscher N.S. Lorenzi P.J. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PEPT2, but not PEPT1, protein was present in the apical membrane of rat choroid plexus epithelial cells. They also observed that GlySar accumulation and transepithelial transport were 3 to 4 times higher when introduced from the apical as opposed to the basal side of the cell monolayers. This study and other studies from our laboratory (21Novotny A. Xiang J. Stummer W. Teuscher N.S. Smith D.E. Keep R.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Teuscher N.S. Novotny A. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 494-499PubMed Google Scholar, 23Teuscher N.S. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2001; 18: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggest that PEPT2 may have a role in the efflux of neuropeptides, peptide fragments, and peptidomimetics from cerebrospinal fluid to the blood. Based on whole tissue studies, in the presence and absence of sodium, it has been estimated that PEPT2-mediated transport may account for about 30–60% of the total transport processes in rat choroid plexus. However, this estimate is far from certain because PHT1 (5Yamashita T. Shimada S. Guo W. Sato K. Kohmura E. Hayakawa T. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10205-10211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and PHT2 (6Sakata K. Yamashita T. Maeda M. Moriyama Y. Shimada S. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) transcripts have been reported in the brain, with PHT1 being especially abundant in the hippocampus, choroid plexus, cerebellum, and pontine nucleus. Moreover, it is unknown if other as yet unidentified peptide transporters are expressed and functionally active in brain. Thus, a transgenic PEPT2-deficient model would be a valuable tool in delineating the role and relative importance of this specific transporter at the blood-CSF interface. In the present study, a PEPT2-deficient mouse model was successfully generated by targeted gene disruption in embryonic stem cells. The Southern analyses confirm that this novel mutant mouse strain does not produce the gene for PEPT2. Moreover, RT-PCR analyses confirm that PEPT2 transcripts are absent from the choroid plexus, kidney, and brain of null mice, while being retained in wild-type and to a lesser extent in PEPT2+/− mice. As expected, the low affinity peptide transporter, PEPT1, was retained in kidney. Surprisingly, PEPT2 null mice were viable and grew at a normal rate. There were no obvious biochemical changes nor morphologic abnormalities in the kidneys and choroid plexus of PEPT2−/− animals. Despite the large number of possible di- and tripeptide substrates in brain, and the putative physiological role of PEPT2 as an efflux pump for neuropeptides (and/or fragments), no apparent pathologies were observed. Nevertheless, dipeptide uptake studies in isolated rat choroid plexus revealed a markedly dysfunctional process. As clearly demonstrated, the transport activity of GlySar in PEPT2−/− mice was essentially ablated, with less than 10% residual function on average. Several factors may explain the 10% residual activity for dipeptide uptake in PEPT2 null mice. Most notably, the activity may reflect the presence of a low affinity carrier. This possibility is consistent with the study of Shu et al. (20Shu C. Shen H. Teuscher N.S. Lorenzi P.J. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), in which a pH-independent, low affinity transporter (i.e. K m of 1.4 mm for GlySar) was observed at the basolateral membrane of rat choroid plexus epithelial cells in primary culture. Although the molecular properties of this protein were not delineated, the basolateral carrier was distinct from that of PEPT1 and PEPT2 and was involved in the coordinated efflux of GlySar across the cell monolayers. We subsequently performed a temperature-dependent study in null mice and found that 1.9 μm GlySar uptake was reduced at 5 min (0.111 ± 0.013 μl/mg at 37 °Cversus 0.069 ± 0.007 μl/mg at 4 °C;p < 0.05). Thus, there is some temperature-dependent uptake in the choroid plexus of null mice, but it is small (0.042 μl/mg in Pept2−/− compared with a total uptake of 1.02 ± 0.05 μl/mg in Pept2+/+ at 37 °C). Whether or not this process reflects the basolateral low affinity transporter is unclear. Some of the residual activity might also be explained by other factors. Integrity of the radiolabel was considered, but GlySar had a radiochemical purity of 98–99%. This dipeptide has also been shown to be stable in rat choroid plexus (20Shu C. Shen H. Teuscher N.S. Lorenzi P.J. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,22Teuscher N.S. Novotny A. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 494-499PubMed Google Scholar). Although tissue binding might occur, this effect would be minimal, at best, based on our GlySar uptake time profiles in whole tissue rat choroid plexus (22Teuscher N.S. Novotny A. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 494-499PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a nonspecific, non-temperature-dependent process (i.e.diffusion) may be operational to a minor extent in the absence of PEPT2 protein. Brain homeostasis depends upon the composition of both brain interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid (28Strazielle N. Ghersi-Egea J.-F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6275-6289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hakvoort A. Haselbach M. Wegener J. Hoheisel D. Galla H.J. J.

Uhler M.D. Basic Neurochemistry: Molecular, Cellular and Medical Aspects. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1999: 671-689Google Scholar). Whereas the former is largely controlled by the blood-brain barrier, the latter is regulated by a highly specialized blood-CSF interface, the choroid plexus epithelium. Similar to other epithelia, the choroid plexus is polar with distinct brush border (CSF-facing) and basolateral (blood-facing) surfaces. The polarity of the cell has distinct characteristics, and in particular, transporters are uniquely distributed among the two membrane surfaces. More recent studies (31Johanson C.E. Conn P.M. Neuroscience in Medicine. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 171-196Google Scholar,32Johanson C.E. Adelman G. Smith B.H. Encyclopedia of Neuroscience. 1. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1999: 384-397Google Scholar) have shown that choroid plexuses participate in a variety of functions in addition to their traditional roles of controlling the volume and ionic composition of cerebrospinal fluid. In this regard, they have specialized transport systems that allow blood to brain influx of micronutrients or brain to blood efflux of harmful neurotransmitter metabolites. The choroidal epithelium is also a source of and a target for hormones and other neuroactive or neuromodulating compounds. Moreover, the presence of drug-metabolizing enzymes in the cerebral capillaries, choroidal epithelium, and nervous tissue suggests a concerted mechanism of brain protection by which substrates are inactivated and then cleared from the cerebrospinal fluid (28Strazielle N. Ghersi-Egea J.-F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6275-6289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ghersi-Egea J.F. Leininger-Muller B. Cecchelli R. Fenstermacher J.D. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82/83: 645-653Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Peptide transporters may, therefore, serve a nutritive function (as in the intestine and kidney) by supplying small peptides from the blood circulation to choroid plexus tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. Alternatively, they may serve as a clearance mechanism to remove unwanted neuropeptides (and peptide fragments) from the CSF. Finally, they may also affect the disposition of peptidomimetic drugs and toxic agents in the CSF and brain. The lack of an observable pathological phenotype in PEPT2null mice suggests that other transporter and/or metabolic systems can compensate for this loss of function. It may also mean thatPEPT2 plays an insignificant role in the disposition of neuropeptides (and/or fragments) in choroid plexus and that its main role is in protecting the organism from toxic xenobiotics. This last scenario is analogous to P-glycoprotein-deficient mdr1a(−/−) mice in which no obvious phenotypic abnormalities were observed other than hypersensitivity to drugs (34Schinkel A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In this case, nearly all of the mdr1(−/−) mice died by a chance encounter with the anthelmintic pesticide ivermectin. Although the role of PEPT2 in choroid plexus has not been conclusively determined, our initial findings inPEPT2-deficient mice have important implications. Thus, asPEPT2 appears to mediate the efflux of peptides and peptidomimetics from cerebrospinal fluid (20Shu C. Shen H. Teuscher N.S. Lorenzi P.J. Keep R.F. Smith D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), improved central nervous system delivery of therapeutic agents may be achieved by specific blocking agents or by designing therapeutic agents with limitedPEPT2 affinity. In conclusion, results from this study provide strong evidence that, under the experimental conditions of this study, PEPT2 is the primary member of the POT family responsible for dipeptide uptake in brain choroid plexus tissue. As a result, these findings may have significant implications in the design, delivery, and targeting of peptidomimetic drugs for the treatment of central nervous system disorders. Although PEPT2 null mice were without obvious visible abnormalities, further testing for biological phenotypes is being performed. Notwithstanding this surprising lack of physiological and/or pathological change, the development of transgenicPEPT2-deficient mice provides a unique opportunity for probing its in vivo role and relative importance in the brain, kidney, and other tissues of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2171383865,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients produce great amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating that circulating cells are activated and could mirror changes occurring in inflammatory cells infiltrating the failing heart. Adenosine is a regulatory metabolite acting through four membrane receptors that are linked to adenylyl cyclase: activation of the A2A receptor subtype has been reported to inhibit cytokine release. Changes of the adenosinergic system may play a role in CHF development. Here we report an increase of A2A receptor expression, density, and coupling to adenylyl cyclase in blood circulating cells of CHF patients. A2A receptor up-regulation was also found in the explanted hearts of these patients, suggesting that changes of peripheral adenosine receptors mirror changes occurring in the disease target organ. In a cohort of patients followed longitudinally after heart transplantation, alterations of peripheral A2A adenosine receptor progressively normalized to control values within 6 months, suggesting that improvement of cardiac performance is accompanied by progressive restoration of a normal adenosinergic system. These results validate the importance of the A2A receptor in human diseases characterized by a marked inflammatory/immune component and suggest that the evaluation of this receptor in peripheral blood cells may be useful for monitoring hemodynamic changes and the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in CHF patients."

The first isolated neurotrophin, nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; AC, adenylate cyclase; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); CaM, calmodulin; DAG, diacylglycerol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (2Levi-Montalcini R. Arch. Ital. Biol. 1965; 103: 832-846PubMed Google Scholar), was shown to induce a neuronal like phenotype characterized by neurite outgrowth (1Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). The effect of NGF is dependent on a long lasting activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway (3Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). Activation of the cAMP pathway was also reported to induce PC12 differentiation (4Gunning P.W. Landreth G.E. Bothwell M.A. Shooter E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 5Young S.W. Dickens M. Tavare J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In line with the demonstrated role of ERK activation in NGF-induced PC12 differentiation, cAMP analogues, and forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase (AC) was shown to stimulate ERK activity in this cell line (5Young S.W. Dickens M. Tavare J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Frodin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, mobilization of calcium and/or stimulation of the diacylglycerol (DAG) production results in ERK activation and eventually neurite outgrowth (7Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 8Zhong H. Minneman K.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2388-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for the control of the ERK pathway by receptor tyrosine kinases, cAMP analogues, and calcium/DAG were intensively investigated, and Ras-like small GTP-binding proteins emerged as key elements in this pathway. The products of theH-Ras gene was shown to stimulate the activity of the MEK kinase Raf-1 following activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (9Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP and calcium were also suggested to control the activity of Ras in some cell types (7Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 10Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2900-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), resulting in ERK activation. More recently, the Ras superfamily member Rap1 and the protein kinase B-Raf were suggested to link PKA activation by cAMP analogues to MEK1 stimulation in neuronal cells (11Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several mechanisms have been proposed for calcium-induced ERK activation, including activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (12Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the cAMP/Rap1/B-Raf pathway (17Grewal S.S. Horgan A.M. York R.D. Withers G.S. Banker G.A. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3722-3728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Based on the above-mentioned data, one would predict that activation of GPCRs positively coupled to AC or PLC-β would lead to PC12 differentiation. However, in contrast to the effect of cAMP analogues or forskolin, stimulation of the endogenous A2A adenosine receptor (18Huang N.-K. Lin Y.-W. Huang C.-L. Messing R.O. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13838-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or of the transfected β1 adrenergic receptor (19Williams N.G. Zhong H. Minneman K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24624-24632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), two GPCRs positively coupled to AC, does not result in neurite outgrowth. Similarly, the situation is more complex than anticipated for PLC-coupled GPCRs as exemplified by the differential effects of the three closely related, PLC-coupled, α1adrenergic receptor subtypes (8Zhong H. Minneman K.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2388-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These contradictory data led us to study in detail the mechanisms involved in the stimulation of the ERK pathway by the GPCR for PACAP. This neuropeptide belongs to the vasoactive intestinal peptide-secretin-glucagon family of peptides and was originally isolated through its ability to stimulate the adenylate cyclase activity of pituitary cells in vitro (20Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). PACAP neurotrophic activity was first reported for PC12 cells in which the 38-amino acid form of PACAP was shown to promote neurite outgrowth (21Deutsch P.J. Sun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5108-5113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the receptor for PACAP is the only endogenous GPCR to stimulate neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. This neurotrophic activity was extended to the protection of cerebellar granule (22Cavallaro S. Copani A. Dagata V. Musco S. Petralia S. Ventra C. Stivala F. Travali S. Canonico P.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 60-66PubMed Google Scholar, 23Villalba M. Bockaert J. Journot L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dorsal root ganglion neurons (24Lioudyno M.

Brain Res. 1996; 736: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) neurons from ischemia-induced cell death. PACAP was also shown to control the proliferation and differentiation of cortical (27Lu N.R. DiCiccoBloom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3357-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Nicot A. DiCicco-Bloom E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4758-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Suh J.

Vaudry H. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). PACAP neurotrophic activity is mediated by the activation of Pac1, the PACAP-specific GPCR. Pac1 displays a complex pattern of alternative splicing that modulates its ligand binding and signaling properties (31Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 32Pantaloni C. Brabet P. Bilanges B. Dumuis A. Houssami S. Spengler D. Bockaert J. Journot L. J. Biol.

We and others (21Deutsch P.J. Sun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5108-5113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) showed that Pac1 potently stimulated the AC and PLC activities as well as the ERK pathway that was implicated in its neurotrophic activity (23Villalba M. Bockaert J. Journot L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Barrie A.P. Clohessy A.M. Buensuceso C.S. Rogers M.V. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this context, we selected the PC12 cell line to assess the involvement of the small GTP-binding proteins Rap1 and Ras in the signaling pathways responsible for PACAP-induced ERK activation in this system. PACAP and mouse 2.5 S NGF were purchased from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) and Promega, respectively. Forskolin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma. The PKA inhibitors H89 and (R p)-cAMP, the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide-1, the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, and the calmodulin inhibitor W13 were purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). The PLC inhibitor U-73122 and its inactive analogue, U-73343, were from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibodies to Rap1 and Ras were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and monoclonal antibody to HA (12CA5) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phosphorylation-specific and total ERK antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Wild-type and PKA-deficient PC12 cells (A126-1B2) were kindly provided by Prof. J. A Wagner (Harvard Medical School, Boston) and were grown on tissue culture dishes (Falcon) coated with poly-l-lysine in Opti-MEM/Glutamax medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum (Invitrogen). Culture medium was further supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a saturating humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. PC12 cells were plated in 6-well plates in complete medium until they reached 80% confluence. Cells were then washed and cultured for an additional 16–18 h in RPMI 1640/Glutamax medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (low serum medium) before treatment with PACAP (100 nm), forskolin (20 or 50 μm), PMA (0.3 or 1 nm), or NGF (40 ng/ml) for the indicated time. Before stimulation, the cultures were exposed to different inhibitors as mentioned in the figure legends. Cells were then rapidly rinsed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in Laemmli's sample buffer. Cell lysates were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with phospho-specific and phosphorylation state-independent antibodies following the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Rap1 and Ras GTP loading were measured with a non-radioactive method as described previously (37Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 38Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Briefly, after stimulation, cells were rinsed rapidly in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 and solubilized at 4 °C for 10 min in 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 μm aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences) freshly coupled to 10 μg of GST-RalGDS-RBD to isolate Rap1GTP or GST-Raf1-RBD to isolate Ras-GTP. Protein complexes were allowed to form for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer. Finally, precipitates were resuspended in Laemmli's sample buffer, and denatured proteins were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P transfer membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunodetection was performed using an anti-Rap1 or anti-Ras antibody and an anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (Pierce). Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and lysed 28 h after transfection. PC12 cells were grown to 70% confluence in a 24-well plate prior to transfection as described above. In all experiments, 2 μg of (Gal4)5-E1B-TATA-luciferase reporter plasmid and 2 μg of a plasmid encoding the Gal4-(Elk1 transactivation domain) fusion protein (kindly provided by R. Hipskind, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire; Montpellier, France) were co-transfected with various amounts of a test plasmid as indicated in the figure legends. Rap1A-V12, Rap1A-N17, and Ras-V12 cDNAs were provided by J. de Gunzburg (INSERM U248, Institut Curie, Paris, France). Ras-N17 and Rap1B-V12 were obtained from F. Zwartkruis (Utrecht University, The Netherlands) and P. J. Stork (The Vollum Institute, Portland), respectively. The N-Raf1 dominant-negative mutant of Raf-1, lacking the C-terminal kinase domain, was described previously (39Garcia J. de Gunzburg J. Eychene A. Gisselbrecht S. Porteu F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant with addition of pRK5-CAT. Eight hours after transfection, cells were placed for 18 h in low serum medium before stimulation with PACAP, forskolin, PMA, or NGF. Luciferase activity was assayed 5 h later as described previously (31Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses expressing Gap1m (Ras-GAP), Rap1-GAP, or LacZ (as a negative control) were kindly provided by Dr. S. Hattori (National Institute of Neurosciences, Tokyo) (40Iida N. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Ueno H. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6459-6466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were infected in 6-well plates at a multiplicity of infection of 100 in complete medium. Forty eight hours post-infection, endogenous ERK activities were determined as indicated above. PC12 cells were transfected with HA-Ras-V12, HA-Rap1A-V12, or EGFP-N1 as a control. Twenty eight hours after transfection, cells in low serum medium for 18 h were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS/glycine 0.1 m, permeabilized with PBS/Triton X-100 0.1% for 10 min at room temperature, and incubated for 30 min in PBS/bovine serum albumin 1%. Fixed cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody to HA (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed in PBS, incubated with Alexa fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum (1:1000) (Molecular Probes), and examined with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Because quantitative and qualitative differences were reported among PC12 cells used in different laboratories, we verified ERK regulation by PACAP in the PC12 cells used throughout this study. As expected, PACAP-38 induced a biphasic phosphorylation of both ERK1 and -2 at Thr-202 and Tyr-204 (Fig. 1 A). ERK phosphorylation was maximally stimulated at 5 min, and then gradually diminished but remained above resting level for several hours. This kinetic profile was qualitatively similar to the one obtained with NGF (Fig. 1 A). The effect of NGF was however more pronounced and lasted longer, in agreement with the reported more robust effect of NGF on neurite outgrowth. We then evaluated the enhancement of Rap1 and Ras GTP loading induced by PACAP-38 which activates AC and PLC in PC12 cells (21Deutsch P.J. Sun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5108-5113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both monomeric G proteins were rapidly activated upon PACAP-38 addition (Fig. 1, B andC). Rap1 activation was sustained, comparable in amplitude to the one obtained with forskolin and superior to the one induced by NGF (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, PACAP-induced Ras stimulation was transient and weaker than that obtained with NGF (Fig. 1 C). To assess the role of Rap1 and Ras in PACAP-induced ERK activation, we co-transfected dominant-negative mutants of both G proteins, Ras-N17 and Rap1A-N17, respectively, with a plasmid encoding a Gal4-Elk1 fusion protein, and we measured the activity of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a minimal promoter incorporating five Gal4-responsive elements. In this system, ERK activation induces Gal4-Elk1 phosphorylation and the subsequent transcriptional regulation of the reporter gene, providing a read-out for long term stimulation of the ERK pathway. The induction of the luciferase activity by PACAP was completely abolished upon preincubation with the MEK-specific antagonist U0126 (10 μm, 30 min), attesting for the specificity of the reporter system (Fig. 2 A). PACAP-induced Elk1-transactivating activity was blocked more efficiently by Rap1A-N17 than by Ras-N17 (Fig. 2 B), whereas it was the reverse for NGF (Fig. 2 C). Together with the data presented in Fig. 1 which indicate that Rap1 stimulation is sustained and ample whereas Ras stimulation is more transient and weaker, these results indicated that both Ras and Rap1 were involved in PACAP-elicited ERK activation and that Rap1 played a prominent role in long term ERK activation. To confirm the relative role of Ras and Rap1 in PACAP-induced ERK stimulation, we used adenoviruses encoding LacZ, Gap1m (Ras-Gap), or Rap1GAP (40Iida N. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Ueno H. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6459-6466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). As expected from the data obtained using the Elk1 reporter system, deactivation of Ras or Rap1 by the GTPase-activating activity of the GAPs led to the attenuation of PACAP-elicited endogenous ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, Ras-GAP was more efficient than Rap-GAP at 5 min following PACAP addition, whereas it was the reverse at 15 min. These observations suggested that Ras was prominently involved in the peak stimulation of ERK phosphorylation by PACAP, whereas the sustained stimulation of the ERK pathway required Rap1 activation. To determine whether Rap1 GTP loading elicited by PACAP was indeed sufficient to account for PACAP-induced ERK stimulation, we compared the signaling pathways involved inPac1-elicited Rap1 and ERK stimulations. We first tested the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of different signaling pathways on Rap1 activation. The only effective molecule was U73122 (Fig. 4 A), a specific blocker of PLC. Significantly, the inactive analogue U73343 had no effect (Fig. 4 A). PKC, calcium, and calmodulin were also found dispensable because bisindolylmaleimide-1, EGTA, BAPTA-AM, and W13 were ineffective (Fig. 4 A). PKA was also not involved because H89 and (R p)-cAMP did not alter Rap1 activation by PACAP (Fig. 4 A). This finding was further confirmed using the A126-1B2 variant of PC12 cells, which displays only 10% of the PKAII activity (41Van Buskirk R. Corcoran R. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and in which PACAP stimulated Rap1 GTP loading (Fig. 4 B). A role for a cAMP-GEF could also be excluded because the stimulation of Rap1 by forskolin was abolished in A126-1B2 cells (Fig. 4 B). We then tested whether PLC-elicited Rap1 activation is indeed sufficient for PACAP-induced ERK activation. As expected U73122blocked ERK phosphorylation induced by PACAP (Fig. 4 C) confirming the involvement of the PLC pathway. Surprisingly, H89 efficiently attenuated PACAP-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). The involvement of PKA was further confirmed using A126-1B2 cells in which PACAP-elicited ERK phosphorylation was notably attenuated (Fig. 4 D). Interestingly, in wild-type PC12 cells, forskolin, a direct activator of AC, was able to induce ERK phosphorylation less efficiently than PACAP (Fig. 4 D), whereas it was the reverse for the stimulation of the cAMP production (data not shown). As expected the effect of forskolin was completely abolished in A126-1B2 cells, whereas the effect of NGF was not affected (Fig. 4 D). Altogether, these data indicate that PKA is necessary but not sufficient for PACAP-induced ERK activation. Bisindolylmaleimide-1, the most specific PKC blocker (42Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar), strongly diminished PACAP-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C), showing that the activation of PKC is necessary for PACAP to stimulate efficiently ERK. Similarly, a rise in intracellular calcium is necessary as addition of EGTA to the incubation medium or of the cell-permeant BAPTA-AM attenuated PACAP-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, the effect of calcium was at least partially mediated by CaM because addition of W13, a specific calmodulin blocker, strongly diminished PACAP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 C). Because there was an apparent discrepancy between the pathway involved in Rap1 GTP loading and those necessary for potent ERK stimulation by PACAP, we tested whether activated Rap1 is sufficient to stimulate ERK efficiently. A constitutively active mutant of Ras, Ras-V12, was exquisitely potent in inducing Gal4-Elk1 phosphorylation-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 5 A; note the bi-logarithmic scale). Surprisingly, the corresponding constitutively active mutant of Rap1A, Rap1A-V12, only minimally stimulated Elk1 phosphorylation-induced luciferase activity (Fig. 5 A). The observed weak activation of the ERK pathway was not specific for the Rap1A isoform because a constitutive Rap1B mutant was also ineffective (Fig. 5 A). Because the effect of Rap1-GTP depends on the presence of B-Raf (11Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 43Ohtsuka T. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1258-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we monitored the PC12 cells used in the present study for the expression of B-Raf by Western blotting and evidenced the expected 95- and 68-kDa bands (data not shown). To exclude that the difference in the potency of Ras-V12 and Rap1A/B-V12 was because of a difference in the protein levels, we performed similar experiments with HA-tagged constructs and monitored the expression levels of the mutants by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5 B, transfection of various amount of the different constructs resulted in similar levels of Ras-V12, Rap1A-V12, and Rap1B-V12. In these conditions, Ras-V12 was considerably more effective than the corresponding Rap1A/B mutants (Fig. 5 B; note the logarithmic scale). To confirm further the results obtained with the Elk reporter system, we examined ERK activation following transient transfection of constitutively activated mutants of Rap1A, Rap1B, and Ras. As shown in Fig. 5 C, HA-Ras-V12 efficiently stimulated ERK phosphorylation, whereas similar levels of HA-Rap1A-V12 and HA-Rap1B-V12 were inefficient. These data indicated that GTP loading of Rap1 was not sufficient to induce effectively ERK activation. These results were further confirmed at a more physiological level. We monitored neurite outgrowth in transfected PC12 cells and could demonstrate that Ras-V12 efficiently induced neurite outgrowth, in line with its potency in stimulating the ERK pathway. In contrast, Rap1A-V12 was completely inefficient (Fig. 5 D). We reasoned that because multiple signaling pathways are involved in ERK activation by PACAP, these signals may be required to potentiate the effect of GTP-loaded Rap1A. In line with this hypothesis, we found that Elk1-transactivating activity is synergistically activated by Rap1A-V12 and minute amounts of Ras-V12 (Fig. 6 A). Although the synergy of the constitutively active Rap1A and Ras mutants was apparently weak (Fig. 6 A), one should take into account that it resulted from a limited number of transfected cells, due to the small amount of Ras-V12 used in this experiment. Similarly, efficient Elk1 phosphorylation-dependent luciferase activation was obtained upon incubation of Rap1A-V12-transfected cells with doses of forskolin and PMA, which by themselves did not produce a significant effect (Fig. 6 B). To elucidate further the relative roles of Ras, PKC, and the cAMP pathway, we used dominant-negative mutants of Ras and its downstream kinase, Raf-1. Ras-N17 moderately attenuated the potentiation by PMA and forskolin of Rap1A-V12-elicited stimulation of Gal4-Elk1-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the N-terminal fragment of Raf-1 (10Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R.

This fragment of Raf-1 includes the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 and hence behaves as a blocker of Ras signaling.

In the present study, we characterized configurational isomers of a HNE-N α-acetylhistidine adduct by NMR spectroscopy and by molecular orbital calculations. In addition, we raised monoclonal antibodies against (R)-HNE-histidine and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts, characterized their specificities, and examined in vivo localizations of each adduct under oxidative stress. To facilitate structural characterization of the configurational isomers of an HNE-histidine adduct, we prepared the (R)-HNE-histidine and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts by incubatingN α-acetylhistidine with each HNE enantiomer, both of which provided two peaks (Ra and Rb from (R)-HNE-histidine and Sa and Sb from (S)-HNE-histidine adducts) in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The NMR analysis showed that each peak was a mixture of two diastereomers. In addition, the analysis of the nuclear Overhauser effect enabled the determination of configurations of the eight isomers. The relative amounts of these isomers in the NMR analysis correlated with the relative energies calculated by molecular orbital methods. On the other hand, using (R)-HNE-modified and (S)-HNE-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanins as the antigens, we raised the monoclonal antibodies, mAbR310 and mAbS412, which enantioselectively recognized the (R)-HNE-histidine and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts, respectively. Among the mixtures (Ra, Rb, Sa, and Sb) of diastereomers, mAbR310 showed the highest immunoreactivity to Rb (the mixture of 2R,4S,5R and 2S,4S,5R isomers), whereas mAbS412 preferentially recognized Sa (the mixture of 2R,4S,5S and 2S,4S,5S isomers). The presence of (R)-HNE and (S)-HNE epitopes in vivo was immunohistochemically examined in the kidney of rats exposed to the renal carcinogen, ferric nitrilotriacetate, by which nuclear and cytosolic stainings with mAbR310 and mAbS412, respectively, were detected. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a major racemic product of lipid peroxidation, reacts with histidine to form a stable HNE-histidine Michael addition-type adduct possessing three chiral centers in the cyclic hemiacetal structure.

Several lines of evidence indicate that the oxidative modification of proteins and the subsequent accumulation of the modified proteins have been found in cells during aging, oxidative stress, and in various pathological states, including premature diseases, muscular dystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis (1Shacter E. Drug. Metab. Rev. 2000; 32: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 2Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The important agents that give rise to the modification of a protein may be represented by lipid metabolites, such as 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals (3Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar, 4Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1685-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). These metabolites are considered important mediators of cell damage due to their ability to covalently modify biomolecules, which can disrupt important cellular functions and can cause mutations (3Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the adduction of aldehydes to apolipoprotein B in low density lipoproteins has been strongly implicated in the mechanism by which low density lipoprotein is converted to an atherogenic form that is taken up by macrophages, leading to the formation of foam cells (5Steinberg D.

Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). HNE exerts these effects because of its facile reactivity with biological materials, particularly the sulfhydryl groups of proteins (10Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Scholz N. Z. Naturforsch. C. 1975; 30: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The reaction of HNE with sulfhydryl groups leads to the formation of thioether adducts that further undergo cyclization to form cyclic hemiacetals (3Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar, 11Schauenstein E. Esterbauer H. Ciba Found. Symp. 1979; 67: 225-244Google Scholar). Formation of thiol-derived Michael adducts, stabilized as cyclic hemiacetals, was initially considered to constitute the main reactivity of HNE (3Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). However, other studies led to the realization that HNE could form Michael adducts also with the imidazole moiety of histidine residues (12Uchida K. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 13Uchida K. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6388-6393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the ε-amino group of lysine residues (14Szweda L.I. Uchida K. Tsai L. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3342-3347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HNE-histidine Michael adduct is readily isolable and is stabilized toward retro-Michael reaction, because of the poorer leaving group ability of imidazole over amine at neutral conditions. Because HNE generated in lipid peroxidation is a racemic mixture of 4R- and 4S-enantiomers (15Schneider C. Tallman K.A. Porter N.A. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20831-20838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the HNE-histidine Michael adduct, possessing three chiral centers at C-2, C-4, and C-5 in the tetrahydrofuran moiety, is presumed to be composed of at least eight isomers (see Scheme 1). However, the structures of HNE-histidine adducts in solution have not been fully characterized as yet with complicating 1H NMR diastereoscopic splittings by three chiral centers. In the present study, we characterized the configurational isomers of the HNE-N α-acetylhistidine adduct by NMR spectroscopy and by molecular orbital calculations. Moreover, we raised monoclonal antibodies against (R)-HNE-histidine and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts, characterized their specificities, and investigated the in vivo distributions of each adduct under oxidative stress. N α-Acetyl-l-histidine and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was obtained from Pierce. Ferric nitrate nonahydrate and sodium carbonate were from Wako (Osaka, Japan); nitrilotriacetic acid disodium salt was from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Anti-HNE-histidine monoclonal antibody (mAbHNEJ2) was kindly provided by Nihon Oil Factory Co. (Tokyo, Japan) (16Toyokuni S. Miyake N. Hiai H. Hagiwara M. Kawakishi S. Osawa T. Uchida K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG immunoglobulin and ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). The stock solutions of HNE were prepared by the acid-treatment (1 mm HCl) of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal dimethylacetal, which was synthesized according to the procedure of De Montarby et al. (17De Montarby L. Mosset P. Gree R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 3895Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). (R)- and (S)-HNEs were prepared by the enzymatic resolution of racemic HNE (18Allevi P. Anastasia M. Cajone F. Ciuffreda P. Sanvito A.M. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 5000-5002Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and purified by a chiral-phase HPLC on a ChiralPak AD-RH column (0.46 × 15 cm) (Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (90/10/0.01, v/v) (solvent A)-acetonitrile (solvent B) (time = 0–5 min, 100% A; 60 min, 0% A), at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by UV absorbance at 224 nm. The concentrations of racemic and enantioisomeric HNE stock solutions were determined by the measurement of UV absorbance at 224 nm (19Schauenstein E. Taufer M. Esterbauer H. Kylianek A. Seelich T. Monatsh. Chem. 1971; 102: 517-529Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (10 ml) containing 40 mm N α-acetylhistidine was incubated with 20 mm (R,S)-HNE, (R)-HNE, or (S)-HNE in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed with a reverse-phase HPLC on a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nomura Chemicals, Aichi, Japan) eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (90/10/0.01, v/v) (solvent A) − acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (100/0.01, v/v) (solvent B) (time = 0 - 5 min, 100% A; 60 min, 0% A), at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 200–400 nm. Modification of protein by HNE enantiomers was performed by incubating BSA (1.0 mg/ml) with 1–10 mm (R)-HNE or (S)-HNE in 1 ml of 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 24 h. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AMX600 (600 MHz) instrument. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was carried out with a Jasco PlatformII-LC instrument. The restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) and density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP exchange-correlation functional calculations for eight isomers of the model compound (5′-methyl-N τ-(2-hydroxy-5-methyltetrahydrofuran-4-yl)imidazole) were performed by using the Gaussian 98 program package. All molecular geometries were fully optimized with RHF/6–31G* and DFT/6–31G* levels at C1 symmetry, respectively. After molecular geometries of each species were optimized, vibrational analysis calculations were also carried out to check whether they were correctly energy-minimized structures. All calculations were made on the HIT alpha 667d computer at Gifu University. Female BALB/c mice were immunized three times with (R)-HNE-treated or (S)-HNE-treated KLH. Spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with P3/U1 murine myeloma cells and cultured in hypoxantine/amethopterin/thymidine selection medium. Culture supernatants of the hybridoma were screened using ELISA, employing pairs of wells of microtiter plates on which were absorbed (R)-HNE-treated or (S)-HNE-treated BSA as the antigen (1 μg of protein/well). After incubation with 100 μl of the hybridoma supernatants, and with intervening washes with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.8, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween), the wells were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, followed by a substrate solution containing 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate. Hybridoma cells, corresponding to the supernatants that were positive on (R)-HNE-modified or (S)-HNE-modified BSA, were then cloned by limiting dilution. After repeated screening, four clones were obtained. Among them, clones R310 and S412 showed the most distinctive recognition of the (R)-HNE-modified and (S)-HNE-modified BSA, respectively. Cross-reactivity of antibodies for aldehyde-treated proteins was determined by a non-competitive ELISA. A coating antigen was prepared by incubating 1 mg of BSA with 2 mm aldehyde in 1 ml of 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h at 37 °C. A 100-μl aliquot of the antigen solution was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 20 h at 4 °C. The antigen solution was then removed, and the plate was washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 10% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween). Each well was incubated with 200 μl of 1% BSA in TBS/Tween for 30 min at 37 °C in a moist chamber to block the unsaturated plastic surface. The plate was then washed once with TBS/Tween. A 100-μl aliquot of antibody was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with TBS/Tween, 100 μl of a 5 × 104 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in TBS/Tween was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the plates were washed three times with TBS/Tween. Enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed by adding 100 μl/well of 1,2-phenylenediamine in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.003% hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2 m sulfuric acid, and absorbance at 492 nm was read on a micro-ELISA plate reader. In a competitive ELISA study, a competitor was incubated with antibody for 20 h at 4 °C to yield competitor/antibody mixtures containing antibody at 25 ng/ml and variable concentrations of the competitor. A 100-μl aliquot of competitor/antibody mixtures was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with TBS/Tween, the second antibody was added and the enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed as described above. Results were expressed as the ratio, B/B o, whereB = absorbance in the presence of competitor − background absorbance (no antibody) and B o = absorbance in the absence of competitor − background absorbance. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The protein was stained with Coomassie Blue The gel was transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with Block Ace (40 mg/ml) for blocking, washed, and treated with the primary antibody. This procedure was followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to a goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 fragment and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The bands were visualized by exposure of the membranes to autoradiography film. The ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe3+-NTA) solution was prepared immediately before use by the method described by Toyokuni et al. (21Toyokuni S. Uchida K. Okamoto K. Hattori-Nakakuki Y. Hiai H. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, ferric nitrate enneahydrate and the nitrilotriacetic acid disodium salt were each dissolved in deionized water to form 80 and 160 mm solutions, respectively. They were mixed at the volume ratio of 1:2 (molar ratio, 1:4), and the pH was adjusted with sodium hydrogen carbonate to 7.4. Male SPF slc: Wistar rats (Shizuoka Laboratory Animal Center, Shizuoka), weighing 130–150 g (6 weeks of age), were used. They were kept in a stainless steel cage and given commercial rat chow (Funabashi F-2, Chiba) as well as deionized water (Millipore Japan, Osaka) ad libitum. Animals received a single intraperitoneal injection of Fe3+-NTA (15 mg of Fe3+/kg body weight). They were sacrificed at 0, 24, and 48 h after the administration. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Both kidneys of each animal were immediately removed. One of them was fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, cut at 3-μm thickness, and used for immunohistochemical analyses by an avidin-biotin complex method with alkaline phosphatase (22Toyokuni S. Tanaka T. Hattori Y. Nishiyama Y. Yoshida A. Uchida K. Hiai H. Ochi H. Osawa T. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 365-374PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after deparaffinization with xylene and ethanol, normal rabbit serum (Dako Japan Co., Ltd., Kyoto; diluted to 1:75) for the inhibition of the nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody, a monoclonal antibody (mAbR310 or mAbS412) (0.5 μg/ml), biotin-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG serum (Vector Laboratories; diluted 1:300), and avidin-biotin complex (Vector; diluted 1:100) were sequentially used. Procedures, using phosphate-buffered saline or the IgG fraction (0.5 μg/ml) of normal mouse serum instead of mAbR310 and mAbS412 antibodies, showed no or negligible positive responses. Acetylhistidine with Racemic and Enantioisomeric HNE—To facilitate structural characterization of configurational isomers of the HNE-histidine adduct, we prepared (R)-HNE-histidine and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts by incubating N α-acetylhistidine with (R)-HNE and (S)-HNE, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, reversed-phase HPLC demonstrated that the reaction of N α-acetylhistidine with (S)-HNE in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C gave two peaks (Sa and Sb). The reaction with (R)-HNE also provided two peaks (Ra andRb). These HPLC profiles were similar to those observed in the reaction of N α-acetylhistidine with racemic HNE, providing RSa and RSb. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of these peaks gave a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 354 (M+H)+ (data not shown), which would be expected from the Michael addition-type HNE-histidine adducts, suggesting that they all represent the products derived from the Michael addition of the imidazole nitrogen atom to the C-3 of HNE. The four peaks (Ra, Rb, Sa, andSb) obtained from (R)-HNE-histidine and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts were then subjected to characterization by 600-MHz NMR. The assignment of the proton signals and stereochemistry could be made by analyzing1H-1H-correlation spectroscopy (COSY),1H-detected multiple-bond heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMBC), 1H-detected multiple-bond heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and nuclear Overhauser and exchange spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum recorded in D2O. In all samples, we observed the correlation between the methine proton (C-4) of the tetrahydrofuran moiety and two imidazole vinyls (C-2′ and C-4′) in the HMBC spectrum (data not shown), indicating that the reaction exclusively occurred at the N τposition of the imidazole ring. This agrees with the previous assignment on the basis of the coupling constant between two imidazole vinyls (23Nadkarni D.V. Sayre L.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The COSY spectrum of Sa suggested that the peak was a mixture of two diastereomers (Sa1 and Sa2) (Supplementary Data Fig. 1). Similarly, other peaks (Ra,Rb, and Sb) also appeared to contain a pair of diastereomers (Supplementary Data Tables I and II). Identification of the proton signals of the tetrahydrofuran moiety in Ra,Rb, Sa, and Sb follows from the analysis of NOESY spectra collected in D2O. InSa, proton signals at 4.24 and 4.00 ppm, which were assigned to the methine protons at C-5 of Sa1 and Sa2, respectively, displayed NOE cross-peaks to the methine proton at C-4, whereas there were no such NOE cross-peaks in Sb(Sb1 + Sb2) (Supplementary Data Fig. 2), suggesting that the configurations at C-4 of Sa andSb are S and R, respectively. Absolute configurations at C-2 and C-3 were determined by the NOE connectivity between the C-2 methine proton and C-3 methylene protons (H-3α and H-3β). We observed NOE cross-peaks between C-4 proton and C-3 proton (H-3β) and between C-3 proton (H-3α) and C-2 proton inSa1, whereas the presence of NOE cross-peaks between the C-4 proton and C-3 (H-3α) proton and between the C-3 proton (H-3α) and C-2 proton were observed in Sa2. These data suggest thatSa1 and Sa2 correspond to 2R,4S,5S and 2S,4S,5S isomers, respectively. Similarly, the absolute configuration of the tetrahydrofuran moiety ofSb1 and Sb2 was determined to be 2S,4R,5S and 2R,4R,5S, respectively. Based on the assignment of these signals, relative amounts (%) of Sa1,Sa2, Sb1, and Sb2 in D2O were found to be 25, 8, 25, and 42, respectively. In a similar manner to the assignment of the (S)-HNE-histidine isomers, the absolute configuration of the four isomers (Ra1,Ra2, Rb1, and Rb2) of the (R)-HNE-histidine adduct were determined to be 2S,4R,5R, 2R,4R,5R, 2R,4S,5R, and 2S,4S,5R, respectively. In addition, their relative amounts (%) of (R)-HNE-histidine isomers (Ra1:Ra2:Rb1:Rb2 = 25:8:25:42) were exactly comparable to those of the (S)-HNE-histidine isomers. Fig. 2 summarizes the configurations of the eight isomers of the HNE-N α-acetylhistidine adduct. For each of the isomers, the (R)-HNE-histidine adduct structure is essentially a mirror image of the (S)-HNE-histidine adduct. Furthermore, the NMR data on the eight isomers allowed assignment of the signals in the one-dimensional1H-NMR analysis of the (R,S)-HNE-N α-acetylhistidine adduct (Supplementary Data Fig. 3). To elucidate the fundamental structural principles that govern the tetrahydrofuran ring in the HNE-histidine adducts and to relate the results to experimental observations in the NMR analysis, molecular orbital calculations on the eight isomers of the model compound (5′-methyl-N τ-(2-hydroxy-5-methyltetrahydrofuran-4-yl)imidazole) were performed. Table I shows the total energies in atomic units and relative energies in kilocalories/mol. There is a similar trend in the relative energies between RHF/6–31G* and DFT/6–31G* levels of calculation. Notably, the relative energies calculated by molecular orbital methods correlated well with the relative amounts of the isomers of the (R)-HNE-histidine and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts found in the NMR analysis. Fig. 3 shows optimized structures of eight isomers calculated by the DFT/6–31G* method. The values in parentheses are electronic charges on atoms.

We have previously raised a monoclonal antibody (mAbHNEJ2) against HNE-modified protein and found that it recognizes the HNE-histidine adduct as the epitope (21Toyokuni S. Uchida K. Okamoto K.

We examined the binding of the antibody to the (R)-HNE-histidine and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts and found that it equally recognized both adducts. 2M. Hashimoto and K. Uchida, unpublished data. Hence, to evaluate the distribution of the (R)-HNE-histidine and (S)-HNE-histidine adducts separately, we attempted to raise a monoclonal antibody directed toward each adduct. To this end, mice were immunized individually with (R)-HNE-modified and (S)-HNE-modified keyhole limpet hemocyanins. During the preparation of the monoclonal antibodies, hybridomas were selected by the reactivities of the culture supernatant to the (R)-HNE-modified and (S)-HNE-modified BSA, respectively. We finally obtained the monoclonal antibodies, mAbR310 and mAbS412, which specifically recognized (R)-HNE-modified and (S)-HNE-modified proteins, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). The ELISA study attested that, among reactive aldehydes tested, only (R)-HNE and (S)-HNE generated the epitopes that could be recognized by mAbR310 and mAbS412, respectively (Fig. 4 C). Then, we characterized the antibodies' ability to recognize specific molecular targets in their native three-dimensional structure. As shown in Fig. 5 A, binding of the HNE-modified protein to mAbR310 and mAbS412 was scarcely inhibited by the HNE-cysteine and HNE-lysine adducts but significantly inhibited by the HNE-histidine adduct. Approximately 5 nmol of the HNE-histidine adduct per well (100 μl) caused 50% inhibition of antibody binding to the HNE-modified protein, whereas at least 10-fold higher concentrations of HNE-lysine or HNE-cysteine adduct were necessary for the same inhibition. These data indicate that both antibodies represent the anti-HNE-histidine monoclonal antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2156782835,"The use of expression microarrays to determine bona fide changes in gene expression between experimental paradigms is confounded by noise due to variability in measurement. To assess the variability associated with transcript hybridization to commercial oligonucleotide-based microarrays, we generated a data set consisting of five replicate hybridizations of a single labeled cRNA target from three distinct experimental paradigms, using the Affymetrix human U95 GeneChip set. We found that the variability of expression level in our data set is intensity-specific. We quantified the observed variability in our data set in order to determine significant changes in gene expression. LOESS fitting to a plot of the standard deviation of replicates assigned a variability associated with a specific intensity. This allowed for the calculation of a ""variable fold-change"" threshold for any absolute intensity at any level of statistical confidence. Testing of this method indicates that it removes intensity-specific bias and results in a 5- to 10-fold reduction in the number of false-positive changes. We suggest that this approach can be widely used to improve prediction of significant changes in gene expression for oligonucleotide-based microarray experiments and reduce false leads, even in the absence of replicates."
https://openalex.org/W2098378575,"Vascular remodeling and rearrangement of the extracellular matrix formation are among the major adaptive mechanisms in response to a chronic blood pressure increase. Vasoactive peptides, such as endothelin, participate in hypertension-associated vascular fibrosis by stimulating collagen I formation and increasing contractility of arterial wall. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor pathway mediates these events. Experiments were performed in transgenic mice harboring the luciferase gene under the control of the collagen I-alpha2 chain promoter. Endothelin induced a rapid phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK and increased collagen I gene activity in freshly isolated aortas. This effect of endothelin was totally inhibited by an endothelin receptor antagonist, an EGF receptor phosphorylation inhibitor, and a blocker of the MAPK/ERK cascade. In parallel experiments, inhibition of EGF receptor phosphorylation decreased the endothelin-induced pressor effect in isolated aortic rings and in anesthetized animals in vivo. In addition, the endothelin-induced increase of blood pressure was blunted in the waved-2 mice, a strain expressing functionally impaired EGF receptors. Our results provide the first evidence that the EGF receptor mediates at least two of the major actions of endothelin in the vascular tissue: contractility and fibrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1967225560,"Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is secreted postprandially and acts in concert with glucose to stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreas. Here, we describe a novel pathway for the regulation of GIP receptor (GIPR) expression within clonal beta-cell lines, pancreatic islets, and in vivo. High (25 mM) glucose was able to significantly reduce GIPR mRNA levels in INS(832/13) cells after only 6 h. In contrast, palmitic acid (2 mM) and WY 14643 (100 microM) stimulated approximate doublings of GIPR expression in INS(832/13) cells under low (5.5 mM), but not high (25 mM), glucose conditions, suggesting that fat can regulate GIPR expression via PPARalpha in a glucose-dependent manner. Both MK-886, an antagonist of PPARalpha, and a dominant negative form of PPARalpha transfected into INS(832/13) cells caused a significant reduction in GIPR expression in low, but not high, glucose conditions. Finally, in hyperglycemic clamped rats, there was a 70% reduction in GIPR expression in the islets and a 71% reduction in GIP-stimulated insulin secretion from the perfused pancreas. Thus, evidence is presented that the GIPR is controlled at normoglycemia by the fatty acid load on the islet; however, when exposed to hyperglycemic conditions, the GIPR is down-regulated, which may contribute to the decreased responsiveness to GIP that is observed in type 2 diabetes."

H+-transporting F1Fo ATP synthases consist of two structurally and functionally distinct sectors termed F1 and Fo (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Google Scholar). In the intact enzyme, ATP synthesis or hydrolysis takes place in the F1 sector and is coupled to active H+ transport through the Fosector. Structurally similar F1Fo ATP synthases are present in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and most eubacteria (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Google Scholar). The F1 sector lies at the surface of the membrane and inEscherichia coli consists of five subunits in an α3β3γ1δ1ε1stoichiometry. The Fo sector spans the membrane and inE. coli consists of three subunits in ana 1 b 2 c 10stoichiometry (2Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the case of the bovine mitochondrial enzyme crystallized in the presence of Mg2+ and adenosine phosphates, the three α and three β subunits alternate around the central γ subunit, with subunit γ interacting asymmetrically with the three catalytic sites formed at the αβ interface (3Abrahams J.P.

In the widely accepted binding change mechanism for ATP synthesis, the alternate tight binding of ADP and Pi and subsequent release of product ATP are mediated by γ subunit rotation between the alternating catalytic sites (9Boyer P.D.

In the complete membranous enzyme, the rotation of subunit γ is proposed to be driven by H+ transport-coupled rotation of a connected ring ofc subunits in the Fo sector of the enzyme, which extend through the lipid bilayer and maintain a fixed linkage with the γ subunit. Rotation of the c ring was also demonstrated using the filament rotation assay (14Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M.

In this report, a span of 19 residues in aTMH4 were replaced with Cys and tested for accessibility to water-soluble reagents NEM and Ag+. We found that residues 206, 210, and 214 are NEM-accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In contrast, residues 215 and 218 on helix 4 and residue 245 on helix 5 form an Ag+-accessible but NEM-inaccessible pocket bridging aTMH4 and aTMH5. This pocket may form part of the aqueous access pathway extending from Asp61 to the periplasmic surface.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we report on the aqueous accessibility of cysteine residues substituted into the fourth transmembrane helix in subunita of the rotary ATP synthase. aTMH4 is thought to interact with Asp61 of subunit c during proton translocation and may play a part in forming an aqueous access channel to cAsp61 from one or both sides of the membrane. The proximity of aTMH4 to cTMH2 was initially postulated on the basis of second site suppressor analysis (33Fraga D. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2562-2567Google Scholar) and is now supported by intermolecular Cys-Cys cross-links betweencTMH2 and aTMH4 (27Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Google Scholar). Aqueous access to Asp61 of subunit c had been postulated previously based upon the pH-sensitive function of the cA24D mutant (67Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5473-5479Google Scholar) and is further supported by the discovery that simultaneous mutation of three residues surrounding Asp61 makes the enzyme sensitive to inhibition by Li+ (68Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 87-93Google Scholar). Additionally, the analogous enzyme from Propiogenium modestum, with a very homologous subunit c, alternatively transports Na+, Li+, or H+ (69Dimroth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 374-386Google Scholar, 70Kaim G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 94-107Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that these various ions gain access to the membrane-embedded carboxyl of subunit c via a water-filled channel. We have substituted cysteine over the length ofaTMH4 and tested the susceptibility of each substitution to modification with water-soluble, thiol-modifying reagents. The approach has been used previously to define surfaces of membrane proteins with aqueous accessibility (38–51).Reactivity of Cys Substitutions with NEM, Ag+, and MTS ReagentsThe ionized sulfhydryl group of cysteine is the form that preferentially reacts with the thiol-specific reagents used here. For example, the reactivity of MTS reagents with the thiolate is preferred by a factor of 109 over reaction with a nonionized thiol group (54Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Google Scholar). Similarly, NEM (52Gorin G. Martic P.A. Doughty G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 115: 593-597Google Scholar, 53Friedman M. The Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Sulfhydryl Group in Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins. 1st Ed. Pergamon Press, Oxford1973Google Scholar) and Ag+ (45Lu Q. Miller C. Science. 1995; 268: 304-307Google Scholar, 55Dance I.G. Polyhedron. 1986; 5: 1037Google Scholar) react preferentially with ionized thiolates rather than with neutral thiols. The differential reactivity of substituted cysteines can thus provide information about the ionization state of different residues, which in most cases should be related to aqueous accessibility, i.e. the interpretation given in similar studies of other membrane proteins (38Tamura N. Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20330-20339Google Scholar, 39Li J. Xu Q. Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Laskey A. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11605-11610Google Scholar, 41Mordoch S.S. Granot D. Lebendiker M. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19480-19486Google Scholar). The means by which NEM penetrates the membrane to react with Cys residues is not certain. It may be sufficiently lipid-soluble to gain access to transmembrane Cys via the hydrophobic phase of the membrane. However, modification should only be observed with those residues subject to ionization. It is also conceivable that uncharged MTS reagents could access reactive Cys residues via the lipid phase, although reactivity would again depend upon the ionization state of the sulfhydryl group. It is of interest that Ag+ reacts with transmembrane residues that are NEM-insensitive. This may indicate that NEM-sensitive residues need to be bounded by larger aqueous cavities, sufficient in size to accommodate the bulkier NEM molecule.NEM Reactive TMH4 SubstitutionsResidues 206, 210, and 214 onaTMH4 are preferentially modified with NEM, as indicated by direct labeling with [14C]NEM and also by inhibition of ATP-driven quenching in the case of the 206 and 214 mutants. The radioactive labeling studies were carried out to address the possibility that residues might be modified with NEM without effect on function. Additionally, we were able to examine the labeling of a Cys at position 210 in a mutant that is nonfunctional in proton transport. These three residues fall on one face of an α-helix (Fig.13), and it seems likely that NEM modification results in a block to proton transport through this region of the protein. Inhibition of proton translocation by attachment of the ethylmaleimide group is consistent with evidence from mutagenesis studies that bulky substitutions are not as well tolerated as smaller ones at these positions (Table III). The fact that the three residues found to label with NEM line one face ofaTMH4 suggests that NEM could be gaining access to these residues via an aqueous pathway formed at this face of an α-helix.Table IIIProperties of aTMH4 mutations constructed previously in NEM or Ag+-sensitive residuesPositionSubstitutionGrowth on SuccinateaIn most cases ATP-driven proton pumping was also measured, and the decrease in activity correlates with the growth on succinate parameter.ReferenceSer206Ala+++Ref.73Howitt S.M.

Open table in a new tab The Cys206 residue appears to titrate as the pH of the medium is lowered from 7.5 to 7.0, as indicated by the dramatic decrease in NEM reactivity, suggesting that this residue is accessible to the bulk solvent. The solvent accessibility of this residue is also supported by the rapid reversal of Ag+ inhibition by dithiothreitol. On the other hand, the reactivity of Cys214is unaffected by lowering the pH of the medium to 7.0, suggesting that this residue remains ionized at a lower pH than Cys206, even though topological analysis would place residue 214 in the middle of the membrane. Despite its low apparent pK a, Cys214 does not appear to be generally accessible to the aqueous medium based upon the slow reversal of Ag+inhibition by DTT. We suggest that the low pK a of Cys214 at the center of the membrane may be due to salt bridge formation with the proximal Arg210 residue.Silver Used to Probe aTMH4 Cys SubstitutionsSilver has been used previously as an irreversible covalent modifier of Cys introduced into several membrane proteins (45Lu Q. Miller C. Science. 1995; 268: 304-307Google Scholar, 46Kriegler S. Sudweeks S. Yakel J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3934-3936Google Scholar, 47del Camino D. Yellen G. Neuron. 2001; 32: 649-656Google Scholar, 48Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Google Scholar). The irreversibility of the Ag+ inhibition under the conditions used here is indicated by an experiment where Ag+ pretreatment of membrane vesicles protected Cys215 from becoming labeled with [14C]NEM after solubilization of the membrane with SDS (experiment not shown). Further, if membranes are treated with silver and centrifuged to remove the assay buffer, inhibition is still observed on resuspension in Ag+-free buffer with Cl− present to precipitate any free silver released to solution. As would be expected (65Bell R.A. Kramer J.R. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 1999; 18: 9-22Google Scholar), the reaction and inhibition can in some cases be reversed by competing sulfhydryl reagents such as DTT,e.g. in the case of the aS206C substitution. It is not clear from our studies exactly how silver gains access to these sulfhydryls. In this experimental system, we have shown by atomic absorption analysis that 80% of silver added to membrane vesicles becomes complexed with the membrane. Conceivably, the silver may be transported to the interior of the membrane vesicles, where it gains access to subunit a. Alternatively, the silver may bind to other membrane proteins or sites of unsaturation on fatty acid tails (71Bennett M.A. Chem. Rev. 1962; 62: 611-652Google Scholar, 72Morris L.J. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 717-732Google Scholar). To test whether other proteins in the membrane were transporting silver or were necessary for silver absorption by the membrane, F1Fo was purified and reconstituted into liposomes and tested for Ag+ inhibition of ATP-driven proton pumping by Ag+. The Cys214 and Cys215 mutant enzymes still exhibited inhibition by Ag+, suggesting that the silver may gain access to these cysteines without the aid of other membrane proteins and that the inhibitory Ag+ does not need to be transported to the interior of these vesicles by an inner membrane Ag+transport system.As seen in Fig. 12, aH245C/D119H shows inhibition of ATP-driven quenching when treated with silver. This is the first direct evidence that the aqueous access pathway tocAsp61 may involve more than one helix of subunit a. Looking at the silver-sensitive residues highlighted on the model of subunit a in Fig. 13, it is certainly possible that these residues form a pocket that is accessed from an aqueous channel extending to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The aqueous pathway to the cytoplasm appears to include NEM-sensitive residues 206, 210, and 214 on one α-helical face ofaTMH4. To the periplasmic side ofaAsn214, residues 215–220 are characterized here as being NEM-inaccessible but Ag+-sensitive, with residues 215 and 218 showing the greatest silver sensitivity. Residues 215 and 218 would fall on the α-helical face of aTMH4 opposite to residues 206, 210, and 214. If an aqueous pocket bridges these residues and residue 245 in aTMH5, thenaTMH4 may have to swivel to gate access between the periplasmic pocket and Asp61 of subunit c. As we have discussed elsewhere (76Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 29-36Google Scholar), such swiveling may be coupled mechanically to other helical movements that drive stepwise rotation of the c ring. H+-transporting F1Fo ATP synthases consist of two structurally and functionally distinct sectors termed F1 and Fo (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Google Scholar). In the intact enzyme, ATP synthesis or hydrolysis takes place in the F1 sector and is coupled to active H+ transport through the Fosector. Structurally similar F1Fo ATP synthases are present in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and most eubacteria (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Google Scholar). The F1 sector lies at the surface of the membrane and inEscherichia coli consists of five subunits in an α3β3γ1δ1ε1stoichiometry. The Fo sector spans the membrane and inE. coli consists of three subunits in ana 1 b 2 c 10stoichiometry (2Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Google Scholar). The structures of several types of F1have been solved by x-ray crystallography (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

S. A. 2002; 99: 3464-3468Google Scholar). In the case of the bovine mitochondrial enzyme crystallized in the presence of Mg2+ and adenosine phosphates, the three α and three β subunits alternate around the central γ subunit, with subunit γ interacting asymmetrically with the three catalytic sites formed at the αβ interface (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar, 4Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Google Scholar, 5Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Google Scholar). In the widely accepted binding change mechanism for ATP synthesis, the alternate tight binding of ADP and Pi and subsequent release of product ATP are mediated by γ subunit rotation between the alternating catalytic sites (9Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Google Scholar, 10Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 465-471Google Scholar, 11Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Google Scholar). Rotation of the γ subunit during ATP hydrolysis was demonstrated by attaching an actin filament to an immobilized α3β3 complex (12Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Google Scholar, 13Kinosita Jr., K. Yasuda R. Noji H. Adachi K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 473-489Google Scholar). In the complete membranous enzyme, the rotation of subunit γ is proposed to be driven by H+ transport-coupled rotation of a connected ring ofc subunits in the Fo sector of the enzyme, which extend through the lipid bilayer and maintain a fixed linkage with the γ subunit. Rotation of the c ring was also demonstrated using the filament rotation assay (14Sambongi Y. Iko Y. Tanabe M. Omote H. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Ueda I. Yanagida T. Wada Y. Futai M.

The structure of monomeric subunit c has been solved by NMR in a membrane mimetic solvent mixture (16Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Google Scholar), and the structure of the oligomericc 10 ring was predicted from this structure and cross-linking constraints (17Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C.

The proposed subunit packing is now supported by a 3.9 Å x-ray diffraction map of an F1 c 10 subcomplex from yeast mitochondria (19Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Google Scholar). The c subunit spans the membrane as a hairpin of two α-helices and in the case of E. colicontains the essential aspartyl 61 residue at the center of the second TMH. 1The abbreviations used are: TMH, transmembrane helix; DTT, dithiothreitol; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; ACMA, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxy acridine; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy- 1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 1The abbreviations used are: TMH, transmembrane helix; DTT, dithiothreitol; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; ACMA, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxy acridine; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy- 1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Asp61 is thought to undergo protonation and deprotonation as each subunit of the oligomeric ring moves past a stationary subunit a. Subunita is believed to provide access channels to the proton-binding Asp61 residue, but the actual proton translocation pathway remains to be defined (20Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2151065392,"Chronic exposures to inorganic arsenic (iAs) have been linked to increased incidences of various cancers, including cancer of the urinary bladder. Mechanisms by which iAs promotes cancer may include stimulation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding through increased expression and/or phosphorylation of the AP-1 constituents. However, the role of methylated metabolites of iAs in AP-1 activation has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we show that short-time exposures to 0.1-5 microM arsenite (iAsIII) or the methylated trivalent arsenicals methylarsine oxide (MAsIIIO), or iododimethylarsine (DMAsIIII) induce phosphorylation of c-Jun and increase AP-1 DNA binding activity in human bladder epithelial cells. DMAsIIII and especially MAsIIIO are considerably more potent than iAsIII as inducers of c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation. Phosphorylated c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and Fra-1, but not c-Fos, FosB, or ATF-2, are detected in the AP-1-DNA binding complex in cells exposed to trivalent arsenicals. In cells transiently transfected with an AP-1-dependent promoter-reporter construct, MAsIIIO was more potent than iAsIII in inducing the AP-1-dependent gene transcription. Exposures to trivalent arsenicals induce phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not c-Jun N-terminal kinases or p38 kinases. These results indicate that an ERK-dependent signal transduction pathway is at least partially responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation in UROtsa cells exposed to inorganic or methylated trivalent arsenicals."

Among the lymphocyte accessory molecules (CD2, CD4, CD8, CD9, CD28, CD43, CD45, etc.), there are CD5 and CD6, two highly homologous representatives of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR)1 superfamily (1Aruffo A. Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Starling G.C. Gebe J.A. Bajorath J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 498-504Google Scholar, 2Vilà J.M. Padilla O. Arman M. Gimferrer I. Lozano F. Immunologı́a. 2000; 19: 105-121Google Scholar). The SRCR superfamily includes a heterogeneous group of soluble and/or membrane-associated receptors involved in the development of the immune system and in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses (1Aruffo A. Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Starling G.C. Gebe J.A. Bajorath J. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 498-504Google Scholar). This family is characterized by the presence of one or several repeats of a well conserved extracellular domain named SRCR, which was first reported at the C terminus of the macrophage type I scavenger receptor (SR-AI) (3Freeman M. Ashkenas J. Rees D.J. Kingsley D.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8810-8814Google Scholar). CD5 and CD6 are the two representatives of the SRCR superfamily reported to be expressed on human lymphocytes. Both lymphocyte receptors are type I transmembrane glycoproteins with extracellular regions composed of three SRCR domains and cytoplasmic domains devoid of intrinsic catalytic activity but well adapted for signal transduction (4Jones N.H.

CD5 has been shown to behave as a dual receptor, which provides either positive or negative co-stimulatory signals depending on the cell type and the developmental stage (10Lozano F. Simarro M. Calvo J. Vila J.M. Padilla O. Bowen M.A. Campbell K.S. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 347-358Google Scholar). To achieve this, engagement of different signaling molecules and cascades by CD5 (phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), acidic sphingomyelinase (ASMase), casein kinase II (CKII), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Cbl, RasGAP, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase, etc.) have been reported (10Lozano F. Simarro M. Calvo J. Vila J.M. Padilla O. Bowen M.A. Campbell K.S. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 347-358Google Scholar). Initial positive co-stimulatory properties on peripheral T cells were first reported for CD5, by using either soluble or solid phase-bound monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (11Ceuppens J.L. Baroja M.L. J.

It seems, however, that CD5 could exert negative effects on only one branch (Ca2+influx following phospholipase C-γ activation) of the T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signal, during CD5-mediated differentiation of double positive thymocytes (20Cibotti R. Punt J.A. Dash K.S. Sharrow S.O. Singer A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 245-255Google Scholar, 21Zhou X.Y. Yashiro-Ohtani Y. Toyo-Oka K. Park C.S. Tai X.G. Hamaoka T. Fujiwara H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1260-1268Google Scholar). The influence of CD5 in the selection process of developing thymocytes has been shown to depend on the TCR/major histocompatibility complex/ligand affinity (15Tarakhovsky A. Kanner S.B. Hombach J. Ledbetter J.A. Muller W. Killeen N. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 535-537Google Scholar, 17Pena-Rossi C. Zuckerman L.A. Strong J. Kwan J. Ferris W. Chan S. Tarakhovsky A. Beyers A.D. Killeen N. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6494-6501Google Scholar, 18Azzam H.S. DeJarnette J.B. Huang K. Emmons R. Park C.S. Sommers C.L. El-Khoury D. Shores E.W. Love P.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5464-5472Google Scholar). This, together with the fact that CD5 surface expression is developmentally regulated by TCR signals and TCR avidity (22Azzam H.S. Grinberg A. Lui K. Shen H. Shores E.W. Love P.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2301-2311Google Scholar), has led to the notion that CD5 functions to fine-tune TCR signaling (18Azzam H.S. DeJarnette J.B. Huang K. Emmons R. Park C.S. Sommers C.L. El-Khoury D. Shores E.W. Love P.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5464-5472Google Scholar). Whether this tuning is achieved by CD5 alone or in conjunction with other lymphocyte receptors remains to be ascertained. Recently, the synergistic effect on thymocyte-positive selection of the null mutations of CD5 and CD2, two associated molecules (23Carmo A.M. Castro M.A. Arosa F.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4238-4245Google Scholar), has been reported (24Teh S.J. Killeen N. Tarakhovsky A. Littman D.R. Teh H.S. Blood. 1997; 89: 1308-1318Google Scholar). The identity and the role played by the CD5 ligand(s) are also a matter of controversy (2Vilà J.M. Padilla O. Arman M. Gimferrer I. Lozano F. Immunologı́a. 2000; 19: 105-121Google Scholar, 25Bhandoola A. Bosselut R. Yu Q. Cowan M.L. Feigenbaum L. Love P.E. Singer A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1811-1817Google Scholar). A good candidate is, however, gp150 (26Calvo J. Places L. Padilla O. Vila J.M. Vives J. Bowen M.A. Lozano F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2119-2129Google Scholar), a broadly distributed receptor that is expressed on thymic epithelial cells. The precise function of CD6 in lymphocyte activation and differentiation still remains elusive. Available evidence indicates that it is an accessory molecule capable of providing co-stimulatory signals in mature T cells (27Morimoto C. Rudd C.E. Letvin N.L. Hagan M. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2165-2170Google Scholar, 28Gangemi R.M. Swack J.A. Gaviria D.M. Romain P.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2439-2447Google Scholar, 29Swack J.A. Gangemi R.M. Rudd C.E. Morimoto C.

The signaling pathway used by CD6 to influence T cell activation is, however, mostly unknown. It has been shown that CD6 becomes hyperphosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues (29Swack J.A. Gangemi R.M. Rudd C.E. Morimoto C. Schlossman S.F. Romain P.L. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 1037-1049Google Scholar,33Cardenas L. Carrera A.C. Yague E. Pulido R. Sanchez-Madrid F. de Landazuri M.O. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1450-1455Google Scholar) and transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated after CD3 stimulation alone or by co-cross-linking of CD3 with either CD2 or CD4 (34Wee S. Schieven G.L. Kirihara J.M. Tsu T.T. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 219-223Google Scholar, 35Kobarg J. Whitney G.S. Palmer D. Aruffo A. Bowen M.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2971-2980Google Scholar). In B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, CD6 ligation protects from anti-IgM-mediated apoptosis through Bcl-2 induction (36Osorio L.M. De Santiago A. Aguilar-Santelises M. Mellstedt H. Jondal M. Blood. 1997; 89: 2833-2841Google Scholar). A role for CD6 in thymocyte development has also been suggested. CD166/activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, a CD6 ligand, is expressed on thymic epithelium and mediates adhesion of thymocytes to it (37Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Li X. Modrell B. Malacko A.R.

The correlation of CD6 expression with thymocyte-positive selection and resistance to apoptosis has also been reported (40Singer N.G. Fox D.A. Haqqi T.M. Beretta L. Endres J.S. Prohaska S. Parnes J.R. Bromberg J. Sramkoski R.M. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 585-597Google Scholar). Mice deficient for CD6 are not available yet, and the possibility that CD6 possesses negative regulatory properties similar to those reported for CD5 on thymocyte development still has to be evaluated. CD5 has been found physically associated with the antigen-specific receptor present on B1a (B cell receptor) and T (TCR) cells (41Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M. Cordell J.L. van Noesel C.J. van Lier R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 812-816Google Scholar, 42Osman N. Lazarovits A.I. Crumpton M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1173-1176Google Scholar), as well as with the surface receptors CD4 or CD8, CD2, and CD9 (23Carmo A.M. Castro M.A. Arosa F.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4238-4245Google Scholar, 43Beyers A.D. Spruyt L.L. Williams A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2945-2949Google Scholar,44Toyo-oka K. Yashiro-Ohtani Y. Park C.S. Tai X.G. Miyake K. Hamaoka T. Fujiwara H. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 2043-2052Google Scholar). This positions CD5 as an important regulatory molecule relevant for T and B cell-mediated responses. In the CD6 case, no associations with other lymphocyte surface receptors have been reported up to now. The fact that CD5 and CD6 are closely related molecules, not only at structural but also at expression and functional level (2Vilà J.M. Padilla O. Arman M. Gimferrer I. Lozano F. Immunologı́a. 2000; 19: 105-121Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate a possible physical association between them. Here we present strong biochemical and microscopic evidence on the in vivo association and co-localization of CD5 and CD6 on the membrane of T lymphocytes. This suggests that they may constitute a functional unit subserving lymphocyte activation and differentiation processes. Lymphocytes were obtained either from peripheral blood (PBL) samples subjected to centrifugation on a standard Ficoll gradient (d = 1,077) or from lymph node suspensions. Thymocytes were obtained by disruption of human thymus specimens from children undergoing cardiac surgery. The human T cell lines HUT-78 and Jurkat JE6.1, and the lymphoblastoid B cell line Raji were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). COS-7 cells were from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC 87021302). Cell lines were grown in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The mouse Cris-1 (anti-CD5, IgG2a), 148.1C3 (anti-CD43, IgG2a), 33-2A3 (anti-CD3, IgG2a) and 161.8 (anti-CD6, IgG1) mAbs were produced in our laboratory by R. Vilella (Hospital Clı́nic, Barcelona, Spain). Affinity-purified Leu-1 (anti-CD5, IgG2a) mAb was purchased from BD Biosciences. The SPV L14.2 (anti-CD6, IgG1) mAb was from Immunotech (Marseille, France), and the W6/32 (anti-HLA class I, IgG2a) was from the ATCC (HB-95). The fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-CD5 (UCTH2, IgG1), anti-CD6 (M-T605, IgG1), and anti-CD3 (UCHT1, IgG1) mAb were from Pharmingen. The 148.1C3 mAb was conjugated to FITC (Sigma) as described previously (45Goding J.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1976; 13: 215-226Google Scholar). The Leu-1 and 161.8 mAbs were conjugated to cyanine 3 (Cy3) using the Cy3 mAb labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). The FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyvalent immunoglobulins (GAMIg-FITC) were from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (SAv) was from Dako (Denmark). Tricolor- and Texas Red (TR)-conjugated SAv were from Caltag (Burlingame, CA). The generation of the rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the extracellular region of human CD5 has been reported elsewhere (46Calvo J. Places L. Espinosa G. Padilla O. Vila J.M. Villamor N. Ingelmo M. Gallart T. Vives J. Font J. Lozano F. Tissue Antigens. 1999; 54: 128-137Google Scholar). The anti-CD6 polyclonal antiserum was produced in our laboratory by immunizing rabbits for 2 weeks with four intramuscular injections (50 μg each) of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-CD6cy in complete (first) and incomplete (next) Freund's adjuvant (Invitrogen). Biotinylation of mAbs and cell surface proteins was performed with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Mowiol 4-88 was from Calbiochem, and poly-l-lysine (PLL) was from Sigma. The blue fluorescent cell tracker chloromethyl derivative of aminocoumarin (CMAC) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE) was from Toxin Technology (Sarasota, FL). The cDNA used to amplify the cytoplasmic region of CD6 was obtained by retrotranscription of total mRNA from PBL with SuperscriptTM II RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The GST-CD6cy construct codes for a fusion protein was composed of the GST protein fused in-frame to the CD6 cytoplasmic region (from Lys-427 to Ala-688). This was done by PCR amplification of CD6 cDNA with the sense/antisense oligonucleotide pair, 5′-AGCAGTCGACGAAAGGAAAATATGCCCTCCCCGTA-3′ and 5′-AAGAATGCGGCCGCTAGGCTGCGCTGATGTCATCGT-3′, and further cloning intoSalI- and NotI-restricted (Fermentas MBI, Vilnius, Lithuania) pGEX 4T2 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences AB). The expression construct coding for wild-type CD6 (CD6.WT) was obtained by cloning SalI/EcoRI- andEcoRI/BamHI-restricted (Fermentas MBI) fragments corresponding to the extracellular and cytoplasmic regions of CD6, respectively, into SalI/BamHI-restricted pHβAPr-1-neo mammalian expression vector. The extracellular portion of CD6 was obtained by PCR amplification using the 5′-TCTCGTCGACATGTGGCTCTTCTTCGGGAT-3′ and 5′-AACTTCTTTGGGGATGGTGATGGG-3′ primers and the CD6-PB1 cDNA sequence cloned into pBJneo as a template (47Robinson W.H. Neuman de Vegvar H.E. Prohaska S.S. Rhee J.W. Parnes J.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2765-2769Google Scholar). The intracellular region of CD6 was obtained by PCR amplification of HUT78 cDNA with the 5′-GTCACTATAGAATCTTCTGTG-3′ and 5′-AAAGGATCCCTAGGCTGCGCTGATGTCATC-3′ primers. The generation of expression constructs coding for CD5.WT and CD5.K384stopmolecules has been described elsewhere (48Simarro M. Pelassy C. Calvo J. Places L. Aussel C. Lozano F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4307-4315Google Scholar). Aliquots of surface biotinylated cells were lysed for 30 min on ice with a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaF, 0.4 mm orthovanadate, 5 mmpyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture tablets (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and either 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 1% Brij 96 (Fluka). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the cell lysates were precleared by end-over-end rotation with 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences AB). Immunoprecipitations were carried out by adding 3 μg of mAb plus 20 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads and by rotating for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer with 1% detergent. For re-precipitation, the immune complexes were boiled for 5 min in lysis buffer containing 3% SDS. The eluate was recovered and diluted 9-fold with lysis buffer and then pre-cleared with 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min. Proteins were re-precipitated with 5 μl of anti-CD6 or -CD5 polyclonal rabbit antiserum plus 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 90 min at 4 °C. Re-precipitates were washed three times with 200 μl of lysis buffer, eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, and run on 8% SDS-PAGE. For immunodepletion experiments, surface-biotinylated HUT-78 cells were lysed with 1% Brij 96 and then sequentially immunoprecipitated (eight times) with anti-CD5 (Cris-1) or anti-CD6 (161.8) mAbs. Once depleted, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the reverse mAb and re-precipitated as above with rabbit polyclonal antisera (5 μl) against the depleted molecule. Transient transfection into COS-7 cells was performed by the diethylaminoethyl-dextran/Me2SO method as previously described (49Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.T. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of plasmid DNA per 2 × 105 cells in a 9-cm2 dish were used. The cells were harvested ∼48 h after transfection and then surface-biotinylated and lysed with lysis buffer containing 1% Brij 96 as indicated above. Samples resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred (at 0.4 A, 100 V for 1 h) to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Filters were blocked for 30 min at 37 °C with 5% non-fat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a 1/1000 dilution of HRP-SAv in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were developed by chemiluminescence with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) and exposure to X-OmatTM films (Eastman Kodak). All procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. 1 × 106 PBL were incubated for 10 min with saturating amounts of biotinylated anti-CD6 (SPV L14.2) or anti-CD5 (Cris-1) mAbs. After washing with ice-cold PBS plus 0.1% sodium azide, cells were incubated with saturating doses of TR-SAv for 10 min at 4 °C. For capping to proceed, cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold PBS/azide. Next, the cells were transferred onto PLL-coated coverslips and stained for 30 min with FITC-conjugated anti-CD5, -CD6, or -CD43 mAbs before fixation with PBS 2% paraformaldehyde. After washing twice, the coverslips were transferred onto Mowiol-treated glass slides, and visualized in a confocal spectral microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The images were analyzed with the Image Processing Leica confocal software and Photoshop 4.0 (Adobe Systems). 1 × 106 PBL were incubated for 30 min on ice with 500 μl of RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS in the presence or absence of 3 μg of Cris-1 or 161.8 mAbs. After washing twice with cold PBS, the cells were incubated on ice with 500 μl of RPMI 10% FCS containing 3 μl of FITC-GAMIg for 30 min. Then the cells were washed and left overnight at 37 °C in order to allow the immune complexes to be internalized. At this point, part of the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences), and the remaining cells were incubated with biotinylated mAb plus Tricolor-SAv before flow cytometry analysis. Cells left overnight in RPMI 10% FCS alone were stained with 1 μg of Cris-1 or 161.8 mAb and 3 μl of FITC-GAMIg and used as a control to monitor CD5 and CD6 expression on unmodulated cells. 1 × 106 PBL (in 300 μl of PBS) were transferred onto PLL-coated coverslips for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 1% heat-inactivated rabbit serum for 10 min at room temperature, cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with saturating amounts of FITC- (donor) and Cy3-labeled (acceptor) antibodies, either alone or mixed. Cells were then rinsed twice for 5 min at 4 °C with PBS and fixed with PBS, 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washed twice, the coverslips were transferred onto Mowiol-treated glass slides. FRET measurements were based on the sensitized emission method (50Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Google Scholar, 51Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Google Scholar) with minor modifications for the confocal microscope. A Leica TCS SL laser scanning confocal spectral microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with argon and green HeNe lasers, ×100 oil immersion objective lens, and triple dichroic filter (488/543/633 nm) was used. To measure FRET, three images were acquired in the same order in all experiments as follows: 1) the FITC channel (absorbance 488 nm and emission 500–555 nm), 2) the FRET channel (absorbance 488 nm and emission 590–700 nm), and 3) the Cy3 channel (absorbance 543 nm and emission 590–700 nm). Background was subtracted from images before FRET calculations. Control and experiment images were taken under the same conditions of photomultiplier gain, offset, and pinhole aperture. The crossover of donor and acceptor fluorescence through the FRET filter is a constant proportion between the fluorescence intensity levels of donor and acceptor and their bleed through. In order to calculate the spectral bleed through of the donor and acceptor through the FRET filter, images of cells labeled only with FITC-conjugated mAb and cells labeled only with Cy3-conjugated mAb were also taken under the same conditions as for the experiments. As a control, images of FITC-GAMIg combined with an unlabeled anti-CD5 mAb (Leu-1) were included. The fraction of bleed through of FITC (A) and Cy3 (B) fluorescence through the FRET filter channel was calculated for different labeling conditions: FITC-anti-CD3, 0.13 ± 0.024; FITC-anti-CD43, 0.13 ± 0.020; FITC-anti-CD6, 0.13 ± 0.022; anti-CD5 plus FITC-GAMIg, 0.12 ± 0.015; and Cy3-anti-CD5, 0.56 ± 0.043. Corrected FRET (FRETc) was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image by using Equation 1,FRETc=FRET−(A×FITC)−(B×Cy3)Equation 1 where FRET, FITC, and Cy3 correspond to background-subtracted images of cells labeled with FITC- and Cy3-conjugated antibodies acquired through the FRET, FITC, and Cy3 channels, respectively. Images of FRETc intensity were renormalized according to a lookup table where the minimum and maximum values are displayed as blue and red, respectively. Mean FRETc values were calculated from mean fluorescence intensities for each of the 10 regions of interest (ROI) selected from 5 different cells according to Equation 1. The apparent efficiency (E a) of FRET was calculated according to Equation 2,Ea=FRETc/Cy3Equation 2 where FRETc and Cy3 are the mean intensities of FRETc and Cy3 in the selected regions of interest. These calculations allowed E a to be <0. All calculations were performed using the Image Processing Leica confocal software and Microsoft Excel. The statistical analysis was performed by SPSS statistical software (Chicago, IL). The results are graphed showing the mean ± S.D. and percentiles 25 and 75. Statistical differences between groups were tested using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. A value of p < 0.001 was taken to indicate statistical significance. T cell-APC cell conjugates were generated by using Vβ8 TCR-expressing Jurkat cells (J77c120) and the human B cell line Raji in the presence or absence of SEE as described previously (52Niedergang F. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1703-1710Google Scholar). Jurkat J77 cells were loaded with 10 μm CMAC for 20 min at 37 °C. Raji cells (5 × 106 cell/ml) were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 20 min in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml of SEE. J77 cells (5 × 104cell/well) were mixed with an equal number of Raji cells in a final volume of 600 μl and incubated for 30 min before plating onto PLL-coated slides in flat-bottomed 24-well plates (Costar Corp.). Cells were allowed to settle for 10 min at 37 °C, fixed for 5 min in PBS 2% formaldehyde, and blocked with 100 μg/ml human IgG (Sigma) before staining with the appropriated mAb plus FITC-GAMIg. Cells were observed by a DMR photomicroscope (Leica) with ×63 and 100 oil immersion objectives. Images were acquired using the Leica QFISH 1.0 software. Conjugates were first identified by directly observing both cell morphologies under differential interference contrast and blue fluorescent CMAC-labeled J77 cells. The possible membrane association of CD5 and CD6 was explored by co-immunoprecipitation experiments of biotin-labeled surface proteins solubilized under different detergent conditions (either 1% Brij 96 or 1% Nonidet P-40). The presence of CD6 in CD5 immunoprecipitat"
https://openalex.org/W2154985891,"Stochastic resonance, in which noise enhances the response of a nonlinear system to a weak signal, has been observed in various biological sensory systems. We speculated that bone formation in response to mechanical loading could be enhanced by adding noise (vibration) to a standard exercise regimen. To test this hypothesis, three different loading regimens were applied to the ulnae of mice: (1) high amplitude, low frequency sinusoidal loading at 2 Hz with an amplitude of 3 N to simulate exercise; (2) low amplitude, broad frequency vibration with frequency components 0-50 Hz and 0.3 N of mean amplitude; (3) the sinusoidal wave combined with vibration (S+V) to invoke stochastic resonance. The simulated exercise regimen induced new bone formation on the periosteal surface of the ulna, however the addition of vibration noise with exercise enhanced the osteogenic response by almost 4-fold. Vibration by itself had no effect on bone formation. It was concluded that adding low magnitude vibration greatly enhanced bone formation in response to loading, suggesting a contribution of stochastic resonance in the osteogenic response."
https://openalex.org/W1521352617,"Betacellulin (BTC) is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, and it acts through EGF receptors. We asked whether BTC could be an angiogenic factor. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we examined the effect of BTC on kinases and angiogenic processes. BTC induced ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. BTC induced phosphorylation of all three EGF receptors present on HUVECs: ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Pretreatment with effective concentrations of ErbB1 inhibitor did not suppress BTC-induced kinase phosphorylation. BTC, EGF, VEGF (all at 10 ng/ml) produced similar increases in DNA synthesis. BTC, EGF, and VEGF all significantly increased endothelial cell migration. In addition, BTC promoted survival in a dose-dependent manner, and its effect was inhibited by pretreatment with PtdIns 3'-kinase inhibitor wortmannin or MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. Both BTC and EGF produced similar increases in tube formation in collagen gels. BTC-induced tube formation was suppressed by PD98059, wortmannin, and LY294002. In the mouse Matrigel plug assay, BTC (100 ng/ml) promoted neovessel formation, and its effect was suppressed by a combination of wortmannin and PD98059. Taken together, these data show that BTC exerts potent angiogenic activity through activation of EGF receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PtdIns 3'-kinase/Akt in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093714762,"The ryanodine (RY) receptors in beta-cells amplify signals by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). The role of CICR in insulin secretion remains unclear in spite of the fact that caffeine is known to stimulate secretion. This effect of caffeine is attributed solely to the inhibition of cAMP-phosphodiesterases (cAMP-PDEs). We demonstrate that stimulation of insulin secretion by caffeine is due to a sensitization of the RY receptors. The dose-response relationship of caffeine-induced inhibition of cAMP-PDEs was not correlated with the stimulation of insulin secretion. Sensitization of the RY receptors stimulated insulin secretion in a context-dependent manner, that is, only in the presence of a high concentration of glucose. This effect of caffeine depended on an increase in [Ca2+]i. Confocal images of beta-cells demonstrated an increase in [Ca2+]i induced by caffeine but not by forskolin. 9-Methyl-7-bromoeudistomin D (MBED), which sensitizes RY receptors, did not inhibit cAMP-PDEs, but it stimulated secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. The stimulation of secretion by caffeine and MBED involved both the first and the second phases of secretion. We conclude that the RY receptors of beta-cells mediate a distinct glucose-dependent signal for insulin secretion and may be a target for developing drugs that will stimulate insulin secretion only in a glucose-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2014117599,"The pim family of proto-oncogenes encodes three serine-threonine kinases that have been implicated in the development of malignancies in mice and in humans. Expression of the Pim protein kinases is tightly regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational levels. Dysregulation ofpim transcription and pim mRNA stability have been implicated in Pim-mediated transformation. The data presented herein demonstrate that expression of the Pim kinases is additionally regulated at the post-translational level, by the serine-threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The catalytic subunit of PP2A associates with the Pim kinases in vivo, and the Pim kinases are substrates of PP2A phosphatase activity in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of PP2A reduces the levels of the Pim proteins, whereas inhibition of PP2A activity by the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid stabilizes the Pim proteins. Finally, the effects of PP2A on the expression of the Pim proteins can affect Pim function. Taken together, these data suggest that PP2A activity is important for the regulation of the stability and function of the Pim kinases. The pim family of proto-oncogenes encodes three serine-threonine kinases that have been implicated in the development of malignancies in mice and in humans. Expression of the Pim protein kinases is tightly regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational levels.

The pim family of proto-oncogenes encodes three serine-threonine kinases, Pim-1, -2, and -3 (1Selten G. Cuypers H.T. Berns A.

Little is known about the functional role of the Pim kinases in vivo, although a number of observations have pointed to a potential role for Pim-1 in signal transduction. Pim-1 has been shown to phosphorylate the transcriptional co-activator p100 and activate the transcription factor c-Myb downstream of Ras (4Leverson J.D. Koskinen P.J. Orrico F.C. Rainio E.M.

Moreover, Pim-1 has been implicated in glycoprotein 130-mediated induction of cell proliferation and protection from apoptosis downstream of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (5Shirogane T.

In addition, pim-1-deficient mast cells exhibit decreased responsiveness to interleukin-3 in vitro (6Domen J. van der Lugt N.M. Laird P.W. Saris C.J. Clarke A.R. Hooper M.L. Berns A. Blood. 1993; 82: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the Pim kinases have recently been shown to associate with and stabilize the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein, SOCS-1 1The abbreviations used are: SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RPMI, Roswell Park Medical Institute medium; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; LLnL, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleu-al; JAK, Janus kinase; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (7Chen X.P.

SOCS-1 has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of JAK kinase activity and to play an important role in regulating the responsiveness of cells to cytokine stimulation (8Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M.

These observations suggest that the Pim kinases may play an important role in cytokine signaling. Expression of the Pim kinases in normal cells is highly regulated, and several mechanisms by which Pim-1 expression is controlled have been characterized. Pim-1 mRNA levels are regulated by transcriptional attenuation of pim-1 (12Nagarajan L. Narayana L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as well as by induction of transcription of pim-1 upon mitogenic stimulation of cells (13Yip-Schneider M.T. Horie M. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pim-1 expression is rapidly induced by a number of cytokines including interferon-γ, interleukin-2, and interleukin-3 in hematopoietic cells, and by synaptic stimulation in neurons (3Konietzko U. Kauselmann G. Scafidi J. Staubli U. Mikkers H. Berns A. Schweizer M. Waltereit R. Kuhl D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3359-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Yip-Schneider M.T. Horie M.

Pim-2 transcription, like that of Pim-1, is cytokine-inducible, whereas Pim-3 and Pim-1 transcription are induced by synaptic activity (3Konietzko U. Kauselmann G. Scafidi J. Staubli U. Mikkers H. Berns A. Schweizer M. Waltereit R. Kuhl D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3359-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Allen J.D. Verhoeven E. Domen J. van der Valk M. Berns A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Levels of pim-1 mRNA are also regulated post-transcriptionally by modulation of mRNA stability (13Yip-Schneider M.T. Horie M. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1995; 85: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wingett D. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3653-3659PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the Pim kinases is therefore highly regulated by multiple mechanisms. Dysregulation of Pim expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several different forms of leukemia and lymphoma. Pim-1was originally identified as a common proviral insertion site of Moloney murine leukemia virus in T cell lymphomas in mice (1Selten G. Cuypers H.T. Berns A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and viral activation of pim-2 (2van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Verhoeven E. Linders K. van der Gluden H. Allen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and transgenic overexpression of pim-1 and pim-2 (15Allen J.D. Verhoeven E. Domen J. van der Valk M. Berns A.

Cell. 1989; 56: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) also result in T cell lymphoma development. The Pim kinases have been implicated in the development of human hematopoietic malignancies as well. High levels of Pim-1 protein have been seen in acute myeloid, lymphoid, and erythroid leukemia (18Nagarajan L. Louie E. Tsujimoto Y. ar-Rushdi A. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The observation that transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type Pim-1 or Pim-2 develop tumors demonstrates that Pim-mediated transformation can occur as a consequence of dysregulated Pim expression (15Allen J.D. Verhoeven E. Domen J. van der Valk M. Berns A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 17van Lohuizen M. Verbeek S. Krimpenfort P. Domen J. Saris C. Radaszkiewicz T. Berns A. Cell. 1989; 56: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Diverse mechanisms have been identified in spontaneous tumors that lead to increased Pim-1 expression. Enhanced Pim-1 mRNA stability has been observed in numerous transformed cell lines (21Meeker T.C. Loeb J. Ayres M. Sellers W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the half-life of the Pim-1 protein has been shown to be prolonged in several tumor cell lines (22Saris C.J. Domen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23Liang H. Hittelman W. Nagarajan L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore disruption of the regulation of Pim-1 transcript levels and Pim-1 protein stability have been shown to be associated with Pim-mediated transformation. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a highly conserved serine-threonine phosphatase expressed in all eukaryotic cells that is involved in a multitude of cellular functions including transcription and translation, cell cycle progression, and cytokine signaling (reviewed in Ref. 24Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). In the present study, PP2A is demonstrated to be a binding partner and regulator of the protein stability of the Pim kinases. PP2A associates with Pim-1 and Pim-3 in vivo and dephosphorylates Pim-3 in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of PP2A results in a decrease in the expression levels of Pim-1 and Pim-3 protein, and inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid results in stabilization of the Pim-1 protein. Finally, PP2A inhibits the effects of the Pim kinases on the SOCS-1 protein. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism for the regulation of Pim protein expression and function and suggest a role for PP2A in Pim-mediated transformation.

BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River, Wilmington, MA, and splenocytes and thymocytes isolated from the mice were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and nonessential amino acids. Cycloheximide, okadaic acid, PMA, and ionomycin were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant PP2A was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. The SOCS-1, Pim-1, and Pim-2 expression vectors have previously been described (7Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl.

The anti-HA antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The anti-PP2A antibody used in immunoprecipitation was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. The anti-PP2A antibody used in Western blotting was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. The anti-β-actin and anti-Flag antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Calcium-phosphate transient transfections of 293T cells were performed as previously described (7Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L.

For cycloheximide time course experiments, cycloheximide was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. For okadaic acid treatments of cells, okadaic acid was used at a concentration of 25 nm. For LLnL treatments of cells, LLnL was used at a concentration of 10 μm. Whole cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitations were performed also as previously described (7Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays were performed as previously described (6Domen J. van der Lugt N.M. Laird P.W. Saris C.J. Clarke A.R. Hooper M.L. Berns A. Blood. 1993; 82: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Saris C.J. Domen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays that were subjected to in vitro phosphatase reactions were performed as above except that, after washing twice in buffer containing 20 mm PIPES and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, the immunoprecipitates were washed one time in phosphatase buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and then resuspended in 40 μl of phosphatase buffer (25Cheng M. Zhen E. Robinson M.J. Ebert D. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12057-12062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recombinant PP2A was then added, with or without 5 μm okadaic acid, and reactions were incubated at room temperature for 45 min with agitation. Reactions were terminated by washing twice in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. 293T cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (cDMEM) were transfected by calcium-phosphate transfection in 6-cm dishes. After 24 h, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in cDMEM for 24 h. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 1 h. 0.5 mCi per plate of 35S-labeled methionine was then added to the transfections for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in cDMEM for the indicated amounts of time, after which cells were harvested and lysed. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Pim-3 antibody, immunoprecipitates were run on SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy MiniKit purchased from Qiagen, Valencia, CA, and Northern blots were prepared using standard techniques. Pim-1 was detected with a full-length cDNA probe radiolabeled by the NEBlot Kit purchased from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. The three Pim kinases and the catalytic subunit of PP2A have previously been identified as proteins that can bind the regulator of cytokine signaling, SOCS-1 (7Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To determine whether PP2A and the Pim kinases can directly associate, His-tagged PP2A and His-tagged Pim-1 were expressed alone or together in 293T cells, and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PP2A antibody. His-tagged Pim-1 was detected in PP2A immunoprecipitates in extracts of cells expressing both Pim-1 and PP2A, but not in extracts of cells expressing Pim-1 alone (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were observed when Pim-3 and PP2A were co-expressed in 293T cells (data not shown). SOCS-2 was used as a negative control for the immunoprecipitations. In extracts of cells co-expressing His-tagged SOCS-2 and His-tagged PP2A, SOCS-2 did not co-immunoprecipitate with PP2A (Fig. 1 A). Thus, in an overexpression system, the Pim protein kinases and PP2A are capable of interacting in vivo. To confirm that endogenous Pim kinases and PP2A can associate, the ability of Pim-1 to co-immunoprecipitate with PP2A in lysates from primary mouse cells was determined. High levels of Pim-1 are induced by culturing of either mouse spleen or thymus with PMA and ionomycin (26Wingett D. Long A. Kelleher D. Magnuson N.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 549-557PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, extracts from primary splenocytes and thymocytes, unstimulated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin, were immunoprecipitated with antibody to PP2A, and the presence of co-immunoprecipitated Pim-1 protein was detected by Western blotting. Pim-1 was detected in PP2A immunoprecipitates of extracts from stimulated, but not unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 B). Thus, endogenous Pim-1 protein is capable of interacting with PP2A in vivo. The Pim kinases are known to autophosphorylate in vitro (2van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Verhoeven E. Linders K. van der Gluden H. Allen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 3Konietzko U. Kauselmann G. Scafidi J. Staubli U. Mikkers H. Berns A. Schweizer M. Waltereit R. Kuhl D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3359-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Hoover D. Friedmann M. Reeves R. Magnuson N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14018-14023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and when immunoprecipitates of wild-type and kinase-inactive Pim-3 were incubated in in vitro kinase reactions, a band corresponding to phosphorylated Pim-3 was detected in wild-type but not kinase-inactive Pim-3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3). To determine whether PP2A can directly dephosphorylate the autophosphorylation sites on the Pim kinases, Pim-3 immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays followed byin vitro phosphatase assays. When wild-type Pim-3 immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitrokinase-in vitro phosphatase reactions, recombinant PP2A was able to dephosphorylate the autophosphorylation sites on Pim-3 (Fig. 2,lanes 4 and 5). This effect of PP2A was blocked by addition of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A catalytic activity, to the phosphatase reactions (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and8). These data show that the Pim kinases are in vitro substrates of PP2A phosphatase activity and suggest that PP2A may regulate the phosphorylation state of the Pim kinases in vivo. As the activity of the Pim kinases is controlled by regulation of protein expression, the effect of overexpression of PP2A on Pim protein levels was examined. 293T cells were co-transfected with Pim-1 and increasing amounts of PP2A in the presence of SOCS-1, and Pim-1 levels were detected by Western blotting. A lacZ expression vector was also co-transfected to control for transfection efficiency, protein loading, and the nonspecific effects of overexpressing PP2A. With increasing expression of PP2A, the levels of expression of Pim-1 decreased (Fig. 3 A), and similar results were seen for Pim-3 (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that overexpression of PP2A decreases expression of the Pim kinases and suggest that PP2A may regulate pim kinase expressionin vivo. Previous work has demonstrated that the Pim kinases are capable of phosphorylating and stabilizing the SOCS-1 protein (7Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The observation that overexpression of PP2A decreases the steady-state levels of expression of the Pim kinases therefore implies that PP2A can modulate the function of the Pim kinases. Co-expression of SOCS-1 and Pim-1 resulted in an increase in the levels of expression of SOCS-1 and in the appearance of multiple hyperphosphorylated forms of SOCS-1 of slower mobility (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1 and2). Upon co-expression of PP2A, however, the levels of SOCS-1, and the presence of the slower mobility forms of SOCS-1, decreased with increasing PP2A expression (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3–5). Similar results were obtained when SOCS-1, Pim-3, and increasing amounts of PP2A were co-expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 3 B). Therefore overexpression of PP2A in 293T cells modulates the increase in the steady-state levels of SOCS-1 and the appearance of hyperphosphorylated forms of SOCS-1 induced by co-expression of SOCS-1 with the Pim kinases. To confirm that the effect of overexpression of PP2A on SOCS-1 mobility is not a result of direct dephosphorylation of SOCS-1 by PP2A, the ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate SOCS-1 was determined. SOCS-1 was co-expressed with Pim-3, immunoprecipitated, and incubated in in vitro kinase assays, and SOCS-1 phosphorylated by Pim-3 was then used as a substrate in in vitro phosphatase assays with recombinant PP2A. Incubation of the labeled SOCS-1 immunoprecipitates with recombinant PP2A did not result in the dephosphorylation of SOCS-1 (data not shown). Thus SOCS-1 is not a direct substrate of PP2A, and the effects of overexpression of PP2A on SOCS-1 mobility are therefore likely an indirect effect of the decreased levels of Pim protein expressed upon overexpression of PP2A. SOCS-1 has been shown to be involved in the recruitment of signaling molecules to the proteasome (28De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 29Frantsve J. Schwaller J. Sternberg D.W. Kutok J. Gilliland D.G. Mol. Cell.

Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12530-12538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the decrease in the expression levels of the Pim proteins upon overexpression of PP2A requires the presence of SOCS-1. When 293T cells were transfected with Pim-3 and increasing amounts of PP2A in the absence of overexpressed SOCS-1, no decrease in the steady-state levels of Pim-3 were observed (data not shown). The observation that down-regulation of expression of the Pim kinases by PP2A requires the expression of SOCS-1 raises the possibility that the Pim kinases undergo proteasomal degradation and that they are targeted for degradation by SOCS-1. To determine whether the Pim kinases are degraded by the proteasomal pathway, 293T cells were transfected with Pim-3, the cells were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor LLnL, and pulse-chase assays were performed to measure the effect of LLnL on the stability of the Pim-3 protein. LLnL treatment resulted in enhancement of stability of the Pim-3 protein (Fig. 4). These data, combined with the observation that altering cellular levels of PP2A affects the levels of expression of the Pim protein kinases, suggest that the Pim kinases are targeted for proteasomal degradation in a SOCS-1-dependent mechanism. To determine whether PP2A activity can regulate the stability of endogenous Pim proteins, the effect of inhibition of PP2A on the half-life of Pim-1 in primary cells was determined. Primary mouse splenocytes and thymocytes, untreated or pretreated with 25 nm okadaic acid were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin and subsequently treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for various times, and the levels of Pim-1 protein expression were determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5). The concentration of okadaic acid used in these experiments has previously been shown to potently inhibit PP2A but not the other major known serine-threonine phosphatases PP-1, PP2B/calcineurin, and PP2C (32Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Stimulation of splenocytes with PMA and ionomycin resulted in induction of expression of two, 44 and 35 kDa, isoforms of Pim-1, and both isoforms displayed half-lives of less than 5 min (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1 and3–8). Upon pretreatment of the splenocytes with okadaic acid, however, the half-lives of both isoforms of Pim-1 increased. In cells pretreated with okadaic acid, the levels of the 44-kDa isoform of Pim-1 did not begin to decrease until after 30 min of cycloheximide treatment, and the protein was still clearly detectable at 60 min (Fig. 5 A,lanes 12–14). Furthermore, in untreated cells, the levels of the 35-kDa isoform of Pim-1 were barely detectable after 30 min of cycloheximide treatment, whereas in cells pretreated with okadaic acid the levels of the 35-kDa isoform were still detectable after 45 min of cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 5 A,lanes 6 and 13). Okadaic acid alone, however, did not induce expression of Pim-1 in the splenocytes (Fig. 5 A,lane 2). As PMA and ionomycin also induce Pim-1 expression in the thymus, the effect of okadaic acid on Pim-1 protein stability was confirmed in thymocytes. In thymocytes, okadaic acid treatment had a similar effect on the stability of the 35-kDa isoform of Pim-1 (Fig. 5 B). In cells not pretreated with okadaic acid, the levels of the 35-kDa isoform of Pim-1 were significantly decreased after 15 min of cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 5 B,lane 4). In cells pretreated with okadaic acid, however, the levels of the 35-kDa isoform of Pim-1 did not begin to decrease until after 60 min of cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 5 B,lane 10). The 44-kDa isoform of Pim-1 has a longer half-life in thymocytes than in splenocytes (Fig. 5 B,lanes 3–6), and the levels of the 44-kDa isoform of Pim-1 did not begin to decrease until after 60 min of treatment of the cells with cycloheximide (Fig. 5 B,lane 6). Okadaic acid treatment did not significantly affect the half-life of the 44-kDa isoform of Pim-1 expressed in thymocytes (Fig. 5 B,lanes 7–10). Therefore inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid preferentially enhances the protein stability of the most labile isoforms of Pim-1 expressed in splenocytes and thymocytes. To confirm that the effects of okadaic acid on the levels of expression of Pim-1 are not the result of increased steady-state levels of pim-1 mRNA, the effect of okadaic acid on the levels of pim-1 mRNA was determined. Splenocytes untreated or pretreated with 25 nm okadaic acid were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin and subsequently treated with cycloheximide for various times, RNA was isolated from the cells, and the level of pim-1 mRNA expressed under the different conditions was determined by Northern blotting (Fig. 6). Low levels of pim-1mRNA were expressed in untreated cells, and these levels were not increased by treatment with okadaic acid alone (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). PMA and ionomycin, however, induced the expression of pim-1 mRNA, and the levels ofpim-1 mRNA induced by PMA and ionomycin, and by PMA, ionomycin, and okadaic acid, were equivalent (Fig. 6, comparelanes 3 and 7). Inhibition of PP2A results in an increase in the stability of the Pim-1 protein, but no change in the steady-state levels of pim-1 mRNA, in primary cells. In this study, the role PP2A plays in the regulation of the Pim kinases was examined. The Pim kinases were found to associate with PP2Ain vivo, and were found to be substrates of PP2A in vitro. Moreover, PP2A was found to regulate the expression of the Pim proteins. Overexpression of PP2A in 293T cells resulted in a decrease in the expression levels of the Pim-1 and Pim-3 proteins, and inhibition of PP2A activity in primary mouse splenocytes and thymocytes by okadaic acid resulted in the stabilization of endogenous Pim-1 protein. Finally, overexpression of PP2A resulted in the inhibition of Pim kinase function in 293T cells. The lower mobility forms of SOCS-1 induced by co-expression of SOCS-1 and the Pim kinases disappeared upon co-expression of PP2A. Thus, regulation of Pim protein stability by PP2A represents an additional mechanism by which Pim kinase expression and function are regulated. Dephosphorylation of the Pim kinases by PP2A may directly affect the stability of the Pim kinases. Phosphorylation has been shown to regulate the stability of many cellular proteins by modulating the targeting of the proteins to degradation. Whereas phosphorylation has most often been identified as an event that enhances protein degradation, several proteins, including the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, have recently been found to be protected from degradation by phosphorylation (33Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1886-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of the Pim kinases by PP2A may therefore target the Pim proteins to proteasomal degradation. To determine whether the phosphorylation status of the Pim kinases has a direct effect on their stability, the half-lives of wild-type and kinase-inactive Pim-3 protein, which has very weak autophosphorylation activity in vitro (Fig. 2, lane 1), were examined. In cycloheximide time course experiments, wild-type and kinase-inactive Pim-3 protein had similar half-lives (data not shown). This implies that phosphorylation of the Pim kinases and, by extension, dephosphorylation of the Pim kinases by PP2A, does not have a direct effect on the stability of the Pim kinases. However, the Pim kinases could be stabilized in vivo by phosphorylation at the same or other sites than those that undergo autophosphorylation, and these phosphorylation events could affect the stability of endogenous Pim kinases. Alternatively, the regulation of the stability of the Pim kinases by PP2A may not be a direct consequence of Pim dephosphorylation by PP2A but may instead be an indirect result of PP2A regulating the phosphorylation state and/or function of other cellular proteins that regulate Pim protein stability. One gene that may be involved in the PP2A-mediated targeting of the Pim kinases for degradation is SOCS-1. As well as being a JAK kinase inhibitor, SOCS-1 has also been identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene. SOCS-1 targets TEL-JAK2, an oncogenic form of JAK (29Frantsve J. Schwaller J.

This targeting is thought to involve the association of the SOCS box with elongin B and elongin C, homologues of components of the ubiquitination pathway (34Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L.

The observations that SOCS-1 binds the Pim kinases (7Chen X.P. Losman J.A. Cowan S. Donahue E. Fay S. Vuong B.Q. Nawijn M.C. Capece D. Cohan V.L. Rothman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and that SOCS-1 is required for the PP2A-mediated decrease in steady-state levels of Pim-1 and Pim-3 in 293T cells, suggest that SOCS-1 acts as an adapter between the Pim kinases and the ubiquitination pathway. Inhibition of the proteasome by LLnL enhances the stability of the Pim kinases in 293T cells (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the proteasome has been found to be phosphorylated, and phosphorylation of subunits of the proteasome is thought to be involved in the regulation of the assembly of proteasome complexes and the function of the proteasome (36Umeda M. Manabe Y. Uchimiya H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Etlinger J.D. Li S.X. Guo G.G. Li N.

PP2A may therefore regulate phosphorylation of the proteasome, or of proteasome-associated factors, thereby modulating the activity of the complex. As the stability of Pim-1 is known to be enhanced in several Pim-1-expressing tumor lines (22Saris C.J. Domen J. Berns A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23Liang H. Hittelman W. Nagarajan L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), this raises the possibility that dysregulation of PP2A contributes to pim-mediated transformation. The observation that inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid results in the stabilization of endogenous Pim-1 protein in primary cells suggests that PP2A plays a role in vivo in the regulation of Pim protein stability. Okadaic acid has been shown to preferentially inhibit PP2A at the low concentration used in these experiments, and at this concentration, okadaic acid does not inhibit the other major serine-threonine phosphatases PP1, PP2B/calcineurin, and PP2C (32Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). This does not rule out, however, that other less well characterized serine-threonine phosphatases, some of which share greater sequence similarities with PP2A than do PP1, PP2B, and PP2C, may also be inhibited under these conditions. The stabilization of Pim-1 in primary cells by okadaic acid treatment may therefore result from the inhibition of other cellular phosphatases than just PP2A. However, the observation that increasing cellular PP2A activity by overexpression of PP2A decreases the levels of expression of Pim-1 and Pim-3 in 293T cells, whereas decreased cellular PP2A activity, as a result of okadaic acid treatment, stabilizes the Pim-1 protein in primary cells, strongly implicates PP2A in the modulation of the stability and expression of the Pim kinases. In conclusion, regulation of Pim protein stability is an important site of regulation of Pim kinase function, and disruption of that regulation may be an important mechanism by which the Pim kinases lead to transformation. Mutations in the various genes involved in the PP2A-mediated regulation of Pim protein stability may potentially contribute to Pim-induced tumor formation.

Despite the fact that type VI collagen is a heterotrimer composed of α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains, the formation of dimers is determined principally by interactions of the α2(VI) chain. Key components of this interaction are the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif of the α2C2 A-domain and the GER sequence in the helical domain of another α2(VI) chain. Replacement of the α2(VI) C2 domain with the α3(VI) domain abolished dimer formation, whereas alterations in the α2(VI) C1 domain did not disrupt dimer formation. When the helical sequences were investigated, replacement of the α2(VI) sequence GSPGERGDQ with the α3(VI) sequence GEKGERGDV abolished dimer formation. Mutating the Pro-108 to a Lys-108 in this α2(VI) sequence did not influence dimer formation and suggests that, unlike the integrin I-domain/triple-helix interaction, hydroxyproline is not required in collagen VI A-domain/helix interaction. These results demonstrate that the α2(VI) chain position in the assembled triple-helical molecule is critical for antiparallel dimer formation and identify the interacting collagenous and MIDAS sequences involved.

These interactions underpin the subsequent assembly of type VI collagen. metal ion-dependent adhesion site Type VI collagen has a ubiquitous distribution throughout connective tissues, and it is thought to link cells and other matrix components. It has three different chains, α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI), each containing a short triple-helical region and globular extensions at NH2 and COOH termini (1Chu M.-L. Pan T.-C. Conway D. Kuo H.-J.

Mayer U. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast to most other collagens, type VI collagen undergoes some polymerization prior to secretion. Heterotrimeric association of the α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains constitutes a monomer with a short triple-helical region (100 nm) encompassed by NH2- and COOH-terminal globular regions (3Engel J. Furthmayr H. Odermatt E. von der Mark H. Aumailley M. Fleischmajer R. Timpl R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 460: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Dimers are assembled by a staggered antiparallel alignment of two disulfide bonded monomers, resulting in a 75-nm overlap between the two triple helices and alignment of the COOH-terminal globular region of one molecule with the helical domain of the other. In dimers, the triple-helical regions become supercoiled in a left-handed superhelix of pitch 37.5 nm (4Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 5Knupp C. Squire J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Dimers then align with their ends in register to form tetramers, which are the secreted form. Tetramers then align end-to-end in the extracellular space to form type VI collagen microfibrils (4Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E. Engel J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The majority of the type VI collagen globular regions comprise domains that have homology to von Willebrand factor A-domains (6Sadler J.E. Shelton-Inloes B.B. Sorace J.M. Harlan J.M. Titani K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A-domains are found in a number of proteins, including integrins (designated αI-domains) and several collagens, and appear to act as homologous adhesion domains. The crystal structures of several αI-domains reveal a Rossman-type fold, with a six-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by seven amphipathic α-helices (7Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Side chains from three loops closely opposed on the upper surface of the domain coordinate a Mg2+ or Mn2+ ion, to form a three-dimensional metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS),1 which is conserved in all αI-domains. Loop 1 contains a contiguous DXSXS sequence, where D is aspartate,X is any amino acid, and S is serine; loop 2 contains a threonine residue, while loop 3 contains an aspartate residue, located ∼70 and 100 residues from the DXSXS sequence, respectively. Mutation of individual MIDAS residues disrupts metal binding and significantly reduces or eliminates ligand binding activity (8Michishita M. Videm V.

Consideration of the staggered antiparallel alignment of type VI collagen monomers in dimers suggests that a C2 domain of one monomer interacts with the helical domain of another type VI collagen molecule. In type VI collagen, a MIDAS motif is found in C1 and C2 of α1 and α2 chains, but not α3(VI).

A reaction mixture consisted of α-chain clone (10 ng), two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation (125 ng), 200 μm dNTPs, 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase, and reaction buffer to a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 s at 95 °C, immediately followed by 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 12 min 30 s at 68 °C for 18 cycles, cooled to 4 °C, then 10 units of DpnI restriction enzyme added and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Mutated DNA was transformed into Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue competent cells, then colonies containing the correct mutation were identified by dye-terminator automated sequencing.

Atomic models for the interaction of a collagen triple helix with α2(VI) C2 domain were built based on the crystal structure coordinates of the complex between the A-domain of α2β1 integrin and a collagen peptide containing the GFOGER sequence (14Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). First, a homology model for α2(VI) C2 was built based on the alignment of its sequence to both von Willebrand factor A-domain (27Ball S.G. Baldock C. Kielty C.M. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7422-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the αA-domain of α2β1 integrin, using the coordinates of the ligand-bound form of the α2β1 A-domain as reference. The program LOOK (Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA) was used for this homology modeling. Different models for the collagen-α2(VI) C2 interaction were then assembled using collagen triple-helical models with the following sequences: (EAGSOGERGDQGARG)3 from α2(VI), (PRGEKGERGDVGIRG)3 from α3(VI), and a model with sequence ((PKGDOGAFGLKGEKG) (EAGSOGERGDQGARG) (PRGEKGERGDVGIRG)) to represent an α1α2α3 collagen VI heterotrimer (see “Discussion”). A metal ion was always modeled at the MIDAS site, and a few water molecules were also included in the models to complete the metal coordination sites and to account for the water-mediated hydrogen bonds in the collagen triple helices (30Kramer R.Z.

https://openalex.org/W2012405150,"STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are transcription factors downstream of cytokine and growth factor signals. All of the seven different STATs bind to regulatory promoter elements with the common core motif 5'-TTC(N)2-4GAA-3'. A key question is how the different STAT factors recognize ""their"" response elements, that is, what distinguishes for example STAT1 from STAT6 binding sites. In vivo, binding of the different STATs to DNA elements is highly specific and disruption of the genes for the different STAT factors is accompanied with distinct, non-overlaping phenotypical effects. As a first step towards discrimination of target sequences for the various STATs, we determined requirements for binding sites for STAT6. In functional assays, six sequences were identified. These have palindromic extensions of the core motif in common (underlined): 5'-TTTCNNNGAAA-3', 5'-CTTCNNNGAAG-3', 5'-TTTCNNNNGAAA-3', 5'-CTTCNNNNGAAG-3', 5'-TTCCNNGGAA-3' and 5'-TTCANNTGAA-3'. Different approaches and mutational analysis demonstrated the functionality of these sequences and high specific binding to STAT6. (I) These elements mediate transcriptional induction by interleukin-(IL)-4, IL-13, IL-15, and platelet-derived growth factor. (II) When used as ""decoy"" oligonucleotides, they bind STAT6 and disrupt its function in vivo, attenuating (a) STAT6/IL-4-mediated reporter gene transcription and (b) STAT6/IL-4-mediated induction of mu-opioid receptor mRNA of Raji cells."
https://openalex.org/W2147568373,"Congestive heart failure is the common endpoint of various cardiac diseases representing a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in Western countries. Characteristic functional alterations of the failing heart are explained by expressional changes of myocardial regulatory proteins; however, little is known about underlying mechanisms regulating cardiac gene expression in the failing heart. Here, we address the specific role of transcription factor CREM for cardiac function in CREM mutant mice with complete inactivation of the CREM gene. We show that CREM mutant mice display distinct alterations of cardiac function resembling characteristic functional defects of the failing heart. Left ventricular hemodynamic assessment of CREM mutant mice revealed impairment of both cardiac contraction and relaxation in basal state, as well as a decreased responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation. The diminished cardiac contractile performance was associated with a selective down-regulation of beta1-adrenergic receptors and a decreased ventricular expression of SERCA, the Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The cardiac phenotype of CREM mutant mice provides the first evidence that CREM represents an important key regulator of cardiac gene expression, which is essential for normal left ventricular contractile performance and response to beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation."

Like catechol oxidase and the respiratory pigment hemocyanin (Hc), tyrosinase contains a so-called “type-3 copper” active site (1Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). Despite the wide distribution of Ty in nature, from bacteria to man, no crystal structure of the enzyme is available to date. It is current practice to use the crystal structures of other members of the type-3 copper protein family as structural models for Ty. These are the deoxygenated form of Panulirus interruptus Hc (2Volbeda A. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Volbeda A. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol.

Krebs B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1084-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The common structural theme of the type-3 active site in all crystallized proteins is the presence of six conserved histidine ligands that, three by three, co-ordinate the two copper ions through their Nε nitrogens. Despite the lack of a three-dimensional structure this structural theme could also be identified in Streptomyces antibioticus Ty in the oxidized [Cu(II)-Cu(II)] state by paramagnetic 1H NMR (9Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W.J.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In that study, the protein was found to exhibit a well resolved paramagnetic spectrum despite its size (30 kDa), and the protein ligands to the binuclear copper site were identified as six Nε nitrogens. The other common structural feature of type-3 sites is the binding mode of molecular oxygen to the deoxy form [Cu(I)-Cu(I)], which in all cases results in a μ-η2:η2 peroxide-bound dicupric site. The spectroscopic properties typical for the binuclear cupric μ-η2:η2 peroxide complex have been described for the oxygenated forms of all proteins of this family (1Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). The proteins can be distinguished according to their activity. Hcs reversibly bind oxygen under physiological conditions. They exhibit no enzymatic activity except for a very small catecholase activity for Hcs deriving from one of the two phyla in which Hcs have been detected,i.e. the molluscs (10Decker H. Tuczek F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; : 25Google Scholar) (the other one being the arthropods). Catechol oxidases oxidize catechols to o-quinones, but only the Tys can catalyze the monooxygenation of monophenols too-diphenols (catechols) as well as the oxidation of diphenols to o-quinones with molecular oxygen as a co-substrate. Direct structural information on Tys would be helpful for proposing a model for the molecular mechanism of its complex enzymatic activity, but the structural investigation of Tys is hindered by two issues, the very low level of expression of these enzymes in natural systems and their limited accessibility to common spectroscopic techniques. In the present study the first issue was solved by the use of an overexpression system for bacterial Ty from S. antibioticus, which allowed the production of milligram amounts of Ty. The second issue was addressed by the generation of a paramagnetic active site through partial reduction of the met form. The partial reduction of the EPR silent met-Ty to the half-met [Cu(I)-Cu(II)] form has been previously described for Neurospora crassa Ty (11Himmelwright R.S. Eickman N.C. Lubien C.D. Lerch K.

Soc. 1980; 102: 7339-7344Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and on the basis of cw EPR spectroscopy of this derivative and its inhibitor-bound complexes, a reaction mechanism was proposed whereby the hydroxy group of the incoming phenol binds at an axial coordination position of one copper of [Cu(II)-O 22−-Cu(II)] oxy-Ty and subsequently undergoes a Berry-pseudorotation to an equatorial position (12Wilcox D.E. Porras A.G. Hwang Y.T. Lerch K. Winkler M.E. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 4015-4027Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 13Winkler M.E. Lerch K. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 103: 7001-7003Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Later on these proposals were elaborated in light of further experimental evidence. A survey of these models has been recently presented (14Decker H. Dillinger R. Tuczek F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 2000; 39: 1591-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It emerges, however, that questions remain open with regard to the mode of binding of the phenolic substrates to the copper and the sequence of intermediary steps in the enzymatic reaction (14Decker H. Dillinger R. Tuczek F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng. 2000; 39: 1591-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To shed more light on these questions, we have performed cw EPR, pulsed EPR, and hyperfine sublevelcorrelation spectroscopy (HYSCORE) experiments on half-met-tyrosinase from S. antibioticus and on its complexes with three types of competitive inhibitor. The first type is represented by p-nitrophenol, a very poor substrate for the monooxygenase activity of Ty. On the time scale of the sample preparation it forms a stable complex with half-met-Ty. The second type of inhibitor is formed by hydroxyquinones such as kojic acid andl-mimosine. These molecules can be considered intermediate state analogues since they exhibit a structural analogy to the quinone reaction products as well as to the diphenolic substrates while occurring in an oxidation state that is not suitable for reaction. The third type of inhibitor is represented by toluic acid. This is a competitive inhibitor and a substrate analogue in which the carboxylate group, which is conjugated to the aromatic ring, is expected to bind to the cupric center of half-met-Ty. The aim of the present work is to characterize the half-met-Ty form and to explore the electronic and structural differences brought about by binding of the inhibitors. Probes for such structural effects are the hyperfine coupling constants from the non-coordinating histidyl nitrogens of half-met-Ty. These have been obtained from simulations of the electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectra and HYSCORE spectra of half-met-Ty (15van Gastel M. Bubacco L. Groenen E.J.J. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The host for the expression of tyrosinase, S. antibioticus (LMD 86.18), was obtained from the collection of the Kluyver Laboratory of the Delft Technical University, The Netherlands. The plasmid that contains the tyrosinase operon (melC1 andmelC2) and the thiostrepton resistance marker was kindly provided by Prof. E. Katz (16Katz E. Thompson C.J. Hopwood D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 2703-2714PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosinase was purified following the procedure described previously (17Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W.J.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2000; 8: 27-35Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The purified protein was obtained as a mixture of [Cu(II)-OH−-Cu(II)] met-Ty (∼90%), [Cu(II)-O 22−-Cu(II)] oxy-Ty, and [Cu(I)-Cu(I)] deoxy-Ty. After concentration the charge-transfer band at 350 nm, characteristic for the oxy form of the protein (18Jolley R.L. Evans L.H. Makina N. Mason S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 335-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was absent. The met-Ty was divided into aliquots and stored in 18% (w/w) ethylene glycol at −20 °C. The protein concentrations of the solutions used in the EPR experiments were determined by measurement of the optical absorption at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 82.1 mm−1cm−1 (19Jackman M.P. Hajnal A. Lerch K. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The selective reduction of one of the two coppers in the active site was carried out by mixing 1 ml of 0.5 mm met-Ty in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 with NaNO2 and ascorbic acid buffered solutions to a final concentration of 40 mm and 4 mm, respectively (modified from Refs.11Himmelwright R.S. Eickman N.C. Lubien C.D. Lerch K. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 7339-7344Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar and 12Wilcox D.E. Porras A.G. Hwang Y.T. Lerch K. Winkler M.E. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 4015-4027Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The formation of the enzymatically inactive half-met-Ty was followed by monitoring the specific activity of the protein solution with respect to the conversion of DOPA (as described in Ref. 20Lerch K. Ettlinger L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). When no further decrease of activity was detected, the protein solution, which has a pale green color, was purified with a desalting column (Sephadex G-25), which was previously equilibrated with 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. The residual activity was less than 4% of the starting activity indicating less than 4% of the Ty being present in the red, oxy, and met form. The latter forms of Ty are EPR-inactive, anyway. The half-met-Ty solution was then concentrated in an Amicon® ultrafiltration system to a final concentration of 0.7 mm. The complexes of half-met-Ty with inhibitor were obtained by addition of small aliquots of buffered inhibitor solution at a concentration of 20 mm to achieve a final concentration of 2 mm. After addition of the inhibitor, the samples were frozen immediately by immersion in liquid nitrogen. The 95-GHz (W-band) ESE-detected EPR experiment for a frozen solution of half-met-tyrosinase (T = 1.2 K) was performed on a home-built spectrometer described in Ref. 21Disselhorst J.A.J.M. van der Meer H. Poluektov O.G. Schmidt J. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 115: 183-188Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar except for the microwave bridge, which was replaced by a bridge from the Department of Microwave Equipments for Millimeter Waveband ESR Spectroscopy in Donetsk, Ukraine. Microwave pulses of 100 and 150 ns were used, and the time between the microwave pulses was 300 ns. The repetition rate of the pulse sequence was 66 Hz. The 9-GHz (X-band) continuous wave EPR experiments were performed on a Bruker ESP380E EPR spectrometer. The microwave frequency was 9.40 GHz for half-met-Ty, half-met-Ty withl-mimosine, half-met-Ty with toluic acid, and half-met-Ty with kojic acid and 8.95 GHz for half-met-Ty withp-nitrophenol. The modulation field was 0.5 millitesla, and the modulation frequency 100 kHz. To verify that no copper was removed from the active site of the protein by the excess of inhibitors, the cw EPR spectra of a 2-mm CuSO4 solution plus inhibitor at the same concentration as the Ty sample were collected. These bear no resemblance to the spectra presented here for the Ty inhibitor complexes. The ESEEM experiments were performed with a 3-pulse sequence in which the microwave pulses had a length of 16 ns. The microwave frequency was 9.74 GHz for half-met-Ty, 9.75 GHz for half-met-Ty withl-mimosine, and 9.73 GHz for half-met-Ty withp-nitrophenol. The time T between the second and third microwave pulse was scanned, starting at 56 ns and incremented with steps of 8 ns. In total, 2048 data points were acquired. Two series of modulation patterns were recorded. In the first series, in which the time τ between the first and second microwave pulse was fixed at 120 ns for half-met-Ty and 144 ns for half-met-Ty withp-nitrophenol or l-mimosine, the modulation patterns were measured at different magnetic field settings. In the second series the modulation patterns were measured at different τ values and the magnetic field was fixed to the position of maximum absorption in the ESE-detected EPR spectrum (335 millitesla for half-met-tyrosinase, 332.5 millitesla for half-met-tyrosinase withp-nitrophenol, and 337.5 millitesla half-met-tyrosinase withl-mimosine). The background of the modulation patterns was removed by fitting and subsequently subtracting a Gaussian function. No window function was used. The data were zero-filled to 4096 data points and subsequently Fourier-transformed to obtain magnitude ESEEM spectra. The HYSCORE experiments were performed with a π/2-τ-π/2-T2-π-T1-π/2 microwave pulse sequence with π/2 pulses of 16 ns and a π pulse of 24 ns. In a HYSCORE spectrum, cross-peaks from nitrogens are expected at (±νQ, ±νDQ) and (±νDQ, ±νQ), where the first coordinate represents the frequency related to T1 and the second coordinate the frequency related to T2. The symbol νQ corresponds to one of the three quadrupole frequencies of the cancelled MS manifold and the symbol νDQ to the so-called ΔMI = 2 or double-quantum transition of the non-cancelled MS manifold. For half-met-tyrosinase the magnetic field setting was 335 millitesla, for half-met-Ty with nitrophenol it was 332.5 millitesla, and for half-met-Ty with l-mimosine it was 337.5 millitesla. The microwave frequency was the same as for the ESEEM experiments. The time τ between the first and second microwave pulse was fixed at 192 ns. In total 512 × 256 data points were acquired in the T1 and T2 direction, respectively. Starting times of T1 and T2 were 168 and 136 ns, respectively, and the time increments were 16 ns for both. The background of the resulting two-dimensional modulation patterns was subtracted by a quadratic fit first to the slices at fixed T2 and then to the slices at fixed T1. Apodization was performed with a Hamming window function. The data were zero-filled to 1024 × 512 points and transformed into the frequency domain by a two-dimensional Fourier transformation. The spectra are represented as magnitude contour spectra. Simulations of the cw EPR spectra have been carried out with the software EPR (22Neese F. QCPE Bulletin. 15. University of Indiana, Bloomington, IN1995: 5Google Scholar). According to the procedure outlined and discussed in Ref. 23van Gastel M. Coremans J.W.A. Jeuken L.J.C. Canters G.W. Groenen E.J.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 102: 4462-4470Google Scholar, the ESEEM spectra were simulated as follows. The expectation value of the electron spin operator S⃗ was calculated from the Hamiltonian of the electron Zeeman interaction and the copper hyperfine interaction, given by He=βeB⃗0·g⇉·S⃗+SzAzzCuMICuEquation 1 where βe is the Bohr magneton, B⃗0 the magnetic field, g⇉ the g tensor, A zzCu the copper hyperfine interaction along the z principal axis of the g tensor, and M ICu the magnetic quantum number of the nuclear spin of copper. Subsequently, the expectation value was inserted into the nuclear spin Hamiltonian for nitrogen, which consists of the nuclear Zeeman interaction, the nitrogen hyperfine interaction, and the following quadrupole interaction. Hn=−gNβnB⃗0·I⃗+〈S⃗〉α,β·A⇉·I⃗+I⃗·Q⇉·I⃗Equation 2 In this equation gN is the g value of nitrogen, βn the nuclear magneton, A⇉ the hyperfine tensor, and Q⇉ the quadrupole tensor. From the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the nuclear spin Hamiltonian, the contribution of a single nitrogen to the modulation function was calculated according to the formula derived by Mims (24Mims W.B. Peisach J. Davis J.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1977; 66: 5536-5550Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Mims W.B. Peisach J. J. Chem. Phys. 1978; 69: 4921-4929Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These steps were repeated for the nitrogens that contribute to the spectrum, for the values of M ICu, and for the α and the β values of the electron spin using the appropriate product formula (23van Gastel M. Coremans J.W.A. Jeuken L.J.C. Canters G.W. Groenen E.J.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 102: 4462-4470Google Scholar). Finally, to simulate a spectrum of a frozen solution, about 3100 directions of B⃗0 are considered. The decay of the echo and the modulations and the dead time of the spectrometer were taken into account as described in Ref. 23van Gastel M. Coremans J.W.A. Jeuken L.J.C. Canters G.W. Groenen E.J.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 102: 4462-4470Google Scholar with time constants of 400 μs, 4 μs, and 298 ns, respectively. The principal values of the g tensor are called gxx, gyy, and gzz, and the principal axes are calledx, y, and z. For each nitrogen, the quadrupole tensor is specified by principal values Qx′x′, Qy′y′, and Qz′z′ and principal axes x′,y′, and z′, and the hyperfine tensor is specified by principal values Ax“x”, Ay“y”, and Az“z” and principal axes x“, y”, and z“. The principal values of the quadrupole tensor are related to the parameters e2qQ and η that describe the electric field gradient at the nitrogen according to Qx′x′ = e2qQ(η − 1)/4, Qy′y′ = −e2qQ(η + 1)/4 and Qz′z′ = e2qQ/2. The continuous wave EPR spectra at 9 GHz of frozen solutions of S. antibioticushalf-met-tyrosinase and half-met-Ty with the inhibitorsp-nitrophenol, l-mimosine, kojic acid, and toluic acid are presented in Fig. 1. To obtain accurate g values for half-met-Ty, an ESE-detected EPR spectrum was recorded at 95 GHz (Fig. 2), which provided for superior g value resolution. Simulations of the cw EPR spectra are included in Fig. 1, and the g values (gxx, gyy, gzz) and copper hyperfine values (Axx, Ayy, Azz) of the simulations are given in Table I.Figure 2W-band ESE-detected EPR spectrum of half-met-Ty.

Open table in a new tab In the cw EPR spectrum of the half-met-Ty with l-mimosine a superhyperfine interaction in the perpendicular region is present with a splitting of about 40 MHz. The spectra are characterized by large gzz and Azz values, consistent with a singly occupied molecular orbital in the ground state of dx2−y2 or dxy character on copper (26Abragam A. Bleaney B. Electron Paramgnetic Resonance of Transition Metal Ions. Clarendon Press, Oxford1970Google Scholar). For half-met-Ty, the g values obtained from independent simulation of the spectra at 9 and 95 GHz are consistent with those reported previously for the half-met derivative of N. crassaTy (11Himmelwright R.S. Eickman N.C. Lubien C.D. Lerch K. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 7339-7344Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 12Wilcox D.E. Porras A.G. Hwang Y.T. Lerch K. Winkler M.E. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 4015-4027Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The gzz value amounts to 2.298 and the rhombicity ( gyy−gxx ) to 0.018. The spectrum of half-met-Ty with p-nitrophenol is similar to that of half-met-Ty. Only around g = 2.1 do the spectra differ. When l-mimosine binds, the cw EPR spectrum is characterized by larger gzz and Azz values. Superhyperfine structure becomes visible in the gxx/gyy region and on the copper hyperfine band at g = 2.5. For half-met-Ty with kojic acid, the gzz and Azz values become even larger. The complex of half-met-Ty with toluic acid is characterized by the largest gzz and smallest Azz value. It is clear that binding of the inhibitors investigated in this study results in significant changes in EPR parameters. As we are dealing here with competitive inhibitors they must bind at or close to the copper site. However, the fact that nitrophenol can also act as a substrate, albeit a very poor one (45Conrad J.S. Dawso S.R. Hubbard E.R. Meyers T.E. Strothkamp K.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5739-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), is diagnostic of binding to the copper. The only inhibitor/enzyme complex of a type-3 copper protein of which a structure has been reported in the literature is catechol oxidase (8Klabunde T. Eicken C. Sacchettini J.C. Krebs B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1084-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), where the thiourea inhibitor binds directly to the copper site. Other (indirect) structural evidence on the binding mode of inhibitors relates to the release of a water molecule or an OH−moiety from the first coordination shell of the paramagnetic copper in half-met-Ty upon inhibitor binding (23van Gastel M. Coremans J.W.A. Jeuken L.J.C. Canters G.W. Groenen E.J.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 102: 4462-4470Google Scholar), making it likely that the leaving moiety is replaced by an oxygen of the inhibitor. For the met-form of Ty there has also been found direct evidence for coordination to the copper since the contact-shifted NMR signals of the inhibitors have been observed in the 600-MHz NMR spectra of the inhibitor/Ty complexes. 2L. Bubacco and G. W. Canters, unpublished results. Taking all this evidence into account it appears that the simplest way to interpret the present data is to assume that the inhibitors directly bind to the copper. In Fig. 3, three-pulse ESEEM spectra for frozen solutions of half-met-Ty, half-met-Ty withp-nitrophenol, and half-met-Ty with l-mimosine are presented, recorded at the magnetic field of maximum absorption in the ESE-detected EPR spectrum. The ESEEM spectrum of half-met-Ty (Fig.3 a) is characterized by three bands at about 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MHz and a broad and weak band around 4 MHz, typical for a remote (amino) nitrogen of a histidine that ligates to copper (27Mondovi B. Graziani M.T. Mims W.B. Oltzik R. Peisach J. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4189-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An additional band is present at 1.7 MHz. For half-met-Ty withp-nitrophenol (Fig. 3 b), the three bands at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MHz become more pronounced compared with those for half-met-Ty. One band at 1.6 MHz dominates the ESEEM spectrum for half-met-Ty with l-mimosine (see Fig. 3 c). For each of these samples a series of ESEEM spectra were collected for different magnetic field settings and different values of the time τ between the first and second microwave pulses. For half-met-Ty a number of these are shown in Fig. 4. The frequencies of the bands below 2 MHz are almost independent of the value of the magnetic field, but their relative intensities vary. When the value of the time τ is changed, the relative intensities are affected more. For example, at τ = 120 ns or 144 ns, the band at 1.5 MHz dominates, and at τ = 208 ns, this band is weaker than the one at 0.5 MHz. The intensities of the broad bands around 4 MHz also vary. Fig. 5 ashows the HYSCORE spectrum of half-met-Ty, recorded at the field of maximum absorption in the ESE-detected EPR spectrum. On the diagonal, bands are visible at the same frequency as the bands in the corresponding ESEEM spectrum. For example, the three sharp bands appear at (ν1, ν2) = (0.5, 0.5), (1.0, 1.0), and (1.5, 1.5) MHz. Two strong cross-peaks, labeled I and II are visible at (1.7, 3.7) and (3.7, 1.7) MHz. Weak cross-peaks III-VI correlate 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MHz to about 4.8 MHz. The frequencies correlated by the cross-peaks are summarized in TableII. A more resolved pattern is observed in the HYSCORE spectrum of half-met-Ty with p-nitrophenol (Fig. 5 b). Similar to the case of half-met-Ty, the bands on the diagonal correspond to the bands in the ESEEM spectrum. The frequencies of the sharp bands (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 MHz) are connected to about 4.8 MHz by the weak cross-peaks XI-XIII. The peak marked by XVI occurs at the same position as the one marked by I in the spectrum for half-met-Ty, but its intensity is smaller. The HYSCORE spectrum for half-met-Ty with l-mimosine is shown in Fig. 5 c. The spectrum is dominated by cross-peak XVII at (1.6, 4.2) MHz. A cluster of six cross-peaks connects the frequencies 0.4, 1.2, and 1.6 MHz to 3.8 and 4.2 MHz. The frequencies 0.4 and 1.2 MHz are not resolved in the ESEEM spectrum.Table IIFrequencies (MHz) of the cross-peaks in the HYSCORE spectra of half-met-Ty, half-met-Ty with p-nitrophenol and half-met-Ty withl-mimosineHalf-met-TyIII0.64.9V1.04.8I1.63.7VII1.53.9IV0.54.9VI1.54.6II1.73.7Half-met-Ty with p-nitrophenolVIII0.54.7XII1.04.7XIV0.53.8IX1.04.6XIII1.64.8XV1.03.3X1.44.9XVI1.63.7XI0.54.8Half-met-Ty with l-mimosineXVII1.64.1XXI1.14.2XVIII1.63.8XXII0.53.8XVIX1.64.2XXIII0.54.2XX1.13.8XXIV0.54.3 Open table in a new tab The controlled oxidation of only one copper in the binuclear type-3 active site provides a sensitive paramagnetic probe for the investigation of the interaction between the metal ion and substrates or transition state analogue inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2166130989,"The risk of atherosclerosis is intimately related to the heterogeneity of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. The potential relationship between oxidative modification of distinct LDL subspecies and induction of apoptosis in arterial wall cells is indeterminate. The capacity of light LDL3 versus dense LDL5 to induce cytotoxicity in endothelial cells as a function of the degree of copper-mediated oxidation was compared. Mildly oxidized LDL3 (oxLDL3) exerted potent cytotoxicity, which was intimately related to both the degree of oxidation and the oxLDL3 concentration based on either cholesterol content or particle number. In contrast, dense LDL5 particles exerted a minor effect on cell viability. Cells incubated with oxLDL3 exhibited apoptotic features, with cytoplasmic condensation, cell or nuclear fragmentation, and accumulation of DNA fragments. OxLDL3-induced apoptosis involved cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c, with a concomitant increase in caspase-3-like protease activity. OxLDL3 particles were uniquely distinct from oxLDL5 particles in their elevated content of lipid hydroperoxides. Hydroperoxide removal by NaBH4 markedly reduced oxLDL3-induced cytotoxicity, leading to an increase in cell viability. Lipid hydroperoxide content of oxidatively modified LDL subclasses is therefore a major determinant of the induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells. These data are highly relevant to atherogenic hypercholesterolemia, in which the LDL phenotype is dominated by elevated concentrations of light LDL3."
https://openalex.org/W2128782481,"The use of xenogeneic cells or tissues for tissue engineering applications may lead to advances in biomedical research. Hyperacute and delayed rejection are immunologic hurdles that must be addressed to achieve xenograft survival in the pig-to-primate setting. Expression of human alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase (HT) in the donor cell or tissue protects from hyperacute rejection (HAR) by reducing expression of Galalpha1,3-Gal epitope, the major xenoantigen recognized by human natural antibodies. We hypothesized that Galalpha1,3-Gal antigen contributes to delayed tissue rejection. To test this hypothesis, we transplanted control or HT-transgenic engineered porcine cartilage s.c. into alpha1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout (Gal KO) mice. Control porcine cartilage grafted in Gal KO mice was not susceptible to HAR but was rejected in several wk by a prominent cellular immune infiltrate and elevated antibody titers. In contrast, Gal KO mice receiving the HT engineered cartilage showed a markedly reduced anti-pig antibody response and no anti-Galalpha1,3-Gal-elicited antibody response. The HT implants had a mild cellular infiltrate that was confined to the graft periphery. Our study demonstrates that a marked reduction of Galalpha1,3-Gal antigen in HT-transgenic porcine cartilage confers resistance to a process of delayed rejection. Further development of tissue engineering applications that use genetically modified porcine tissues is encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W2139532812,"Biological and genetic cell heterogeneity is a landmark of most colorectal cancers and provides a frame for tumor progression as an evolutional process. Classical models have hypothesized that increased genetic instability may contribute to modulating and shaping malignant transformation. This is true for the small subset of colorectal cancers displaying microsatellite instability. For the rest of colorectal tumors, numerical and/or structural chromosomal alterations are the most prominent outcome of genetic disruption. These observations have prompted some investigators to hypothesize about the presence of chromosomal instability in these cells. To characterize chromosomal instability in cancer cells, we have analyzed genetic clonal divergence in three colorectal cancer cell lines considered to be archetypes in cancer research (HCT116, LoVo, and SW480). A dynamic setting was designed to allow the calculation of mutation rates. Comprehensive analyses at the chromosomal level revealed distinctive patterns of genetic divergence. Aneuploid SW480 cells displayed high rates of structural alterations (>100-fold) as compared with near diploid LoVo cells. Numerical alterations also occurred more frequently in SW480 cells but at low rates as compared with rearrangements in the chromosomically unstable SW480 cells. These results strengthen the role of structural instability in the generation of genetic heterogeneity in colorectal cancer."

A recent study showed that apoA-I−/− HDL binds to SR-BI with the same affinity as apoA-I+/+ HDL, butapoA-I−/− HDL has a decreasedV max for CE transfer from the HDL particle to adrenal cells. The present study was designed to determine the basis for the reduced selective uptake of CE fromapoA-I−/− HDL. Variations inapoA-I−/− HDL particle diameter, free cholesterol or phospholipid content, or the apoE or apoA-II content ofapoA-I−/− HDL had little effect on HDL CE selective uptake into Y1-BS1 adrenal cells. Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase treatment alone or addition of apoA-I toapoA-I−/− HDL alone also had little effect. However, addition of apoA-I to apoA-I−/− HDL in the presence of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase reorganized the large heterogeneous apoA-I−/− HDL to a more discrete particle with enhanced CE selective uptake activity. These results show a unique role for apoA-I in HDL CE selective uptake that is distinct from its role as a ligand for HDL binding to SR-BI. These data suggest that the conformation of apoA-I at the HDL surface is important for the efficient transfer of CE to the cell.

It is well established that the risk of developing coronary heart disease is inversely proportional to plasma HDL 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; apo, apolipoprotein; LCAT, lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B, type I; CE, cholesteryl ester; FC, free cholesterol; PL, phospholipid; NDGGE, nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PBS-E, NaCl, potassium phosphate, and EDTA; COE, cholesteryl oleoyl ether; DLT, dilactitol tyramine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TC, total cholesterol cholesterol levels (1Castelli W.P.

Decreased levels of apoA-I, the major protein of HDL, are also associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease (2Miller N.E. Am. Heart J. 1987; 113: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The most widely accepted model explaining the anti-atherogenic properties of apoA-I is reverse cholesterol transport (3Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this process, poorly lipidated apoA-I first removes excess free cholesterol (FC) from peripheral cells through a mechanism dependent on ABCA1 (4Oram J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The apoA-I then acts as a co-factor for LCAT, which transforms the FC to cholesteryl ester (CE). This event initiates the conversion of the poorly lipidated apoA-I to a spherical HDL particle. After remodeling by plasma enzymes including cholesteryl ester transfer protein, hepatic lipase, and phospholipid transfer protein, the HDL finally delivers its CE either to the liver, where it can be excreted or repackaged into new lipoproteins, or to ovaries, testes, and adrenal glands, where it can be used in the production of steroid hormones. ApoA-I has a number of important roles in HDL metabolism including activation of LCAT, determination of plasma HDL cholesterol levels, and interaction with the ABCA1 transporter and the HDL receptor, SR-BI. Mice deficient in apoA-I have a 70% reduction in total plasma cholesterol and HDL cholesterol (5Li H. Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 349-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a severe depletion of cholesteryl ester stores in steroidogenic tissues (9Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In these animals, the cortical cells of the adrenal gland, the luteal and interstitial cells of the ovary, and the Leydig cells of the testis all display diminished CE content, indicating that apoA-I is important for the SR-BI-mediated HDL CE selective uptake process (10Glass C.

Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This deficiency appears to be directly attributable to the absence of apoA-I because apoA-II-deficient mice have a similar reduction in HDL cholesterol but do not show reduced CE reserves in their adrenals, ovaries, and testes (9Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In a recent study we addressed the role of apoA-I in HDL CE selective uptake by analyzing the structural, chemical, and functional properties of apoA-I+/+ andapoA-I−/− HDL. Compared with theapoA-I+/+ HDL, apoA-I−/− particles were larger, more heterogeneous in size, and enriched in apoA-II, apoCs, apoE, FC, and CE (12Temel R.E. Walzem R.L. Banka C.L. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Compared withapoA-I+/+ HDL, CE selective uptake fromapoA-I−/− HDL was significantly reduced into Y1-BS1 adrenal cells and Fu5AH hepatoma cells, which naturally express SR-BI, and into ldlA[SR-BI] cells, a Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing SR-BI from a transfected cDNA. In Y1-BS1 and ldlA[SR-BI] cells, the reduction in HDL CE selective uptake was attributed to a reduced V max for CE transfer to the cell. Interestingly, in both cell types,apoA-I−/− HDL showed a lowerK D for HDL cell association, indicating that the absence of apoA-I did not reduce the affinity of HDL for SR-BI. These findings illustrate that HDL properties necessary for HDL binding to SR-BI are distinct from those properties necessary for the transfer of HDL CE to the cell membrane. Additionally, theV max for endocytic uptake and degradation of HDL did not differ betweenapoA-I+/+ and apoA-I−/−HDL in either cell type. Thus, the absence of apoA-I on HDL particles selectively affected the SR-BI-mediated HDL CE selective uptake pathway. In the current report we have explored the basis for the reduced selective uptake of CE from apoA-I−/− HDL. Variation in HDL particle size, cholesterol to phospholipid ratios, and apolipoprotein compositions had little effect on HDL CE selective uptake into Y1-BS1 adrenal cells. Addition of apoA-I toapoA-I−/− HDL also had little effect. However, addition of apoA-I to apoA-I−/− HDL in the presence of LCAT reorganized HDL structure and produced an HDL particle with enhanced CE selective uptake activity. These data suggest that the conformation of apoA-I at the HDL surface is important for the efficient transfer of CE to the cell. The following reagents used for culturing Y1-BS1 cells were purchased from the listed vendors: poly-d-lysine (Becton Dickinson), heat-denatured fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 100× penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen), six-well plates (Costar), Cortrosyn (Organon), Ham's F-10 medium, and heat-denatured horse serum (Sigma). Sodium[125I]iodide and [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether were acquired from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. apoA-I−/−C57BL/6J-Apoa1tm1Unc (6Williamson R. Lee D.

Housing and experimental procedures were approved by the State University of New York at Stony Brook Committee on Laboratory Animal Resources and the Scripps Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. After an overnight fast, mice were anesthetized and exsanguinated by heart puncture, and blood cells were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. If not used immediately, plasma was frozen at −80 °C after adding sucrose to a final concentration of 10%. Plasma was adjusted to 0.05% NaN3, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA, and lipoproteins in the 1.02–1.21 g/ml density range were isolated by sequential density ultracentrifugation at 1.02 and 1.21 g/ml, respectively. Following dialysis against PBS-E (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), lipoproteins were overlaid with argon and stored at 4 °C. Where specified,d 1.02–1.21 g/ml lipoproteins were fractionated on a Superose 6 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) to obtainapoA-I+/+ and apoA-I−/−HDL as described (12Temel R.E. Walzem R.L. Banka C.L. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins were examined by separating 7.5 μg of protein on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and visualizing the proteins with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Total cholesterol, free cholesterol, and phospholipid concentrations were measured using commercially available enzymatic kits (Wako). A modified Lowry assay using horse IgG as a standard (Pierce) was employed to determine HDL protein concentration (13Markwell M.A. Hass S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). HDL was double radiolabeled with [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether ([3H]COE) and [125I]dilactitol tyramine ([125I]DLT) (14Azhar S. Stewart D. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1799-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield specific activities of 4–20 cpm/ng of protein for [3H] and 90–200 cpm/ng of protein for [125I] as described (12Temel R.E. Walzem R.L. Banka C.L. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HDL was analyzed by nondenaturing 4–25% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis followed by staining with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (12Temel R.E. Walzem R.L. Banka C.L. Williams D.L. J.

Alternatively, HDL apolipoproteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) run at 100 V for 90 min. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dried milk in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either rabbit anti-mouse apoA-I (Biodesign) or rabbit anti-mouse apoE antiserum (15Thorngate F.E. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Williams D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

The blot was washed with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20, probed with 1:10,000 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by exposing X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) to the membrane, which had been treated with SuperSignal-West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Lipid-free mouse apoA-I was isolated with a modification of a previously published protocol (16Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 750: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HDL (1.063–1.21 g/ml) was isolated fromapoA-I+/+ FVB/N mouse plasma using sequential density ultracentrifugation. Following dialysis against PBS-E, HDL was incubated in 3 m guanidine HCl for 2 h at 37 °C, dialyzed against PBS-E, and subjected to ultracentrifugation (39,000 rpm, 19 h, 15 °C) at d = 1.21 g/ml in a SW60 Ti rotor. HDL remnants (d < 1.21 g/ml) were separated from the lipid-free apoA-I (d > 1.21) using a tube slicer. ApoA-I was dialyzed against PBS-E and stored under argon at 4 °C. Because of the tendency of the protein to form multimers at concentrations above 1 mg/ml, the apoA-I was not concentrated after the final dialysis step (17Gong E.L. Tan C.S. Shoukry M.I. Rubin E.M. Nichols A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins (1.02–1.21 g/ml) radiolabeled with [3H]COE were separated using a Superose 6 column run at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Following the initial injection of the sample, fractions were collected from 33–35.6, 35.6–37, and 37–40 min for apoA-I+/+ HDL and from 31–33.3, 33.3–35.3, and 35.3–40 min forapoA-I−/− HDL. Each fraction (10 μg of total cholesterol) was analyzed on a nondenaturing 4–25% polyacrylamide gradient gel as described above. The HDL apolipoproteins were then visualized using 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. After concentrating the HDL fractions using a Centricon 50 (Millipore), HDL apolipoproteins were radiolabeled using [125I]DLT as described above. Using 12% SDS-PAGE, the apolipoprotein complement of the [3H]COE-[125I]DLT HDL was analyzed by separating an equal number of [125I] counts from each fraction. Following fixation of the gel with 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, the [125I]DLT-labeled apolipoproteins were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (AmershamBiosciences). Plasma was isolated from FVB/N mice as described above and subjected to ultracentrifugation (39,000 rpm, 24 h, 15 °C) atd = 1.21 g/ml in a SW41 Ti rotor. The d> 1.21 fraction was washed by ultracentrifugation (39,000 rpm, 24 h, 15 °C) at d = 1.21 g/ml and dialyzed against PBS-E supplemented with 0.02% NaN3. [3H] COE apoA-I+/+ andapoA-I−/− HDL (1.5 mg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h in 5.5 ml of PBS-E containing 50% by volume d > 1.21 g/ml plasma or d > 1.21 g/ml plasma plus 0.3 mg/ml lipid-free apoA-I, respectively. For controls, HDL (1.5 mg of protein) was incubated under similar conditions in PBS-E alone. The density of the samples was adjusted to 1.21 g/ml with KBr, and HDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation (39,000 rpm, 19 h, 15 °C) in a SW41 Ti rotor. The HDL was dialyzed against PBS-E, and apolipoproteins were radiolabeled using [125I]DLT as described above. Recombinant human LCAT was purified as previously described and stored at −70 °C in 50 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol (18Chisholm J.W. Gebre A.K. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1512-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LCAT in the presence of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA; Intergen) was concentrated at 4 °C using an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device with a 50,000 M r cut-off (Millipore). The final concentrations of the LCAT and the BSA were 1.1–1.4 × 105 units (nmol of CE formed/h/μg of enzyme)/ml and 60 mg/ml, respectively. [3H]COEapoA-I−/− HDL (1.2 mg of protein) was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in 2.3 ml of reaction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% NaN3, 5 mmimidazole, 1% glycerol, pH 7.4) containing 12,000 LCAT units/ml plus or minus 0.45 mg/ml lipid-free apoA-I. For controls, [3H]COE apoA-I+/+ andapoA-I−/− HDL (1.2 mg of protein) were incubated under the same conditions in reaction buffer supplemented with 6 mg/ml BSA. The sample was adjusted to 1.21 g/ml with KBr, and HDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation (39,000 rpm, 19 h, 15 °C) in a SW60 Ti rotor. Following dialysis against PBS-E, HDL were then radiolabeled using [125I]DLT as described above. Using particles that were only [3H]COE-radiolabeled, the total cholesterol concentrations of the HDL samples were determined using the Cholesterol CII enzymatic assay (Wako). An equal amount of each sample was analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (5 μg of total cholesterol) and nondenaturing 4–25% polyacrylamide gradient gels (5 and 10 μg of total cholesterol) as described above. Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or evaluated by Western blot analysis as described above. Similar conditions were used to modify and analyze other HDL particles with the following exceptions. For one study, the [3H]COE apoA-I−/− HDL were incubated with 0.45 mg/ml lipid-free apoA-I in the absence or presence of 12,000 LCAT units/ml. Y1-BS1 cells were maintained in a 37 °C humidified 95% air, 5% CO2atmosphere in Ham's F-10 complete medium (12.5% heat-denatured horse serum, 2.5% heat-denatured fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). For experiments, the cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well into six-well plates, which had been treated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine. After 48 h, medium was replaced with Ham's F-10 complete medium plus 100 nmCortrosyn, a 1–24ACTH synthetic analogue. All studies were conducted following a 24-h exposure to ACTH. After being seeded and treated as listed above, Y1-BS1 cells were washed and the medium replaced with serum-free Ham's F-10 medium. [3H]COE-[125I]DLTapoA-I+/+ or apoA-I−/−HDL was added to the final concentration specified in the figure legends. Following a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4; one time with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; lysed with 1.25 ml of 0.1n NaOH; and passed five times through a 28.5-gauge needle. The lysate was then processed to determine trichloroacetic acid-soluble and -insoluble 125I radioactivity and organic solvent-extractable 3H radioactivity as described (14Azhar S. Stewart D. Reaven E. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1799-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Azhar S. Tsai L. Reaven E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1047: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble 125I radioactivity represents cell-associated HDL apolipoprotein that is the sum of cell surface-bound apolipoprotein and endocytosed apolipoprotein that is not yet degraded. Trichloroacetic acid-soluble 125I radioactivity represents endocytosed and degraded apolipoprotein that is trapped in lysosomes as a result of the dilactitol tyramine label (14Azhar S. Stewart D.

Chem. 1983; 258: 7161-7167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sum of the 125I-degraded and125I-cell-associated undegraded apolipoprotein expressed as CE equivalents was subtracted from the CE measured as extractable3H radioactivity to give the selective uptake of HDL-CE (14Azhar S.

Previous studies with reconstituted or modified HDL suggest that specific apolipoproteins, particularly apoA-II and apoE, may alter the efficiency of SR-BI-mediated HDL CE selective uptake. However, there is no clear consensus in the literature as to whether these proteins have inhibitory or stimulatory effects (21Richard B.M. Pittman R.C. J.

To compareapoA-I−/− HDL with different apoA-II and apoE contents, HDL were isolated from mice on FVB/N or C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds. Previous studies showed thatapoA-I−/−HDL from C57BL/6 mice are enriched in apoE (5Li H. Reddick R.L. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Plump A.S. Azrolan N. Odaka H. Wu L. Jiang X. Tall A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1033-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we noted that HDL from FVB/N mice are enriched in apoA-II. The SDS-PAGE analysis in Fig. 1 A shows the relative enrichment of FVB/N apoA-I−/− HDL in apoA-II in comparison to the enrichment of C57BL/6apoA-I−/− HDL in apoE. Each of these HDLs along with the respective apoA-I+/+ HDLs were labeled with [3H]COE and [125I]DLT and tested in a standard selective uptake assay using ACTH-treated Y1-BS1 adrenocortical cells in which HDL CE selective uptake is primarily the result of SR-BI (26Temel R.E. Trigatti B. DeMattos R.B. Azhar S. Krieger M. Williams D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13600-13605Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Comparing particles isolated from mice of the same genetic strain, ∼2-fold more selective CE uptake was observed from apoA-I+/+ than fromapoA-I−/− HDL (Fig. 1 D). Additionally, HDL CE selective uptake was similar when comparingapoA-I−/− HDL of both strains. This result indicates that apoA-I−/− HDL, regardless of its apoA-II or apoE content, is less efficient than wild type HDL at selectively transferring its CE to the Y1-BS1 cells. Interestingly, the Y1-BS1 cells displayed similar HDL-CE cell association and degradation of the different particles with the exception of the C57BL/6apoA-I−/− HDL (Fig. 1, B andC). The 2-fold increase in these parameters for the C57BL/6apoA-I−/− HDL is likely a result of this apoE-rich HDL being bound and internalized by proteoglycans or members of the LDL receptor family (27Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, differences in the apoA-II and apoE content of the apoA-I−/− HDL did not alter the ability of the Y1-BS1 cells to internalize CE via SR-BI-dependent selective uptake. Several studies have shown that HDL particle size affects the ability of cells to selectively internalize HDL-CE (28Pittman R.C. Glass C.K. Atkinson D. Small D.M. J. Biol.

Analysis by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that the HDL was separated into fractions with different mean particle diameters (Fig. 2 B). Following radiolabeling of the HDL with [125I]DLT, the apolipoprotein complement of each fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 C). As observed previously (12Temel R.E. Walzem R.L. Banka C.L. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), apoA-II was enriched on smaller particles and apoE on larger particles of apoA-I−/− HDL. The functional properties of the size-fractionated HDL were tested on ACTH-treated Y1-BS1 cells. Although the two types of unfractionated particles were bound and degraded to similar extents (Fig. 3, A and B, T columns), more selective CE uptake was seen withapoA-I+/+ compared with theapoA-I−/− total HDL fraction (Fig. 3 C, T columns)). In contrast, cell association and degradation of the fractionated particles increased in proportion to their diameter for both apoA-I+/+ andapoA-I−/− HDL (Fig. 3, A andB). These differences among the size-fractionated particles likely reflect the larger, apoE-rich HDL interacting with LDL receptor family members or proteoglycans. In contrast, little difference was seen for HDL CE selective uptake among the size-fractionated particles for either apoA-I+/+ orapoA-I−/− HDL (Fig. 3 C). Additionally, more selective CE uptake was seen fromapoA-I+/+ thanapoA-I−/− HDL when particles of similar diameter were compared. For instance, the Y1-BS1 cells selectively internalized more HDL CE from apoA-I+/+ fraction 2 than from the similar sized apoA-I−/−fraction 3. Similar results were obtained with size-fractionated particles from two independent HDL preparations. Several conclusions can be drawn. First, size subpopulations within theapoA-I+/+ and apoA-I−/−HDL do not differentially transfer CE to the Y1-BS1 cells by selective uptake. Second, in agreement with the experiments comparing FVB/N and C57BL/6 apoA-I−/− HDL (Fig. 1), selective CE uptake from apoA-I−/− HDL is not significantly affected by the apoA-II and apoE content. Third, the larger size and heterogeneity of apoA-I−/− HDL are not responsible for the diminished SR-BI-mediated selective CE uptake. In a previous analysis, we noted that apoA-I−/− HDL has a significantly higher FC content than apoA-I+/+HDL, a factor that may reduce the fluidity of the PL monolayer and hinder SR-BI-mediated transfer of CE from the HDL core (12Temel R.E. Walzem R.L. Banka C.L. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test the importance of the HDL FC content for CE selective uptake, [3H]COE apoA-I−/− HDL was incubated with apoA-I+/+ d > 1.21 g/ml plasma, which acted as a source of LCAT, and lipid-free mouse apoA-I. Radiolabeled apoA-I+/+ HDL was treated in a similar fashion but without the addition of apoA-I. Incubation with d > 1.21 g/ml plasma resulted in significant reductions in the FC content of both apoA-I+/+and apoA-I−/− HDL (Table I). In addition, apoA-I associated with the apoA-I−/− particles (data not shown). After radiolabeling with [125I]DLT, the HDL were incubated with ACTH-treated Y1-BS1 cells. The selective CE uptake from the particles exposed to the d > 1.21 g/ml plasma was significantly increased compared with their respective mock-treated controls (Table I). This result suggested that the high FC content of the apoA-I−/− HDL may impede selective transfer of CE to Y1-BS1 cells. However, the functional properties of the apoA-I−/− HDL may also may have been altered by the acquisition of apoA-I or modification by enzymes other than LCAT in the d > 1.21 g/ml plasma.Table IImpact of d > 1.21 g/ml mouse plasma on apoA-I+/+ and apoA-I−/− HDLHDLTreatmentFC/PTSelective CE uptakeng HDL-CE/mg cell proteinapoA-I+/+Mock0.1241170 ± 33apoA-I+/+d > 1.21 g/ml0.0581410 ± 531-ap < 0.01 compared to respective mock control.apoA-I−/−Mock0.27432 ± 68apoA-I−/−d > 1.21 g/ml + apoA-I0.185871 ± 331-ap < 0.01 compared to respective mock control.ACTH-treated Y1-BS1 cells were incubated with 25 μg of CE/ml of [3H]COE-[125I]DLT apoA-I +/+ andapoA-I −/− HDL for 4 h at 37 °C, and the amount of selective CE uptake was determined as"
https://openalex.org/W2101927159,"Organogenesis proceeds rapidly and faithfully during fetal development. The process includes generation of parenchyma, followed by organization into functional tissues. The method by which the growth of organ parenchyma is regulated is not known, but insight into this regulation has been obtained by studying mosaic tissues of experimental chimeras and transgenic mosaics. The patterns revealed by this procedure offer an indication of how the parenchyma was generated. In the liver, the pattern appears as islands of one cell type in a sea of the other cell type, while in the adrenal cortex the pattern is one of alternating cords of one cell type adjacent to the other cell type. We have established previously that mosaic patches in the liver are fractal. The fractal dimensions of patches in the liver are consistent with an iterative, recursive growth model with simple stereotypical division rules. Here we report that the patches in mosaic adrenal cortex of the mouse and rat are also fractal and that the fractal dimension of the surface of the patches is lower than that in the liver. Fetal development and fractal dimensions of adrenal cortical mosaic patches are consistent with an algorithmic cell division model in which parenchymal growth is constrained to edges of growth centers forcing cord structures to form. Fractal analysis of the geometry of mosaic patches in tissues of experimental chimeras is helpful in constructing hypotheses of organ growth."
https://openalex.org/W1997572170,"Streptococcal pyrogenic enterotoxin C (Spe-C) is a superantigen virulence factor produced byStreptococcus pyogenes that activates T-cells polyclonally. The biologically active form of Spe-C is thought to be a homodimer containing an essential zinc coordination site on each subunit, consisting of the residues His167, His201, and Asp203. Crystallographic data suggested that receptor specificity is dependent on contacts between the zinc coordination site of Spe-C and the β-chain of the major histocompatibility complex type II (MHCII) molecule. Our results indicate that only a minor fraction of dimer is present at T-cell stimulatory concentrations of Spe-C following mutation of the unpaired side chain of cysteine at residue 27 to serine. Mutations of amino acid residues His167, His201, or Asp203had only minor effects on protein stability but resulted in greatly diminished MHCII binding, as measured by surface plasmon resonance with isolated receptor/ligand pairs and flow cytometry with MHCII-expressing cells. However, with the exception of the mutants D203A and D203N, mutation of the zinc-binding site of Spe-C did not significantly impact T-cell activation. The mutation Y76A, located in a polar pocket conserved among most superantigens, resulted in significant loss of T-cell stimulation, although no effect was observed on the overall binding to human MHCII molecules, perhaps because of the masking of this lower affinity interaction by the dominant zinc-dependent binding. To a lesser extent, mutations of side chains found in a second conserved MHCII α-chain-binding site consisting of a hydrophobic surface loop decreased T-cell stimulation.

Together with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), SEC, toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST), and several others, Spe-C belongs to the superantigen protein family. Superantigens help pathogenic bacteria colonize the host by binding to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) and T-cell receptors (TCR), thus bypassing the normal signal transduction pathway essential for immune recognition. In addition, the resulting nonspecific stimulation of the host's T-cells can induce pathological levels of cytokines. There is a substantial amount of structural data available for the superantigens, both free and in complex with their TCR and MHCII receptors (1Li H. Llera A. Malchiodi E.L. Mariuzza R. Annu. Rev.

Forsberg G. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Walse B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3306-3312Google Scholar). The superantigen fold is highly conserved despite low overall sequence similarity among protein family members. Superantigen-binding sites are found on the β-chain or on the α-chain of the MHCII receptor. The β-chain-binding site requires zinc to form a complex with the superantigen through a conserved His from MHCII and three His or Asp residues from the superantigen. The absence of zinc in certain superantigens, such as SEB, presumably precludes β-chain binding. The α-chain-binding site requires a structurally conserved positioning of a hydrophobic binding loop contributed by the superantigen, and usually a second polar binding pocket is also engaged. For the case of Spe-C, the α-chain binding loop is displaced, and the potential α-chain-binding site, if the Spe-C were to bind MHCII as a monomer, may be hidden in the interface of the zinc-dependent superantigen dimer (2Roussel A. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 635-643Google Scholar), hypothetically resulting in interaction only with the MHCII β-chain. The β-chain binding residues are conserved in Spe-C and other streptococcal superantigens, and the β-chain-binding site (3Li Y. Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Google Scholar, 4Arcus V.L. Proft T. Sigrell J.A. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 157-168Google Scholar) is intact in crystallographic models in which this interaction site with MHCII critically involves zinc. Zinc was implicated in streptococcal superantigen binding to MHCII on the surface of cells (7Li P.-L. Tiedemann R.E. Moffat S.L. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 375-383Google Scholar, 8Proft T.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 6719Google Scholar), suggesting an essential role in both MHCII molecular recognition and TCR-mediated signal transduction. The high affinity zinc coordination complexes of SEA and Spe-C consist of three amino acid side chains contributed by the superantigen and the fourth by the MHCII receptor. As observed in structural data for the Spe-C tetrahedral zinc coordination complex (3Li Y. Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Google Scholar, 4Arcus V.L. Proft T. Sigrell J.A. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 157-168Google Scholar, 5Sundstrom M. Abramsen L. Antonsson P. Mehindate K. Mourad W. Dohlsten M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6832-6840Google Scholar), His and/or Asp contribute the zinc ligands from the superantigen and His81 from the β-chain of MHCII molecule. The recently determined crystal structure of SEH with the MHCII HLA-DR1 indicates a potentially lower affinity zinc coordination site, present at the interface with the receptor (6Petersson K. Håkanson M. Nilsson H. Forsberg G. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Walse B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3306-3312Google Scholar), where one of the ligands is a water molecule. The binding of SEH to MHCII is dependent on zinc, and superantigen potency is diminished when the zinc binding residues are replaced by alanines (10Nilsson H. Björk P. Dohlsten M. Antonsson P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6683-6693Google Scholar). However, the MHCII β-chain mutation H81A, expected to abolish the zinc-mediated SEH binding to MHCII, had minimal effect (10Nilsson H. Björk P. Dohlsten M. Antonsson P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6683-6693Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal zinc-binding site of another dimer-forming superantigen (11Bavari S. Ulrich R.G. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 423-429Google Scholar), SEC1, is not necessary for T-cell stimulation (12Chi Y.I. Sadler I. Jablonski L.M. Callantine S.D. Deobald C.F. Stauffacher C.V. Bohach G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22839-22846Google Scholar). In vitro data with purified recombinant Spe-C demonstrated a large proportion of dimer at 81 μm protein concentration (7Li P.-L. Tiedemann R.E. Moffat S.L. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 375-383Google Scholar), yet the K d for dimer formation from equilibrium centrifugation data is only 390 μm (3Li Y. Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Google Scholar) compared with T-cell stimulation occurring at nanomolar concentrations of superantigen. The mutant H35A, thought to affect dimer formation, had only minor effect on the K d (3Li Y. Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Google Scholar). Finally, the Spe-C molecule forms a zinc-less dimer in the Spe-C/TCR Vβ 2.1 crystal structure (13Sundberg E.J. Li H. Llera A.S. McCormick J.K. Tormo J. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Structure. 2002; 10: 687-699Google Scholar), using a surface proposed to be involved in the zinc-mediated MHCII binding, a site far removed from the one anticipated to bury the conserved residues interacting with the MHCII α-chain (2Roussel A. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 635-643Google Scholar). Therefore, to further understand binding of Spe-C to MHCII and the contribution to T-cell stimulation, we have re-examined the relationship of zinc binding to stability, oligomerization, and biological function of the Spe-C superantigen. Our results suggest a diminished functional role for zinc and dimerization in T-cell stimulation. Further, an alternative zinc-independent-binding site, involving residues structurally equivalent to the MHCII α-chain-binding hydrophobic loop and polar pocket on SEB, may be biologically relevant for TCR stimulation. Binding to this site is only possible when the biologically active form of Spe-C is a monomer but not the homodimer.RESULTSThe Spe-C superantigen was cloned from a clinical isolate ofS. pyogenes. r wt and mutants thought to be important for binding to MHCII molecules (Fig. 1) (discussed below) were also constructed. To avoid dimerization because of covalent, intermolecular disulfide formation, all proteins had the mutation C27S introduced. The C27S mutation did not affect Spe-C biological function (discussed later) and allowed us to accurately measure the chemical stability and propensity to form a non-covalent dimer. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies and refolded on-column under non-reducing conditions. The proteins were homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when the mutants were analyzed by LC-MS, plotting the A 280 and total ion current as a function of retention time (data not shown). The summary of mass assignments from LC-MS analysis is given in TableI. The experimental and calculated masses differ by less than four mass units, which excludes modifications due to post-translational modifications by E. coli and purification artifacts due to the refolding or chromatography procedures.Table IA summary of mass determination data for Spe-C recombinant proteinsSpe-CMolecular massMolecular massexp.

Dimasi N. McCormick J. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Google Scholar), the expected amount of monomer at 0.2 mg/ml (8.13 μm) protein concentration used in our size-exclusion chromatography experiments was about 97%. The slightly lower (93%; see Table II) proportion of the monomer may have been because of trimer formation, which was not included in our calculations. These results indicate that only a small population of dimer was present under our experimental conditions.Figure 2Gel filtration chromatography of recombinant H201A mutant at pH 7.0.

The spectrum of r wt protein (Fig. 3) exhibits a minimum at 210 nm and a second, less pronounced minimum at about 220 nm. These data suggest a combination of α-helix and β-sheet as observed in the x-ray structure of Spe-C (2Roussel A. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. Nat. Struct.

Estimates of secondary structure were as follows: 31% for α-helix, 21% for β-sheet, and 48% for coil. These experimental values, within the experimental error range, agree with the x-ray data (2Roussel A. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Fraser J.D. Baker E.N. Nat. Struct.

The overall shape of the plots and absolute values of molar elliptically for the r wt protein are also very similar to the spectrum of the closely related Spe-A superantigen purified under non-denaturing conditions (14Fagin U.

However, the results for the H201A mutant may indicate potential folding problems in this protein. To further investigate, we measured the chemical stability of all recombinant proteins by GdnHCl unfolding. All proteins exhibited a cooperative transition under neutral pH conditions indicating a well folded species. The midpoint of transition, Cm, was 1.10–1.16 m for most proteins (Table III) and 0.92m for the H201A mutant. The free energy of unfolding,ΔGo, was 30–31 kJ/mol for the r wt and H167A mutant. The ΔGo of the other mutants, however, were 24–26 kJ/mol. The differences, compared with r wt, were small but reproducible and may indicate that some of the zinc binding residues are important for protein stability.Table IIIThermodynamic parameters for equilibrium unfolding of Spe-C mutant proteinsSpe-CΔG oCmmkJ/molmkJ/mol−1m−1r wt31.5 ± 2.11.16 ± 0.0427.2 ± 2.6H167A30.6 ± 1.01.11 ± 0.0427.7 ± 0.8H201A24.3 ± 2.90.92 ± 0.0226.3 ± 2.6D203A26.5 ± 3.01.11 ± 0.0223.8 ± 3.0D203N26.5 ± 2.21.14 ± 0.0223.2 ± 1.4Protein concentration was 0.817 μm in 50 mmpotassium phosphate; pH 7.0.

Open table in a new tab Spe-C binding to soluble MHCII was measured by surface plasmon resonance, using HLA-DR1 expressed in S2 insect cells (24Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Google Scholar) and complexed with the influenza hemagglutinin peptide 306–318 (25Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G.

The r wt Spe-C bound HLA-DR1 with a dissociation constant of 1.0 μm whereas binding of zinc-binding site mutants was below the limits of detection (Table IV). Inclusion of EDTA in the analyte greatly inhibited binding (Fig.4), suggesting zinc dependence. The residual binding (Fig. 4, inset) may indicate a secondary binding site on Spe-C for HLA-DR1. However, the signal was too weak to estimate the K d reliably. We next measured the affinity of recombinant Spe-C mutants for MHCII molecules expressed on the cell surface to determine whether zinc was necessary for binding to the expressed receptors. All the Ala-substituted mutants of Spe-C had a significantly reduced affinity for the MHCII molecules expressed on LG2 cells (Fig. 5). The largest reduction was observed for the D203A mutant. Surprisingly, the affinity of the D203N mutant was five times greater than that of the r wt (K d ∼0.5 μm). The negative charge at position 203 was apparently not necessary for the MHCII binding.Table IVA summary of affinities of recombinant HLA-DR1 for Spe-C protein variantsProteink on·103k off·10−3K dΔΔG o1/Ms1/sμmkJ/molwt2.74 ± 0.022.74 ± 0.121.0 ± 0.050H167ANDND>50>32H201ANDND>50>32D203ANDND>50>32D203NNDND>50>32The rate constants were determined at 37 °C in 10 mm HEPES; pH 7.0; 150 mm NaCl.

A representative result is shown in Fig.6. Binding of the labeled r wt protein to the cell surface of HLA-DR1 transfected cells was blocked by adding increasing amounts of unlabeled Spe-C. The apparentK i, determined as the concentration value at 50% of relative binding saturation, was 0.15 μm, a value lower than the K i of 0.5 μm estimated from binding to human LG2 cells. The lower value may be because of the contribution of different sets of peptides bound by HLA-DR1 expressed on independent cell backgrounds. These results confirm that the binding data reflected direct interactions between HLA-DR1 and Spe-C. We concluded that the residues His167, His201, and Asp203 are important for binding to MHCII molecules expressed on cells and in solution. Additionally, metal, most likely zinc, was essential for the overall binding of Spe-C to HLA-DR1, based on our metal content analysis (Table V) and cellular and surface plasmon resonance binding data. However, any potential secondary, zinc-independent MHCII-binding site was likely masked by the higher affinity, zinc-dependent site.Figure 6Wild type Spe-C binds exclusively to recombinant HLA-DR1 molecules expressed on the surface of cells.Cells were incubated with a mixture of FITC-labeled recombinant wild type Spe-C and non-labeled competitor proteins.

Open table in a new tab To investigate whether replacements in the zinc-binding site of Spe-C would affect the biological activity of the protein, we next measured human T-cell stimulation. The r wt protein was first compared with wild type SEA and Spe-A. SEA binds to the β-chain of MHCII molecules in a zinc-dependent mode and to the α-chain in a zinc-independent mode (15Dowd J.E. Karr R.W. Karp D.R. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 1267-1274Google Scholar, 16Ulrich R.G. Bavari S. Olson M.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 554-559Google Scholar), whereas the zinc-binding Spe-A has been proposed to bind only to the α-chain (17Papageorgiu A.C. Collins M.C. Gutman D.M. Kline J.B. O'Brien S.M. Tranter H.S. Acharya K.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 9-21Google Scholar). A typical T-cell stimulation assay for the wild type proteins is shown in Fig.7 A. The r wt superantigen produced by E. coli exhibits a typical superantigen response curve with P50% (P50% is defined as the concentration of antigen at which the T-cell stimulation is equal to half of the maximum T-cell response) between 10 and 100 ng/ml. The concentration of r wt toxin at which the response becomes saturated is also slightly higher than observed for the native SEA and Spe-A. To assess the importance of zinc-binding site for the T-cell stimulation potential of Spe-C, we next examined mutants of the zinc binding residues (Fig. 7 B). The response point (the response point is defined by us as the lowest concentration of antigen at which the T-cell response is significantly higher than the baseline response) and P50% values of the H167A mutant were identical to the wild type protein. The H201A mutant had the same response point, but the P50% value was slightly higher. However, the response points of D203A and D203N mutants were higher than r wt values by an order of magnitude. The saturation values were equal or slightly higher than observed for the r wt protein. Clearly, none of the zinc-binding site mutations except at position 203 caused a dramatic decrease in biological activity. The replacement of Asp203 by either Ala or Asn caused a noticeable decrease in initial T-cell recognition. The T-cell response to the other mutants was essentially the same as obtained with the r wt protein. The difference between T-cell stimulation and MHCII binding by Spe-C may be a consequence of stabilizing interactions with cell surface proteins other than MHCII molecules (11Bavari S. Ulrich R.G. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 423-429Google Scholar). However, a major contribution by other proteins is unlikely in view of the experiments with the HLA-DR1 transfectants (Fig. 6) showing an exclusive binding to HLA-DR1. Although the Asp203 mutations resulted in only a slight change in protein-folding stability (Table III), we could not exclude the possibility that mutating this residue may perturb local secondary structure more than mutations in the other zinc-binding side chains. Collectively, these data suggest that zinc binding is not essential for T-cell recognition by Spe-C.Figure 7Human T-cell stimulation by Spe-C is not dependent on zinc. A, wild type superantigens are shown as follows: ■, wild type Spe-C; ▪, wild type SEA; ▴, wild type Spe-A.

Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Google Scholar), there may be a second, lower-affinity binding mode important for T-cell stimulation. We used protein docking simulations to facilitate a search for additional MHCII-binding sites in Spe-C that were zinc-independent. Several clusters of candidate binding sites were identified, generally close to the hydrophobic loop (discussed later). The final model structure, chosen based on the least amount of steric problems, was the solution most favored by the computational search. This solution also had the best agreement with our experimental data. The orientation of Spe-C versus DR1 in the modeled complex is very similar to the SEB/DR1 complex (root mean square deviation between the complexes is 0.53 Å for the α-C atoms). There are two major contact sites in the Spe-C/DR1 model complex: a hydrophobic loop (Fig. 8 A), containing no intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and a polar pocket (Fig. 8 B). Both sites form an almost continuous binding surface. The side chain of residue Thr34 from the hydrophobic loop packs very tightly against the peptide backbone of Ser19-Gln18from the α-chain of DR1. The polar pocket residue Tyr76is on a flexible loop. This loop also contacts the following residues from the TCR Vβ 2.1 chain (13Sundberg E.J. Li H. Llera A.S. McCormick J.K. Tormo J. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A.

An overlay of our modeled DR1/Spe-C complex on the published Spe-C/TCR Vβ 2.1 complex crystal structure (13Sundberg E.J. Li H. Llera A.S. McCormick J.K. Tormo J. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Structure. 2002; 10: 687-699Google Scholar) revealed no steric clashes between HLA-DR1 and TCR Vβ, suggesting the likelihood of a ternary complex of Spe-C/MHCII/TCR based on this alternative binding mode. It should be noted that the zinc-binding site and hydrophobic loop/polar pocket regions proposed to contact HLA-DR1 are on opposite surfaces of Spe-C (Fig. 1).Figure 8Close-ups of the hydrophobic loop (A) and polar pocket (B) regions in Spe-C proposed to bind HLA-DR1 α-chain.The b"

On the other hand, pre-TCR signaling is a key process in αβ T cell development, which appears to proceed in a constitutive and ligand-independent manner. Here, comparative analyses on the dynamics of pre-TCR and TCR cell surface expression show that unligated pre-TCR complexes expressed on human pre-T cells behave as engaged TCR complexes, i.e. they are rapidly internalized and degraded in lysosomes and proteasomes but do not recycle back to the cell surface. Thus, pre-TCR down-regulation takes place constitutively without the need for extracellular ligation. By using TCRα/pΤα chain chimeras, we demonstrate that prevention of recycling and induction of degradation are unique pre-TCR properties conferred by the cytoplasmic domain of the pTα chain. Finally, we show that pre-TCR internalization is a protein kinase C-independent process that involves the combination of srckinase-dependent and -independent pathways. These data suggest that constitutive pre-TCR down-modulation regulates pre-TCR surface expression levels and hence the extent of ligand-independent signaling through the pre-TCR.

Upon productive TCRα gene rearrangements, the TCRα chain pairs with TCRβ and associates with CD3ε, -γ, -δ, and -ζ chains, and thymocytes undergo a second step of selection upon binding of the TCRαβ to self-peptide-major histocompatibility complex molecules (1von Boehmer H.

Med. 2001; 193: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), current studies support the theory that mechanisms regulating the assembly and intracellular transport of these complexes may differ markedly, because the pre-TCR is expressed only transiently and very inefficiently during thymocyte development, at levels about 50–100-fold lower than those of the TCR on mature T cells (3Borst J.

Particularly, the pTα cytoplasmic (Cy) domain was found to serve an endoplasmic reticulum retention function that could contribute in part to the regulation of pre-TCR assembly and surface expression (9Carrasco Y.R. Ramiro A.R. Trigueros C. de Yébenes V.G. Garcı́a-Peydró M. Toribio M.L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

Alarcón B. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 325-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli induce changes in one or several of these processes and therefore modify the level of expression of a given receptor. In the particular case of the TCR, receptor engagement by its natural ligands results in down-regulation of TCR-CD3 cell surface expression (11Alcover A. Alarcón B. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 325-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zanders E.D. Lamb J.R. Feldmann M. Green N. Beverley P.C. Nature. 1983; 303: 625-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Cai Z.

Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1995; 375: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Different molecular mechanisms have been proposed to account for the down-modulation of ligated TCR complexes. Most studies support the position that TCR ligation results in a significant increase of the TCR internalization rate followed by the degradation of the internalized complex (15Niedergang F. Hemar A. Hewitt C.R. Owen M.J. Dautry-Varsat A. Alcover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12839-12845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Valitutti S. Müller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, TCR-CD3 complexes are continuously internalized and recycled back to the cell surface in nonstimulated T cells (17Krangel M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1141-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Minami Y. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13342-13347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that constitutive TCR recycling on resting T cells has to be affected by TCR ligation. In this regard, Wiest and co-workers (19Liu H. Rhodes M. Wiest D.L. Vignali D.A.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) have recently proposed that TCR engagement has little effect on the TCR internalization rate; rather, it prevents TCR recycling back to the cell surface by inducing the intracellular retention of ligated complexes and their degradation by lysosomes and proteasomes. In sharp contrast to the TCR, pre-TCR signaling occurs apparently without any need for ligation (5Jacobs H. Iacomini J. van de Ven M. Tonegawa S. Berns A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Irving B.A. Alt F.W. Killeen N. Science. 1998; 280: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This concurs with the finding that the pre-TCR spontaneously clusters and localizes on the cell surface into lipid rafts (20Saint-Ruf C. Panigada M. Azogui O. Debey P. von Boehmer H. Grassi F. Nature. 2000; 406: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Ramiro A.R. Navarro M. Carreira A. Carrasco Y.R. de Yébenes V.G. Carrillo G. San Millán J.L. Rubin B. Toribio M.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), in a manner similar to that found for the αβ TCR following ligand binding (22Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 23Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.-M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.-A. Chauvin J.-P. Pierres M. He H.-T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). These findings support the view that surface pre-TCR complexes are constitutively activated without any need for ligation (20Saint-Ruf C. Panigada M. Azogui O. Debey P. von Boehmer H. Grassi F. Nature. 2000; 406: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and raise the question of what is the intracellular fate of such “activated” pre-TCR complexes. In this study, we have analyzed the dynamics of pre-TCR-CD3 cell surface expression and down-modulation in unstimulated pre-T cells and show that, similar to ligated TCR complexes, surface pre-TCR complexes are continually and rapidly endocytosed and degraded in the absence of extracellular ligation but do not recycle back to the cell surface. Moreover, we show that cell-autonomous pre-TCR down-modulation depends on the pTα cytoplasmic tail. The possibility that constitutive endocytosis and degradation of the pre-TCR is a self-safe mechanism responsible for its limited expression on the cell surface is discussed. The αwt and α/CypTα stable transfectants were derived as described elsewhere (9Carrasco Y.R. Ramiro A.R. Trigueros C. de Yébenes V.G. Garcı́a-Peydró M. Toribio M.L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) from the pre-T cell line SUP-T1, which expresses an endogenous TCRβ (Vβ1) chain and the pTα chain but lacks TCRα. Briefly, SUP-T1 cells were transfected, respectively, either with full-length cDNAs encoding a conventional TCRα (Vα12.1) chain or with a TCRα/pTα chimeric construct in which the Cy domain of TCRα was replaced by the equivalent domain of pTα (CypTα). G418-selected transfectants were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Likewise, TCRζ-GFP stable transfectants were derived from SUP-T1 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding a COOH-terminal fusion protein of the TCRζ chain with the green fluorescence protein (GFP). The TCRζ-GFP fusion was performed by PCR amplification of a complete TCRζ chain cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. B. Alarcón, Centro de Biologı́a Molecular Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain) with the sense 5′-CGC GCG CCC GGG ATG AAG TGG AAG GCG CTT-3′ and antisense 5′-GCG CGC CCG GGC CCC GCG AGG GGG CAG GGC-3′ primers followed by digestion and ligation into the SmaI site of the pEGFP-N1 plasmid vector (Clontech). Pre-TCR surface expression levels analyzed on 48 selected TCRζ-GFP clones were similar to those on parental SUP-T1 cells. SUP-T1 cells and αwt, α/CypTα, and TCRζ-GFP stable transfectants were cultured (5–8 × 105/ml) in 24-well plates (Costar) either in the absence or presence of cycloheximide (40 μg/ml, Calbiochem), brefeldin-A (1 μg/ml, Sigma), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml, Calbiochem), and/or PP2 (2 μm, Calbiochem). At different time points, surface expression of the endogenous pre-TCR was analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS XL Coulter Corp.) with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human TCRβ-Vβ1 (Endogen) or anti-CD3ε (BD Biosciences) mAbs. Surface levels of the conventional TCRα-ΤCRβ (TCR) or the chimeric TCRα/CypTα-TCRβ (ChTCR) receptors expressed respectively on αwt and α/CypTα transfectants was analyzed with the anti-TCRαβ mAb BMA031 (Behringwerke AG) plus phycoerythrin-labeled F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse Igs (Caltag Laboratories). The percentage of surface expression at the indicated time points was determined from the mean fluorescence values of treated cells using the untreated controls as reference. Background values were determined with isotype-matched irrelevant antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (9Carrasco Y.R. Ramiro A.R.

In brief, cells were cultured as described above in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (40 μg/ml) with or without inhibitors of lysosomal degradation (NH4Cl, 40 mm, Merck; or chloroquine, 50 μm, Sigma) or a proteasome inhibitor (lactacystin, 20 μm, Sigma) for 8 h. Then, cells (5 × 106/immunoprecipitation) were washed in 1× PBS, lysed with 1% Brij 96-containing lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated as described (9Carrasco Y.R. Ramiro A.R.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ImmobilonTM-P, Millipore). Blots were probed with the anti-human TCRζ rabbit antiserum 448 (kindly provided by Dr. B. Alarcón) plus horseradish peroxidase-labeled polyclonal donkey anti-rabbit Igs (Amersham Biosciences) and then developed using ECL Lumi-LightPLUS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Densitometric analysis was performed with a Bioimaging BAS 1500 (Fujifilm). Cells (107/ml) either untreated or pretreated for 2 h with 50 μm chloroquine, 20 μm lactacystin, or 1 μm epoxomicin (Calbiochem) were washed three times in complete 1× PBS at 4 °C and labeled with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in complete 1× PBS for 30 min on ice. Excess biotin was eliminated by washing the cells three times with 10 mml-lysine (Sigma) in 1× PBS. Then, cells were cultured (5–10 × 106/ml) in the absence or presence of the indicated lysosome or proteasome inhibitors. At each time point, cells (20 × 106/immunoprecipitation) were washed with 1× PBS, lysed with 1% Brij, and immunoprecipitated as described above with the UCHT-1 or SP-34 (kindly provided by Dr. B. Alarcón) anti-CD3ε mAb. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and blots were probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and revealed by the ECL method. When indicated, blots were stripped and reprobed with the 448 anti-TCRζ antiserum or an anti-α-tubulin mAb (Sigma) as above. Confocal microscopy was performed essentially as described previously (9Carrasco Y.R. Ramiro A.R. Trigueros C. de Yébenes V.G. Garcı́a-Peydró M. Toribio M.L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were adhered to poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-precoated coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C, and stained at the cell surface with an anti-CD4 mAb (BD Biosciences). For intracellular staining, fixed cells were permeabilized with a commercial lysing solution (BD Biosciences) and stained with the anti-CD63 mAb TEA3/18 (VI International Leukocyte Typing Workshop), kindly provided by Dr. F. Sánchez-Madrid (Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain). Rhodamine Red X-coupled goat anti-mouse Igs (Molecular Probes) was used as the second-step reagent for both surface and cytoplasmic staining. Samples were examined under a confocal microscope (Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad Laboratories) coupled to an Axiovert S100TV inverted microscope (Zeiss). Serial optical sections were recorded at 0.3–0.5 μm intervals with a 63× lens under an optimal iris setup. Colocalization analyses were performed using Metamorph, version 5.03, software (Universal Imaging). To study the dynamics of pre-TCR cell surface expression, we used a human pre-T cell line, SUP-T1, which has been shown to display low pre-TCR surface levels as found on primary human pre-T cells (Ref. 9Carrasco Y.R. Ramiro A.R. Trigueros C. de Yébenes V.G. Garcı́a-Peydró M. Toribio M.L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and Fig.1A). The relative contribution of synthesis and secretion of new chains as compared with internalization and recycling of expressed ones to actual pre-TCR-CD3 surface levels was explored by comparative cycloheximide or brefeldin- A (BFA) treatment, as described recently for the mature TCR-CD3 complex (19Liu H. Rhodes M. Wiest D.L. Vignali D.A.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Pre-TCR surface expression was measured with an anti-TCRVβ1 mAb (9Carrasco Y.R. Ramiro A.R. Trigueros C. de Yébenes V.G. Garcı́a-Peydró M. Toribio M.L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The dynamics of TCR-CD3 surface expression was analyzed for comparison in the same cellular environment, namely SUP-T1 cells stably transfected with a TCRα chain (αwt transfectants), which co-expressed the conventional TCRαβ-CD3 complex (>99% TCRαβ+) together with the endogenous pre-TCR (Ref. 9Carrasco Y.R. Ramiro A.R. Trigueros C. de Yébenes V.G. Garcı́a-Peydró M. Toribio M.L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, and Fig. 1A). The results confirmed that, as described (19Liu H. Rhodes M. Wiest D.L. Vignali D.A.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), the mature surface TCR-CD3 was relatively synthesis-independent, that is, surface TCR-CD3 expression levels remained essentially stable within the studied 12-h time period (Fig. 1C). Therefore, mature TCR complexes are long-lived on αwt transfectants. As reported (19Liu H. Rhodes M. Wiest D.L. Vignali D.A.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), the effect of BFA on TCR expression was very different from that of cycloheximide and resulted in a partial reduction of TCR membrane levels (Fig. 1A), which fell rapidly during the first 2 h of treatment (about 30% reduction) and remained low (50% of control levels) for 8 h thereafter (Fig. 1B). Because surface expression of the mature TCR was found independent of newly synthesized complexes, this reduction in TCR surface levels cannot be due to the reported BFA-induced blockade of the anterograde transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex (24Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner A.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 25Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Rather, it may be caused by the documented capacity of BFA to induce tubulation and fusion of the trans-Golgi network with early endosomes, which, although previously reported to leave cycling between plasma membrane and endosomes of certain molecules such as transferrin unperturbed (24Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner A.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), has recently been shown to affect the endocytic transport of the TCR (19Liu H. Rhodes M. Wiest D.L. Vignali D.A.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26von Essen M. Menne C. Nielsen B.L. Lauritsen J.P.H. Dietrich J. Andersen P.S. Karjalainen K. Odum N. Geisler C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4519-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data indicate that TCR-CD3 complexes expressed on SUP-T1 αwt transfectants are continually internalized and recycled back to the cell surface and thus behave as conventional TCR-CD3 complexes on resting T cells (19Liu H. Rhodes M. Wiest D.L. Vignali D.A.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to the TCR, surface expression of the pre-TCR was dramatically affected by cycloheximide, indicating that it is dependent on newly synthesized complexes. Pre-TCR levels fell to less than 20% of control levels after 6 h of treatment and remained essentially undetectable after 12 h (Fig. 1C). BFA also induced a rapid and marked decrease on pre-TCR surface expression (80% after 2 h of treatment), which resulted in the down-modulation of the complex (Fig. 1, A and B). These data suggest that pre-TCR-CD3 complexes are continually internalized from the surface of SUP-T1 pre-T cells, with internalization rates that are apparently higher than those for the TCR-CD3. Surprisingly, however, endocytosed pre-TCR-CD3 complexes do not recycle back to the cell surface. Because the pre-TCR and TCR are co-expressed on αwt transfectants, the differential intracellular fate of the two complexes cannot be cell type-dependent but, rather, is structure-dependent (i.e. the substitution of pTα in the pre-TCR with TCRα in the TCR). To uncover the structural properties of pTα that are responsible for the impaired recycling of the endocytosed pre-TCR, TCRα/pTα chimeric constructs involving distinct pTα and TCRα domains were stably transfected into SUP-T1 cells (9Carrasco Y.R. Ramiro A.R. Trigueros C. de Yébenes V.G. Garcı́a-Peydró M. Toribio M.L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the surface expression dynamics of the resulting ChTCR was analyzed by flow cytometry. Particularly, we focused on α/CypTα chimeric constructs in which the Cy domain of TCRα was replaced by the equivalent domain of pTα. As shown Fig.1A, the effects of BFA and cycloheximide on surface expression of the resulting α/CypTα-TCRβ ChTCR, measured with an anti-TCRαβ mAb, were equivalent to those observed on endogenous pre-TCR expression. BFA induced a significant reduction of ChTCR expression levels after 2 h, which was followed by the complete loss of the complex after 6 h of treatment (Fig. 1, Aand B), and cycloheximide treatment also resulted in ChTCR down-modulation (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that the pTα Cy domain actively mediates impaired recycling of the pre-TCR-CD3 complex to the cell surface without the need of ligand binding. To investigate the mechanisms that could account for the impaired return of endocytosed pre-TCR (and ChTCR) complexes to the cell surface, we followed the intracellular fate of pre-TCR-associated TCRζ chains in SUP-T1 cells stably transfected with a plasmid encoding a COOH-terminal fusion protein of the TCRζ chain with the green fluorescence protein (ζ-GFP). As shown in Fig. 2Afor one representative ζ-GFP+ clone of four, flow cytometry analysis allowed us to simultaneously measure the surface levels of the pre-TCR complex and the total cellular content of the ζ-GFP protein. These studies revealed that, as shown in Fig. 1 for the parental SUP-T1 pre-T cell line, pre-TCR complexes expressed on ζ-GFP transfectants are continually internalized from the cell surface and become down-modulated after treatment with cycloheximide, BFA, or both. Kinetic analysis showed that pre-TCR down-modulation paralleled a gradual decrease of the total content of ζ-GFP when protein synthesis was blocked, so that green fluorescence became barely detectable (<20% of control expression levels) after 12 h of treatment with cycloheximide (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the ζ-GFP chimeric chains, including those associated with the internalized pre-TCR, were degraded intracellularly. In contrast, pre-TCR down-modulation was coupled with a dramatic increase of green fluorescence in BFA-treated cells, indicating that ζ-GFP protein chimeras had accumulated in the cytoplasm. More importantly, blocking of endosome to lysosome trafficking induced by BFA (24Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner A.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) counteracted the effect of cycloheximide and prevented the disappearance of GFP expression, which remained stable although partly reduced (≥60% of control levels) after 12 h (Fig. 2, A andB). Therefore, loss of green fluorescence induced by cycloheximide could be the result of selective degradation of ζ-GFP fusion proteins in lysosomes. Supporting this possibility, confocal microscopy analysis showed that untreated ζ-GFP transfectants had low levels of surface ζ-GFP that colocalized with the membrane marker CD4 (Fig. 2C), whereas a significant amount of green fluorescence was expressed intracellularly and accumulated in the cytoplasmic structures that expressed the lysosomal marker CD63 (27Metzelaar M.J. Wijngaard P.L. Peters P.J. Sixma J.J. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Clevers H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3239-3245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2D a high proportion of ζ-GFP (55 ± 17%) colocalized with CD63 on different 0.2 μm sections. According to flow cytometry data, ζ-GFP expression was sensitive to BFA treatment, so that a significant increase of green fluorescence was observed in BFA-treated cells in which ζ-GFP accumulated intracellularly and acquired a characteristic distribution in tubular structures typical of BFA-treated cells (Fig. 2E). Expectedly, no ζ-GFP expression was detected upon cycloheximide treatment (data not shown), again supporting the possibility that pre-TCR-associated intracellular TCRζ was degraded. However, intracellular accumulation of ζ-GFP was observed when cells were treated simultaneously with cycloheximide and BFA (Fig. 2F), indicating that degradation of cytoplasmic ζ-GFP was blocked because of the impaired trafficking to lysosomes induced by BFA. It has been shown that the primary mechanism mediating down-modulation of the TCR upon ligand binding involves targeting of endocytosed complexes for intracellular degradation, predominantly by lysosomes, but also by proteasomes (16Valitutti S. Müller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Liu H. Rhodes M. Wiest D.L. Vignali D.A.A. Immunity. 2000; 13: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To investigate whether proteasome was also involved in degradation of endocytosed pre-TCR or ChTCR complexes, biochemical studies were performed aimed at analyzing the intracellular fate of TCRζ associated to internalized complexes in cells treated with drugs that block lysosome (NH4Cl and chloroquine) or proteasome (lactacystin) function. None of these drugs affected surface receptor expression levels or cellular viability (data not shown). However, as shown by immunoblot analysis (Fig.3A), they induced a significant accumulation of intracellular TCRζ2dimers that were immunoprecipitated associated to the pre-TCR or the ChTCR from SUP-T1 cells or α/CypTα transfectants, respectively. In contrast, these drugs did not significantly affect the levels of TCRζ chain associated to the mature TCR complex in αwt transfectants, which is consistent with an active and selective degradation of TCRζ2 dimers associated with the pre-TCR and the ChTCR but not with the conventional TCR. Accordingly, degradation of TCRζ2 dimers associated to pre-TCR and ChTCR complexes was observed when protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide (Fig. 3A), but TCRζ chain degradation was inhibited by NH4Cl and chloroquine, and to a lesser extent, by lactacystin (see densitometric analysis in Fig. 3B). Taken together, our data provide evidence that, as shown previously for ligated TCR-CD3 complexes, constitutive internalization of unligated pr"

Such therapy is often sub-optimal, however, particularly in patients with reduced LDL receptors (familial hypercholesterolemia), and novel or adjuvant therapies are therefore warranted. Cholesterol elimination is profoundly influenced by the rate of its conversion to bile acids (BA), regulated by the enzyme Cyp7a1. Induced fecal loss of BA by resin treatment reduces plasma cholesterol, presumably through induction of hepatic LDL receptors (LDLR). We here describe the effect of PR835, a drug belonging to a new class of lipid-lowering agents that inhibit the Slc10a2 protein, the intestinal transporter responsible for active uptake of BA. Treatment reduced plasma cholesterol by 40% in mice devoid of both the LDLR and its ligand, apoE, while triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were unchanged. Cyp7a1 enzyme activity and mRNA were induced several-fold, and hepatic HMG CoA reductase mRNA increased, mirroring an induced synthesis of BA and cholesterol. The addition of a statin potentiated the effect, leading to reductions of plasma total and LDL cholesterol by 64% and 70%, respectively. These effects could not be attributed to induction of other known hepatic lipoprotein receptors and indicate the presence of new points of targeting in lipid-lowering therapy."

Here, we investigated the effects of cADPR on engraftment of hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) into irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Two different protocols were used: i) a 24 h in vitro priming of cord blood-derived mononuclear cells (MNC) with micromolar cADPR, followed by their infusion into irradiated mice (both primary and secondary transplants); and ii) co-infusion of MNC with CD38-transfected, cADPR-generating, irradiated murine 3T3 fibroblasts. We demonstrated a dual effect of cADPR on human HP in vivo: i) enhanced proliferation of committed progenitors, responsible for improvement of short-term engraftment; ii) expansion of HSC, with increased long-term human engraftment into secondary recipients and a significantly higher expansion factor of CD34+ progenitors in mice co-infused with MNC and CD38+ 3T3 fibroblasts. These results hold promise for the possible therapeutic use of cADPR, and of cADPR-producing stroma, to achieve long-term expansion of human HSC, that is, those HP capable of self-renewal and responsible for repopulation of the bone marrow."

The various steps in DNA synthesis are basically similar among all organisms in eukarya, bacteria, and archaea, although replication components differ. In eukaryotic cells, the final processing of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand requires that the ribonucleotide portions as primers are completely removed by the concerted action of three nucleases, Fen-1, RNaseH, and Dna2. Next, the corresponding sections of the molecule are filled by DNA polymerases. The resulting nicks on the lagging strand are then sealed by DNA ligase (1MacNeill S.A. Curr.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The endonuclease activity associated with Dna2 preferentially cleaves ssDNA with free ends, and the helicase activity unwinds duplex DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction. The cleavage reaction was stimulated by the presence of an RNA segment at the 5′-end of flap DNA. The 5′-end region of the Okazaki fragment is efficiently processed by Dna2 when it is displaced from the template by the DNA polymerase δ extending the upstream primer. These enzymatic properties of Dna2 provide a biochemical basis for a role in Okazaki fragment maturation (10Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol.

The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and SalI and inserted into an expression vector pET-21b digested with NdeI andXhoI. The constructed plasmid was designated pET-Dna2PhoS(21b). Since the Dna2 homologue (Dna2Pab) fromPyrococcus abyssi was longer by 124 amino acids at the NH2-terminal than Dna2Pho, and another initiation codon TTG was found at the position of Dna2Pho corresponding to the initiation codon (GTG) of Dna2Pab, the ORF coding Dna2Pho was elongated by 122 amino acids. The elongated NH2-terminal region was amplified by PCR against the chromosomal DNA of P. horikoshii as template using the primers P3 and P4 (Table I, Fig.1). The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and inserted into pET-Dna2PhoS(21b) digested with NdeI andSmaI. The newly constructed plasmid was designated pET-Dna2PhoL(21b).Table IPrimers used in cloning and construction of the expression vectorsPrimerSequences and restriction sites in the primer1-aThe restriction sites are underlined.P15′-TTTTAAACCTGAACAATATCCATATGTATCAAGCTCCACTCATAGGAAAGATAGGG-3′NdeIP25′-CTCGAGTGCGGCCGCAAGCTTGTCGACCTCTCCAGCCCACCTAAACAC-3′SalIP35′-GTAGAGGTGGAAACATATGGAATTTGGGGAGTTACATCCCAGCG-3′NdeIP45′-GGGGCCAGGGAAAATTATCCTTAGTGACAATGGCTAGC-3′NheIP55′-GCTTGGTGATCCATATGACGAGGAAGCTG-3′NdeIP65′-AAAAGGATCCGGTACCTCTACTCGAGCCCAC-3′BamHI KpnIP75′-TTTTGGTACCCCTCTAGAAATAATTTTG-3′KpnI1-a The restriction sites are underlined. Open table in a new tab To construct the co-expression vector for PH0108 and Dna2Pho, the PH0108 gene was amplified with primers P5 and P6 (Table I, Fig. 1). The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI andBamHI and inserted into pET-21b digested withNdeI and BamHI. The new plasmid was designated pET-PH0108(21b). To add a KpnI site upstream of the ribosome binding site (RBS) in pET-Dna2PhoL(21b), PCR was performed using primers P4 and P7 (Table I, Fig. 1). After digestion withKpnI, the fragment was subcloned into pUC19 digested withKpnI and SmaI. ThePvuII-NheI fragment was inserted into pET-Dna2PhoL(21b) digested with NdeI (TheNdeI-digested end was blunted by the Klenow fragment) andNheI. The resulting plasmid was then digested withKpnI and Bpu1102I and inserted into pET-PH0108(21b) digested with KpnI and Bpu1102I. The final co-expression vector was named pET-PH108/Dna2PhoL(21b). The sequences of the genes were verified using an ABI PRISM kit and model 310 capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The newly constructed vectors were transformed into host E. coliBL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL. The transformed cells were grown in 2× yeast tryptone (2YT) medium (16 g of trypton, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl in 1 liter of deionized water) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 37 °C. The overnight culture was inoculated (1% inoculation) into fresh 2YT medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and incubation was continued at 37 °C until the optical density at 660 nm reached 0.4. The inducer isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (final concentration, 1 mm), and cultivation was continued for another 4 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (7,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min) and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mm NaCl) containing the protease inhibitor, DNase RQ1 (final concentration, ∼1 unit/ml), and MgCl2 (final concentration, ∼6 mm). The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the resultant solution was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cleared supernatants were obtained by centrifugation (24,000 × g, at 4 °C for 20 min) and then applied to the matrix of a nickel column (Novagen) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl) and washed with buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole. The enzymes were eluted with buffer B containing 500 mmimidazole. The eluted fraction was heated at 75 °C for 10 min and centrifuged (24,000 × g, at 4 °C for 20 min) to remove denatured proteins. The supernatant was supplemented with 5m NaCl to a final concentration of 2.3 m NaCl and applied to a HiTrap phenyl-Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 2 m NaCl). The column was washed with the same buffer, and protein was eluted with a 2–1m NaCl gradient. The eluted fraction was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mmNaCl) and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). The purified samples were analyzed by 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel was stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). NH2-terminal peptide sequencing was examined as follows. After electrophoresis, separated proteins were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm) (Bio-Rad) using a semidry apparatus (Bio-Rad). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was determined with an Applied Biosystems model 492 protein sequencer (Foster City, CA). The oligomers used in this study (TableII) were labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled oligonucleotide (5 pmol) was first heated with 2 μg of M13mp18 ssDNA or 98-mer oligonucleotide (5 pmol) in annealing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl) at 100 °C for 5 min, then kept at 67 °C for 1 h, and subsequently allowed to stand at 37 °C for 30 min (28Seki M. Enomoto T. Yanagisawa J. Hanaoka F. Ui M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1766-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The annealing mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature. For the preparation of 3′-labeled substrate, the partial duplex substrate was prepared as described above and then labeled using the Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dATP.32P-Labeled oligonucleotide substrate was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). M13 DNA substrate was purified using a MicroSpin S-400 column (Amersham Biosciences) and PCR purification kit (Qiagen). To determine the direction of translocation, the 5′-labeled or 3′-labeled substrate was digested with SmaI at 30 °C for 6 h and purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen).Table IIOligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequence15′-GCA TGC CTG CAG GTC GAC TCT AGA GGA TCC CCG GGT ACC GAG CTC GAA TTC GTA ATC ATG GTC-3′ (63)2-aThe underline indicates theSmaI cleavage site used to prepare a linear M13 ssDNA.

Open table in a new tab ATPase activity was measured in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 nmol of [γ-32P]ATP (15 Ci/mmol), 1 mmMgCl2, the indicated amount of polynucleotide, and the purified Dna2Pho helicase (30 ng). After incubation at 50 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 2 μl of 100 mmNa2EDTA. An aliquot (2 μl) was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin-layer plate. The reaction products (ATP, inorganic phosphate (Pi)) were separated by chromatography in a 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl solution (29Chong J.P.J. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The extent of ATP hydrolysis was quantified with the GS-525 molecular imager system (Bio-Rad). The standard reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 32P-labeled helicase substrate, and the purified Dna2Pho helicase. After incubation at 50 °C for 1 h, the reaction was terminated by adding 4 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Na2EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 25% glycerol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue. The sample (10 μl) was loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (89 mmTris borate (pH 8.2) and 2 mm EDTA) and electrophoresed at 10 mA. Gels were dried, and the helicase or nuclease products were analyzed and quantified with the GS-525 molecular imager system. The helicase activity was calculated with the formula X =P/(P + S), in which P is the value of the displaced oligonucleotides, and S is the value of nondisplaced substrates. The helicase activity was normalized with the positive and negative controls by the following formula: DNA helicase activity (%) = 100 × [(X sample −X n)/(X p −X n)], in which the X nvalue was determined by negative control assays at 50 °C without enzyme, and X p was obtained as a positive control with the reaction mixture boiled for 5 min without enzyme (30Seki M. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2924-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Purified Dna2Pho (130 ng) was incubated with32P-labeled substrate at 50 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture the same as in the helicase reaction except that the concentration of MgCl2 was 10 mm. For denaturing gel analysis, after mixing with 10 μl of sequencing gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue), samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7 m urea). The gel was dried, and the radioactivity was visualized using the GS-525 molecular imager system (31Matsui E. Kawasaki S. Ishida H. Ishikawa K. Kosugi Y. Kikuchi H. Kawarabayashi Y. Matsui I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18297-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). According to the genomic sequence of P. horikoshii, the PH0109 gene encodes a protein of 1188 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 137 kDa. The PH0109 gene was first cloned into pET-21b to yield a construct encoding a fusion protein tagged at the COOH terminus with VEHHHHHH (Fig. 1). The newly constructed plasmid was designated pET-Dna2PhoS(21b). Dna2Pho was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL. However, the majority of the protein was in insoluble fractions. The Dna2 homologue (Dna2Pab) fromP. abyssi is longer by 124 amino acids at the NH2-terminal region than Dna2Pho. Another initiation codon (TTG), corresponding to the initiation codon (GTG) of Dna2Pab, is located 366 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon (GTG) of Dna2Pho. Therefore, the ORF coding Dna2Pho was elongated by 122 amino acids (Fig. 2). To obtain a soluble recombinant protein, the elongated Dna2Pho was inserted into pET-21b to yield a construct encoding a fusion protein tagged at the COOH terminus with VEHHHHHH (predicted mass, 153 kDa, designated pET-Dna2PhoL(21b)) (Fig. 1). Although Dna2Pho protein was successfully expressed in the soluble fraction using pET-Dna2PhoL(21b), only a small amount was purified (data not shown). The gene encoding one ORF (PH0108) is found upstream of the Dna2Pho gene. Since the subunits of DNA polymerase (DP1Pho and DP2Pho) from P. horikoshii were successfully overexpressed in soluble fractions using a co-expression vector as previously described (22Shen Y. Musti K. Hiramoto M. Kikuchi H. Kawarabayashi Y. Matsui I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 29: 27376-27383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar), to obtain large amounts of purified Dna2Pho, a co-expression vector designated pET-PH0108/Dna2Pho(21b) was constructed, although the function of PH0108 protein was unknown. In this vector, the PH0108 and Dna2Pho genes were connected in tandem into two ORFs. The two genes are transcribed under the control of a single transcription promoter and terminator (T7 promoter and T7 terminator). PH0108 and Dna2Pho are expressed as native and His-tagged forms of proteins, respectively (Fig. 1). Both of them were successfully expressed in soluble fractions. Dna2Pho protein was purified in larger amounts using the co-expression system than with pET-Dna2PhoL(21b) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.3 shows the SDS-PAGE of the purified sample. A major protein band of His-tagged Dna2Pho around 150 kDa and a minor protein band around 22 kDa were observed, whereas a band for PH0108 was not detected. The amino-terminal sequence of the 22 kDa protein was determined as MKVAKDLVVSL, which completely agreed with the amino-terminal sequence of FKBP-type peptidyl-prolylcis-trans-isomerase protein (FKBP-PPIase) (21 kDa) fromE. coli (32Wuelfing C. Lomardero J. Plueckthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an intimate interaction between Dna2Pho and a chaperon-like protein, FKBP-PPIase. Since we could not separate Dna2Pho from FKBP-PPIase with any further purification steps, this protein sample was used for the experiments in this report. We also constructed a co-expression vector that produced PH0108 His-tagged at the COOH terminus and the native form of Dna2Pho. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that there was no band of Dna2Pho protein after nickel column chromatography (data not shown). These results may indicate that Dna2Pho does not interact with PH0108 or that the interaction between them is weak. Therefore, pET-PH0108/Dna2Pho(21b) was used to obtain a large amount of the purified Dna2Pho protein. It is not known what effect addition of the His tag may have had on the activities of Dna2Pho, although it is clear that the tagged protein has retained the DNA helicase and the nuclease activities.Figure 3SDS-PAGE of the purified Dna2 homologue fromP. horikoshii (Dna2Pho).

This mutation affects ATPase, helicase, and nuclease activities. The amino acid residue corresponding to Pro504 of the Dna2Sce is not observed in Dna2Pho based on the alignment of amino acid sequences (data not shown), whereas Asp142, Glu155, and Tyr173 are found in the RecB-like motif of Dna2Pho equivalent to the catalytic residues of Dna2, Asp657, Glu675, and Tyr693, respectively (36Budd M.E.

The cysteine cluster conserved among eukaryotic Dna2 proteins is also observed in archaeal Dna2 homologues. However, the function of this cluster is still unknown (35Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Dna2Pho possesses seven typical helicase motifs (I, Ia, II, III, IV, V, and VI) (33Gorbalenya A.E.

The sequence (GTGKT) in the walker A box, the NTP binding motif within motif I as shown in Fig. 2, is completely conserved. Although many residues are conserved within RecB-like nuclease and helicase motifs, no conserved residues were identified in other regions. Dna2Pho possesses a RecB-like nuclease motif and helicase motifs. However, the location of these motifs in Dna2Pho is different from that in Dna2Sce (Fig. 2,upper panel). Since theinset in Fig. 4 shows that Dna2Pho hydrolyzed ATP in a dose-dependent manner, Dna2Pho (30 ng) was added to the reaction mixture for the ATPase assay. Pur"

Sixteen glutathioneS-transferase-Ap4A hydrolase fusion proteins were expressed and their k cat andK m values determined after removal of the glutathione S-transferase domain. As expected for a Nudix hydrolase, the wild type k cat of 23 s−1 was reduced by 105-, 103-, and 30-fold, respectively, by replacement of the conservedP 4-phosphate-binding catalytic residues Glu56, Glu52, and Glu103 by Gln.K m values were not affected, indicating a lack of importance for substrate binding. In contrast, mutating His31 to Val or Ala and Lys83 to Met produced 10- and 16-fold increases in K m compared with the wild type value of 8.8 μm. These residues stabilize theP 1-phosphate. H31V and H31A had a normalk cat but K83M showed a 37-fold reduction ink cat. Lys36 also stabilizes theP 1-phosphate and a K36M mutant had a 10-fold reduced k cat but a relatively normalK m. Thus both Lys36 and Lys83 may play a role in catalysis. The previously suggested roles of Tyr27, His38, Lys79, and Lys81 in stabilizing theP 2 and P 3-phosphates were not confirmed by mutagenesis, indicating the absence of phosphate-specific binding contacts in this region. Also, mutating both Tyr76 and Tyr121, which clamp one substrate adenosine moiety between them in the crystal structure, to Ala only increased K m 4-fold. It is concluded that interactions with the P 1- andP 4-phosphates are minimum and sufficient requirements for substrate binding by this class of enzyme, indicating that it may have a much wider substrate range then previously believed.

Structurally and mechanistically, they fall into two groups. The symmetrically cleaving enzymes (EC 3.6.1.41), such as Escherichia coli ApaH, generate 2-ADP from Ap4A, whereas the asymmetrically cleaving enzymes (EC 3.6.1.17) produce AMP and ATP (1Guranowski A.

A water ligand of this ion is oriented or deprotonated for nucleophilic attack by Glu53, which is itself oriented by Arg52. A second metal ion is complexed to the substrate and neutralizes the charge on the attacked phosphate while Lys39 activates the NMP leaving group (18Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J.

Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The contributions of the other residues to catalysis were also confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis: E53Q, E56Q, and E44Q led to 104.7-, 25-, and 14-fold decreases ink cat, respectively (20Harris T.K. Wu G. Massiah M.A. Mildvan A.S.

The principle of this catalytic mechanism appears to be well conserved among the Nudix hydrolases, including the lupin andBartonella bacilliformis Ap4A hydrolases (15Swarbrick J.D. Bashtannyk T.

Among the asymmetrically cleaving Ap4A hydrolases, identification of residues responsible for substrate binding as well as catalysis is of interest for two reasons. First, it will help our understanding of the evolution of substrate specificity among the Nudix hydrolases. Second, if the plant-type Ap4A hydrolase of invasive pathogenic bacteria is to be considered as a target for new antibacterial agents, the design of such agents will require knowledge of the subtle differences between the plant and animal types if selectivity is to be achieved. Recently we reported the crystal structure of an animal Ap4A hydrolase from the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans in both free form and after crystallization in the presence of the substrate analogue, AppCH2ppA (27Bailey S. Sedelnikova S.E. Blackburn G.M. Abdelghany H.M. Baker P.J. McLennan A.G. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Bailey S.

The structure of the resulting binary complex allowed some predictions to be made about the importance of certain residues for substrate binding and catalysis and comparisons to be drawn with the lupin enzyme. Here, we extend these studies to include the effects of 19 site-specific mutations on Ap4A binding and hydrolysis by the C. elegans enzyme. Total RNA was isolated and purified from washed adult nematodes (C. elegans strain N2) using Trizol solution (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length C. elegans first strand cDNA was synthesized from this RNA using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (MPI Fermentas). RNA (2 μl of 2.5 μg/μl) was added to 10 μl of RNase-free ddH2O. The solution was mixed gently, incubated at 70 °C for 5 min, and chilled on ice for 3 min before adding to a mixture containing 4 μl of 5× reaction buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 25 °C, 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2,5 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μl of ribonuclease inhibitor (20 units/μl), 2 μl of oligo(dT)18 (0.5 μg/μl), 2 μl of dNTPs (10 mm each), and 2 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (20 units/μl,Promega). The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h, and then heated to 90 °C for 5 min. The library was stored at −20 °C. A cDNA corresponding to the C. elegans Y37H9A.6 Ap4A hydrolase gene (6Abdelghany H.M. Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. Bailey S. Rafferty J.B. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was amplified from the cDNA library by PCR using the forward and reverse primers d(CAGCGCCAGAATTCAATGGTCGTAAAAGCCGCGGG) and d(GAAATTACTCGAGAAAAATCGTTAAAATCCGGC), respectively. These primers provided an EcoRI restriction site at the start of amplified cDNA and a XhoI site at the end. After amplification with Taq DNA polymerase, the DNA was recovered, digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and the required restriction fragment ligated between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-6P-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting construct, pGEX-Y37H9A, encoded the 137-amino acid Ap4A hydrolase fused to the C terminus of GST through a 6-amino acid linker. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR reactions contained pGEX-Y37H9A as template, Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase, and pairs of complementary oligonucleotide primers 37 to 43 nucleotides long containing the required mutations (Table I). Each reaction volume was 50 μl and contained the following: 50–100 ng of plasmid DNA, 125 ng of each mutagenic primer, 200 μm dNTPs, 10 mmKCl, 6 mm (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 units ofPfu Turbo DNA polymerase. The PCR reaction protocol consisted of 2 min at 95 °C followed by 16 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 14 min, followed by a final incubation at 72 °C for 15 min. Parental DNA was digested with 10 units of DpnI to degrade the methylated parental strands and the remaining plasmid DNA was used to transform E. coliXL1-Blue cells. For production of the Y76A/Y121A double mutant, the Y76A DNA construct was used as template in a PCR containing the Y121A mutagenic primers (Table I). The identities of all mutants were verified by complete sequencing of both DNA strands.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for site-directed mutagensis of Ap4A hydrolaseMutationPrimer namePrimer sequencesLengthntY27A TAT → GCGY27A upstreamCTCCTGCTTCAAGCCTCCGCGCCACCACATCACTGGACCCC41Y27A downstreamGGGGTCCAGTGATGTGGTGGCGCGGAGGCTTGAAGCAGGAGY27D TAT → GACY27D upstreamCTCCTGCTTCAAGCCTCCGACCCACCACATCACTGGACCCC41Y27D downstreamGGGGTCCAGTGATGTGGTGGGTCGGAGGCTTGAAGCAGGAGH31A CAC → GCCH31A upstreamGCCTCCTATCCACCACATGCCTGGACCCCACCAAAAGGTC40H31A downstreamGACCTTTTGGTGGGGTCCAGGCATGTGGTGGATAGGAGGCH31V CAC → GTCH31V upstreamGCCTCCTATCCACCACATGTCTGGACCCCACCAAAAGGTCACG43H31V downstreamCGTGACCTTTTGGTGGGGTCCAGACATGTGGTGGATAGGAGGCW32G TGG → GGGW32G upstreamCCTATCCACCACATCACGGGACCCCACCAAAAGG34W32G downstreamCCTTTTGGTGGGGTCCCGTGATGTGGTGGATAGGK36M AAA → ATGK36M upstreamCCACCACATCACTGGACCCCACCAATGGGTCACGTGGATCC41K36M downstreamGGATCCACGTGACCCATTGGTGGGGTCCAGTGATGTGGTGGH38G CAC → GGGH38G upstreamCACTGGACCCCACCAAAAGGTGGGGTGGATCCAGGAGAAG40H38G downstreamCTTCTCCTGGATCCACCCCACCTTTTGGTGGGGTCCAGTGH38K CAC → AAGH38K upstreamCACTGGACCCCACCAAAAGGTAAGGTGGATCCAGGAGAAG40H38K downstreamCTTCTCCTGGATCCACCTTACCTTTTGGTGGGGTCCAGTGE52Q GAG → CAGE52Q upstreamGAATGGCAGGCGGCAATTCGTCAGACTAAGGAAGAAGC38E52Q downstreamGCTTCTTCCTTAGTCTGACGAATTGCCGCCTGCCATTCE56Q GAA → CAAE56Q upstreamGGCAATTCGTGAGACTAAGGAACAAGCTAATATTACAAAAG41E56Q downstreamCTTTTGTAATATTAGCTTGTTCCTTAGTCTCACGAATTGCCY76A TAT → GCTY76A upstreamCATGAAACACTCTTTGCTGAGGCAAAAGGGAAGCCAAAATC41Y76A downstreamGATTTTGGCTTCCCTTTTGCCTCAGCAAAGAGTGTTTCATGK79M AAA → ATGK79M upstreamGAAACACTCTTTTATGAGGCAATGGGGAAGCCAAAATCAGTG42K79M downstreamCACTGATTTTGGCTTCCCCATTGCCTCATAAAAGAGTGTTTCK81M AAG → ATGK81M upstreamGAGGCAAAAGGGATGCCAAAATCAGTGAAATATTGGC37K81M downstreamGCCAATATTTCACTGATTTTGGCATCCCTTTTGCCTCK83M AAA → ATGK83M upstreamGAGGCAAAAGGGAAGCCAATGTCAGTGAAATATTGGC37K83M downstreamGCCAATATTTCACTGACATTGGCTTCCCTTTTGCCTCE103Q GAA → CAAE103Q upstreamCGACGTTCAACTATCTCATCAACATCAAAATTGGAAATGG40E103Q downstreamCCATTTCCAATTTTGATGTTGATGAGATAGTTGAACGTCGY121A TAC → GCCY121A upstreamGATGCTATCAAAATTGCCGATGCCGCTGAAATGGGCAGCC40Y121A downstreamGGCTGCCCATTTCAGCGGCATCGGCAATTTTGATAGCATCNucleotides that are noncomplementary to the template are underlined.

Cultures (250 ml) in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin were grown to anA 600 of 0.7 at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm and incubation continued for 2 h. Induced cells (approximately 1.6 g) were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, washed, and resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold breakage buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane) (E-64, Sigma). Cell suspensions were sonicated and the resulting lysates cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were recovered and applied to columns containing 2.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Columns were washed with 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, followed by 25 ml of PreScission cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol). Following complete elution of the buffer, the outlets were closed and 100 units of PreScission protease in 2.5 ml of cleavage buffer added to the resin and incubated for 18–20 h with gentle rocking at 4 °C. Cleavage of the GST domain from the Ap4A hydrolases was complete after 20 h. Columns were remounted, the resin left to settle, and the free Ap4A hydrolases containing the N-terminal extension GPLGSPNS eluted. Ap4A hydrolase activity was measured using a luciferase-based bioluminescence assay as previously described (6Abdelghany H.M. Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. Bailey S. Rafferty J.B. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One ng enzyme protein was used in each case, except for K83M (10 ng), K79M (20 ng), E52Q and E103Q (60 ng), and E56Q (600 ng). This sensitive, continuous assay permits direct evaluation of initial rates. The increase in luminescence was linear for several minutes for each enzyme. Protein concentrations were estimated by the Coomassie Blue binding method (29Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and protein molecular masses were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry as previously described (30Thorne N.M.H. Hankin S. Wilkinson M.C. Nuñez C. Barraclough R. McLennan A.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A cDNA corresponding to the C. elegans Y37H9A.6 Ap4A hydrolase gene was amplified from a cDNA library by PCR and inserted into the pGEX-6P-3 GST fusion vector to generate the recombinant plasmid pGEX-Y37H9A. When E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with this plasmid and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β–d-galactopyranoside, a major soluble 43-kDa band corresponding to the expected GST-Ap4A hydrolase fusion protein was detected (data not shown). The GST domain of this protein was readily removed by on-column cleavage with PreScission protease, resulting in the free Ap4A hydrolase with the N-terminal extension GPLGSPNS and mass 16.6 kDa. Specific mutations were introduced into the Ap4A hydrolase coding region of pGEX-Y37H9A by PCR (Table I). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A total of 16 single mutants and one double mutant involving 13 different residues was generated in this way. Their positions in the primary structure of the Ap4A hydrolase are shown in Fig. 2 A and the locations of their α-carbon atoms in the three-dimensional structure of the binary complex are shown in Fig. 2 B. Each was expressed as a GST fusion protein and purified after on-column cleavage and elution as described for the wild type. The predicted masses of the cleaved proteins were confirmed by mass spectrometry. With the exception of five (K36M, Y76A, Y76A/Y121A, K79M, and W32G) mutant proteins were substantially expressed in the soluble fraction (at least 40% of the total expressed recombinant protein) and the yields of purified proteins were nearly the same as for the wild type. The first four exceptions yielded about 5% of the recombinant protein in a soluble form, whereas W32G was completely insoluble when expressed. All kinetic data were determined using enzymes purified from the soluble fractions, which were all judged to be more than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE. The values of K m(8.8 μm) and k cat (23 s−1) estimated for the N-terminal extended wild type Ap4A hydrolase after cleavage from the GST domain were close to those previously reported for the native recombinant enzyme purified by conventional procedures (7.0 μm and 27 s−1, respectively) (6Abdelghany H.M. Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. Bailey S. Rafferty J.B. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). From this we conclude that the 8-amino acid N-terminal extension does not interfere significantly with the binding of the substrate or with catalysis. The linearity of light output from the luminometric assay used was the same for all mutants as for the wild type, indicating the stability of the mutants under assay conditions. K m and kcatvalues were then determined for each mutant enzyme to determine the effects of each mutation on substrate binding and catalysis (Table II). For this enzyme,K m can be taken to approximate the dissociation constant of the ES complex(es), and hence as an inverse measure of affinity, based on the lack of effect of active site (k cat) mutants on the value ofK m. Previous mutational studies with Nudix hydrolases have highlighted the importance of the Glu residues within the Nudix motif for catalysis (Fig. 1) (16Maksel D. Gooley P.R. Swarbrick J.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3240-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, therefore, the E56Q mutation was found to result in a 105-fold reduction ink cat and virtual abolition of detectable enzyme activity, exactly as was found for the equivalent residue (Glu59) in the lupin Ap4A hydrolase; in contrast, the K m was unaffected, indicating that the mutation has no effect on substrate binding. Similarly, neutralization of the charge on Glu52, the second of the three highly conserved Glu residues within the Nudix motif, by conversion to Gln (E52Q) reduced k cat by a factor of 103 but again had little effect on K m(Table II). On the basis of the 105-fold reduction ink cat, we previously proposed that Glu56 was most likely to be the catalytic base that deprotonates the attacking water molecule. However, the structural equivalents of Glu52 in the lupin Ap4A hydrolase (Glu55) and in the E. coli MutT protein (Glu53) have been proposed as the deprotonating base (11Guranowski A. Brown P. Ashton P.A. Blackburn G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Maksel D. Gooley P.R. Swarbrick J.D. Guranowski A. Gange C. Blackburn G.M. Gayler K.R. Biochem.

Glu103, although not in the Nudix motif, is positioned close to it in the three-dimensional structure and coordinates two of the four Mg2+ ions located in the catalytic site (27Bailey S. Sedelnikova S.E. Blackburn G.M. Abdelghany H.M. Baker P.J. McLennan A.G. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). E103Q has a 30-fold lowerk cat than the wild type and a similarK m. The equivalent mutations in E. coliMutT (E98Q) and the lupin Ap4A hydrolase (E125Q) produced 6.3- and 140-fold reductions in k cat, respectively (16Maksel D. Gooley P.R. Swarbrick J.D. Guranowski A. Gange C. Blackburn G.M. Gayler K.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Harris T.K. Wu G. Massiah M.A. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1655-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whereas these values suggest that Glu103 and its equivalents are unlikely to be the catalytic base in these enzymes, a detailed structural analysis of E. coli ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase has led to the conclusion that the equivalent Glu162 has this role in that enzyme (33Gabelli S.B.

Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, although the architecture of the catalytic sites are broadly similar among the Nudix hydrolases, the mechanism of proton abstraction from the attacking water/hydroxyl appears to be subtly different in different family members.Table IIKinetic constants for Ap4A hydrolysis by the wild type and mutant Ap4A hydrolasesMutationsk catK nts−1μmWild type238.8Y27A2611Y27D2916H31A1273H31V14110W32GND2-aND, not determined.NDK36M2.113H38G315.8H38K314.1E52Q0.00525.3E56Q0.000247.9Y76A2.059Y76A + Y121A1.133K79M0.1615K81M3020K83M0.60140E103Q0.755.8Y121A1475Values are the means of duplicate determination.

Kinetic constants were determined directly by nonlinear regression analysis of the data. Whereas several mutational studies of Nudix hydrolases have highlighted the importance to catalysis of particular residues in and adjacent to the catalytic motif, less attention has been focused on residues elsewhere that may be involved in substrate recognition and binding as well as catalysis. The crystal structure of the C. elegansAp4A hydrolase binary complex showed that the adenine ring in the “AMP-binding pocket” distal to theP 4-phosphate (the site of nucleophilic attack) was sandwiched between the phenolic rings of Tyr76 and Tyr121 and formed extensive π-π stacking interactions with these residues. To achieve this, a 90° rotation of the phenolic ring of Tyr121 about the χ1 dihedral angle and an associated shift in Tyr76 occurred upon substrate binding (27Bailey S. Sedelnikova S.E. Blackburn G.M. Abdelghany H.M. Baker P.J. McLennan A.G. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both of these residues are highly conserved in structure-based sequence alignments of animal and plant Ap4A hydrolases. This, coupled with further interactions between the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr121 and the 2′-OH of the attached ribose and between the ring of Tyr76 and the ribose O4oxygen suggested that both Tyr residues should be important for substrate binding, therefore the effects of replacing each with Ala were investigated. As expected, both Y76A and Y121A showed an increasedK m, but only by a factor of about 8 (Table II). Surprisingly, the combination of mutations in the double mutant Y76A/Y121A appeared to reduce the K m, again such that it was only 4-fold higher than the wild type. This suggests that the substrate may be able to bind effectively in a way that is independent of the Tyr residues (see “Discussion”). This alternative binding does lead to a lower catalytic rate, as evidenced by the reduced k cat values (20-fold less in the double mutant). The crystal structure of the binary complex also showed that theP 1-phosphate attached to the above adenosine moiety is stabilized on the enzyme via a series of hydrogen bonds/salt bridges between the phosphate oxygens and the side chain NZ nitrogens of Lys36 and Lys83, the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr76, and the side chain imidazole ring Nε2 of His31 (27Bailey S. Sedelnikova S.E. Blackburn G.M. Abdelghany H.M. Baker P.J. McLennan A.G. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Replacement of His31 with Ala (H31A) or Val (H31V) had a significant and specific impact on the binding of Ap4A, increasing theK m 8–12-fold while only marginally reducingk cat. Loss of the NZ nitrogen of Lys83 (K83M) led to an even greater increase inK m (16-fold) but in this casek cat was also substantially reduced (37-fold). The K36M mutant also had a reduced k cat(10-fold) but a relatively normal K m. These results confirm the predictions of the crystal structure and indicate the importance of Lys36 and Lys83, which is positioned such that it could also stabilize theP 2-phosphate, to catalysis (27Bailey S. Sedelnikova S.E. Blackburn G.M. Abdelghany H.M. Baker P.J. McLennan A.G. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As there was no interpretable electron density for either theP 2- or P 3-phosphates in the binary complex, it was suggested that the side chains of His38 (within the Nudix motif) plus Lys79, Lys81, and Tyr27 (outside the Nudix motif) might be in appropriate positions to participate inP 2- and P 3-phosphate stabilization either by direct interaction or by metal coordination. The main chain amide of His38 is also the only direct protein contact with P 4 via a hydrogen bond to one of the oxygen atoms (27Bailey S. Sedelnikova S.E. Blackburn G.M. Abdelghany H.M. Baker P.J. McLennan A.G. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Potentially, His38(structurally equivalent to Lys39 in the E. coliMutT protein) and/or Lys79 and/or Lys81 could neutralize the developing negative charge on the ATP leaving group, in much the same way as has been proposed for MutT Lys39 (18Lin J. Abeygunawardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,20Harris T.K. Wu G. Massiah M.A. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1655-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, appropriate mutants were generated to test these suggestions. Surprisingly, of the mutants analyzed (Y27A, Y27D, H38G, H38K, K79M, and K81M), only K79M showed a significant change in any kinetic constant, a substantial 140-fold reduction ink cat. However, Lys79, like Tyr27, is not well conserved among the Ap4A hydrolases, so this reduced activity may reflect a slight structural alteration in the protein rather than an important catalytic role. In contrast, Lys81 is well conserved as a basic residue in animal and plant Ap4A hydrolases. However, its mutation to Met resulted in a slight increase in k cat to 30 s−1, so it seems unlikely to be involved in stabilizing the leaving group. H38G and H38K also showed slight increases ink cat such that thek cat/K m ratio was 2.5-fold higher than the wild type. The equivalent residue in plant Ap4A hydrolases is a Gly, so, unlike Lys39 in MutT, His38 does not appear to be important for catalysis either. As all other residues in the region are too small to make contact, the conclusion is that there are few, if any, structurally or mechanistically important binding contacts for theP 2- and P 3-phosphates. This interesting point is discussed further below. Finally, Trp32 is a completely conserved residue among Ap4A hydrolases of the Nudix family and is commonly found in other family members. This residue does not form interactions with the substrate but appears to stabilize the protein fold through interactions with Leu22 and Gln24 in the βB strand and with Ile118 in the αII helix (27Bailey S.

Consistent with this essential structural role is the fact that the W32G mutant was completely insoluble and inactive when expressed. The results of this analysis confirm the importance of residues previously implicated by structural analysis in binding and catalysis at the P 4-phosphate and binding of theP 1-phosphate of Ap4A by the C. elegans Ap4A hydrolase. It also provides important information on two further aspects of substrate binding by this enzyme that have implications for substrate recognition in the Nudix hydrolase family as a whole. First, there appear to be few, if any, important binding contacts for the P 2- andP 3-phosphates. Our previous structural analysis was unable to provide this information. It is possible that a nucleotide-bound metal ion is more important for stabilization of the negative charge during catalysis than any individual amino acid side chain. Such an ion appears to be required by the B. bacilliformis Ap4A hydrolase (23Conyers G.B. Wu G. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2347-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the E. coli ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (33Gabelli S.B. Bianchet M.A. Ohnishi Y. Ichikawa Y. Bessman M.J. Amzel L.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9279-9285Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the apparent absence of specific interactions in this region is entirely consistent with our recent discovery that this and related dinucleoside polyphosphate hydrolases can bind and hydrolyze 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (35Fisher D.I. Safrany S.T. Strike P. McLennan A.G. Cartwright J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47313-47317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this case the ribose ring would occupy theP 2,P 3 site, with binding dependent solely on interactions in the P 1 andP 4 sites, in agreement with the data above. Second, the mutational data relating to Tyr76 and Tyr121 were somewhat unexpected. The 90° rotation of the phenolic ring of Tyr121 in the binary complex compared with the apoenzyme and the π-π stacking interactions between both rings and the adenine ring of the adenosine moiety attached to theP 1-phosphate originally suggested an essential role for these residues. However, substitution of both Tyr residues by Ala did not have the expected dramatic effect on substrate binding and yielded only a 4-fold increase in K m. Again, this is consistent with the finding that 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, which lacks a base altogether, is a substrate. Thus, binding of one adenine ring between the Tyr residues is not an essential requirement for catalysis, although it undoubtedly contributes to the higher specificity constant for Ap4A compared with 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (35Fisher D.I. Safrany S.T. Strike P. McLennan A.G. Cartwright J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47313-47317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the NMR structure of the lupin Ap4A hydrolase complexed with the substrate analogue ATP-MgFx, the adenine ring is not located between the structurally equivalent residues Tyr77and Phe144, and instead Tyr77 is suggested to be important for the structural integrity of the enzyme-substrate complex rather than for direct substrate binding (17Fletcher J.I. Swarbrick J.D. Maksel D. Gayler K.R. Gooley P.R. Structure. 2002; 10: 205-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although structurally very similar, plant and animal Ap4A hydrolases typically show only 25–30% sequence similarity outside the Nudix motif and appear to form two distinct evolutionary groups within the family (6Abdelghany H.M. Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. Bailey S. Rafferty J.B. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, either the animal and plant enzymes differ substantially in the way they bind substrate, or the possibility exists that Ap4A can bind to both Ap4A hydrolases in two different ways. Conceivably, one site represents the true substrate binding site before hydrolysis whereas the other is a transitional site for the ATP leaving group. Indeed, in view of the lack of electron density for the P 2- andP 3-phosphates and the second adenosine moiety in the crystal structure of the C. elegans binary complex, we have suggested that the analogue AppCH2ppA was probably hydrolyzed during crystallization (27Bailey S. Sedelnikova S.E. Blackburn G.M. Abdelghany H.M. Baker P.J. McLennan A.G. Rafferty J.B. Structure. 2002; 10: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the visible AMP may be the AppCH2p product with its mobileP 2- and P 3-phosphates disordered in the crystal lattice and therefore invisible, or even the AMP product that has re-bound between the Tyr residues after departure of the ATP. If binding of the adenine ring between Tyr76and Tyr121 is not essential, this could also explain our observations that phosphonate analogues with isopolar halomethylene groups bridging P 1 and P 2and P 3 and P 4 such as ApCHFppCHFpA, andP 1,P 4-thiophosphates such as ApspppsA can be cleaved symmetrically by Nudix Ap4A hydrolases (14McLennan A.G. Taylor G.E. Prescott M. Blackburn G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Blackburn G.M. Taylor G.E. Thatcher G.R. Prescott M. McLennan A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6991-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This requires attack atP 2 or P 3. Assuming that the loop-helix-loop structural motif containing the catalytic residues cannot move significantly, symmetrical hydrolysis implies that the substrate is bound in such a way as to presentP 3 rather than the usualP 4 to the attacking nucleophile. Thus, substrates are able to bind in more than one location. Taken together, the ability of some Nudix hydrolases to use non-nucleotide substrates such as 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates and the flexibility of substrate binding noted above suggest that the substrate range and function of Nudix hydrolases may be much wider than previously believed."

Previously, we developed a cleavage site variant of eIF4G-1, termed eIF4G-1SM, that was 100-fold more resistant to in vitro cleavage by Coxsackievirus 2A protease (2APro) than wild-type eIF4G-1 (eIF4G-1WT), but it was still digested at high protease concentrations.

Upon infection of mammalian cells with picornaviruses of the rhino-, aphtho-, and enterovirus genera, most host protein synthesis is shut off coincident with the appearance of viral proteins (1Ehrenfeld E.

These extended the open reading frame by an additional 156 codons to produce a theoretical polypeptide of 172 kDa, termed eIF4G-1e (24Bradley C.A. Padovan J.C. Thompson T.L. Benoit C.A. Chait B.T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12559-12571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, an even longer form, eIF4G-1f, was detected by mass spectrometric analysis (24Bradley C.A. Padovan J.C. Thompson T.L. Benoit C.A. Chait B.T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12559-12571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). eIF4G-1e and eIF4G-1f contain the binding site for PABP, but eIF4G-1a does not (Fig. 1).Cleavage of eIF4G-1 by 2APro was initially thought to be the major mechanism utilized by entero- and rhinoviruses to shut down host protein synthesis and allow viral protein synthesis to continue by IRES-driven translation (1Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar). Subsequently, evidence has been presented that eIF4G-1 cleavage is not responsible, or is only partially responsible, for the shutoff of host protein synthesis. When cells are infected with poliovirus in the presence of a viral replication inhibitor, eIF4G-1 is completely degraded, but host protein synthesis is only partially shut off (27Bonneau A.M. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Perez L. Carrasco L. Virology. 1992; 189: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, ionophores block the host shutoff but not eIF4G cleavage (29Irurzun A. Sanchez-Palomino S. Novoa I. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7453-7460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of poliovirus 2APro in COS-1 cells has a much greater inhibitory effect on transcription by RNA polymerase II than on translation, suggesting that both processes may be involved in the host shutoff (30Davies M.V. Pelletier J. Meerovitch K. Sonenberg N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14714-14720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo expression of 2APro alone activates viral mRNA translation, independent of its role in the host shutoff (31Hambidge S.J. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10272-10276Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,32Macadam A. Ferguson G. Fleming T. Stone D. Almond J. Minor P.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) by introduction of exogenous 2APro results in only a modest reduction of protein synthesis. Cleavage of eIF4G-2 appears to correlate better with host shutoff than that of eIF4G-1 (35Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Finally, PABP is also cleaved during Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3; Ref. 36Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and poliovirus (37Joachims M. Van Breugel P.C. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 718-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) infection; partial cleavage coincides with the most rapid period of viral protein synthesis, whereas complete cleavage coincides with the cessation of viral protein synthesis (36Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that events accompanying picornavirus infection other than eIF4G-1 cleavage are responsible, wholly or partly, for the host shutoff.Creating an eIF4G-1 variant that is resistant to 2AProwould provide a useful tool to study the mechanism of host protein synthesis shutoff upon viral infection. Previously, we determined the cleavage site in eIF4G-1 for HRV2 and CVB4 2APro (10Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and developed a variant form in which the Gly in the P1′-position was changed to Glu (38Lamphear B.J. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15726-15733Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Even though the variant (eIF4G-1aSM) was 100-fold more resistant to cleavage than eIF4G-1aWT, it was still digested, at sufficiently high protease concentrations and extended incubation times, into fragments of approximately the same size as those derived from eIF4G-1aWT. This raised the question of whether cleavage occurred at the same or a different site.In the present study, we have mapped the CVB4 2AProcleavage site in eIF4G-1SM and found it to be different from the site in eIF4G-1WT. We used this information to create a second variant in which both cleavage sites were altered, eIF4G-1DM. This variant is 1,000–10,000-fold more resistant to CVB4 2APro than eIF4G-1WT in vitro. eIF4G-1DM was capable of restoring cap-dependent protein synthesis after 2AProexpression both in vitro and in vivo.DISCUSSIONComparison of the cleavage sites for 2APro in the viral polyproteins of 22 entero- and rhinoviruses yields the consensus sequence Leu-Thr-Thr-X↓Gly-Pro … (P4-P3-P2-P1↓P1′-P2′ …; see Ref. 45Blom N. Hansen J. Blaas D. Brunak S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The most conserved positions are P1′, which is Gly in all cases, and P2, which is Thr in 16 out of 22 cases. The 2APro of HRV2 and CVB4 cleave eIF4G-1 initially at Leu679-Ser-Thr-Arg ↓ Gly, a sequence that contains both of these consensus aa residues (10Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.-D.

Our previous observation that the G683E variant eIF4G-1aSM was still cleaved (38Lamphear B.J. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15726-15733Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), albeit 100-fold more slowly than eIF4G-1aWT, meant either that CVB4 2APro had a preference but not an absolute requirement for Gly at P1′ or that it cleaved at another site. Finding a secondary cleavage site between Leu674 and Gly675, 8-aa residues upstream from the primary site, supports the latter mechanism. Whereas the P1′ position in the secondary cleavage site is occupied by the highly conserved Gly, the P2 position is occupied by the less conserved Asn, which occurs in only 2 of the 22 viral polyprotein sequences (45Blom N. Hansen J. Blaas D. Brunak S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This may account for the slower rate of cleavage at the secondary site. It is possible that both sites are cleaved in eIF4G-1WT, but our method of analyzing cpC by Edman sequencing detects only the downstream site (10Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even if this occurs, the results of Fig. 3 indicate that the secondary cleavage is ∼100-fold slower. Interestingly, the Lb protease of foot-and-mouth virus, which is a Papain-like protease, cleaves eIF4G-1 between Gly675 and Arg676 (46Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only 1-aa residue from the secondary cleavage site of CVB4 2APro. Thus, this region of eIF4G-1 may be particularly accessible to proteases. Because of this proximity of sites, the eIF4G-1DM variant may have some resistance to Lb protease as well.Careful examination of the immunoblots in Fig. 3 reveals that the newly synthesized eIF4G-1aWT is cleaved more readily than endogenous eIF4G-1 (Fig. 3, A and B,upper versus lower panels). There are several possible explanations for this as follows: human eIF4G-1 may be a better substrate for CVB4 2APro than rabbit eIF4G-1, because human matches the consensus CVB4 2APro-recognition sequence better than does rabbit (10Lamphear B.J. Yan R. Yang F. Waters D. Liebig H.-D. Klump H. Kuechler E. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19200-19203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); newly synthesized eIF4G-1 may associate more readily with eIF4E, because eIF4G-1 alone is a poorer substrate for HRV2 2APro than the eIF4G-1·eIF4E complex (47Haghighat A. Svitkin Y. Novoa I. Kuechler E. Skern T. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8444-8450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); or eIF4G-1a may be more susceptible to proteolysis than the larger forms.We found that the ability of eIF4G-1eDM to restore translation to 2APro-pretreated MDL was significantly higher than that of eIF4G-1aDM when the system contained natural globin mRNA. By contrast, the activities of eIF4G-1aDM and eIF4G-1eDM were similar with deadenylated globin mRNA. This is most likely explained by the finding of Imataka et al. (25Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) that eIF4G-1e but not eIF4G-1a contains a PABP-binding site. It might be argued that 2APro-pretreated MDL lacks both functional eIF4G-1 and PABP, because the latter is also cleaved by 2APro (36Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Joachims M. Van Breugel P.C. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 718-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have previously shown that PABP cleavage occurs at only approximately one-tenth the rate of eIF4G-1 cleavage (36Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions actually used in the present study, we demonstrated, by immunoblotting with anti-PABP antibodies, that pretreatment of MDL with CVB4 2APro resulted in only one-third cleavage of PABP but complete cleavage of eIF4G-1 (data not shown). The fact that eIF4G-1eDM is able to fully restore translation of globin mRNA indicates that (i) any hypothetical changes to the translational system caused by 2APro pretreatment other than eIF4G cleavage do not affect the overall rate of translation, and (ii) the 2-aa substitution in eIF4G-1eDM does not affect its activity for in vitro translation of capped and polyadenylated mRNA.Co-transfection of stable cell lines expressing eIF4G-1DMisoforms with plasmids that express GFP and 2APro indicated that eIF4G-1DM isoforms substantially protect cap-dependent protein synthesis from inhibition by 2APro in vivo. The response of GFP synthesis to 2APro was opposite depending on how translation of GFP was initiated. Cap-dependent GFP synthesis was dramatically inhibited by 2APro expression, whereas IRES-dependent GFP translation initiation was greatly increased. This latter result agrees with the observation that initiation of both IRES-containing and uncapped mRNAs is either unaffected or even stimulated upon eIF4G cleavage (15Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D. Sommergruber W. Frasel L. Lamphear B. Rhoads R.E. Kuechler E. Skern T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7581-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Ohlmann T. Rau M. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. Kean K.M. RNA (New York). 1997; 3: 186-196PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due to two factors as follows: (i) cpC is more active than intact eIF4G-1 for initiation of IRES-containing mRNAs, and (ii) the inhibition of cap-dependent translation of exogenous mRNAs by 2APro makes limiting components of the translational machinery available for IRES-driven synthesis. Doxycycline-induced expression of eIF4G-1eDM substantially reversed the effects of 2APro in both cases; inhibition of cap-dependent translation by 2APro was relieved (Fig. 9 B), and stimulation of IRES-dependent translation by 2APro was suppressed (Fig. 9 D). For reasons we do not understand, eIF4G-1aDM was able to restore cap-dependent translation (Fig. 9 A) but not suppress the IRES-dependent stimulation (Fig. 9 C).Initial attempts to protect cells against CVB3 infection were not successful. This may be because the amount of exogenous eIF4G-1 was low compared with the endogenous level (Fig. 7). With improved techniques for producing eIF4G-1DM at higher levels in intact cells, it should be possible to use the approach demonstrated here to gain further insight into the cytopathic effect of picornaviruses. Furthermore, because there are numerous isoforms of eIF4G-1 (24Bradley C.A. Padovan J.C. Thompson T.L. Benoit C.A. Chait B.T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12559-12571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), this approach may provide a means of testing them for unique activities or preferential recruitment of mRNA populations. Upon infection of mammalian cells with picornaviruses of the rhino-, aphtho-, and enterovirus genera, most host protein synthesis is shut off coincident with the appearance of viral proteins (1Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar). The shutoff is thought to be mediated by a switch from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation. Extracts from poliovirus-infected cells are unable to carry out cap-dependent translation, but this ability can be restored by addition of initiation factors from uninfected cells (2Rose J.K. Trachsel H. Leong K. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2732-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Helentjaris T. Ehrenfeld E. Brown-Luedi M.L. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13599-13606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF4G was discovered as a result of its proteolysis coincident with the loss of cap-dependent initiation during poliovirus infection (9Etchison D.

The 5′-untranslated region of picornavirus mRNA contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that allows translation to be initiated by the direct binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit (13Pelletier J.

Cleavage of eIF4G drastically inhibits translation of capped mRNAs in vitro, whereas initiation of IRES-containing and uncapped mRNAs is either unaffected or even stimulated (15Liebig H.-D.
