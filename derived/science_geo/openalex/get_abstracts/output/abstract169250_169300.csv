https://openalex.org/W1524848610,"Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS, MIM 120100), commonly known as familial cold urticaria (FCU), is an autosomal-dominant systemic inflammatory disease characterized by intermittent episodes of rash, arthralgia, fever and conjunctivitis after generalized exposure to cold. FCAS was previously mapped to a 10-cM region on chromosome 1q44 (refs. 5,6). Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS; MIM 191900), which also maps to chromosome 1q44, is an autosomal-dominant periodic fever syndrome with a similar phenotype except that symptoms are not precipitated by cold exposure and that sensorineural hearing loss is frequently also present. To identify the genes for FCAS and MWS, we screened exons in the 1q44 region for mutations by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from affected individuals and controls. This resulted in the identification of four distinct mutations in a gene that segregated with the disorder in three families with FCAS and one family with MWS. This gene, called CIAS1, is expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and encodes a protein with a pyrin domain, a nucleotide-binding site (NBS, NACHT subfamily) domain and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif region, suggesting a role in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2088094751,"In humans, the plasma interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration increases dramatically during low-intensity exercise. Measurements across the working limb indicate that skeletal muscle is the source of IL-6 production. To determine whether energy availability influences the regulation of IL-6 expression during prolonged exercise, six male subjects completed two trials consisting of 180 min of two-legged dynamic knee extensor with either normal or low (~60% of control) pre-exercise muscle glycogen levels. Increases in plasma IL-6 during exercise were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the low-glycogen (16-fold) trial verses the control (10-fold) trial. Transcriptional activation of the IL-6 gene in skeletal muscle was also higher in the low-glycogen trial; it increased by about 40-fold after 90 min of exercise and about 60-fold after 180 min of exercise. Muscle IL-6 mRNA followed a similar but delayed pattern, increasing by more than 100-fold in the low-glycogen trial and by about 30-fold in the control trial. These data demonstrate that exercise activates transcription of the IL-6 gene in working skeletal muscle, a response that is dramatically enhanced when glycogen levels are low. These findings also support the hypothesis that IL-6 may be produced by contracting myofibers when glycogen levels become critically low as a means of signaling the liver to increase glucose production."

In contrast to our knowledge about the regulation and execution of apoptosis in animal system, information about plant HR is limited. Recent studies implicated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in regulating plant HR cell death as well as several other defense responses during incompatible interactions between plants and pathogens. Here, we report the generation of transgenic Arabidopsis plants that express the active mutants of AtMEK4 and AtMEK5, two closely related MAPK kinases under the control of a steroid-inducible promoter. Induction of the transgene expression by the application of dexamethasone, a steroid, leads to HR-like cell death, which is preceded by the activation of endogenous MAPKs and the generation of hydrogen peroxide. Both prolonged MAPK activation and reactive oxygen species generation have been implicated in the regulation of HR cell death induced by incompatible pathogens. As a result, we speculate that the prolonged activation of the MAPK pathway in cells could disrupt the redox balance, which leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species and eventually HR cell death.

American Phytopathological Society Press, St. Paul, MN1995Google Scholar). It has long been speculated that the HR cell death and associated dehydration are directly responsible for limiting pathogen growth and development. All pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, and viruses, require a water environment to multiply and acquire nutrients from their hosts. In the case of viral pathogens, cell death/dehydration also affects the plasmodesmata, through which the viruses spread to other cells. In contrast, cell death in a compatible interaction is slow and not associated with quick dehydration. As a result, the pathogen can actually take advantage of the nutrients released during plant cell death and multiply. Recently, an Arabidopsis mutant (dnd1) was isolated that exhibits resistance to certain pathogens in the absence of HR, which suggests that disease resistance can be achieved by more than one mechanism (3Clough S.J. Fengler K.A. Yu I.-C. Lippok B. Smith J.R.K. Bent A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). It is also possible that in some cases, a subset of defense responses may be sufficient to stop pathogen growth. Several lines of evidence suggest that HR cell death during plant disease resistance is a form of programmed cell death because it requires active transcription and translation and is genetically defined (4Pennell R.I.

Although the details for the regulation and execution of HR remain poorly understood, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), altered ion fluxes, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and gene activation have been implicated in the process (7Jabs T.

HR cell death in both suspension cells and plants induced by avirulent pathogens or elicitors can be blocked by kinase inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase(s) (11He S.Y.

Potential targets for these kinase inhibitors could be at the recognition step because several R genes such asPto and Xa21 and the receptor of flagellin, a non-host-specific elicitor, encode protein kinases and/or at the downstream signaling components such as calcium dependent protein kinases and MAPKs (9Martin G.B.

Increasing evidence suggests that plant MAPK cascade is one of the converging points after the perception of different pathogens and pathogen-derived elicitors (18Zhang S. Klessig D.F.

Based on phylogenetic analysis, SIPK, AtMPK6, and salt SIMK are orthologs, whereas WIPK, AtMPK3, and SAMK are orthologs. Members in the WIPK subfamily are also unique in their up-regulation at the transcriptional level by stresses (15Zhang S. Liu Y. Klessig D.F.

Involvement of the SIPK subfamily in the plant defense response was first demonstrated through the biochemical purification and cloning of its encoding gene (27Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). By using a SIPK-specific antibody, SIPK was later shown to be activated by wounding (34Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7225-7230Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); osmotic and salt stresses (35Hoyos M.E. Zhang S.

Xanthi nc tobacco plants (26Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 273-287PubMed Google Scholar). Although all of the above mentioned stresses activate SIPK, the kinetics of activation is different. Activation of SIPK by abiotic stresses such as wounding and high osmolarity is transient, whereas its activation by pathogens or elicitors that induce cell death is long lasting (15Zhang S. Liu Y. Klessig D.F. Plant J. 2000; 23: 339-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7433-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 35Hoyos M.E. Zhang S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that SIPK might function in a common signaling pathway shared by all of these stimuli and, in addition, that the duration of its activation influences the outcome (13Suzuki K. Yano A. Shinshi H. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Zhang S. Liu Y. Klessig D.F. Plant J. 2000; 23: 339-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zhang S. Du H. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar). More direct evidence for the role of SIPK and WIPK in HR cell death came from a conditional gain-of-function study of NtMEK2, the upstream MAPKK of SIPK and WIPK. Expression of NtMEK2DD, a constitutively active mutant of NtMEK2, in a transient transformation analysis induces HR-like cell death in tobacco, which is preceded by the activation of endogenous SIPK and WIPK (38Yang K.-Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Parallel studies of several other tobacco MAPKKs, which failed to activate SIPK or WIPK and induce cell death, demonstrated the specificity of the NtMEK2-SIPK/WIPK cascade. Using a similar approach, activation of SIPK alone was shown to be sufficient to induce HR-like cell death (39Zhang S. Liu Y. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1877-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrated that AtMEK4 and AtMEK5, two closely related Arabidopsis MAPKKs, were functionally interchangeable with NtMEK2 in activating downstream MAPKs. To alleviate the defense responses induced by the Agrobacteriumused in the transient transformation assay, we generated permanent transgenic Arabidopsis plants that express wild type, the active mutants, or the inactive mutants of AtMEK4, AtMEK5, or NtMEK2 under the control of a steroid-inducible promoter. Activation of the endogenous Arabidopsis MAPKs by the active mutant transgenes under induced conditions leads to HR-like cell death, which is preceded by the generation of hydrogen peroxide. Both prolonged MAPK activation and ROS generation have been implicated in the regulation of HR cell death induced by incompatible pathogens. Our results presented in this report suggest that the prolonged activation of the MAPK pathway in cells could disrupt the redox balance and lead to the generation of ROS, which may eventually lead to HR cell death. Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia ecotype) plants were grown at 22 °C in a growth chamber with a 12-h photoperiod at a photon flux density of 100 microeinsteins/m−2 s−1. Unless indicated otherwise, fully expended leaves of 4-week-old plants were used for experiments. Dexamethasone (DEX; 15 μm) was applied by spraying to induce the transgene expression. Samples were taken at the indicated times after the DEX treatment, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Arabidopsis AtMEK4 and AtMEK5cDNAs were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into pBlueScript vector (Stratagene). Primers used were 5′-CATATGAGACCGATTCAATCGCC-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTAAAATTCAGAGACCCTCC-3′ for AtMEK4 and 5′-CATATGAAACCGATTCAATCTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-ATCCAGCTAAAATCACTCTTAAACCA-3′ for AtMEK5. The constitutively active and inactive mutants of the MAPKKs were generated by QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. The MAPKKs and their mutants with a FLAG epitope at their N termini were inserted into the XhoI/SpeI sites of the steroid-inducible pTA7002 binary vector (40Aoyama T. Chua N.-H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region of MAPKKs was replaced with the Ω sequence from tobacco mosaic virus (41Gallie D.R. Sleat D.E. Watts J.W. Turner P.C. Wilson T.M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3257-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These constructs were electroporated intoAgrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1. Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation experiments in tobacco were performed as previously described (38Yang K.-Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Six-week-old tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacumcv. Xanthi nc) grown at 25 °C in a growth room programmed for a 14-h light cycle were used for experiments. Permanent transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated using the flower-dipping method (42Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic lines were selected in the presence of hygromycin. Total protein was extracted from leaf tissue by grinding with small plastic pestles in extraction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 5 μg ml−1 aprotinin, 5% glycerol). After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 40 min, supernatants were transferred into clean tubes, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analyses. The concentration of protein extracts was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For immunoblot analysis, 7 μg of total protein/lane were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) by semidry electroblotting. After blocking for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% no-fat dried milk (Carnation) at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma). Following three washes with Tris-buffered saline buffer, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. The in-gel kinase activity assay was performed as described previously (27Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In brief, 7 μg of protein extracts were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels embedded with 0.1 mg ml−1 myelin basic protein in separating gel as substrate for kinase. After electrophoresis, the SDS was removed from the gel by washing with washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 0.5 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) three times for 30 min each at room temperature. The proteins were then renatured in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF at 4 °C overnight with three changes of the buffer. The gel was incubated at room temperature in 100 ml of reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) for 30 min. Phosphorylation was performed for 1.5 h at room temperature in 30 ml of the same reaction buffer with 200 nm ATP plus 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was stopped by transferring the gel into solution with 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) and 1% sodium pyrophosphate (w/v). The unincorporated radioactivity was subsequently removed by washing the gel for 6 h at room temperature with five changes. The gel was dried on 3MM paper (Whatman) and subjected to autoradiography. Prestained size markers (Bio-Rad) were used to calculate the size of kinases. For immunoprecipitation kinase assays, protein extract (100 μg) with or without peptide competitors (5 μg/ml) was incubated with SIPK-specific antibody, Ab-p48N (2.5 μg), and WIPK-specific antibody, Ab-p44N (2.5 μg), that were raised against peptides corresponding to the N termini of SIPK and WIPK, respectively (26Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7433-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), in the immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C for 2 h on a rocker. Approximately 20 μl (packed volume) of protein A−agarose was added, and the incubation was continued for another 4 h. Agarose bead−protein complexes were pelleted by brief centrifugation and washed three times with 1.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer each. Kinase activity in the complex was determined by an in-gel kinase assay as described above. H2O2 was detected by an endogenous peroxidase-dependent in situhistochemical staining procedure using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (43Thordal-Christensen H. Zhang Z. Wei Y. Collinge D.B. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1187-1194Crossref Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). Leaves treated with DEX were detached and placed in a solution containing 1 mg/ml DAB (pH 5.5) for 2 h. The leaves were boiled in ethanol (96%) for 10 min and then stored in 96% ethanol. H2O2 production is visualized as a reddish-brown coloration. Prolonged activation of SIPK and/or delayed activation of WIPK are associated with HR cell death elicited by pathogens or pathogen-derived elicitors (15Zhang S. Liu Y. Klessig D.F. Plant J. 2000; 23: 339-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7433-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Our recent studies demonstrated that the activation of SIPK and WIPK by NtMEK2DD, an active mutant of NtMEK2, induced HR-like cell death in a transient transformation system (38Yang K.-Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). However, the presence of agrobacterial cells in leaves by themselves induced a number of defense responses, which could complicate the interpretation of the data (44Ditt R.F. Nester E.W. Comai L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10954-10959Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 2K-Y. Yang, Y. Liu, and S. Zhang, unpublished results. The generation of permanent transgenic plants will circumvent this shortcoming. To take advantage of the simple transformation procedure, we decided to generate transgenic Arabidopsis plants using itsNtMEK2 orthologs. A search of fully sequenced Arabidopsis genome revealed a total of 10 MAPKKs (Fig. 1A). Phylogenetic analysis using the Clustal method identified AtMEK4 and AtMEK5, two Arabidopsis MAPKKs that share the highest homology with NtMEK2. Their identities in amino acid sequence to NtMEK2 are 67.5 and 69.3%, respectively. The function of neitherArabidopsis MAPKK has been defined. To examine whether these two Arabidopsis MAPKKs can substitute NtMEK2 to activate downstream MAPKs, we generated active mutants of both AtMEK4 and AtMEK5 by mutating the conserved Ser/Thr in the activation loop ((S/T)XXXXX(S/T)) of plant MAPKKs to Asp (Fig.1B) (38Yang K.-Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Agrobacterial cells that carryAtMEK4DD (T224D/S230D) andAtMEK5DD (T215D/S221D) in steroid-inducible vector pTA7002 were transiently transformed into tobacco. The inactive mutants, in which the catalytic essential Lys in the kinase domain was mutated to Arg, AtMEK4KR (K108R) andAtMEK5KR (K99R) were used as controls. To facilitate the detection of transgene expression, a FLAG epitope tag was attached to the N termini of the transgenes. Newly fully expanded tobacco leaves were infiltrated with agrobacterial cells that carry various constructs, and the transgene expression was induced by the application of DEX (30 μm) 2 days later. As shown in Fig. 2A, leaf sections expressing the active Arabidopsis MAPKK mutants, AtMEK4DD or AtMEK5DD showed high level activation of two endogenous MAPKs. Their molecular masses of 48 and 44 kDa correspond to the sizes of SIPK and WIPK, respectively. SIPK- and WIPK-specific antibodies pulled down these two kinase activities as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation kinase assay (Fig.2B). The addition of peptide competitors, p48N and p44N, to which the antibodies were raised, effectively blocked the immunoprecipitation, demonstrating the specificity of the assay. As a positive control, experiments using NtMEK2DD, which has been shown to activate SIPK and WIPK (38Yang K.-Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), were performed in parallel. The expression of wilt-type proteins, AtMEK4WTand AtMEK5WT, or their inactive mutants, AtMEK4KR and AtMEK5KR, failed to activate any MAPK as determined by in-gel kinase activity assay; even the proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 2A). This is again in good agreement with previous results obtained using NtMEK2WT and NtMEK2KR (Fig. 2A) (38Yang K.-Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The sizes of all proteins matched the predicted sizes based on sequences, with AtMEK5 the smallest one and AtMEK4 and NtMEK2 about the same size (Fig. 2A). It was interesting to note that all of the active mutant proteins showed an up-shift on the SDS-PAGE, which is frequently associated with the phosphorylated forms of proteins. Within 16 h after the induction of AtMEK4DD, AtMEK5DD, or NtMEK2DD expression, cell death in small areas could be seen. By 24 h, the whole area infiltrated with agrobacterial cells carrying AtMEK4DD, AtMEK5DD or NtMEK2DD collapsed (Fig.2C). No cell death was observed in leaf sections transformed with AtMEK4WT, AtMEK4KR, AtMEK5WT, or AtMEK5KR (Fig. 2C). As another control, the transformation of empty pTA7002 vector did not elicit any of the above phenotype either. These results demonstrated thatArabidopsis AtMEK4 and AtMEK5 are able to substitute tobacco NtMEK2 to activate SIPK and WIPK. This also provided additional evidence that the conserved Ser/Thr in the plant MAPKK activation motif is separated by five amino acids instead of the three amino acids found in MAPKKs from yeast and animals (19Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar, 45Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. VandeWounde G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). After the relationship betweenArabidopsis AtMEK4 and AtMEK5 and tobacco NtMEK2 was established, we transformed all the constructs intoArabidopsis by flower dipping method (42Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hygromycin-resistant T1 transgenic plants were selected. A total of 78AtMEK4DD, 75 AtMEK5DD, and 48NtMEK2DD transgenic lines were obtained. Among them, 15 AtMEK4DD, 17 AtMEK5DD, and 12NtMEK2DD lines showed transgene expression upon DEX (15 μm) treatment of detached leaves. All of them showed HR-like cell death and dehydration of the tissue, which were preceded by the activation of two MAPKs (data not shown). In contrast, a similar number of wild type or inactive mutant MAPKK transgenic plants failed to activate endogenous MAPKs and show cell death phenotype; even the transgenes were expressed at similar levels as determined by anti-FLAG antibody (Table I). The correlation between the expression of the active mutants and the HR-like cell death phenotype was also examined in the T2 generation with selected lines that contain a single copy of the transgene. Expression of transgene in randomly selected T2 plants, eight for the active mutant (DD) lines and five for the inactive mutant (KR) lines, were determined after the application of DEX. As shown in Fig. 3, all plants that carried the active mutant transgenes showed elevated levels of endogenous MAPK activities (Fig. 3, middle), which is followed by HR-like cell death (Fig. 3, bottom). In contrast expression of the inactive MAPKK mutants failed to activate endogenous MAPKs and induce cell death. In Arabidopsis, anti-FLAG antibody recognized a nonspecific band of about 45 kDa, which is between the sizes of FLAG-tagged AtMEK4 and AtMEK5 (Figs. 3 and4A).Table ICorrelation between the inducibility of the active AtMEK4, AtMEK5, or NtMEK2 and HR-like cell death in T1 transgenic ArabidopsisConstructTotal transgenic lines obtained1-aTransgenic T1 plants were selected by hygromycin resistance.Lines with inducible transgene1-bDetached leaves were treated with DEX (15 μm) for 24 h, and protein extracts were prepared.

https://openalex.org/W1686085663,"Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is most often caused by hemizygous deletion of a 1.5-Mb interval encompassing at least 17 genes at 7q11.23 (refs. 1,2). As with many other haploinsufficiency diseases, the mechanism underlying the WBS deletion is thought to be unequal meiotic recombination, probably mediated by the highly homologous DNA that flanks the commonly deleted region. Here, we report the use of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to identify a genomic polymorphism in families with WBS, consisting of an inversion of the WBS region. We have observed that the inversion is hemizygous in 3 of 11 (27%) atypical affected individuals who show a subset of the WBS phenotypic spectrum but do not carry the typical WBS microdeletion. Two of these individuals also have a parent who carries the inversion. In addition, in 4 of 12 (33%) families with a proband carrying the WBS deletion, we observed the inversion exclusively in the parent transmitting the disease-related chromosome. These results suggest the presence of a newly identified genomic variant within the population that may be associated with the disease. It may result in predisposition to primarily WBS-causing microdeletions, but may also cause translocations and inversions."
https://openalex.org/W2072738635,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus results from an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells. Cytokines, such as interleukin-1β and interferon-γ, are putative mediators of immune-induced β-cell death and, under in vitroconditions, cause β-cell apoptosis. We have recently shown that interleukin-1β + interferon-γ modifies the expression of >200 genes in β-cells. Several of these genes are putative targets for the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and in subsequent experiments we showed that NF-κB activation is mostly pro-apoptotic in β-cells. To identify cytokine-induced and NF-κB-regulated genes in primary rat β-cells, we presently combined two experimental approaches: 1) blocking of NF-κB activation in cytokine-exposed β-cells by a recombinant adenovirus (AdIκB(SA)2) containing an inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBac) super-repressor (S32A/S36A) and 2) study of gene expression by microarray analysis. We identified 66 cytokine-modified and NF-κB-regulated genes in β-cells. Cytokine-induced NF-κB activation decreased Pdx-1 and increased c-Myc expression. This, together with NF-κB-dependent inhibition of Glut-2, pro-hormone convertase-1, and Isl-1 expression, probably contributes to the loss of differentiated β-cell functions. NF-κB also regulates several genes encoding for chemokines and cytokines in β-cells. The present data suggest that NF-κB is a key “switch regulator” of transcription factors and gene networks controlling cytokine-induced β-cell dysfunction and death.

Lernmark A. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β,1 IFN-γ, and TNF-α, are released in the islets by activated macrophages and T-cells in the early stages of the disease (insulitis) and probably contribute for β-cell death (2Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1005-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 3Rabinovitch A. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 4Eizirk D.L. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 2115-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Blocking cytokine signaling with the use of cytokine antagonists, soluble receptors, or neutralizing antibodies prevents type 1 diabetes mellitus in BB rats and NOD mice (4Eizirk D.L. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 2115-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Under in vitro conditions, IL-1β induces functional impairment in mouse and rat β-cells (5Eizirik D.L. Darville M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S64-S69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, in combination with IFN-γ and/or TNF-α, leads to human, mouse, and rat β-cell death, mostly by apoptosis (4Eizirk D.L. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 2115-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 5Eizirik D.L. Darville M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S64-S69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This form of cell death seems to be the main mode of β-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes mellitus, as shown by studies in several animal models of immune-mediated diabetes (4Eizirk D.L. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 2115-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). β-Cell apoptosis requires prolonged exposure to cytokines (6–9 days) and is preceded by complex modifications in gene expression (5Eizirik D.L. Darville M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S64-S69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify these genes, we have recently utilized microarray analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified rat β-cells exposed for 6 or 24 h to IL-1β or IL-1β + IFN-γ (6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). β-Cell exposure to cytokines leads to induction or down-regulation of ∼200 genes and ESTs (6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). There was a decrease in the expression of several genes related to differentiated β-cell functions, probably caused by down-regulation of genes encoding the transcription factors Pdx-1 and Isl-1, whereas cytokines up-regulated stress response genes. Interestingly, cytokines induced the expression of mRNAs for several chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules. These peptides have the potential to increase mononuclear cell homing and activity during insulitis. Several of the modified genes found by microarray analysis or candidate-gene approach are putative targets for the transcription factor NF-κB (5Eizirik D.L. Darville M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S64-S69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For three of these genes, namely iNOS (7Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1998; 44: 1101-1108Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar), MnSOD (8Darville M.I. Ho Y.-E. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Fas (9Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1741-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the role of NF-κB has been confirmed by functional studies with promoter-luciferase constructs and gel shift analysis. NF-κB is a widely used transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in many cellular responses to environmental changes. NF-κB is formed by homodimers or heterodimers of members of the Rel/NF-κB family of proteins (10Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They can bind to a set of related DNA target sites (κB sites) and directly regulate gene expression. In nonstimulated cells, NF-κB is associated with the inhibitory protein IκBα and remains sequestered in the cytosol (10Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB-regulated genes have been shown to inhibit the apoptotic program in diverse cell types. In a few cell types, however, the transcription factor also acts as apoptosis inducer (11Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Note that most studies suggesting an anti-apoptotic role for NF-κB were performed in tumoral cell lines (11Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), and little information is available on the effects of NF-κB activation on primary, nondividing cells. There is no detectable NF-κB activity in resting β-cells, but, upon exposure to IL-1β, NF-κB is activated and translocates to the nucleus (12Eizirik D.L. Flodström M. Karlsen A.E. Welsh N. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cytokine-induced NF-κB activation by either a recombinant adenovirus (AdIκB(SA)2), containing a nondegradable mutant form of IκBα (S32A, S36A), or by stable transfection with a dominant negative inhibitor of NF-κB, prevents cytokine-induced cell death in respectively human islet cells (13Giannoukakis N. Rudert W.A. Trucco M. Robbins P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 47: 6509-36513Google Scholar) and purified rat β-cells (14Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Jobin C. Leeman R. Darville M. Cardozo A.C. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and in mouse insulin-producing MIN6 cells (15Baker M.S. Chen X. Cao X.C. Kaufman D.B. J. Surg. Res. 2001; 97: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, intravenous administration of a NF-κB “decoy” inhibits alloxan-induced β-cell death and diabetes mellitus in mice (16Quan N. Ho E. Lai W. Tsai Y.-H. Bray T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1616-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that NF-κB activation has mostly pro-apoptotic effects in pancreatic β-cells. However, the nature of the cytokine-induced and NF-κB-regulated genes in pancreatic β-cells remains to be identified. To address this issue, we presently combined two experimental approaches, namely the blocking of NF-κB activation by AdIκB(SA)2 in cytokine-exposed β-cells and a comprehensive study of gene expression by microarray analysis. We identified 66 cytokine-induced genes, which are apparently regulated by NF-κB. This collection of genes is an exciting resource for understanding the function of NF-κB in primary β-cells and provides new insights into the signal transduction of cytokine-induced β-cell dysfunction and death. Pancreatic islets were isolated from 10-week-old male Wistar rats by collagenase digestion, and islet β-cells were purified by autofluorescence-activated cell sorting (17Pipeleers D.G. In't Veld P. van de Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) (FACStar, Becton-Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA). β-Cell aggregates were cultured in suspension at 37 °C in Ham's F-10 medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland), as described previously (18Ling Z. Hannaert J.C. Pipeleers D. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For the microarray analysis, purified rat β-cells were precultured in Ham's medium for 16 h and then infected either with a control virus (AdLuc) or with an IκBα super-repressor virus (AdIκB(SA)2) (described below), or, alternatively, left uninfected. 24 h after infection, the β-cells were exposed to IL-1β + IFN-γ for 24 h. IL-1β (tested at 50 units/ml; 38 units/ng) was a kind gift from Dr. C. W. Reinolds (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and IFN-γ (tested at 1000 units/ml; 10 units/ng) was purchased from Invitrogen. The choice of cytokine concentration and time of exposure is based on our previous data (6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For the confirmation experiments with RT-PCR (see below), one additional control virus, AdGFP, was added. To evaluate the role of NO for some of the cytokine-induced and NF-κB-dependent genes, the iNOS inhibitorNG-methyl-l-arginine (l-MA, 1.0 mm; Sigma, Bornem, Belgium) was used together with IL-1β + IFN-γ. We have shown previously that this concentration of l-MA prevents cytokine-induced NO formation by β-cells (19Ling Z. Chen M.-C. Smismans A. Pavlovic D. Schuit F. Eizirik D.L. Pipeleers D.G. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1540-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Culture media from the cells used for the microarray analysis and iNOS blocker experiments were collected after 24 h of IL-1β + IFN-γ exposure for nitrite determination (nitrite is a stable product of NO oxidation), as described previously (20Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Goglowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10586) Google Scholar). The recombinant replicative-deficient adenovirus containing a mutated nondegradable IκBα, with serines 32 and 36 mutated to alanines (AdIκB(SA)2), and the control virus containing the luciferase gene (AdLuc) were prepared as described previously (21Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Limuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar), and were a kind gift from Dr. C. Jobin (University of California, San Diego, CA). The additional control virus containing the green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) was prepared as described (22He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). β-Cells were infected for 2 h at 37 °C, at m.o.i. 7.5. We have shown previously that AdIκB(SA)2 at this m.o.i. protects β-cells against IL-1β/IFN-γ-induced NO production and apoptosis, but does not affect insulin content or glucose-induced insulin release (14Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Jobin C. Leeman R. Darville M. Cardozo A.C. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For microarray analysis the cells were harvested, total RNA isolated, and biotinylated cRNA samples prepared and hybridized in duplicates to the U34-A oligonucleotide array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as described previously (6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because of difficulties in obtaining a sufficient number of rat β-cells in a single occasion, and to decrease eventual biases because of biological variation, the cells were pooled from four separate experiments, using in each experiment 3.5 × 105 cells/group. We have observed previously that GeneChip analysis, performed in duplicate on pooled β-cell samples, provides a reliable estimation of massive changes in mRNA expression (6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Analysis of differential expression was performed by the software GeneChip Suite (version 4.0.1). Normalization was performed by global scaling, with the arrays scaled to an average intensity of 150. Duplicate hybridizations, using separate sets of chips, were performed for all conditions. A gene was considered to have modified expression if it averaged ≥2.5-fold change in the duplicate arrays. Cytokine-modified genes were considered as NF-κB-dependent when expression was induced or inhibited (≥2.5-fold) in noninfected and AdLuc-infected β-cells, but was prevented by AdIκB(SA)2. Genes whose induction or decrease by cytokines was diminished by at least 50% following AdIκB(SA)2 treatment were also considered NF-κB-dependent. Genes that had similar patterns of expression in the three different comparisons were considered as NF-κB independent.

RT-PCR, using specific primers, was performed to confirm some of the changes in mRNA expression observed in the microarray analysis. The selection of RT-PCR, instead of Northern blot analysis, was motivated by the limited availability of primary β-cells. mRNA isolation and RT-PCR were performed as described previously (23Chen M.-C. Schuit F. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1199-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Liu D. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The number of cycles was selected to allow linear amplification of the cDNAs under study. For semiquantitative PCR, the GAPDH housekeeping gene was used as control. We have shown previously (25Eizirik D.L. Bjorklund A. Cagliero E. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and confirmed in the current experiments that IL-1β and IFN-γ do not affect GAPDH mRNA expression in insulin-producing cells. The primer sequences and their respective PCR fragment lengths were as follows: Glut-2, forward (5′-GGTGTGATCAATGCACCTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTATCTGGGGCTTTCTGGAC-3′) (646 bp); Pdx-1, forward (5′-GGTGCCAGAGTTCAGTGCTA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTATTCTCCTCCGGTTCTGC-3′) (369 bp); c-Myc, forward (5′-AAGGCAGCTCTGGAGTGAGA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTCTCTTCCTCGTCGCAGAT-3′) (410 bp); calbindin, forward (5′-ATGCCAGCAACTGAAGTCCT-3′) and reverse (5′-CCGACAAGGCCATTATGTTC-3′) (449 bp); cholecystokinin-A receptor, forward (5′-TCATGACTCCGTACCCCATT-3′) and reverse (5′-ATCAGGTTGGCAGCTGAACT-3′) (406 bp). The primers for GAPDH, iNOS, Isl-1, IP-10 (rat mob-1), Gadd153/CHOP, and IL-15 were as described in Ref. 6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L.

The ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels were photographed under UV transillumination using a Kodak Digital Science DC 120 camera (Eastman Kodak Co.). The data are presented as a representative figure for three to four similar experiments. Abundance of the GAPDH products were assessed by Biomax one-dimensional image analysis software (Kodak) and expressed in pixel intensities (optical density). Data are presented as means ± S.E., and comparisons between groups were performed by analysis of variance followed by paired t test with the Bonferroni correction. For the microarray experiments, noninfected β-cells, β-cells infected with AdIκB(SA)2, and β-cells infected with AdLuc (control virus) were either exposed for 24 h to the combination of the cytokines IL-1β + IFN-γ or left untreated. The selected time of cytokine exposure (24 h) is based on our previous data, showing that 24-h exposure to IL-1β + IFN-γ induces major changes in β-cell gene expression, but precedes a significant decrease in β-cell viability (6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As described previously (14Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Jobin C. Leeman R. Darville M. Cardozo A.C. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), AdIκB(SA)2, but not AdLuc, prevented IL-1β/IFN-γ-induced NO production (data not shown). Cells from four separate experiments were pooled for total RNA extraction, and the resulting biotinylated cRNAs were hybridized in duplicate to the Affymetrix rat U-34A oligonucleotide array containing ∼8,000 probes (77% known genes and 23% ESTs). As observed previously (6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), ∼3,000 genes and ESTs were scored as present in each of the six conditions (2853–3626 genes). The following comparisons were analyzed: 1) noninfected cells + cytokines versus noninfected cells, 2) AdIκB(SA)2 + cytokines versusAdIκB(SA)2, and 3) AdLuc + cytokines versusAdLuc. Similar to our previous findings (6Cardozo A.K. KruhØffer M. Leeman R. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), 24-h exposure to IL-1β + IFN-γ modified expression of 224 genes and ESTs in noninfected β-cells and 211 genes and ESTs in cells infected with the control virus AdLuc. In contrast, when NF-κB activation was prevented by AdIκB(SA)2, IL-1β + IFN-γ changed the expression of only 65 genes and ESTs in β-cells. Adenovirus infection by itself (i.e. in the absence of cytokines) did not induce consistent modifications in β-cell gene expression. Comparison between noninfected versus AdLuc showed modification of 22 genes and ESTs, whereas comparison between noninfected versus AdIκB(SA)2 identified modifications of 14 genes. Only three genes were modified by both AdLuc and AdIκB(SA)2, as compared with control; there was a decrease in 18 S ribosomal gene (AdIκB(SA)2, −2.6; AdLuc, −3.1), c-HA-Ras gene (AdIκB(SA)2, −3.8; AdLuc, −3.6), and the regenerating protein 3 (AdIκB(SA)2, −2.9; AdLuc, −4.6). A stringent criterion was used to accept genes as NF-κB-dependent. Thus, we considered as cytokine-induced and NF-κB-dependent those genes that were modified ≥2.5-fold by IL-1β + IFN-γ in non-virus-infected β-cells and in the AdLuc (both considered as controls), but had this modification prevented by AdIκB(SA)2. In cases where the induction/inhibition was lowered by at least 50% by AdIκB(SA)2, the genes were also considered as"

It was recently reported that CaT1, a member of the TRP family of cation channels, exhibits the unique biophysical properties of CRAC, which led to the conclusion that CaT1 comprises all or part of the CRAC pore (Yue, L., Peng, J. B., Hediger, M. A., and Clapham, D. E. (2001) Nature 410, 705–709). Here, we directly compare endogenous CRAC with heterologously expressed CaT1 and show that they manifest several clearly distinct properties. CaT1 can be distinguished from CRAC in the following features: sensitivity to store-depleting agents; inward rectification in the absence of divalent cations; relative permeability to Na+ and Cs+; effect of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). Moreover, CaT1 displays a mode of voltage-dependent gating that is fully absent in CRAC and originates from the voltage-dependent binding/unbinding of Mg2+ inside the channel pore. Our results imply that the pores of CaT1 and CRAC are not identical and indicate that CaT1 is a Mg2+-gated channel not directly related to CRAC.

Of all store-operated channels, CRAC is functionally the best described, but its molecular identity and the mechanism of its store-dependent activation remain elusive (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

Several members of the TRP family, a group of cation channels related to theDrosophila transient receptor potential (trp) gene product (3Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G.

Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) reported that CaT1 (11Peng J.B. Chen X.Z. Berger U.V. Vassilev P.M. Tsukaguchi H. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. J. Biol.

To further investigate this intriguing possibility, we made a direct comparison of CaT1, heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, and endogenous CRAC in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. RBL cells were chosen because they were the source of the CaT1 clone used by Yue et al. (10Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and have been widely used as a model system to study CRAC (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). We confirm the resemblance of currents through CRAC and CaT1 but additionally present a number of novel features that are incompatible with the proposed equality of the CaT1 and CRAC pores. HEK-293 cells and RBL-2H3 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 10% CO2. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with the pCINeo/IRES-GFP/mCaT1 vector using previously described methods (14Trouet D. Nilius B. Voets T. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and electrophysiological recordings were performed between 8 and 24 h after transfection. Patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight seal, whole-cell configuration at room temperature. Patch pipettes had DC resistances of 2–4 megaohms when filled with the standard intracellular solution containing (in mm): 145 cesium glutamate, 8 NaCl, 0, 3, or 10 MgCl2, 3.3 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.2). The free Ca2+ concentration in this solution was calculated to be 100 nm. The standard extracellular solution contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 10 CsCl, 10 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4). The divalent-free (DVF) solution contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 10 EDTA, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4). To test the monovalent cation permeability sequence, DVF solutions were used in which NaCl was equimolarly replaced by LiCl, CsCl, KCl, or NMDG chloride. Unless indicated differently, currents were measured in response to voltage ramps (−100 to +100 mV in 100 ms) applied at a frequency of 0.5 Hz from a holding potential of 0 mV. Series resistances were between 3 and 10 megaohms and were compensated for 50–80%. Voltage errors were generally <10 mV. Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter. For the accurate determination of the currents through CRAC, background currents measured under identical ionic conditions but before store depletion were subtracted. Averaged data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. from n cells. The significance of differences between means was evaluated using Student’s unpaired t test. Immediately after obtaining the whole-cell configuration, CaT1-transfected HEK-293 cells exposed to 10 mmextracellular Ca2+ and with intracellular Ca2+buffered at 100 nm (to maintain full Ca2+stores) displayed a large membrane current (Fig.1, A and B). This current subsequently decayed to reach a lower, but still robust, steady state level (Fig. 1 A). The CaT1-mediated current was strongly inwardly rectifying (Fig. 1 B) and reversed at positive potentials (39 ± 7 mV; n = 18) in agreement with previous work (10Yue L. Peng J.B.

Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (2 μm) did not induce any store-dependent activation of CaT1 but instead caused a transient inhibition of the CaT1-current by 26 ± 4% (n = 8) (Fig.1 A). A similar inhibition by 30 ± 6% (n = 7) was observed when Ca2+ stores were passively depleted by application of the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, 2,5-di-t-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone (20 μm). We attribute the inhibitory effect of store-depleting agents to an increase of intracellular Ca2+ as has been previously described for epithelial calcium channel (ECaC1; see Refs. 15Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), a close homologue of CaT1. Under identical intra- and extracellular ionic conditions, RBL-2H3 cells displayed only a very small background current that reversed at negative potentials (−41 ± 2 mV;n = 26). Depletion of Ca2+ stores by extracellular application of 2 μm ionomycin (Fig.1 A) or intracellular perfusion with IP3 (20 μm; data not shown) activated CRAC, as indicated by the appearance of a Ca2+-selective, inwardly rectifying current that reversed at positive potentials (42 ± 7 mV;n = 26) (Fig. 1 B). The permeability of both CaT1 and CRAC in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ is at least 100 times higher for Ca2+ than for Na+, but removal of all divalent cations from the extracellular medium renders both channel pores highly permeable for monovalent cations (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 10Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This loss of selectivity is presumably because of the removal of divalents from negatively charged residues (aspartates or glutamates) lining the Ca2+-selective pore (17Hess P. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), as has been previously shown for voltage-gated Ca2+channels and for ECaC1 (18Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 19Nilius B. Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. J. Biol.

When switching from the normal extracellular solution containing 10 mm Ca2+ to a DVF solution, the CaT1-mediated current gradually increased following an exponential time constant of 9 ± 4 s (n = 14) (Fig. 1 C). We interpret this time-dependent increase of the current as the slow removal of the Ca2+-induced inactivation of CaT1, as has been previously demonstrated for its close homologue, ECaC1 (15Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 16Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After reaching its maximal amplitude, the monovalent CaT1 current remained stable for more than 15 min (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). In contrast, the current through CRAC, when preactivated by ionomycin in the normal extracellular solution containing 10 mm Ca2+, reached its maximal amplitude immediately after switching to DVF solution and decayed subsequently with a time constant of 12 ± 4 s (n = 17) (Fig. 1 C). Current-voltage relationships obtained during linear voltage ramps in DVF solutions revealed several significant differences between CaT1 and CRAC (Fig. 1 D). First, the reversal potential for CaT1 (18 ± 2 mV; n = 8) was significantly less positive than for CRAC (45 ± 6 mV; n = 8). We examined whether this difference reflected different monovalent cation permeability profiles of the CaT1 and CRAC channel pores and found that, although both channels display a Na+ ≈ Li+ > K+ > Cs+ > NMDG permeability sequence, CRAC has a much lower relative Cs+permeability (P Cs/P Na = 0.48 ± 0.03 for CaT1 versus 0.12 ± 0.04 for CRAC; p < 0.001). Second, inward rectification was much more pronounced for CaT1 than for CRAC. The rectification score (defined as the ratio of the current amplitudes at potentials 40 mV negative and positive to the reversal potential) was 9.9 ± 1.1 (n = 15) for CaT1 compared with 1.5 ± 0.1 for CRAC (n = 19; p < 0.001). Third, the current-voltage relationship for CaT1 currents measured using the linear voltage ramp protocol displayed a negative slope at potentials below −80 mV, which was not observed for CRAC. As shown below, this negative slope originates from the time-dependent removal of intracellular Mg2+ block. Monovalent cation currents through CaT1 activated during membrane hyperpolarization from +20 mV to −100 mV and deactivated during subsequent steps to less hyperpolarized potentials (Fig.2 A). The fraction of open channels at the end of each voltage step was assessed from the initial current amplitude during a final step to −100 mV and exhibited a Boltzmann dependence on membrane potential (20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar), with a slope factor of 8 mV and half-maximal deactivation at −24 mV (Fig.2 D). This voltage dependence was abolished when Mg2+ was omitted from the intracellular solution (Fig. 2,C and D), indicating that the gating mechanism of CaT1 is a voltage-dependent block/unblock of the channel pore by intracellular Mg2+. Using pipette solutions containing different concentrations of Mg2+, we found that half-maximal block at 0 mV was achieved with ∼200 μmintracellular Mg2+. In contrast, monovalent cation currents through CRAC did not exhibit such voltage dependence (Fig. 2,B and D), not even with 10 mmintracellular Mg2+ (n = 5; data not shown). It should be noted that CaT1 currents remained strongly inwardly rectifying in symmetric monovalent cation solutions and in the absence of intracellular Mg2+, indicating that rectification represents an intrinsic pore property of CaT1. Moreover, the strong inward rectification and voltage-dependent Mg2+block of CaT1 were preserved in cell-free inside-out patches (data not shown). 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), an inhibitor of IP3receptors, is known to inhibit store-dependent Ca2+ influx pathways in a variety of cells (21Ma H.T.

We confirmed that 50 μm 2-APB caused a rapid and complete block of CRAC in RBL cells (Fig.3 A), which was voltage-independent (Fig. 3 B and data not shown) and slowly reversible upon washout (Fig. 3 A). The inhibitory effect of 2-APB on CRAC was dose-dependent with half-maximal inhibition at 5.5 μm (Fig. 3 D). In contrast to a recent study (25Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref Scopus (431) Google Scholar), we did not observe a consistent initial increase in CRAC activity upon application of 2-APB. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some 2-APB-dependent potentiation was masked by the rapid blocking effect of the drug. Although 2-APB has been shown to be membrane-permeable, two observations indicate that the target for 2-APB block of CRAC is exposed to the extracellular medium. First, the onset of block occurred with at time constant of ∼2 s (Fig. 3 A), which is almost as fast as block of CRAC by extracellular Zn2+, Cd2+, or La3+ (data not shown) and much faster than what has been reported for IP3 receptor-mediated effects of 2-APB in intact cells (22Kukkonen J.P. Lund P.-E. Akerman K.E.O. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Second, dialysis of the cytoplasm with a pipette solution supplemented with 50 μm2-APB did not markedly prevent activation of CRAC by ionomycin (data not shown; see also Ref. 23Bakowski D. Glitsch M.D. Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 532: 55-71Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). From this we conclude that the interaction site for 2-APB is either on the extracellular part of the CRAC channel itself or at least closely associated therewith. In remarkable contrast with its inhibitory effects on CRAC, 50 μm 2-APB potentiated CaT1-mediated currents by ∼25% (Fig. 3, A and D). The potentiating effect of 2-APB did not show marked voltage dependence (Fig. 3 C), was fully reversible upon washout (Fig. 3 A), and could be repeated several times in the same cell. A similar but less pronounced potentiation was obtained with 5 μm 2-APB (Fig.3 D). Application of 250 μm 2-APB also caused a potentiation of CaT1, which was mostly followed by a slow and moderate inhibition of the currents by ∼20% and/or activation of linear leak currents. Thus, CRAC is at least 100 times more sensitive for 2-APB block than CaT1. According to Yue et al. (10Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the properties of CaT1, notably its activation by active store depletion, were dependent on the expression level of the channel protein. Therefore, we wanted to make sure that the differences we observed between CaT1 and CRAC were independent on the number of CaT1 channels per cell. Like Yue et al. (10Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), we measured CaT1 currents within 12 h after transfection and selected for cells that had current densities below 100 pA/pF at −100 mV with 10 mm extracellular Ca2+ (mean peak amplitude, 78 ± 9 pA/pF;n = 8). Despite the fact that the average CaT1 current density in this group of cells was ∼5 times lower than the overall average (356 ± 44 pA/pF; n = 25), they displayed all of the above described CaT1 features: inhibition of 24% by 2 μm ionomycin (n = 2); strong inward rectification in DVF solution (rectification score, 12.7 ± 3.2;n = 4); relative Cs+ permeability (P Cs/P Na) of 0.52 ± 0.06 (n = 5); voltage-dependent gating in the presence of intracellular Mg2+ with a slope factor of 8 mV and half-maximal deactivation at −25 mV (n = 4); potentiation to 121% of control by 50 μm 2-APB (n = 2). Thus, the biophysical and pharmacological properties that distinguish heterologously expressed CaT1 from endogenous CRAC in RBL cells are not influenced by the expression level of the CaT1 channel protein. Moreover, virtually identical results were obtained in CaT1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown), indicating that the expression system does not significantly affect the properties of the CaT1 channel. To evaluate the hypothesis that CaT1, a member of the TRP family of cation channels, constitutes all or part of CRAC, the calcium release-activated Ca2+ channel, we made a direct comparison of the biophysical and pharmacological properties of both channels under identical experimental conditions. At first sight, the similarities between CRAC and CaT1 (TableI) are indeed striking. However, it should be noted that many of the common characteristics of the CRAC and CaT1 pores (high Ca2+ selectivity; anomalous mole fraction effect; divalent and monovalent cation permeability sequence; block by inorganic cations; loss of selectivity in the absence of divalents; single-channel conductance to Na+ in the range of 10–100 picosiemens) are not only shared by ECaC1 (15Vennekens R.

In VOCCs and ECaC1, high Ca2+ selectivity depends on negatively charged amino acids (glutamates and/or aspartates) in the pore region (18Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 19Nilius B. Vennekens R. Prenen J. Hoenderop J.G. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1020-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It is believed that high affinity binding of Ca2+ ions to these sites prevents, by electrostatic repulsion, monovalent cations from passing through the pore while simultaneously allowing high rates of Ca2+ flux (17Hess P. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Such a configuration implies that the pore becomes readily permeable to monovalent cations when the extracellular concentration of Ca2+ and other divalent cations is so low that the Ca2+-binding sites are no longer occupied (20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Intermediate Ca2+ concentrations block monovalent permeation but yield only small Ca2+ fluxes. Thus, the conductance of these channels as a function of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration goes through a minimum, a phenomenon termed anomalous mole fraction behavior, which has been observed in VOCCs (17Hess P. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), ECaC1/CaT1 (10Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E.

Moreover, because negatively charged Ca2+-binding sites generally display a high affinity for transition metals such as Cd2+, Zn2+, or La3+ (20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar), it is not unexpected that these cations exert an inhibitory effect on the different Ca2+ selective channels. Thus, it appears that most of the pore properties common for CRAC and CaT1 are features inherent to all highly Ca2+-selective pores in biological membranes.Table ISummary of similarities and differences between CaT1 and CRACCaT1CRAC (RBL cells)Similarities Calcium selectivityP Ca/P Na> 100aFrom Ref. 10.PCa/PNa > 100bFrom Ref. 32.

Open table in a new tab Properties of CaT1 and CRAC were determined in the present study unless indicated otherwise. pS, picosiemens. As summarized in Table I, CaT1 differs from CRAC in RBL cells in the following salient features: effect of ionomycin-induced store depletion; current decay in DVF solution; relative permeability for Cs+ versus Na+; inward rectification; voltage-dependent block by intracellular Mg2+; and effect of extracellular 2-APB. Obviously, some of these differences might be explained by cell-specific modulation of channel function. However, monovalent permeability, channel rectification, and voltage-dependent block represent biophysical properties that are directly related to the channel pore (20Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Thus, our data demonstrate that the pore properties of CRAC and CaT1 are clearly distinct, thereby ruling out the possibility that CaT1 encompasses the full CRAC pore. We cannot definitely exclude the possibility that the CRAC pore consists of CaT1 plus an additional subunit, but this additional channel subunit would then have to abolish the intracellular Mg2+-sensitivity of CaT1, provide for the 2-APB inhibition, and significantly alter the ion selectivity and inward rectification of the putative heteromultimeric channel. An alternative and presumably more likely explanation is that CRAC and CaT1 are two distinct channels with a number of overlapping properties but nevertheless encoded by different genes. In that case, we have provided a number of useful tools to discriminate between both channels in native tissue. We thank A. Janssens, M. Crabbé, M. Schuermans, and H. Van Weijenbergh for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2069952825,"RelB mediates the constitutive nuclear pool of NF-κB transcriptional activity in myeloid and lymphoid cells, which is believed to be secondary to its weak interaction with the classical NF-κB inhibitor proteins, the IκBs. In other cell types, RelB is located in the cytosol, thus suggesting that RelB is also regulated by an inhibitory protein(s). In this study, it is demonstrated that RelB is associated in the cytosol with p100 but not with IκBα, IκBβ, IκBe, nor p105. Its cytosolic control is not affected by stimuli that lead to RelA nuclear translocation, and RelB nuclear localization is prevented by p100, but not by p105 or IκBα. Structure function analysis p100-RelB interactions indicates that p100 amino acids 623–900 are required for effective interaction and repression of nuclear translocation and RelB driven NF-κB-dependent transcription. Moreover, this carboxyl-portion of p100 contains a nuclear export signal(s), which is required for effective retrieval of RelB from the nucleus. Finally, overexpression of NF-κB-inducing kinase, a kinase that has recently been shown to induce p100 processing, possibly through IKKα activation, causes nuclear translocation of RelB protein. Thus, these studies indicate that p100 is a bone fide inhibitor of RelB and that this transcription factor may be regulated by NF-κB-inducing kinase and/or IKKα."
https://openalex.org/W2009152568,"Phosphorylation is one of the most common forms of protein modification. The most frequent targets for protein phosphorylation in eukaryotes are serine and threonine residues, although tyrosine residues also undergo phosphorylation. Many of the currently applied methods for the detection and localization of protein phosphorylation sites are mass spectrometry-based and are biased against the analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated residues because of the stability and low reactivity of phosphotyrosines. To overcome this lack of sensitive methods for the detection of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, we have recently developed a method that is not affected by the more predominant threonine or serine phosphorylation within cells. It is based on the specific detection of immonium ion of phosphotyrosine at 216.043 Da and does not require prior knowledge of the protein sequence. In this report, we describe the first application of this new method in a proteomic strategy. Using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies for immunoprecipitation and one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we have identified 10 proteins in the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, of which 8 have been shown previously to be involved in epidermal growth factor signaling. Most importantly, in addition to several known tyrosine phosphorylation sites, we have identified five novel sites on SHIP-2, Hrs, Cbl, STAM, and STAM2, most of which were not predicted to be phosphorylated.

Histidine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues predominantly undergo phosphorylation in prokaryotes, whereas in eukaryotes serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues are the major targets of phosphorylation (1Yan J. Packer N. Gooley A. Williams K. J. Chromatogr. 1998; 808: 23-41Google Scholar). It is estimated that approximately one third of all proteins in mammalian cells are phosphorylated at some time or another and that approximately 5% of a vertebrate genome encodes for protein kinases and protein phosphatases (2Hunter T. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol Sci. 1998; 353: 583-605Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of this protein modification. Signals from the extracellular environment that result in cellular changes ranging from membrane ruffling to mitogenesis are transmitted as a series of phosphorylation events that undergo amplification within the cytoplasm. It is therefore of pivotal importance to identify such phosphorylated residues on proteins that lead to assembly of larger multiprotein complexes as a result of interaction of phosphorylated residues with specific protein domains. This warrants the need for rapid and sensitive methods for detection of phosphorylation and precise localization of phosphorylated residues. The most sensitive methods for the detection of phosphorylation make use of the incorporation of phosphate groups labeled with radioactive phosphorus isotopes such 32P or 33P. However, the in vivo incorporation of radioactive isotopes is inefficient because of the presence of endogenous ATP pools within cells. Therefore, almost 100–1000-fold greater amounts of radioactively labeled ATP are required to achieve a degree of in vivo phosphorylation that is sufficient for sensitive detection in comparison to in vitro kinase assays. To avoid working with such large amounts of radioactivity, nonradioactive methods are more desirable provided they are sufficiently sensitive. Most of the widely used nonradioactive methods are mass spectrometry-based because of the sensitivity and speed provided by this technology as compared with traditional biochemical methods. Although approaches using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight MS1alone, or in combination with immobilized metal affinity chromatography and/or phosphatase treatment, have been used for phosphorylation analysis, they still suffer from a number of drawbacks, the major one being the inability to directly sequence the peptides to unambiguously identify the phosphorylation site (see, e.g., Ref. 3Stensballe A. Andersen S. Jensen O.N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 207-222Google Scholar). Therefore, (electrospray) tandem mass spectrometry-based approaches are often preferred because they allow subsequent localization of the phosphorylation sites by peptide sequencing. One commonly used electrospray method is based on the neutral loss of HPO3(80 Da) or H3PO4 (98 Da) moieties (4Schlosser A. Pipkorn R. Bossemeyer D. Lehmann W.D. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 170-176Google Scholar). Although this technique is quite useful for phosphorylated serine or threonine residues, it is less suitable for phosphotyrosines because the phosphate group on tyrosine residues is more stable and does not detach easily. A more universal technique is the selective detection of a characteristic negatively charged fragment ion at m/z −79 (PO 3−) for the identification of any phosphorylated species in peptide mixtures (5Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Bean M.F. Carr S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1993; 4: 710-717Google Scholar, 6Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 235-242Google Scholar, 7Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Verma R. Deshaies R.J. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 393-404Google Scholar). However, the alkaline conditions under which this method must be performed preclude direct sequencing of peptides in a sensitive manner. Here we describe the application of a novel tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based technique that relies on specific detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides (8Steen H. Kuster B. Fernandez M. Pandey A. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1440-1448Google Scholar, 9Steen H. Küster B. Mann M. J. Mass. Spectrom. 2001; 36: 782-790Google Scholar). This method, termedphosphotyrosine-specific immonium ion (PSI) scanning, is based on detection of the specific immonium ion of phosphotyrosine at 216.043 Da as a characteristic “reporter” ion for precursor tyrosine-phosphorylated species in complex peptide mixtures. As sequencing is performed immediately after the detection of the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide, this method does not require knowledge of the protein sequence for phosphotyrosine localization,i.e. it is also applicable to novel/unknown proteins. Because numerous other peptide-derived fragment ions have the same nominal mass of 216 Da but different exact masses, high resolution, high accuracy quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometers have to be employed for PSI scanning experiments. If PSI scanning is performed using a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (the type of instrument normally employed for precursor ion experiments), numerous false positives will be encountered, because this type of mass spectrometer cannot resolve the immonium ion of phosphotyrosine from other interfering peptide-derived fragment ions. In this report, PSI scanning was used to identify several phosphoproteins in the EGF receptor signal transduction pathway. The identified proteins included well characterized proteins such as Shc, Cbl, Hrs, and signal transduction adaptor molecule (STAM) in addition to STAM2, a molecule whose involvement in the EGF receptor pathway has recently been reported (10Endo K.

Nielsen M.M. Roche S. Mann M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38633-38639Google Scholar). In addition, we found Ku 70 autoantigen and Hsp 70 as tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. A number of tyrosine phosphorylation sites on these molecules were identified; five of them have never been described in the literature despite the fact that most of these proteins have been intensively studied by several groups. None of these novel tyrosine-phosphorylated residues conform to the known consensus motifs for SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains. The ability of a number of computer programs to predict these identified tyrosine phosphorylation sites was compared. Quite remarkably, most of the programs failed to predict the novel tyrosine-phosphorylated sites, which emphasizes a major limitation of such programs. PSI scanning can be used in high-throughput identification of in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation sites on proteins, which is an important step in the elucidation of regulatory networks within a cell. EGF and agarose-conjugated 4G10 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA). RC20 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). HeLa cells were normally grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. For immunoprecipitation experiments, a total of 108 HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluence and then cultured for additional 15 h without serum. Cells were either untreated or treated with 1 μg/ml EGF for 5 min and subsequently lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in the presence of protease inhibitors. Cleared cell lysates were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with a mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies: 100 μg of 4G-10 monoclonal antibody coupled to agarose beads and 50 μg of biotin-conjugated RC20 monoclonal antibody bound to streptavidin-agarose beads. Precipitated immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and then eluted twice with 100 mm phenylphosphate in lysis buffer at 37 °C. Proteins from control and treated conditions were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After visualization by silver staining, bands of interest were excised and subjected to in-gel reduction, alkylation, and digestion with trypsin (sequencing grade; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) as described previously (12Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). Chemicals used for the in-gel derivatization reactions were purchased from Sigma. High purity solvents used for nanoelectrospray experiments were purchased from Labscan (Dublin, Ireland). All experiments were performed on a QSTAR Pulsar quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (AB/MDS-Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). Precursor ion scanning experiments were acquired with a dwell time of 50 ms at a step size of 0.5 Da and with the Q2-pulsing function turned on. The Q0-voltage, which determines the collision energy, was set to a value corresponding to one tenth of the m/z value of the precursor ion (for further details, see Refs. 8Steen H. Kuster B. Fernandez M. Pandey A. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1440-1448Google Scholar and 9Steen H. Küster B. Mann M. J. Mass. Spectrom. 2001; 36: 782-790Google Scholar). Protein digests were desalted and concentrated on a tandem arrangement comprising POROS R2 and OLIGO R3 columns (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) prepared in GELoader tips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) as described previously (13Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Google Scholar, 14Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel-Larsen M. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kroll-Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass. Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Google Scholar). Columns were eluted in three steps (20, 40, or 60% methanol in 5% formic acid, respectively) directly into nanoelectrospray needles (MDS Proteomics), and each fraction was subjected to MS analysis. Proteins were identified employing the peptide sequence tag approach (15Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Google Scholar). Peptide sequence tags, derived from fragment ion spectra of selected peptides, were searched against the nonredundant protein data base using the program PepSea (MDS Proteomics). It is important to study events such as phosphorylation in the context of a cell because the products of phosphorylation reactions carried out in vitro may not be detected under more physiological conditions. We decided to use the EGF receptor signal transduction pathway as a system in which to test our phosphotyrosine detection method. The two major challenges with characterization ofin vivo phosphorylation in signaling are that first, most signaling molecules are not found in high abundance in cells, and second, only a fraction of a given protein undergoes phosphorylation in a cell. HeLa cells express endogenous EGF receptors as well as other downstream components of this signal transduction pathway and were, therefore, chosen for our experiments. Two cell cultures were used where one was stimulated with EGF while the control set was left unstimulated. To enrich for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, cleared cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies immobilized on agarose beads. After washing the column several times, the bound proteins were eluted with phenylphosphate, which mimics phosphotyrosine residues and thus competitively binds to the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. After elution, the samples were dialyzed and resolved by SDS-PAGE. As a limited quantity of cells was used for these experiments and protein concentrations in lysates were low, we performed silver staining, which is a very sensitive method for visualizing proteins in polyacrylamide gels. Silver staining allows one to detect subpicomole amounts of proteins quite easily and is compatible with subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. The differentially tyrosine-phosphorylated gel bands (Fig. 1) that were clearly present in the EGF-treated lane and absent in the control lane were excised, reduced, alkylated, and digested for subsequent MS analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphotyrosine mapping in addition to ordinary protein identification was accomplished as follows utilizing the PSI scanning approach (see Fig. 2). After acquisition of a mass spectrum of the peptide mixture obtained from tryptic digests of silver stained bands, the spectrum was evaluated to identify peptide ion signals for further MS/MS experiments. During this time, a PSI scanning experiment was performed to identify phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. Finally, those peptides that gave rise to an ion signal in the precursor ion spectrum were first analyzed by MS/MS to obtain sequence information for protein identification as well as for localization of the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. Additional peptides were subjected to MS/MS experiments to confirm the protein identified on the basis of the tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides and also to identify other proteins that may be present.

Open table in a new tab The table lists all the proteins identified in this study along with their data base accession numbers, the band number from which they were derived (Fig. 1). To reduce interference by peptides that show ion signals at similarm/z values, (i.e. to decrease the complexity of the protein digest), the peptide mixtures were fractionated before mass spectrometric analysis. This was achieved by loading the protein digests onto a tandem column arrangement comprised of a POROS R2 and an OLIGO R3 microcolumn previously described by us (6Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 235-242Google Scholar). Such a procedure ensures that smaller and more hydrophilic peptides, which do not bind to the POROS R2 resin, are retained in the subsequent OLIGO R3 column. Therefore, this column setup also reduces the loss of phosphorylated peptides. Subsequently each column was eluted with 20% (fraction 1), 40% (fraction 2), and 60% methanol (fraction 3) containing 5% formic acid and each fraction subjected to nanoelectrospray analysis. Mass spectrometric analysis of band I, eluted with 20% methanol, 5% formic acid from the POROS R2 microcolumn showed several major ion signals (see Fig.3A). MS/MS sequencing revealed that these ion signals were attributable to peptides derived from the EGF receptor. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor upon EGF stimulation was expected because EGF leads to homodimerization and an increase in catalytic activity of the EGF receptor (16Cochet C. Kashles O. Chambaz E.M. Borrello I. King C.R. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3290-3295Google Scholar). A PSI scan experiment shows one clear ion signal at approximatelym/z 773 (Fig. 3B). The corresponding mass spectrum of the EGF receptor digest in the m/z range around 773 displays only one triply charged species of minor abundance. Sequencing of this peptide ion revealed it to contain Tyr-1172 (data not shown; for further detail, see Ref. 8Steen H. Kuster B. Fernandez M. Pandey A. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1440-1448Google Scholar), which is located in the C terminus of the EGF receptor and has previously been described as one of the major autophosphorylation sites (17Downward J. Parker P. Waterfield M.D. Nature. 1984; 311: 483-485Google Scholar, 18Margolis B.L. Lax I. Kris R. Dombalagian M. Honegger A.M. Howk R. Givol D. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10667-10671Google Scholar). Indeed, mutation of Tyr-1172 in addition to C-terminal Tyr-1197, leads to a substantial decrease in binding of several EGF receptor substrates such as phospholipase Cγ1, ras GTPase-activating protein, p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Shc (19Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Google Scholar) as compared with a receptor in which only Tyr-1197 has been mutated. Analysis of band II revealed a number of multiply charged species in the mass spectrum (fraction 3 of the POROS R2 microcolumn). Sequencing of the major peptides observed showed the presence of SHIP-2 with the EGF receptor as a minor component. The presence of EGF receptor is likely the result of smearing from the slower migrating band I which contains the EGF receptor. SHIP-2 was previously shown to be phosphorylated in response to EGF and to associate with Shc (20Pesesse X. De Deleu S. Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Google Scholar,21Habib T. Hejna J.A. Moses R.E. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18605-18609Google Scholar). Although its precise role in growth factor receptor signaling is not understood, SHIP-2 has been shown to negatively regulate insulin-induced signaling (22Ishihara H. Sasaoka T. Hori H. Wada T. Hirai H. Haruta T. Langlois W.J. Kobayashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 265-272Google Scholar). A PSI scanning experiment showed three peaks at m/z 509, 553, and 612 (data not shown). All of them corresponded to “invisible” ion signals in the mass spectrum of the protein digest. In other words, no ion signals were apparent in the mass spectrum of the protein digest as they were hidden by chemical noise. Sequencing of the fragment ion observed at m/z 612 showed that it corresponded to a tyrosine-phosphorylated tryptic peptide containing Tyr-1162 of SHIP-2 (GLPSDpYGRPLSFPPPR) (Fig.4). Although Tyr-1162 in SHIP-2 was not reported as a tyrosine phosphorylation site before, the fact that it is phosphorylated is consistent with the evidence that residual tyrosine phosphorylation was observed, even though Taylor et al. (23Taylor V. Wong M. Brandts C. Reilly L. Dean N.M. Cowsert L.M. Moodie S. Stokoe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6860-6871Google Scholar) mutated the only tyrosine known to be phosphorylated in SHIP-2 (Tyr-986). This suggests that it is possible that the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue at position 1162 serves to recruit additional phosphotyrosine-interacting proteins to SHIP-2. Analysis of band III (fraction 1 of the POROS R2 microcolumn) showed several peptides derived from hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate, Hrs (24Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Google Scholar). A PSI scanning experiment identified two precursor ions one of which was sequenced and found to correspond to a tryptic peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr-334 of Hrs (YLNRNpYWEK; data not shown). Although Hrs is known to be rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after treatment with several growth factors including EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor as well as by cytokines such as interleukin-2 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, no phosphorylation sites have yet been identified on this molecule (25Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Hrs coimmunoprecipitates with STAM in a non-phosphotyrosine-dependent manner and with a 120-kDa phosphoprotein whose identity is unknown (25Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Google Scholar). It is possible that this unidentified protein associates only with the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Hrs via Tyr-334. We also have preliminary evidence that an additional tyrosine residue (Tyr-329) is phosphorylated. Analysis of the second elution fraction (POROS R2 microcolumn) revealed several peptides that could not be explained by a theoretical digest of the Hrs protein (see Fig. 5A). An adapter protein, Cbl, was identified as a second component present in this gel slice based on sequence information from other peptides (26Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse 3rd, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657Google Scholar). Both Cbl and Hrs have previously been shown to co-migrate on a one-dimensional gel (27Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 179-184Google Scholar). A PSI scan experiment showed that two ion signals (m/z 576 and 717) corresponded to peptides containing phosphotyrosine residues (Fig. 5B). Although no signal was evident in the mass spectrum of the digest at m/z576 (see Fig. 5C), fragmentation of invisible peptide(s) at this m/z value gave a clear product ion spectrum that was derived from a peptide containing Tyr-674 of Cbl (IKPSSSANAIpYSLAAR) (see Fig. 5D). Although this tyrosine residue was predicted as being phosphorylated, attempts to investigate this were hindered because transfected cells did not express Cbl with a point mutation causing a residue change at Tyr-674 (28van Leeuwen J.E. Paik P.K. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5153-5162Google Scholar). This residue is found in a proline-rich region of Cbl, which is known to bind to SH3 domain of several proteins including Grb2, Nck, and members of the Src and Btk family (29Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that it is likely that Tyr-674 may mediate phosphotyrosine-dependent interactions as well. Interestingly, this peptide was not predicted by in silicotryptic digestions of the proteins present in the gel band. This is a result of the fact that there is a proline residue C-terminal to Arg-679, thereby normally preventing cleavage by trypsin at this position. This example shows the limitation of non-sequencing-based approaches for phosphorylation analysis such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry in combination with immobilized metal affinity chromatography enrichment or phosphatase treatment, which completely rely on relating expected and observed m/z values of ion signals. Because such methods do not allow further modifications or nonspecific cleavages of the protease, the novel phosphorylation site that we have identified would simply be missed. In addition, this example illustrates the power of the new method, which allows selective detection and immediate peptide sequencing of the same sample. Although the ion signal was completely hidden in the noise so that no charge state and therefore no mass assignment could be made, it was still possible to obtain a good product ion spectrum, revealing the amino acid sequence to unambiguously localize a phosphotyrosine residue in an unexpected peptide. Band IV was found to be a complex mixture as several proteins were identified from the second fraction eluted from POROS R2 column (Fig.6A) by MS/MS sequencing. These proteins included bovine serum albumin, STAM, STAM2, Hsp 70, and Ku 70 autoantigen. As the cells used were human, bovine serum albumin is most likely a contaminant from the medium used for cell culture. STAM was identified based on sequencing of a peptide that corresponds to its N terminus lacking an initiator methionine residue. This confirmed the STAM sequence reported by Takeshita et al.(30Takeshita T. Arita T. Asao H. Tanaka N. Higuchi M. Kuroda H. Kaneko K. Munakata H. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1035-1039Google Scholar), who purified and sequenced STAM by Edman degradation and also found that it lacked the N-terminal methionine residue. In addition, a novel protein with significant homology to STAM was identified and was designated STAM2. This protein was recently cloned and investigated by two groups independently (10Endo K. Takeshita T. Kasai H. Sasaki Y. Tanaka N. Asao H. Kikuchi K. Yamada M. Chenb M. O'Shea J.J. Sugamura K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 55-61Google Scholar, 11Pandey A. Fernandez M.M. Steen H. Blagoev B. Nielsen M.M. Roche S. Mann M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38633-38639Google Scholar). An interesting attribute of STAM and STAM2 is that they are currently the two only cytosolic proteins that contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif domain, a motif normally only found in the cytoplasmic domains of immunoreceptors (31Love P.E. Shores E.W. Immunity. 2000; 12: 591-597Google Scholar). Two peptides corresponding to different charge states of the Tyr-198-containing phosphopeptide (QQSTTLSTLpYPSTSSLLTNHQHEGR) derived from STAM were identified by PSI scanning (Fig. 6, B and C). This phosphorylation site Tyr-198 is located near the N terminus of STAM and is not within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif domain, which is considered to possess multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The significance of this phosphorylation site was underscored by the fact that another ion signal corresponding to the homologous peptide SLpYPSSELQLNNK derived from STAM2 (Fig. 6D) was sequenced. Although the functional analysis of STAM2 showed evidence for phosphorylation in the C-terminal region (11Pandey A. Fernandez M.M. Steen H. Blagoev B. Nielsen M.M. Roche S. Mann M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38633-38639Google Scholar), it could not be localized in the study presented here. As the C-terminal sequence of STAM contains only few cleavage sites for enzymatic digestion (trypsin, GluC, AspN, LysC) peptides result from in-gel digestion that are larger than those normally observed by mass spectrometry. Thus, it is difficult to analyze this region using mass spectrometry in combination with conventional cleavage procedures. This region could conceivably be analyzed by using a less specific protease such as elastase (4Schlosser A. Pipkorn R. Bossemeyer D. Lehmann W.D. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 170-176Google Scholar) to obtain smaller peptides, which are within the normally observed mass range. Hsp 70 proteins have been shown to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in T and B cell receptor signaling pathways in a tyrosine kinase-dependent fashion (32Egerton M. Moritz R.L. Druker B. Kelso A. Simpson R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 666-674Google Scholar, 33Gold M.R. Yungwirth T. Sutherland C.L. Ingham R.J. Vianzon D. Chiu R. van Oostveen I. Morrison H.D. Aebersold R. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 441-453Google Scholar). Hsp 70 isolated from nuclear envelope has also been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated. A closely related molecule, Hsp 72, was shown to accumulate in the nucleus upon tyrosine phosphorylation in response to heat stress (34Knowlton A.A. Grenier M. Kirchhoff S.R. Salfity M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H2143-H2149Google Scholar). Hsp 70 was recently shown to be a component of a multiprotein complex involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (35Stewart S. Sundaram M. Zhang Y. Lee J. Han M. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5523-5534Google Scholar). It is possible that Hsp 70 may also be involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport in a manner analogous to that of Hsp 72. Ku 70 autoantigen was another molecule identified from this band. It has been shown to associate with the cytoplasmic domain of CD 40 and translocate to the nucleus upon CD 40 ligation (36Morio T. Hanissian S.H. Bacharier L.B. Teraoka H. Nonoyama S. Seki M. Kondo J. Nakano H. Lee S.K. Geha R.S. Yata J. Immunity. 1999; 11: 339-348Google Scholar). To study these two proteins in more detail, we immunoprecipitated them using antibodies and subjected the immunoprecipitates to Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7(A and B), both of these proteins were found to be basally tyrosine-phosphorylated and there was no detectable increase in their tyrosine phosphorylation status upon stimulation with EGF. Because this band was a mixture of proteins, the most likely explanation is that Hsp 70 and Ku 70 autoantigen were tyrosine-phosphorylated in the basal state as well (i.e.present in the untreated lane) but could not be visualized under the silver-staining conditions used. Further experiments will be necessary to elucidate their role in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, although it is likely that tyrosine phosphorylation does not play a major role. Two proteins were identified from this band: Shc and vimentin. Both proteins have been identified as phosphoproteins involved in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (37Soskic V. Gorlach M. Poznanovic S. Boehmer F.D. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1757-1764Google Scholar, 38Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Google Scholar). MS/MS sequencing of the precursor ion observed in the PSI scan at m/z 659 identified of Tyr-427 in Shc as a phosphorylated residue (ELFDDPSpYVNVQNLDK; see Fig.8, A–C). This residue was already known to be phosphorylated upon T cell receptor as well as growth factor stimulation (38Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Google Scholar, 39Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of the adapter protein, Grb2, has been shown to bind to this phosphorylated tyrosine residue that lies in the typical YXNX consensus motif for SH2 domain of Grb2 (40Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Google Scholar). Table II lists the proteins in which a phosphotyrosine residue was identified in this study, the corresponding phosphopeptide sequence, and a comparison with predicted phosphotyrosine residues using NetPhos (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/), ProSite (www.expasy.ch/prosite/), and Scansite (cansite.bidmc.harvard.edu/cantley85.phtml) prediction programs. As is clear from our analysis, the predicted phosphorylation sites need to be assessed with caution. ProSite tends to underpredict tyrosine phosphorylation sites because only the motifs [RK]-X(2)-[DE]-X(3)-Y or [RK]-X(3)-[DE]-X(2)-Y (Y indicating the phosphorylation sites) are used. This contrasts with NetPhos, which has the tendency to overpredict tyrosine phosphorylations site. Scansite is a program that is essentially based on experimental data from phosphorylation studies performed in vitro. All of these programs failed to identify many of the phosphorylated tyrosine residues that we have identified. ProSite predicted one to three tyrosine phosphorylation sites/protein, but was able to predict only one phosphotyrosine residue of the several phosphotyrosines that were identified. On the other hand, the “success rate” of NetPhos and Scansite was only slightly better with the correct prediction of three of the identified tyrosine phosphorylation sites, despite the fact that up to 5–20 tyrosine phosphorylation sites/protein had been predicted by NetPhos and 1–7 sites/protein by Scansite. Four of the seven tyrosine phosphorylation sites were missed by NetPhos and Scansite, indicating numerous false negatives in addition to the false positives. For obvious reasons, it is quite difficult to experimentally label any phosphorylation prediction as a false positive based merely upon the inability to detect any given residue in its phosphorylated form. However, our data conclusively point out the limitations of the prediction programs and the consequent need to interpret such predictions with extreme caution.Table IIA list of all tyrosine phosphorylation sites identified in this studyBandProteinPhosphopeptide sequenceResidue no.

The table also shows whether the corresponding tyrosine phosphorylation site was correctly predicted by the programs along with the total number of tyrosine phosphorylation sites predicted for each protein. Analytical methods to identify in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation sites are currently quite limited. Mass spectrometry is a very sensitive method for the analysis of phosphorylation sites in general. However, because of properties inherent to phosphorylated tyrosine residues, it is not straightforward to use mass spectrometry for identification of tyrosine phosphorylation sites within proteins. Here we describe the application of a novel precursor ion scan that is specific for phosphotyrosine residues to study the EGF receptor signaling pathway. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were isolated from EGF-stimulated and nonstimulated cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining.

We hypothesize that tBHQ-mediated activation of the antioxidant responsive element is critical for generating this protective response. Addition of LY294002, a selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), 30 min prior to tBHQ treatment completely reversed the protective effect of tBHQ.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Central to the apoptotic response is a family of aspartate-directed cysteine proteases termed the caspases. Caspases function both dependently and independently in the disruption of the mitochondria and its release of proapoptotic factors that are known to serve as signal transducers and positive effectors in the apoptotic pathway (2Grubb D.R. Ly J.D. Vaillant F. Johnson K.L. Lawen A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4085-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 306-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Activation of the cysteine protease caspase-3 appears to be a key event in the execution of apoptosis in the central nervous system (CNS).1 The CNS is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because of a high rate of oxidative metabolism, which results in high rates of strong oxidant formation. In addition, the CNS contains an abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are susceptible to lipid peroxidation.The cellular toxicity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is initiated by oxidative stress resulting in the rapid modification of cytoplasmic constituents, the depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) and ATP, a decrease in NAD+ level, an increase in free cytosolic Ca2+, and lipid peroxidation (4Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 also activates the mitochondria permeability transition pore and the release of cytochrome c (5Yang J.C. Cortopassi G.A. Free. Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, cytochrome c, in combination with Apaf-1, activates caspase-9 leading to the activation of caspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis (6Sugano N. Ito K. Murai S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Because oxidative stress is involved in H2O2-induced cell death, modulation of antioxidant defenses, such as the increased concentration of the intracellular GSH, may protect cells from programmed cell death (PCD).Others have shown that treating cells withtert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a strong inducer of phase II detoxification enzymes via activation of the antioxidant responsive element (ARE), can protect cells from oxidative stress (9Murphy T.H. Miyamoto M. Sastre A. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1547-1558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 10Duffy S. So A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Murphy T.H. DeLong M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Induction of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) in N18-RE-105 neuronal cells by tBHQ prior to glutamate treatment was correlated with a significant decrease in glutamate toxicity (11Murphy T.H. DeLong M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Glutamate toxicity in these cells is not due toN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and calcium influx. Rather, it is a result of competitive inhibition of cysteine uptake, depletion of GSH, increased oxidative stress, and apoptosis (9Murphy T.H. Miyamoto M. Sastre A. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1547-1558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by Murphy and colleagues (10Duffy S. So A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) using H2O2 and dopamine to induce oxidative stress, however, demonstrated that N18-RE-105 cells overexpressing NQO1 were not resistant to cytotoxicity. These data suggest that the protective effect conferred by tBHQ may not simply be due to an increase in one gene but the coordinate up-regulation of many genes. We hypothesize that tBHQ-mediated activation of the ARE is a principal component generating this protective response.Based on these observations and recent work in our laboratory characterizing a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism of ARE activation for tBHQ in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (12Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Lee J.M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we were interested in identifying the ARE-driven gene set increased by tBHQ and correlating this information with the antiapoptotic effect of tBHQ (11Murphy T.H. DeLong M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The present investigation was designed to: 1) determine if tBHQ pretreatment protects human neuroblastoma cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis; 2) evaluate how the inhibition of PI3K activity modulates any protective effect manifested by treatment with tBHQ; and 3) identify the set of genes conferring this protection using oligonucleotide microarray technology.DISCUSSIONIn this study, H2O2 was used to generate oxidative injury and subsequent apoptosis in cultured IMR-32 cells. Our results clearly show that H2O2 induced IMR-32 cell apoptosis through a caspase-3-dependent pathway. The apoptotic process and development of cell injury in H2O2-treated IMR-32 cells was prevented and/or delayed by strengthening the antioxidant capacity of these cells through the transcriptional activation of ARE-driven genes in response to treatment with tBHQ. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis identified the genes that changed with the treatment. The protective effects of tBHQ pretreatment were reversed by inhibition of PI3K and 46 of the 63 genes increased by tBHQ were significantly blocked. Although we have not screened the entire human genome, the genes identified here represent the first set of antiapoptotic genes encoding proteins that can directly or indirectly attenuate the apoptotic process.The fact that H2O2 toxicity was not totally prevented by tBHQ pretreatment is probably due to the mechanism by which H2O2 causes toxicity. It has been reported that H2O2 depletes NADPH and GSH within 10–30 min after administration (18Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes induced by tBHQ can increase the steady-state concentration of these essential molecules in the cell and delay but not completely prevent their depletion or the eventual cell death induced by H2O2 depending on the time and dose of exposure. Similarly, Murphy and colleagues (11Murphy T.H. DeLong M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Su J.Y. Duffy S. Murphy T.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 273: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that pretreatment of rodent neuroblastoma cells with compounds that activated the ARE and increased NQO1 partially protects cells from H2O2- and dopamine-induced cytotoxicity. They also demonstrated that stable overexpression of NQO1 in this cell line did not confer resistance to cytotoxicity, suggesting that the regulation of multiple genes is required for protection (10Duffy S. So A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis revealed a cluster of phase II detoxification enzymes and other genes, which can coordinately combat oxidative stress and prevent apoptosis. Among these genes, HO1, an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in heme degradation, is involved in a catabolic pathway that leads to the production of bilirubin, a potent antioxidant. NQO1 catalyzes two-electron reduction of quinones and prevents the participation of such compounds in redox cycling and oxidative stress. GCLR catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in glutathione biosynthesis. GSTM3 conjugates hydrophobic electrophiles and reactive oxygen species with glutathione. GR catalyzes the reduction of oxidized glutathione to reduced GSH and maintains adequate levels of reduced cellular GSH. TR is part of a family of selenium-containing pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase, which utilize NADPH to catalyze the conversion of oxidized thioredoxin into reduced thioredoxin and to reduce the oxidized forms of ascorbate into reduced ascorbate. Hepatic dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and KIAA0119 are aldo-keto reductases and detoxify reactive carbinyl-containing compounds, which are widely distributed in nature and pose a serious threat to living organisms because of their ability to react with cellular macromolecules. Finally, cytosolic NADP+-dependent malic enzyme, an NADPH-producing cytosolic enzyme, catalyzes both oxidative decarboxylation of malate and reductive carboxylation of pyruvate.Other categories of genes include those that enhance the growth and differentiation of neuron (neuronal olfactomedin-related ER localized protein, axin, NF-H), function as chaperone proteins or respond to heat shock (hsp40 homolog, Bip protein), participate in various signaling pathways (Wnt-5a, MAPKK4, phosphotyrosine-independent ligand p62 for the Lck SH2 domain), and modulate transcription (KIAA0132 and ERF-2). All these genes, in addition to the detoxification and antioxidant genes, may contribute to the antiapoptotic effects of tBHQ treatment. The mechanisms by which they contribute are open to speculation and remain to be determined.tBHQ-mediated activation of ARE is critical to generating the protective response against H2O2-induced apoptosis. We and others (13Lee J.M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Ramos-Gomez M. Kwak M.K. Dolan P.M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Kensler T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3410-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that exposure to tBHQ triggers nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor, Nrf2, which binds to the ARE. These data provide evidence for a novel pathway of signal transduction in response to oxidative stress via the ARE reminiscent of the well-characterized AP-1-mediated or NF-κB-mediated pathway. A search for potential Nrf2 binding sites within the 5′-flanking regions of a selected gene set was performed using MatInspector V2.2 based on TRANSFAC 4.0 (available athttp://transfac.gbf.de) to determine whether the expression profile could be predicted by the presence or absence of Nrf2 binding sites. Indeed, the gene containing no Nrf2 binding site(s) such as GCLC was not increased by tBHQ whereas the promoter regions for the up-regulated genes (e.g.NQO1, GCLR, Wnt5a, TR, andmalate NADP oxidoreductase) contained Nrf2 binding site(s). In contrast, AP-1 and NF-κB are distributed abundantly in the 5′-flanking region of all genes, including GCLC. They are not supposed to play an important role in transcriptional activation by tBHQ. Nrf2 binding sites appear to be in direct correlation with up-regulation of these genes.Recent reports indicate that Nrf2 is normally localized in the cytoplasm bound to a chaperone, Keap1. Exposure of cells to inducers/stressors disrupts the Keap1·Nrf2 complex, and Nrf2 migrates to the nucleus where it binds (in heterodimeric forms with other transcription factors) to the ARE and stimulates transcription. Keap1, a 624-amino acid protein, contains 25 cysteine residues, 9 of which are expected to have highly reactive sulfhydryl groups because they are flanked by one or more basic amino acid residues (20Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar, 21Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarash K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6509-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because many activators of the ARE can react with sulfhydryl groups, the Keap1·Nrf2 complex is a plausible candidate for the cytoplasmic sensor system that recognizes and reacts with inducers of ARE-driven genes (23Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Massiah M.A. Bozak R.E. Kicks R.J. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3404-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). A recent study describes the identification of Inrf2, a rat homolog of Keap1, as part of a pathway mediating the response to oxidative stress through the ARE (16Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, KIAA0132, a human homolog of Keap1, was up-regulated by tBHQ, whereas other Nrf2 binding proteins, such as the small Maf protein family members (MafK and MafF) present on the U95a array, were unchanged. MatInspector also found putative Nrf2 binding sites in the 5′-flanking region of KIAA0132 indicating that transcription of KIAA0132 can be increased by the transcription factor that it sequesters. We suppose that this feedback effect aims to keep in balance the expression of ARE-driven genes, however, little is understood as to the mechanism by which the Keap1·Nrf2 complex functions as a cytoplasmic sensor for oxidative stress.The signal transduction pathway leading to the activation of gene expression via the Nrf2·ARE interaction has recently been shown to require activation of the PI3K pathway in IMR-32 cells (13Lee J.M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We exploited this PI3K dependence in the present study to address the question of tBHQ-mediated cytoprotection and identify the associated changes in gene expression. Inhibition of PI3K completely blocked the protective effect seen by tBHQ treatment and significantly inhibited the increased expression of 46 out of the 63 genes increased by tBHQ. Although the data strongly support our hypothesis for the existence of a PI3K-Nrf2·ARE pathway leading to protection following treatment with tBHQ, microarray analysis revealed two important phase II detoxification enzymes, GCLR and TR, that were induced by tBHQ but not inhibited by LY294002. This suggests an alternative pathway for GCLR and TR induction that is dependent on the Nrf2·ARE interaction but independent of PI3K. Others have suggested that ERK 1/2 and/or p38 MAPK are positive modulators of the ARE in several cell lines (24Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 25Yu R. Mandlekar S. Lei W. Fahl W.E. Tan T.H. Kong A.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK does not block tBHQ-mediated activation of the ARE or NQO1 induction, this does not appear to be the case in IMR-32 cells (12Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These data imply that, in addition to cell-specific mechanisms for ARE activation, a new level of complexity exists for ARE activation within the same cell.In conclusion, oxidative stress can be defined as an imbalance in which free radicals and their products exceed the capacity of cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms. A gain in product formation or a loss in protective mechanisms can disturb this equilibrium, leading to PCD. Numerous publications have demonstrated a correlation between direct supplementation of medium with chemical antioxidants and a decreased apoptotic rate in cell lines (28Qin F. Rounds N.K. Mao W. Kawai K. Liang C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 736-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Lee M.H. Hyun D.H. Jenner P. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Alternatively, induction of multiple antioxidant genes also may provide a way to increase an antioxidative potential and protect cells from apoptosis, as demonstrated here. We refer to this process as programmed cell life or PCL. An equilibrium exists such that any increase in the forces that drive PCD, therefore, must be balanced by increasing the forces that drive PCL. The set of ARE-driven survival genes identified here represents the first set of genes shown to modulate PCD and confirms that the PI3K-Nrf2·ARE pathway is crucial for the transcription of these PCL genes. Accumulated evidence strongly suggests that apoptosis contributes to neuronal cell death in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (1Mattson M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Central to the apoptotic response is a family of aspartate-directed cysteine proteases termed the caspases. Caspases function both dependently and independently in the disruption of the mitochondria and its release of proapoptotic factors that are known to serve as signal transducers and positive effectors in the apoptotic pathway (2Grubb D.R. Ly J.D. Vaillant F. Johnson K.L. Lawen A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4085-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 306-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Activation of the cysteine protease caspase-3 appears to be a key event in the execution of apoptosis in the central nervous system (CNS).1 The CNS is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because of a high rate of oxidative metabolism, which results in high rates of strong oxidant formation. In addition, the CNS contains an abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are susceptible to lipid peroxidation. The cellular toxicity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is initiated by oxidative stress resulting in the rapid modification of cytoplasmic constituents, the depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) and ATP, a decrease in NAD+ level, an increase in free cytosolic Ca2+, and lipid peroxidation (4Fernandez-Checa J.C. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 also activates the mitochondria permeability transition pore and the release of cytochrome c (5Yang J.C. Cortopassi G.A. Free. Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, cytochrome c, in combination with Apaf-1, activates caspase-9 leading to the activation of caspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis (6Sugano N. Ito K. Murai S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Because oxidative stress is involved in H2O2-induced cell death, modulation of antioxidant defenses, such as the increased concentration of the intracellular GSH, may protect cells from programmed cell death (PCD). Others have shown that treating cells withtert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a strong inducer of phase II detoxification enzymes via activation of the antioxidant responsive element (ARE), can protect cells from oxidative stress (9Murphy T.H. Miyamoto M. Sastre A. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1547-1558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 10Duffy S. So A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Murphy T.H. DeLong M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Induction of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) in N18-RE-105 neuronal cells by tBHQ prior to glutamate treatment was correlated with a significant decrease in glutamate toxicity (11Murphy T.H. DeLong M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Glutamate toxicity in these cells is not due toN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and calcium influx. Rather, it is a result of competitive inhibition of cysteine uptake, depletion of GSH, increased oxidative stress, and apoptosis (9Murphy T.H. Miyamoto M. Sastre A. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1547-1558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by Murphy and colleagues (10Duffy S. So A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) using H2O2 and dopamine to induce oxidative stress, however, demonstrated that N18-RE-105 cells overexpressing NQO1 were not resistant to cytotoxicity. These data suggest that the protective effect conferred by tBHQ may not simply be due to an increase in one gene but the coordinate up-regulation of many genes. We hypothesize that tBHQ-mediated activation of the ARE is a principal component generating this protective response. Based on these observations and recent work in our laboratory characterizing a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism of ARE activation for tBHQ in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (12Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Lee J.M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we were interested in identifying the ARE-driven gene set increased by tBHQ and correlating this information with the antiapoptotic effect of tBHQ (11Murphy T.H. DeLong M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The present investigation was designed to: 1) determine if tBHQ pretreatment protects human neuroblastoma cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis; 2) evaluate how the inhibition of PI3K activity modulates any protective effect manifested by treatment with tBHQ; and 3) identify the set of genes conferring this protection using oligonucleotide microarray technology. DISCUSSIONIn this study, H2O2 was used to generate oxidative injury and subsequent apoptosis in cultured IMR-32 cells. Our results clearly show that H2O2 induced IMR-32 cell apoptosis through a caspase-3-dependent pathway. The apoptotic process and development of cell injury in H2O2-treated IMR-32 cells was prevented and/or delayed by strengthening the antioxidant capacity of these cells through the transcriptional activation of ARE-driven genes in response to treatment with tBHQ. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis identified the genes that changed with the treatment. The protective effects of tBHQ pretreatment were reversed by inhibition of PI3K and 46 of the 63 genes increased by tBHQ were significantly blocked. Although we have not screened the entire human genome, the genes identified here represent the first set of antiapoptotic genes encoding proteins that can directly or indirectly attenuate the apoptotic process.The fact that H2O2 toxicity was not totally prevented by tBHQ pretreatment is probably due to the mechanism by which H2O2 causes toxicity. It has been reported that H2O2 depletes NADPH and GSH within 10–30 min after administration (18Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes induced by tBHQ can increase the steady-state concentration of these essential molecules in the cell and delay but not completely prevent their depletion or the eventual cell death induced by H2O2 depending on the time and dose of exposure. Similarly, Murphy and colleagues (11Murphy T.H. DeLong M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Su J.Y. Duffy S. Murphy T.H. Neurosci.

They also demonstrated that stable overexpression of NQO1 in this cell line did not confer resistance to cytotoxicity, suggesting that the regulation of multiple genes is required for protection (10Duffy S.

Microarray analysis revealed a cluster of phase II detoxification enzymes and other genes, which can coordinately combat oxidative stress and prevent apoptosis. Among these genes, HO1, an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in heme degradation, is involved in a catabolic pathway that leads to the production of bilirubin, a potent antioxidant.

In this study we investigated the relationship between cdk5 activity and regulation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. We report that cdk5 phosphorylates the MAP kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) in vivo as well as the Ras-activated MEK1 in vitro. The phosphorylation of MEK1 by cdk5 resulted in inhibition of MEK1 catalytic activity and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. In p35 (cdk5 activator) −/− mice, which lack appreciable cdk5 activity, we observed an increase in the phosphorylation of NF-M subunit of neurofilament proteins that correlated with an up-regulation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 activity. The activity of a constitutively active MEK1 with threonine 286 mutated to alanine (within a TPXK cdk5 phosphorylation motif in the proline-rich domain) was not affected by cdk5 phosphorylation, suggesting that Thr286 might be the cdk5/p35 phosphorylation-dependent regulatory site. These findings support the hypothesis that cdk5 and the MAP kinase pathway cross-talk in the regulation of neuronal functions. Moreover, these data and the recent studies of Harada et al. (Harada, T., Morooka, T., Ogawa, S., and Nishida, E. (2001) Nat. Cell Biol. 3, 453–459) have prompted us to propose a model for feedback down-regulation of the MAP kinase signal cascade by cdk5 inactivation of MEK1.

Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). By virtue of phosphorylating these diverse substrates, cdk5 plays a multifunctional role in the nervous system. It has been demonstrated that the absence of cdk5 in cdk5 −/− mice results in embryonic lethality (16Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Although the p35 knockout mice survive longer (14Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R.

We observed that in cdk5 −/− mice brain stem neurons showed ballooning and hyperphosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins as detected by the SMI31 antibody (see Fig. 1). Similar observations were obtained from p35 (−/−) mice. 2I. Vincent, personal communication. The antibody cross-reacts with phosphorylated Lys-Ser-Pro (KSP) motifs in neurofilament proteins, tau, and MAPs (29Sternberger L.A. Sternberger N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6126-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), sites that are specifically targeted by proline-directed kinases such as cdk5 and MAP kinases (24Shetty K.T. Link W.T. Pant H.C.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data suggested that in the absence of cdk5 activity, other proline-directed protein kinases were up-regulated. The findings that KSP motifs in rat NF proteins (particularly, NF-M) are preferentially phosphorylated by ERK1/2 (30Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to examine the relationship between cdk5/p35 and MAP kinase activities in vitro andin vivo. The MAP kinases mediate a wide range of cellular functions via a variety of signal transduction pathways (31Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar, 32Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). In one well studied pathway, the binding of GTP to Ras protein initiates a phosphorylation cascade through Raf-1 and MEK1/2 (MAPK kinase), which results in stimulation of the MAP kinases, ERK1/2. Upon stimulation, ERKs are known to phosphorylate a variety of cytosolic substrates and are also translocated into the nucleus where they initiate the transcription of immediate early genes (33Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is stimulated by various growth factors and extracellular stimuli and plays important roles in cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation. This pathway interacts (cross-talks) with other signal transduction cascades, either because of overlapping substrate specificity, shared regulatory sites (31Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar), and/or associations with shared scaffolding proteins (34Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To explore the nature of interactions between cdk5 and the MAP kinase signaling cascade, we studied the effect of cdk5 on MEK1 activityin vitro and in vivo. In this report we provide evidence that cdk5 regulates the MAP kinase pathway in a negative manner via phosphorylation of MEK1. All fine chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated. [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphate were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were a product of Sigma Life Sciences. Roscovitine was a product of BioMol. A constitutively active mutant (CA-MEK1) (engineered by deleting residues 32–51 from the N terminus of MEK1 and by mutating its Ser218 and Ser222 to Glu and Asp, respectively (35Mansour S.J.

The mutant (T286A) was created in a plasmid encoding CA-MEK1 using a Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). CA-MEK1(K97M) was engineered by mutating Lys97 to Met in the CA-MEK1 plasmid. This was used as a template for making T286A(K97M) by mutating Thr286 to Ala. CA-MEK1 and its variant proteins (T286A, CA-MEK1(K97M), and T286A(K97M)) were bacterially expressed with His6 tag (35Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), and cdk5 and p35 were expressed as GST fusion proteins as described previously (4Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). cdk5 and cdk5 dominant negative (DN) constructs for cell transfections were in pcDNA3.1His vector and were expressed as His6 tag proteins (gift from Dr. Li-Huei Tsai, Harvard Medical School). The CMV-p35 plasmid was a gift from Dr. Li Tsai (Harvard Medical School). Raf-activated MEK1 (GST fused at the N terminus and His6 fused at the C terminus) was purchased from Upstate Biotech Industries. Cortices from 18-day-old rat embryos were dissected, and the cortical neuronal cell cultures were grown on polylysine-treated 6-well cell culture dishes. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 7–8 days before drug treatment. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 12.5% fetal horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum as described earlier (33Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). The cells were serum-starved by culturing in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 16 h prior to both transfection and roscovitine inhibition experiments. cDNA encoding HA-tagged CA-MEK1 or its variant, T286A, His6-tagged cdk5, or its kinase defective mutant cdk5(DN) and CMV-p35 (4Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) were transfected in NIH 3T3 or PC12 cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 μg of each plasmid DNA was used in 35-mm collagen-coated dishes to perform transfections for 60 h. In some experiments cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) 12 h after transfection for every 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were lysed and used for immunoblotting after normalizing the protein using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (New England Biolabs). The phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 is indicated as pp-ERK1/2 in the figures, whereas ERK1/2 indicates total amount of ERK1/2. For in vivo labeling experiments, the cells were incubated in phosphate-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 2 h prior to incubation in [32P]orthophosphoric acid (0.2 mCi/ml) for 3 h. The cell lysates were prepared in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μm sodium fluoride, 0.1 μm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). An enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc. or Pierce) method was used for immunoblotting following manufacturer's protocol in all experiments. Anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to immunoprecipitate CA-MEK1 or T286A as described earlier (30Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cdk5 kinase assays were performed in a total volume of 50 μl by incubating a preformed complex of bacterially expressed GST-cdk5 and GST-p25, a truncated form of p35 (4Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of either Raf-phosphorylated or unphosphorylated GST-MEK1-His6 (N terminus tagged with GST and C terminus tagged with His6) (Upstate Biotech Industries) or bacterially expressed CA-MEK1 or its variants, in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm sodium fluoride, 10 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μmsodium vanadate, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 60–90 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling the samples in Laemmli's sample buffer. The phosphate incorporation was detected by autoradiography of the protein gels. A similar procedure was used for assessing ERK2 activity using myelin basic protein or a synthetic KSPXK peptide derived from NF-H (VKSPAKEKAKSPEK) (30Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the substrate. The reaction mixture was spotted on phospho-cellulose paper (Whatman), and the phosphate incorporation was measured by scintillation counting as described previously. To examine the effect of cdk5/p25 phosphorylation on MEK1 activity, similar kinase assays were performed using unlabeled ATP (1 mm). GST-Sepharose was used to concentrate MEK1 because it was GST-fused, and then the fusion protein-coupled Sepharose beads were used to phosphorylate 1 μg of bacterially expressed GST-ERK2 as described above for the cdk5 assays. The reaction mixture was immunoblotted using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (New England Biolabs) to assess the MEK1 activity. When radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP was used, the phosphate incorporation was observed by autoradiography of the protein gels or scintillation counting as described above. The p35 −/− mice were created as described earlier (14Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar,36Ohshima T. Ogawa M. Veeranna Hirasawa M. Longenecker G. Ishiguro K. Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2764-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared from the cerebral cortex and cerebellar tissues of 3–4-week-old p35 −/− mice as described above for PC12 cells. Cytoskeletal extracts containing NF proteins were prepared according to previously published procedures (30Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein levels were normalized, and cdk5 and MEK1 were immunoprecipitated by using anti-cdk5 (C-8, Santa Cruz) and anti-MEK1/2 (New England Biolabs) antibodies, respectively. Bacterially expressed GST-ERK2 was used as the substrate for MEK1 assays, whereas VKSPAKEKAKSPEK, a synthetic KSPXK peptide derived from the sequence of neurofilament-H, was used for cdk5/p35 assays as described previously (30Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lysates were immunoblotted using phospho-ERK1/2 or ERK1/2 antibodies. It has been observed that neurofilament and microtubule-associated proteins are hyperphosphorylated in neurons of cdk5 −/− mice (16Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Because cdk5 activity is dependent on p35, we examined whether p35 −/− mice would show hyperphosphorylation of neurofilament proteins. Unlike cdk5 −/− mice, the p35 −/− mice are viable after birth, and therefore, the phosphorylation levels of neurofilament proteins were easily followed by SMI31 antibody. Fig. 1Ashows the ballooning and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated anti-SMI31 epitope immunoreactive proteins in the brain stem neurons of cdk5 −/− mice. To further verify this observation, the cytoskeletal protein fraction from the cortex and cerebella of 3–4-week-old p35 −/− and +/+ wild type mice were analyzed by immunoblotting with SMI-31 antibody, which specifically recognizes phosphorylated KSP sites on neurofilament and microtubule-associated proteins. As shown in Fig.1B, the immunoreactivity of NF-M to SMI31 in the cortex of p35 −/− mice was severalfold higher than in the wild type mice. However, in contrast to the observations in the cortex, the NF-M from the control and p35 −/− mice cerebella showed fewer significant differences in immunoreactivity to SMI-31. However, the intensity of immunoreactivity of NF-H to SMI-31 in wild type and knockout mice was very similar. It should be noted that the rodent NF-M is a preferred substrate for ERK1/2 phosphorylation as compared with cdk5 (30Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore suggesting that in p35 −/− mice the absence of cdk5 activity might have up-regulated ERK1/2. It has been reported earlier that the brain extracts from p35 −/− mice exhibited insignificant levels of cdk5 activity (14Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). It is possible that the cerebellum might contain higher levels of p39, a cdk5 activator present in both wild type and mutant mice that could possibly compensate for the absence of p35 (10Wu D.C. Yu Y.P. Lee N.T. Yu A.C. Wang J.H. Han Y.F. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Zheng M. Leung C.L. Liem R.K. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 141-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These data suggested that cdk5 activity in +/+ mouse cortex might inhibit the activity of other proline-directed kinases like ERK1/2 that are known to preferentially phosphorylate NF-M. Because MEK1 is a key regulator in the MAP kinase pathway, we immunoprecipitated MEK1 from the cerebral cortex of p35 −/− and +/+ mice to examine whether these two preparations had a differential effect on ERK2 phosphorylation and activity. The animals used for these studies were 3–4 weeks old because MEK1 is expressed at significant levels mainly in the adult brain (37Alessandrini A. Brott B.K. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 505-511PubMed Google Scholar). The MEK1 activity as measured by ERK1/2 phosphorylation was 60–75% higher in the brain extract from the p35 −/− mice as compared with that observed in p35 +/+ mice (Fig.2, B and C). This increase in MEK1 activity correlated with the observed decrease in cdk5 activity in p35 −/− mice (Fig. 2A). The levels of total MEK1 were the same in p35 −/− and +/+ mice as measured by immunoblotting (data not shown). Interestingly, not only did the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation increase in the p35 −/− mice (Fig.2B), but the amount of phosphorylated ERK1/2 also increased, although the amount of total ERK1/2 remained unchanged (Fig.2D). These data prompted the idea that in vivocdk5/p35 and MEK1 cross-talk might result in regulation of the MAP kinase pathway. To further explore the relationship between cdk5 and MEK1, we compared thein vitro phosphorylation of bacterially expressed MEK1 (inactive), Raf-phosphorylated MEK1 (active), and constitutively active MEK1 (CA-MEK1) by cdk5/p25. Although inactive (unphosphorylated) MEK1 was not phosphorylated by cdk5/p25 (Fig.3A, lane 5), Raf-phosphorylated MEK1 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) and CA-MEK1 (not shown here) were good substrates of cdk5/p25. These data suggested that the Raf-activated MEK1 served as a substrate for cdk5/p25. The effect of cdk5/p25-mediated phosphorylation on MEK1 catalytic activity was then tested using expressed ERK2 as its substrate. In experiments described here the Raf-modified MEK1 with or without cdk5/p35 phosphorylation was used to phosphorylate ERK2. Immunoblot analyses using a phospho-ERK1/2-specific antibody that detects the phosphorylation at the regulatory T and Y residues in the activation loop of ERK2 showed a significant decrease in MEK1 activity (Fig.3B, left panel, lanes 1 and3). Similarly, when the phosphorylation of ERK2 was followed by 32P incorporation, cdk5/p35-mediated phosphorylation of Raf-1, phosphorylated MEK1 showed a decreased phosphorylation of ERK2 (Fig. 3B, right panel, lane 1 versus lane 2). A quantitative measurement of [32P]phosphate incorporation into ERK2 suggested a 75% decrease in MEK1 activity as a result of cdk5/p25 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, lower panel). Similarly, in another experiment, when an NF-M peptide containing the KSP motif KAKSPVPKSPVEEVKP, a preferred substrate for ERK (30Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was incubated in an assay mixture containing ERK2 and CA-MEK1 with and without cdk5/p25, the phosphorylation of the peptide was reduced by ∼40% in the presence of cdk5/p25 (Fig. 3C,upper panel). These experiments supported the idea that the activation of ERK2 by CA-MEK1 is inhibited by cdk5/p35-mediated phosphorylation of CA-MEK1. NGF stimulates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (MAP kinase) pathway in PC12 cells, which results in neuronal differentiation (33Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Also, cdk5 is active in PC12 cells because p35 is endogenously expressed in these cells (38Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6200-6212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of cdk5 on the MAP kinase pathway, PC12 cells were treated with roscovitine, a specific cdk5 inhibitor shown to inhibit endogenous cdk5 activity in cultured cells (17Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Nishi A. Yan Z. Meijer L. Fienberg A.A. Tsai L.H. Kwon Y.T. Girault J.A. Czernik A.J. Huganir R.L. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P.

Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Subsequent treatment of these cells for 25 min with NGF stimulated the MAP kinase pathway as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig.4A, lane 2). Interestingly, when the cells were stimulated with NGF in the presence of roscovitine, the increase in ERK phosphorylation was about 3-fold higher (Fig. 4A, lane 3). The effect of cdk5 on the kinetics of MAP kinase activation was also tested (Fig.4B). PC12 cells were treated with NGF for different times in the presence or absence of roscovitine. In the absence of roscovitine, NGF stimulated the MEK1-dependent MAP kinase pathway in a manner reported by several groups. The MEK activity (as judged by phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels) was near maximal at 20 min after NGF treatment. In the presence of roscovitine, however, there was a slight increase in phospho-ERK1/2 levels after 15 min of NGF treatment followed by a significant increase in ph"

Both NF-κB activity and apoptosis regulation have been linked to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and its downstream effector enzymes, AKT and GSK-3. This study evaluates the role of PI 3-K and its downstream mediators in apoptosis and inflammatory gene induction during RSV infection of airway epithelial cells. Whereas RSV infection alone did not produce significant cytotoxicity until 24–48 h following infection, simultaneous RSV infection and exposure to LY294002, a blocker of PI 3-K activity, resulted in cytotoxicity within 12 h. Furthermore, we found that RSV infection during PI 3-K blockade resulted in apoptosis by examining DNA fragmentation, DNA labeling by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage by Western blotting. RSV infection produced an increase in the phosphorylation state of AKT, GSK-3, and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-K. The activation of PI 3-K by RSV and its inhibition by LY294002 was confirmed in direct PI 3-K activity assays. Further evidence for the central role of a pathway involving PI 3-K and AKT in preserving cell viability during RSV infection was established by the observation that constitutively active AKT transfected into A549 cells prevented the cytotoxicity and apoptosis of combined RSV and LY294002 treatment. Finally, both PI 3-K inhibition by LY294002 and AKT inhibition by transfection of a dominant negative enzyme blocked RSV-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity. These data demonstrate that anti-apoptotic signaling and NF-κB activation by RSV are mediated through activation of PI 3-K-dependent pathways. Blockade of PI 3-K activation resulted in rapid, premature apoptosis and inhibition of RSV-stimulated NF-κB-dependent gene transcription.

The mechanisms and signaling pathways activated by RSV that result in airway epithelial cell death and inflammation are not completely understood. In this study, we investigated a novel mechanism through which RSV inhibits apoptotic cell death and regulates the activity of nuclear transcription factor NF-κB. The earliest pathologic findings in RSV-associated bronchiolitis are airway epithelial necrosis and accumulation of inflammatory cells including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages (12Everard M.L. Swarbrick A. Wrightham M. McIntyre J. Dunkley C. James P.D. Sewell H.F. Milner A.D. Arch. Dis. Child. 1994; 71: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 13Aherne W. Bird T. Court S.D. Gardner P.S. McQuillin J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1970; 23: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Chemokines, including the C-X-C chemokine IL-8, attract neutrophils and lymphocytes to the infected epithelium and contribute to their subsequent activation (14Baggiolini M. Walz A. Kunkel S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar, 15Larsen C.G. Anderson A.O. Appella E. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. Science. 1989; 243: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Our previous work and that of others (16Mastronarde J.G. He B. Monick M.M. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Hunninghake G.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) has demonstrated the direct stimulation of IL-8 synthesis and release from airway epithelial cells by RSV. RSV induces the synthesis and release of IL-8 through activation of multiple transcription factors including NF-κB (16Mastronarde J.G. He B. Monick M.M. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Hunninghake G.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Mastronarde J.G. Monick M.M. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Hunninghake G.W. J. Infect.

NF-κB is also a critical transcription factor for other inflammatory mediators produced during RSV infection including IL-1α, IL-6, IL-11, RANTES, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (19Bitko V. Velazquez A. Yang L. Yang Y.C. Barik S. Virology. 1997; 232: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Thomas L.H. Friedland J.S. Sharland M. Becker S. J.

Therefore, the activation of NF-κB is a central determinant of the inflammatory response provoked by RSV infection. In addition to its role in regulating cytokine synthesis, NF-κB also functions as an important mediator in apoptotic signaling pathways. Inhibition of NF-κB activation has been associated with increased apoptotic cell death initiated by a variety of stimuli including TNF, ionizing radiation, and chemotherapeutic agents (22Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar, 23Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). NF-κB appears to mediate the suppression of apoptosis through stimulus-specific induction of inhibitor proteins, including IAP (IAP1, IAP2, and XIAP), TRAF, (TRAF1 and TRAF2), Bcl-2 (A1/Bfl-1 and Bcl-xL), and A20 (24Wang C.Y.

Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of NF-κB on apoptosis are not necessarily anti-apoptotic. In hypoxia-induced epithelial death (28Matsushita H. Morishita R. Nata T. Aoki M. Nakagami H. Taniyama Y. Yamamoto K. Higaki J. Yasufumi K. Ogihara T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 974-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), reovirus-induced epithelial death (29Connolly J.L. Rodgers S.E. Clarke P. Ballard D.W. Kerr L.D. Tyler K.L. Dermody T.S. J.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), NF-κB activity promotes apoptosis. Overall, the pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic effects of NF-κB appear to be determined by both the type of stimulus and the cell type. The impact of NF-κB up-regulation by RSV with respect to apoptosis has not been categorized in airway epithelial cells. NF-κB activity is regulated at multiple levels both in the cytoplasm, where it is sequestered in an inactive state, and in the nucleus following translocation. The NF-κB superfamily of transcriptional activators form homodimers or heterodimers composed of subunits of the Rel family (p65/RelA, p50/NF-κB1, p52/NF-κB2, RelB, and c-Rel), which are sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitor proteins IκBα and IκBβ. NF-κB is released and translocates to the nucleus when IκB is phosphorylated by IκB kinase and targeted for degradation (32Matthews J.R. Hay R.T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 865-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Specific NF-κB subunits including p65/RelA may be further regulated by phosphorylation in the transactivation domain (33Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 34Bird T.A. Schooley K. Dower S.K. Hagen H. Virca G.D. J. Biol.

Finally, NF-κB activity may also be determined by the ability of the individual subunits to associate with basal transcription factors including TFIID/TBP (36Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Wamsley P. Schmitt M.J. Boyer T.G. Zhou Q. Berk A.J. Verma I.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K), has been implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular functions including proliferation, metabolic regulation, and apoptosis (38Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 39Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). In addition to its direct role in apoptosis and metabolic signaling, there is evidence that PI 3-K may play a role in NF-κB regulation. PI 3-K has been shown to mediate NF-κB up-regulation during IL-1 and bradykinin stimulation of cultured epidermoid and airway epithelial cells, respectively (40Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 41Pan Z.K. Christiansen S.C. Ptasznik A. Zuraw B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9918-9922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whereas the precise mechanism of NF-κB up-regulation by PI 3-K remains to be identified, the effects may be partially mediated through AKT (protein kinase B). The enzyme activity of AKT, a serine/threonine kinase, is regulated by the phosphoinositide products of PI 3-K both directly by binding of these lipids to its pleckstrin homology domain (42Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar, 43Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar) and indirectly through subsequent phosphorylation by the phosphoinositol lipid-dependent, upstream kinase PDK-1 (44Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 45Alessi D.R. Deak M.

AKT has been found to play a role in cell survival and apoptosis through its downstream effects on the apoptosis-related proteins BAD and caspase 9 (47Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3718) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AKT has been shown specifically to contribute to NF-κB regulation through association with and activation of IκB kinase during TNF signaling in 293 cells and platelet-derived growth factor signaling in primary fibroblasts (48Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar, 49Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Together, these findings are consistent with the observation that that PI 3-K inhibition can prevent the downstream activation of both AKT and NF-κB in pervanadate-stimulated T cells (50Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Additionally, AKT may contribute to NF-κB regulation through p65/RelA phosphorylation as observed in HepG2 cells with IL-1 stimulation, an effect that did not appear dependent on IκB kinase activation and IκB degradation (35Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the PI 3-K/AKT pathway provides multiple potential links between survival or apoptosis signaling and NF-κB regulation. We have undertaken these studies to define further the mechanisms of inflammatory gene induction and cell death during RSV infection. Because cultured airway epithelial cells display little or no cytotoxic effects early in the course of RSV infection, we hypothesized that RSV activates cell survival and gene transcription pathways that maintain cell viability until mature viral production has been accomplished. In A549-cultured airway epithelial cells, we have found that simultaneous RSV infection and PI 3-K blockade by chemical inhibition with LY294002 results in premature and exaggerated cell death in comparison to RSV alone. Furthermore, the death produced by concurrent RSV infection and LY294002 has features of apoptosis including characteristic DNA fragmentation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. RSV infection produces an early activation of PI 3-K as measured directly by PI 3-K activity assays and indirectly by phosphorylation of the PI 3-K p85 regulatory subunit. Additionally, the RSV-induced PI 3-K activity correlates with phosphorylation of the downstream effectors, AKT and GSK-3, at regulatory-specific residues. The phosphorylation was blocked by pretreatment with LY294002. The role of the PI 3-K/AKT pathway in preserving cellular viability during infection was further supported by the observation that constitutively active AKT attenuated the cytotoxicity and apoptotic effect of chemical PI 3-K blockade. Finally, PI 3-K inhibition by LY294002 or AKT inhibition by transfection of a dominant negative AKT blocked RSV-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity. These observations suggest that RSV activates the PI 3-K/AKT survival pathway, which promotes cellular survival and contributes to NF-κB activation. PI 3-K p85 monoclonal antibody and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. Serine 473-phospho-AKT and serine 21/9-phospho-GSK-3 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Laboratories, (Beverly, MA). Phosphotyrosine PY20, GSK-3, AKT, PARP, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A549 cells, a tumor cell line with properties of normal airway epithelial cells (16Mastronarde J.G. He B. Monick M.M. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Hunninghake G.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 51Lazrak A. Samanta A. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L848-L857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and incubated at 37o in 5% CO2. The cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 40 mg/ml gentamicin and had been subcultured by harvesting in 0.12% trypsin no more than 20 times from stock originally designated at pass 70. To minimize effects of exogenous growth factors or cytokines in our system, we reduced the supplemented serum concentration to 0.5% 24 h prior to and during all experiments with RSV infection. This serum supplement concentration slowed, but did not stop, cell division and produced no evidence of cytotoxicity for 72 h. RSV, strain A2, was obtained from Advanced Biotechnologies Inc. (Columbia, MD) and was used directly as supplied for all experiments. The viral preparation was tested to have a TCID50 titer of ∼1 × 109 in Hep-2 cells at 7 days. Sterile vials of the RSV preparation were supplied in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, stored at −135 °C and rapidly thawed at 37 °C immediately prior to use. The RSV was diluted to a final concentration of 1:1000 of original stock for all experimental treatments. A replication-defective adenovirus vector encoding a constitutively active murine AKT (Ad.myr-AKT) was generously provided by K. Walsh (Boston). The vector contained epitope tagged enzyme (HA-AKT) with the c-srcmyristoylation sequence fused in sequence to the N terminus of the coding sequence. The construction and activity of the vector has been described previously (52Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The vector was amplified without modification in 293 cells, purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C in 10 mm Tris buffer containing 20% glycerol. Virus particle titers were determined byA260 measurement for DNA and were ∼1013 DNA particles/ml. Control adenovirus vector containing β-galactosidase (Ad.LacZ) was purchased commercially (Vector Core Laboratory, University of Iowa, Iowa City). Plasmid vectors containing a hemagglutinin-tagged, murine α-AKT mutant (K179M) inserted into a pCMV6 parental vector were generously provided by A. Toker (Boston, MA). This mutation is a substitution of lysine with methionine at position 179 in the ATP-binding site resulting in complete inhibition of the kinase activity. This mutation has been characterized previously (53Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 54Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). Cell death and cytotoxicity were measured by two different methods: lactate dehydrogenase assay to quantify cellular lysis and an ethidium homodimer/calcein combined fluorescent assay to quantify membrane integrity and cell viability. For the lactate dehydrogenase assay cell culture, supernatants were aspirated, and the remaining adherent cells were lysed by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 directly to each tissue culture well. Following incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatants and lysates were centrifuged to remove debris. After addition of phosphate buffer (0.1m, pH 7.40), NADH (0.3 mm), and sodium pyruvate (0.6 mm), absorbance kinetics were measured at 340 nm. LDH activity in the supernatant was normalized to total LDH measured in supernatant plus lysate for each sample and expressed as percent of total activity, (i.e. % LDH activity = LDH activity supernatant/LDH activity supernatant + LDH activity cell lysate). For the death and viability combined assay a commercially available kit, the LIVE/DEAD® Viability/Cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used in a 96-well microplate format. A549 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plate at 20,000 cells/well and infected with adenoviral vector constructs as described below. After 36 h, the media were replaced with MEM at 0.5% and the cells cultured overnight. The cells were then exposed to 50 μmLY294002 or solvent control for 1 h followed by infection with RSV. Twelve or twenty four hours post-infection, the A549 cells were stained with 8 μm ethidium homodimer (EthD-1) for 15 min, and the fluorescence of EthD-1 bound to DNA in damaged cells was measured using 540 ± 10 nm excitation filter and 620 ± 10 nm emission filter on a Victor2® (EG&G Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD) microplate reader. The same cells were subsequently stained with 4 μm calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM) for 30 min, and the fluorescence of calcein was measured using 485 ± 8 nm excitation filter and 620 ± 10 nm emission filter. Cell death and cell viability were expressed as relative fluorescence intensity of EthD-1 and calcein, respectively, after subtraction of background fluorescence from wells containing the fluorescent dyes in culture media and no cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis for DNA fragmentation was carried out using an Apo-DirectTM kit obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Briefly, A549 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, incubated 24 h in MEM supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, and exposed to LY294002 (50 μm) or control solvent Me2SO (1 μl/ml) for 1 h. RSV was added and the cells incubated for an additional 6 h. Cells were washed once with PBS and harvested by trypsinization. Cells in the washes and supernatants were pelleted and combined with the adherent fractions. The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stored in 70% ethanol at −20 °C until staining and analysis. Cells were labeled with FITC-conjugated deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotides and propidium iodide according to manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScanTM, Becton Dickson, San Jose, CA) using CELLQuest software, (Becton Dickson). Cellular DNA was isolated using Easy-DNATM obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, A549 cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were exposed to LY294002 and RSV as above, harvested by scraping, and washed once with PBS. Following cell lysis, DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform partition and precipitated in ethanol. The DNA was then resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and purified by RNase treatment (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA fragmentation was assessed by gel electrophoresis in 1.7% agarose containing 3.0 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Following experimental exposure, the cells were washed in sterile PBS and harvested by scraping into lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, all from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Detached cells in supernatants and wash were pelleted at 300 × g for 3 min and combined with the scraped lysate. Complete cell disruption was carried out by sonication for 15 s, and insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration in the lysate supernatant was measured by Bradford assay normalized to bovine serum albumin. Equal protein weights were mixed 1:1 with sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 1.25 m Tris, pH 6.8), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Following development of phospho-AKT and phospho-GSK-3 bands, bound immunoglobulins were removed from the membranes by washing for 1 h at room temperature in ImmunoPure IgG Elution Buffer (Pierce), and the membranes were re-probed for total AKT and GSK-3. Adherent and detached cells were harvested following the same procedures for the Western blot protocol. 200 μg of total cell protein was cleared by incubating for 2 h with 1 μg/sample of rabbit IgG and 10 μl/sample of GammaBind-Sepharose. After centrifuging, the supernatants were transferred to a tube containing 2.5 μg/sample of anti-p85 antibody bound to GammaBind-Sepharose and rotated at 4o overnight. For study of the PI 3-K phosphorylation status, the immunoprecipitated protein was washed three times with high salt buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.50 m NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) and twice with lysis buffer (see Western analysis). The protein was then released with 2× Western sample buffer (above), incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine. Activity was assayed by measuring the formation of PI 3-[32P]phosphate by immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase preparations. Immunoprecipitation using an antibody to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase was performed as above. Following isolation, the bound protein was washed three times with buffer I (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μm Na3VO4), three times with buffer II (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mmLiCl, and 100 μm Na3VO4), and finally three times with buffer III (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μmNa3VO4). After pelleting, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer III with the addition of 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 and 10 μl of PI (2 μg/ml). The PI was prepared by drying down an aliquot of chloroform-diluted stock under nitrogen, adding Tris, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EGTA to the tube, and sonicating on ice until the lipid was dispersed in suspension. It was then added immediately to the assay tube. The samples were equilibrated at room temperature for 5 min prior to the addition of 10 μl of radiolabeled substrate ATP (440 μm ATP with 30 μCi/10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP). Following gentle agitation for 10 min, the reaction was terminated by the ad"
https://openalex.org/W2152532147,"We investigated the effect of 2-methyl-arachidonyl-2'-fluoro-ethylamide (Met-F-AEA), a stable analog of the endocannabinoid anandamide, on a rat thyroid epithelial cell line (FRTL-5) transformed by the K-ras oncogene, and on epithelial tumors derived from these cells. Met-F-AEA effect in vivo was evaluated in a nude mouse xenograft model, where K-ras-transformed (KiMol) cells were implanted subcutaneously. Met-F-AEA (0.5 mg/kg/dose) induced a drastic reduction in tumor volume. This effect was inhibited by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (0.7 mg/kg/dose) and was accompanied by a strong reduction of K-ras activity. Accordingly, KiMol cells and tumors express CB1 receptors. Met-F-AEA inhibited (IC50 ~5 mM) the proliferation in vitro and the transition to the S phase of KiMol cells and it reduced K-ras activity; these effects were antagonized by SR141716A. Met-F-AEA cytostatic action was significantly smaller in nontransformed FRTL-5 cells than in KiMol cells. Met-F-AEA treatment exerted opposite effects on the expression of CB1 receptors in KiMol and FRTL-5 cells, with a strong up-regulation in the former case and a suppression in nontransformed cells. The data suggest that: 1) Met-F-AEA inhibits ras oncogene-dependent tumor growth in vivo through CB1 cannabinoid receptors; and 2) responsiveness of FRTL-5 cells to endocannabinoids depends on whether or not they are transformed by K-ras."
https://openalex.org/W2074702672,"In vertebrates, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) exhibits circadian activation in several clock structures and likely participates in the timekeeping mechanism of the circadian clock. Here we show that MAPK associates with a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factor BMAL1, a positive regulator for the autoregulatory feedback loop of the circadian oscillator. MAPK phosphorylates BMAL1 at multiple sites, including Ser-527, Thr-534, and Ser-599, in vitro, and BMAL1:CLOCK-induced transactivation from the E-box element is inhibited by expression of a constitutive active form of MAPK kinase in 293 cells. The inhibitory effect is reversed by coexpression of the kinase-dead mutant of MAPK or by mutation of BMAL1 at Thr-534.

Products ofPer and Cry genes feed back to inhibit BMAL1:CLOCK-induced transcription, resulting in a decrease in levels of these gene products. This then allows the molecular cycle to start again with the activation of the BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer, forming a transcription/translation-based negative feedback loop. Behavioral and molecular analyses of mutant mice for Clock, Per2, Crys,and Bmal1 genes have clarified their circadian function (3Chang D.C. Reppert S.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and in particular, Bmal1 knock-out mice exhibit a complete loss of the circadian rhythmicity immediately upon placement in constant darkness, indicating a central role of BMAL1 in the circadian oscillator (4Bunger M.K.

In addition to the transcriptional regulation, posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation of clock gene products seem to regulate the stability and period length of the circadian cycle by generating an appropriate time lag (5Dunlap J.C.

We demonstrated previously that a transient inhibition of circadian activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 induced a phase shift of the oscillator in the chick pineal gland (7Sanada K.

In the chick pineal gland, MAPK appears to be regulated via the Ras-Raf-1-MEK pathway, and this classical MAPK cascade seems to form a secondary loop interconnected to the core feedback loop (7Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Noticeably, the photic signal down-regulates pineal MAPK via light-activated MAPK phosphatase without affecting the Ras-MEK pathway (8Hayashi Y. Sanada K. Fukada Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that MAPK activity is regulated by the clock and photic signals via independent pathways and suggest a pivotal role of MAPK in maintenance of the circadian rhythm and its photic entrainment. Despite growing evidence supporting an important contribution of MAPK to the clock system, less is known about its downstream pathway. One such candidate is the cAMP response element-binding protein/cAMP-response element transcriptional pathway (12Yamaguchi S. Mitsui S. Miyake S. Yan L. Onishi H. Yagita K. Suzuki M. Shibata S.

In this study, we examined another stream of MAPK signaling and found a direct interaction of MAPK with the clock component BMAL1 for negative regulation of BMAL1:CLOCK-induced transcription via BMAL1 phosphorylation. The open reading frame (ORF) of chicken MAPK (GenBankTM accession no. AY033635) was amplified from chicken pineal cDNA by PCR using LA Taq polymerase (Takara) and a pair of primers (5′-GGGAGGAGTCGACTCATGGCGGCGGTGGCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGTCGACGAAGACTAAGATCGATATCCTGGCTGG-3′). The PCR product was digested with SalI and ligated into SaII-digested pCMV-Tag3C (Stratagene). For bacterial expression of myc epitope-tagged MAPK, the 1.2 kbp-NcoI/XhoI fragment of MAPK-pCMV-Tag3C was ligated intoNcoI/SalI-digested pET21d (Novagen). In reporter gene assay, we used ERK2(K54R)-pEF-BOS plasmid (a kind gift of Masato Ogata at Osaka Medical School, Osaka, Japan) for expression of human K54R-ERK2 (KR-MAPK, kinase-dead mutant). For the yeast two-hybrid assay, the ORF of human K54R-ERK2 was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-GGTCGACTTCATATGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCG-3′ and 5′-GGTGTCGACTTAAGATCTGTATCCTGGCTGGAATC-3′). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and SalI and then ligated into NdeI/SalI-digested pGBKT7 (CLONTECH). The ORF of chicken CLOCK and BMAL1 (16Okano T. Yamamoto K. Okano K. Hirota T. Kasahara T. Sasaki M. Takanaka Y. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was ligated intoXhoI-digested pGADT7 (CLONTECH) for the yeast two-hybrid assay. The ORF of chicken BMAL1 was ligated intoSalI-digested pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for its bacterial expression as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. For reporter gene assay, the ORF of chicken BMAL1 was ligated into SalI-digested pCMV-Tag3C. Mutations (Ser/Thr to Ala) were introduced into BMAL1 by using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Construction of a plasmid for expression of chicken CLOCK in mammalian cells was described previously (16Okano T. Yamamoto K. Okano K. Hirota T. Kasahara T. Sasaki M. Takanaka Y. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The ORF of chicken MEK (GenBankTM accession no. L28703) was amplified from chicken pineal cDNA by PCR with a pair of primers (5′-GCGGGATCCCGGCCATGCCGGCCAAG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCGAAGACTCACGGCAGCACGGGTGGGTG-3′). The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and ligated intoBamHI-digested pGEX-5X-1 or pCMV-Tag3C. A constitutive active form of chicken MEK (DE-MEK) was produced by mutations of Ser-220 to Asp and Ser-224 to Glu (17Huang W. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8960-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with the aid of the site-directed mutagenesis kit. GST-BMAL1 and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) cultured with 30 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C for 15–20 h. The bacteria in a 1-liter culture were then suspended with 50 ml of a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.8, at 4 °C) containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice for lysis followed by centrifugation (45,000 × g for 30 min). GST-fusion proteins in the supernatant were purified by a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and the glutathione used for the elution was removed by passing through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.03% (w/v) Brij 35, pH 7.8, at 4 °C). After concentration by a Centricon YM-100 concentrator (Amicon), the protein content was estimated by the densitometry of SDS-PAGE gel bands in comparison with those of serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin standards in the same gel. GST-DE-MEK was bacterially expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS, and the bacteria were sonicated in the lysis buffer followed by centrifugation (45,000 × g for 30 min). GST-DE-MEK extracted in the supernatant was then purified as described above. For preparing the phosphorylated form of myc epitope-tagged MAPK (termed P-myc-MAPK), bacterially expressed myc-MAPK (1 mg) was purified to near homogeneity by a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmNa3VO4, pH 7.8), and then phosphorylated by incubation at 30 °C for 2 h with GST-DE-MEK (100 μg) in 10 ml of a kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mmMgCl2, and 50 μmNa3VO4, pH 7.8) containing 1 mmATP. This mixture was passed through a glutathione-Sepharose column to adsorb GST-DE-MEK, and the flow-through fraction containing P-myc-MAPK was dialyzed against buffer B. Based on gel shift analysis, we estimated more than 90% of MAPK to be phosphorylated. GST-BMAL1, its mutant, or GST alone (each 3 μg) was incubated with myc-MAPK or P-myc-MAPK (0.3 μg) in 80 μl of a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 135 mm NaCl, 50 μm NaF, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmNa3VO4, pH 7.8) containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 1 h. To this mixture was added 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for sedimentation of GST-fusion protein, which was washed five times with the binding buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. The bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-GST antibody (1:10,000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as described (7Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant myc-MAPK or P-myc-MAPK (0.3 μg) was incubated with 1.8 μg of GST-BMAL1, its mutant, or GST alone in 80 μl of the kinase buffer at 30 °C in the presence of 400 μm [γ-32P]ATP (200 Bq/pmol). The reaction mixture was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation level of GST-BMAL1 was estimated by autoradiography of the gel. For phosphopeptide analysis, recombinant GST-BMAL1 (18 μg) was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h with 1.8 μg of P-myc-MAPK in 80 μl of the kinase buffer containing 1 mm ATP. GST-BMAL1 thus phosphorylated was then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot containing the GST-BMAL1 protein band was excised, washed five times with water, and incubated for blocking with 100 mm acetic acid containing 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing five times with water, the blot was incubated with 0.03 μg of lysylendopeptidase Achromobacter protease I at 37 °C for 18 h in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.8) containing 10% (w/v) acetonitrile. The mixture was then supplemented with 2 μg of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease for further digestion at 37 °C for 18 h, and the digest was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC (18Sanada K. Kokame K. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Yoshizawa T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 15459-15462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All the fragments eluted from the column were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager MALDI-TOF/MS spectrometer equipped with a delayed extraction ion source, operated in the linear mode, PerSeptive Biosystems). For sequence analysis of phosphopeptides (19Takayama M. Matsui T. Sakai T. Tsugita A. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 194-198PubMed Google Scholar), the HPLC-purified peptide was lyophilized, dissolved in 10 μl of 10% (w/v) HCl for incubation at 50 °C for 6 h, and subjected to MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. MAPK is known to translocate to the nucleus where activated MAPK phosphorylates and regulates nuclear proteins including transcription factors, and in some cases, MAPK forms a complex with its substrate (20Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to examine the possible interaction of MAPK (with kinase-dead MAPK as bait) with a couple of basic helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factors, chicken BMAL1 and CLOCK, that are important elements in the clock function (16Okano T. Yamamoto K. Okano K. Hirota T. Kasahara T. Sasaki M. Takanaka Y. Fukada Y. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, MAPK interacted with BMAL1 (Fig.1A) but not with CLOCK (data not shown). We further explored this interaction by GST pull-down assay and examined the effect of MAPK phosphorylation on the complex formation with BMAL1. GST-BMAL1 preferentially associated with phosphorylated MAPK (P-myc-MAPK) rather than with myc-MAPK, whereas GST alone interacted with neither of the proteins (Fig. 1B). Deletion of C-terminal 140 amino acids of BMAL1 (GST-BMAL1(1–493)) did not abrogate the interaction, implying that the C-terminal activation domain (21Takahata S. Ozaki T. Mimura J. Kikuchi Y. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) is not required for the interaction with MAPK. These two analyses suggest that BMAL1 could be one of the in vivotargets of phosphorylated and hence activated MAPK. We then tested whether BMAL1 is phosphorylated by activated MAPK. In the presence of radiolabeled ATP, GST-BMAL1 was efficiently phosphorylated by P-myc-MAPK (Fig. 2A,lane 9) but not by myc-MAPK (lane 8). Quantitative analysis of the time-dependent change of the phosphorylated band revealed that BMAL1 incorporated 6–7 pmol of32Pi/pmol of protein, indicating that MAPK phosphorylates BMAL1 at multiple sites (Fig. 2B). Noticeably, deletion of the C-terminal 140 amino acids of BMAL1 resulted in substantial loss of phosphorylation by P-myc-MAPK (Fig.2A, lane 7) despite the MAPK binding of the truncated form being comparable with that of full-length BMAL1 (Fig.1B). We speculate that the C-terminal region of BMAL1 contains the primary site(s) for MAPK phosphorylation. Within the C-terminal 140 amino acids of BMAL1 from human, rat, mouse, chicken, and zebrafish, we find six conserved sites for putative MAPK phosphorylation (ψX(S/T)P, in which ψ is aliphatic or proline; see Refs. 22Alvarez E.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the phosphorylation site(s), GST-BMAL1 was incubated with either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated MAPK in the presence of unlabeled ATP, digested by lysylendopeptidase and V8 protease, and subjected to reversed-phase HPLC for isolating the proteolytic fragments. From nonphosphorylated BMAL1, we obtained two relevant fragments (termed A and B) showing MALDI-TOF/MS signals at m/z 3509.4 and 2333.2, which correspond to the BMAL1 sequences Ile-513–Lys-546 (fragment A: calculated mass 3508.9, assuming that Cys-523 is acrylamided) and Asn-583–Asp-604 (fragment B: calculated mass 2333.4), respectively (Table I). The assignment of the fragment was confirmed by MS-based sequence analysis (see below). We paid special attention to these fragments due to the accumulation of the putative phosphorylation sites within their sequences (Table I, see footnote a and b). As expected, phosphorylated BMAL1 yielded two peak fractions containing fragment A (Ile-513–Lys-546), and they displayed a MALDI-TOF/MS signal at m/z 3589.7 or 3669.4, which corresponds to the peptide modified by one or two phosphate groups (3508.9 plus 79.9 or 159.8 mass units, respectively; Table I). Fragment B (Asn-583–Asp-604) derived from phosphorylated BMAL1 showed MALDI-TOF/MS signal atm/z 2412.1, corresponding to the peptide with one phosphate group (2333.4 plus 79.9 mass units). This fragment, Asn-583–Asp-604, contains only one putative MAPK phosphorylation site, Ser-599. By contrast, fragment A contains four putative phosphorylation sites, and we performed an MS-based sequence analysis of the doubly phosphorylated fraction of fragment A to determine the phosphorylated residues. This analysis utilizes a sequential C-terminal degradation of a peptide dissolved in 10% (w/v) HCl (Ref. 19Takayama M. Matsui T. Sakai T. Tsugita A. J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 194-198PubMed Google Scholar; see also “Experimental Procedures”). MALDI-TOF/MS analysis of the mixture of partially degraded fragments yielded an array of signals that were assigned to ions of fragments with 0–2 phosphate groups. As summarized in Table II, the loss of phosphate groups was observed at two distinct degradation steps, one from peptide 513–538 to 513–533 and the other from peptide 513–532 to 513–525, supporting the phosphorylation sites at Thr-534 and Ser-527 (Table II). The three sites for in vitro MAPK phosphorylation, Ser-527, Thr-534 (both in fragment A), and Ser-599 (in fragment B), in BMAL1 were mutated to Ala, and each mutant was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2C). These BMAL1 mutants, S527A, T534A, and S599A, were phosphorylated by activated MAPK to reduced degrees (by ∼24, 24, and 40%, respectively) as compared with wild-type BMAL1, which is consistent with the phosphopeptide analysis predicting in vitrophosphorylation at these sites. The observed multiple phosphorylation of BMAL1 (6–7 pmol phosphate/pmol of protein in average, Fig. 2,B and C) suggests the presence of the other sites to be phosphorylated quantitatively that were not identified in our analyses. Alternatively, the overall phosphorylation reaction may involve, in addition to physiologically important phosphorylation on certain sites, slow reaction of less importance at multiple sites that are phosphorylated to various degrees in vitro. The latter might account for the unsuccessful identification of the other sites in our MS-based peptide analyses.Table IMass analysis of proteolytic fragments containing putative MAPK phosphorylation sitesSourceObserved massPredicted peptide structureCalculated massGST-BMAL13509.4fragment A1-aFragment A: IHRIRGSSPSSCGSSPLNITSTPPPDTSSPGSKK (513).3508.92333.2fragment B1-bFragment B: NSHIGIDMIDNDQGSSSPSNDE (583).2333.4Phosphorylated GST-BMAL13669.4fragment A + 2PO43668.73589.7fragment A + 1PO43588.82412.1fragment B + 1PO42413.3Proteolytic fragments of either GST-BMAL1 or phosphorylated GST-BMAL1 were subjected to MALDI-TOF/MS.

Observed masses (MH+) of two fragments (A and B) containing putative MAPK phosphorylation sites (underlined) were shown. Doubly phosphorylated fragment A Ile-513–Lys-546 was partially degraded by incubation in 10% HCl, and the resultant products were subjected to MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. Putative MAPK phosphorylation sites were highlighted. A functional role of MAPK-catalyzed phosphorylation of BMAL1 was examined by a transcriptional assay in 293 cells in which coexpression of BMAL1 and CLOCK stimulated the E-box element-dependent transcription of a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3A). Under these conditions, coexpression of DE-MEK (a constitutive active form of MEK) suppressed BMAL1:CLOCK-induced transcription, and the maximal inhibition reached 23–30%. This inhibitory effect of DE-MEK was completely reversed by additional coexpression of KR-MAPK (a kinase-dead mutant of MAPK), suggesting that activated MAPK mediates the inhibition of BMAL1:CLOCK-induced transcription. To evaluate the contribution of BMAL1 phosphorylation to the inhibition, we examined the effects of BMAL1 mutations at the phosphorylation sites (S527A, T534A, and S599A) in the transcription assay. Similar to wild-type BMAL1, every mutant induced a large increase in E-box element-dependent transcription together with CLOCK in 293 cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, as is observed for wild-type BMAL1:CLOCK, DE-MEK-dependent suppression of the transactivation was observed for BMAL1(S527A):CLOCK and BMAL1 (S599A):CLOCK (inhibition by 21 and 25%, respectively). On the other hand, the transactivation induced by BMAL1 (T534A):CLOCK was not affected by DE-MEK (Fig. 3B). These results, together with the in vitro data (Fig. 1 and Table II), indicate that MAPK negatively regulates E-box-dependent transactivation induced by BMAL1:CLOCK heteromers via phosphorylation of BMAL1 at Thr-534. We speculate that MAPK-catalyzed phosphorylation of BMAL1 at Thr-534 may induce a conformational change of the C-terminal activation domain (21Takahata S. Ozaki T. Mimura J. Kikuchi Y. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) for inhibiting its activity. At present, it is not clear whether the MAPK-catalyzed phosphorylation of BMAL1 completely inhibits its activity or attenuates it partially. Under our experimental conditions, activation of MAPK gave a modest inhibitory effect (∼30% inhibition) on transactivation of BMAL1 (Fig. 3A). It is likely, however, that endogenous MAPK activated by DE-MEK was only able to phosphorylate a part of overexpressed BMAL1. This would lead to the weak inhibition of the transactivation even if phosphorylated BMAL1 retains no substantial activity. Protein characterization of BMAL1 is required to understand the mechanism underlying the phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of BMAL1 function. MAPK activity exhibits a circadian rhythm with a peak at mid to late subjective night in various clock structures (7Sanada K. Hayashi Y. Harada Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 986-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Harada Y. Sanada K. Fukada Y. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). During the nighttime, protein levels of negative regulatory elements in the circadian feedback loop (mPERs and mCRYs) are in declining phase, but their mRNA levels do not start to increase until these protein levels reach to their circadian trough at late subjective night (2Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). BMAL1:CLOCK-mediated transcription ofmPer/mCry is kept suppressed during mid to late subjective night despite very low protein levels of negative elements. Therefore the negative element-independent inhibition of the BMAL1:CLOCK heteromer seems to delay the restart of the mPer/mCRY cycle, generating an appropriate time lag required for the circadian rhythmicity of the oscillator (5Dunlap J.C. Science. 1998; 280: 1548-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The MAPK-mediated inhibition of BMAL1 activity observed in this study (Fig. 3) is an event capable of explaining well such a time lag for activation of E-box element-dependent transcription during the nighttime, and thereby MAPK is likely involved in the timekeeping mechanism of the circadian oscillation. Recently a BMAL1 homolog, BMAL2 (also called MOP9 or CLIF), has been identified in various clock structures (16Okano T. Yamamoto K. Okano K. Hirota T. Kasahara T. Sasaki M. Takanaka Y. Fukada Y.

J. Neurosci. 2000; 20 (1–5): RC83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, phospho-acceptor sites on chicken BMAL1 (Ser-527/Thr-534/Ser-599) are highly conserved among all of the known BMAL1s in vertebrates but are not found in any BMAL2s. Considering that BMAL1 is an essential component that cannot be compensated by any other components in the oscillator (4Bunger M.K. Wilsbacher L.D. Moran S.M. Clendenin C. Radcliffe L.A.

Cell. 2000; 22: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), it is likely that the BMAL1-specific regulation mediated by MAPK makes a fundamental contribution to the circadian regulation of E-box element-dependent transcription in the oscillator.

Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). PPARγ is also expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (4Iijima K. Yoshizumi M. Ako J. Eto M. Kim S. Hashimoto M. Sugimoto N. Liang Y.Q. Sudoh N. Toba K. Ouchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PPARγ is activated by a natural ligand, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-d-PGJ2) (5Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar) such as pioglitazone (Pio) and troglitazone (Tro). Ligand-activated PPARγ forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor, binds to a specific DNA sequence, PPAR response element (PPRE), and activates target gene transcription (1Schoonjans K. Martin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These effects are referred to as “genomic” action, which requires relatively long periods. A growing body of evidences suggests that steroid hormones have more rapid effects so-called “nongenomic” effects, which may be mediated by membrane-bound steroid receptors (7Schmidt B.M. Gerdes D. Feuring M. Falkenstein E. Christ M. Wehling M. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 21: 57-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Estrogen is well characterized for the rapid nongenomic action. Estrogen induces an increase in the intracellular cGMP level and the release of nitric oxide within a few minutes of administration in endothelial cells (8Caulin-Glaser T. Garcia-Cardena G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Estrogen also activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) within 15 min (9Singh M. Setalo G. Guan X. Warren M. Toran-Allerand C.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These time courses are too rapid to encompass the classical genomic mechanism mediated by estrogen response element-dependent gene transcription. Consistent with these findings, bovine serum albumin-conjugated estrogen, which is impermeable to cell membrane, has been also reported to activate the ERK pathway in endothelial cells (10Russell K.S. Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and in a neuroblastoma cell line (11Watters J.J. Campbell J.S. Cunningham M.J. Krebs E.G. Dorsa D.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4030-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that nongenomic actions of estrogen via novel membrane-bound estrogen receptor play a pivotal role in mediating intracellular signals. Phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase, a heterodimer of an adapter subunit (p85) and a catalytic subunit (p110), is activated by many growth factors (12Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). PI3-kinase phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring of PI to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (13Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). One of the effector molecules downstream from PI3-kinase is Akt/PKB, a serine/threonine kinase (14Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have demonstrated in the present study that PPARγ agonists such as 15-d-PGJ2, Pio, and Tro rapidly activated the MEK/ERK pathway and led to c-fos mRNA induction in VSMCs. We have also demonstrated that PI3-kinase was responsible for ERK activation by 15-d-PGJ2. To our knowledge, this is the first report to reveal that PPARγ agonists activate the MEK/ERK pathway in VSMCs.

VSMCs were lysed in a sample buffer (50 mmol/liter NaCl, 30 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 10 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/liter PSMF, 0.2 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 mmol/liter pepstatin A, and 25 mmol/liter leupeptin). The lysates were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membrane was probed with antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, phospho-Akt, and Akt (New England Biolabs) and enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phosphorylation of ERK is reported to correlate with kinase activity (20Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used phosphorylation of ERK as a measure for its activation. Total RNA was prepared by an acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform extraction method, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (21Takeda K. Ichiki T. Funakoshi Y. Ito K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 297-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity of hybridized band of c-fos mRNA and 18 S rRNA was quantified by a MacBAS Bioimage Analyzer (Fujifilm). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured VSMCs, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (22Funakoshi Y. Ichiki T. Ito K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A DNA probe (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) that encodes consensus AP-1 sequence was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Five μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 × 105 cpm of labeled DNA probe for 30 min at room temperature and electrophoresed on 5% acrylamide gel. Fifty-fold molar excess of unlabeled AP-1 was added as a competitor. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed on x-ray films (Kodak). VSMCs were incubated with 15-d-PGJ2 or TZDs for 24 h. The cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine during the final 4 h. After labeling, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and then washed with a mixture of ethanol and ether (2:1). The cells were lysed in 0.5 NaOH, and incorporated [3H]thymidine was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Statistical analyses of the phosphorylated ERK level, the relative c-fos mRNA expression, and thymidine incorporation were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's test if appropriate. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E., and p < 0.05 was considered significant. VSMCs were incubated with 10 μmol/liter 15-d-PGJ2, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was determined by Western blot analysis. Fig.1A shows that 15-d-PGJ2 significantly increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Fig. 1Bshows that incubation with varying concentrations of 15-d-PGJ2 for 15 min resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2. Agonists for PPARα such as clofibrate and Wy-14,643 were also reported to activate ERK in mouse liver cell (23Rokos C. Ledwith BJ. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13452-13457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, bezafibrate, one of the PPARα agonists, rather suppressed phosphorylation of ERK in our VSMCs (Fig.1C). Activation of ERK leads to immediate early gene expression such as c-fos (24Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether activation of ERK by 15-d-PGJ2 resulted in c-fos mRNA induction. 15-d-PGJ2 (10 μmol/liter) transiently induced expression of c-fos mRNA after 30 min of exposure (Fig.2A). Me2SO used for a vehicle for 15-d-PGJ2 did not affect c-fos mRNA expression (data not shown). Fig. 2B shows that incubation with varying concentrations of 15-d-PGJ2 for 30 min resulted in a dose-dependent increase in c-fos mRNA expression. We performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to determine whether 15-d-PGJ2-induced c-fos gene expression led to an increase in the AP-1 binding activity. As shown in Fig.2C, treatment of 15-d-PGJ2 increased the AP-1 binding activity to the AP-1 consensus sequence in a time-dependent manner. The band is specific for AP-1 sequence, because it was eliminated by the addition of 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled AP-1 probe. These results suggest that 15-d-PGJ2 induces not only ERK activation but also c-fos mRNA expression and AP-1 binding activity. However, the reason that AP-1 binding activity lasted longer than ERK activation and c-fos mRNA induction is not clear at this point. To determine whether activation of ERK1/2 by 15-d-PGJ2 is mediated by PPARγ, we examined the effect of Pio, another PPARγ agonist, on ERK1/2 activation. Treatment with Pio (20 μmol/liter) induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 within 15 min (Fig.3A). Pio dose-dependently induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig.3B). Pio also induced c-fos mRNA expression within 30 min (Fig. 3C). The expression of c-fosmRNA by Pio was increased dose-dependently (Fig.3D). To further confirm the involvement of PPARγ, we examined the effect of Tro, another type of TZD, on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Treatment of Tro (20 μmol/liter) for 15 min induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). Tro also induced c-fos mRNA expression after 30 min (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that PPARγ may be involved in ERK activation and c-fos mRNA induction by PPARγ agonists such as 15-d-PGJ2, Pio, and Tro. We determined the effect of two different inhibitors of MEK, PD98059 and U0126, on 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Pretreatment with PD98059 (30 μmol/liter) or U0126 (20 μmol/liter) completely inhibited 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Pretreatment with PD98059 or U0126 also completely suppressed 15-d-PGJ2-induced c-fos mRNA up-regulation (Fig.4B). However, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, did not affect 15-d-PGJ2-induced c-fos mRNA expression (Fig.4C). These results suggest that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is responsible for c-fos mRNA induction by 15-d-PGJ2. To confirm that the activation of ERK1/2 by 15-d-PGJ2 is independent ofde novo gene transcription such as PPRE-dependent transcription, we examined the effect of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml), an inhibitor of gene transcription, on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Fig. 4D shows that 15-d-PGJ2 induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the presence of actinomycin D, suggesting that activation of ERK1/2 by 15-d-PGJ2 is independent of de novo gene transcription. It has been reported that activation of the ERK pathway was regulated by PI3-kinase (16Pandey S.K. Theberge J.F. Bernier M. Srivastava A.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14667-14675Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Miura K. MacGlashan D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 2199-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We examined whether PI3-kinase mediated 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and c-fos mRNA up-regulation. Pretreatment with wortmannin (100 nmol/liter), an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, inhibited 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK activation (Fig.5A) as well as c-fos mRNA induction (Fig. 5B). To determine whether 15-d-PGJ2 activates PI3-kinase, we examined the phosphorylation level of Akt, one of the downstream targets of PI3-kinase, by Western blot analysis. Treatment of 15-d-PGJ2 for 10 min increased the phosphorylation level of Akt (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that 15-d-PGJ2 activates the P13-kinase pathway, and PI3-kinase activation is necessary for ERK activation. It has been also reported that protein kinase C (PKC) activates the ERK pathway (25Goetze S. Kim S. Xi X.P. Graf K. Yang D.C. Fleck E. Meehan W.P. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 35: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of PKC inhibitors on 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK activation and c-fos mRNA expression. Although pretreatment of PMA for 24 h (PKC depletion) or GF109203X, a PKC inhibitor, for 30 min completely inhibited PMA-induced ERK activation and c-fos mRNA induction (Fig. 6, A and B), these pretreatments did not affect 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK activation and c-fos mRNA induction (Fig. 6, C andD). These results suggest that PKC is not involved in 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK activation pathway. We examined whether 15-d-PGJ2 or TZDs affected DNA synthesis in VSMCs. As shown in Fig.7, A–C, 15-d-PGJ2 and TZDs increased thymidine incorporation. The increase in thymidine incorporation by 15-d-PGJ2 was suppressed by wortmannin (Fig.7D), confirming the role for PI3-kinase in 15-d-PGJ2 signaling. However, the inhibition of thymidine incorporation by wortmannin is partial, suggesting that pathways other than the PI3-kinase/ERK pathway are also involved in 15-d-PGJ2-induced DNA synthesis. We have demonstrated in the present study that 15-d-PGJ2 induces rapid and transient activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in VSMCs. Pio and Tro, two types of TZDs, also induced rapid ERK activation, suggesting that PPARγ may be involved in this process. We also showed that 15-d-PGJ2 and TZDs increased c-fos mRNA expression via activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and that PI3-kinase is responsible for 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK activation. 15-d-PGJ2-induced DNA synthesis was partially dependent on PI3-kinase. 15-d-PGJ2 and TZDs induced rapid activation of ERK. The time course is too rapid to encompass PPRE-dependent gene transcription. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrated that 15-d-PGJ2 could activate ERK in the presence of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of gene transcription (Fig. 3D). The analysis of the c-fos promoter sequence up to about −1300 bp showed an absence of putative PPRE sequences. These results may suggest that 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK activation is independent of PPRE-dependent gene transcription. An increasing body of evidence suggests that steroid hormone has rapid nongenomic effects, which may be mediated by membrane-bound receptors (7Schmidt B.M. Gerdes D. Feuring M. Falkenstein E. Christ M. Wehling M. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 21: 57-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is not clear from our results whether membrane-bound receptor for PPARγ agonists is present in VSMCs. Further investigation using bovine serum albumin-conjugated PPARγ agonists, which are impermeable to plasma membrane, will address the presence of putative membrane-bound receptors for PPARγ agonists. However, bovine serum albumin-conjugated 15-d-PGJ2 or TZDs is not available. We explored the upstream signaling involved in 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK activation. PI3-kinase has been reported to activate the MEK/ERK pathway by several stimuli (16Pandey S.K. Theberge J.F. Bernier M. Srivastava A.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14667-14675Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Miura K. MacGlashan D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 2199-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the activation of ERK by 15-d-PGJ2 was completely suppressed by wortmannin, suggesting that this process is dependent on PI3-kinase activation. The finding that 15-d-PGJ2 induced phosphorylation of Akt, a target molecule of PI3-kinase, supports this idea. However, Goetze et al. (25Goetze S. Kim S. Xi X.P. Graf K. Yang D.C. Fleck E. Meehan W.P. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2000; 35: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) obtained a contradictory result in which Tro had no effect on Akt phosphorylation in VSMCs. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear at this time. It has been reported that PI3-kinase regulates the activity of Ras (17Miura K. MacGlashan D.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 2199-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 26Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), upstream molecules of the MEK/ERK pathway. Our findings suggest that activation of PI3-kinase by 15-d-PGJ2 may activate Ras and lead to activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. PKC is reported to activate the ERK pathway (27Haneda M. Araki S. Togawa M. Sugimoto T. Isono M. Kikkawa R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 847-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, pretreatment with PMA for 24 h or with GF109203X did not affect 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK activation or c-fosmRNA induction (Fig. 6). These results suggest that PKC pathway does not play a dominant role in 15-d-PGJ2-induced ERK activation and c-fos mRNA induction in VSMCs. PPARγ agonists regulate various gene expressions; two different mechanisms have been reported previously (1Schoonjans K. Martin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 3Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). First, ligand-activated PPARγ nuclear receptor induces gene expression via binding to PPRE in the target gene promoter (1Schoonjans K. Martin G. Staels B. Auwerx J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), the so-called classical genomic effect. Second, ligand-activated PPARγ nuclear receptor suppresses other gene expression by antagonizing transcriptional factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB (3Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3224) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that PPARγ agonists induced c-fos mRNA expression in an ERK-dependent manner. This may be a novel regulatory mechanism of gene expression by PPARγ agonists. We also demonstrated that 15-d-PGJ2 enhanced AP-1 binding activity (Fig. 2C). AP-1 regulates a large number of genes associated with developmental, proliferative, and inflammatory processes. It was reported previously that estrogen suppressed gene expression of type I collagen through AP-1 in mesangial cells (28Neugarten J. Medve I. Lei J. Silbiger S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F875-F881PubMed Google Scholar, 29Silbiger S. Lei J. Neugarten J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1268-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); these authors observed that estrogen stimulated AP-1 activity via ERK activation and that PD98059 inhibited ERK activity as well as suppression of collagen gene expression. It has also been reported that estrogen reduces the synthesis of type I collagen in VSMCs (30Silbiger S.R. Neugarten J. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 25: 515-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, PPARγ agonists may reduce collagen synthesis through AP-1 activation, which may contribute to the anti-atherogenic effects of PPARγ agonists in vascular walls. Estrogen attenuated superoxide production and phagocytic activity in the MEK/ERK-dependent pathway in microglial cells (31Bruce-Keller A.J. Keeling J.L. Keller J.N. Huang F.F. Camondola S. Mattson M.P. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3646-3656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which estrogen-induced ERK activation suppresses microglial cells has not been clearly determined. One possibility is that estrogen may induce the negative feedback mechanism of ERK activation via up-regulation of MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP). It was previously reported that activated ERK induced the expression of MKP-1 (32Bokemeyer D. Lindemann M. Kramer H.J. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK. Therefore, it may be possible that transient MEK/ERK activation by 15-d-PGJ2 or TZDs and subsequent MKP expression may be responsible for the repression of the MEK/ERK signal induced by stimulation with other cytokines or growth factors. Although 15-d-PGJ2 or TZDs were reported to suppress insulin (26Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar)-, basic fibroblast growth factor (33Law R.E. Goetze S. Xi X.P. Jackson S. Kawano Y. Demer L. Fishbein M.C. Meehan W.P. Hsueh W.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar)-, and angiotensin II (34Graf K. Xi X.P. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)-induced proliferation (or DNA synthesis) of VSMCs, the direct effects of these ligands on VSMCs have not been examined. To our surprise, 15-d-PGJ2 and TZDs were weak mitogen for VSMCs. However, it is not clear at this point whether this in vitro finding has a biological significance in vivo, and thus it requires further investigation. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that PPARγ agonists rapidly induce ERK activation and c-fos mRNA expression in VSMCs. The rapid kinetics suggest the presence of a nongenomic action of PPARγ agonists or a PPARγ-independent action of these ligands. The rapid signaling pathway of PPARγ agonists may implicate a potential mechanism responsible for the cardiovascular protective effects of PPARγ agonists."

Their deduced amino acid sequences are characterized by a strong similarity in the C-terminal region, corresponding to the lysyl oxidase family catalytic domain, and by marked differences in the N-terminal regions.

Kagan H.M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The resulting cross-links in collagen and elastin are essential for the structural integrity and function of connective tissue. The lysyl oxidase (LOX)1 gene encoding the LOX isoenzyme has been localized to human chromosome 5q23.3-q31.2 (2Hämäläinen E.R. Jones T.A. Sheer D. Taskinen K. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I.

The enzyme is synthesized as a 48-kDa precursor, which is N-glycosylated to a form of apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa (3Romero-Chapman N. Lee J. Tinker D. Uriu-Hare J.Y. Keen C.L. Rucker R.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12939-12944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), LOXL3 (11Mäki J.M. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and LOXC (12Ito H. Akiyama H. Iguchi H. Iyama K. Miyamoto M. Ohsawa K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24023-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The deduced molecular masses of these proteins are 63, 87, 80.3, and 82 kDa, respectively. All these LOX isoforms exhibit strong homology within the C-terminal domain encoded by exons 2–6 in the LOX gene (see Fig. 1 in Ref.11Mäki J.M. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This region is characterized by the presence of 10 conserved cysteine residues, suggesting identical tertiary structure of this domain, the existence of the copper binding domain WXWHXCHXHYH with four histidine residues, and the conservation of the tyrosine and lysine residues that form the lysyl-tyrosyl quinone cofactor (13Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Thus the region corresponding to the catalytic domain of lysyl oxidase is very similar among the different members of the lysyl oxidase family. In contrast, the N-terminal regions of the proteins encoded by these cDNAs exhibit very little homology. At the present time the roles of these very different N-terminal regions are not understood. Possible functions include the inhibition of enzyme activity before secretion of the protein, thus preventing undesirable cross-linking of intracellular substrates. In addition, the presence of different N-terminal domains could be linked to the recognition of different substrates or ligands or to the existence of different functions for the five members of the lysyl oxidase family. Indeed, different functions have been described for lysyl oxidases in addition to their traditionally assumed roles on collagen and elastin substrates. LOXs have been implicated in developmental regulation (14Butler E. Handlin J. Benson S. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), tumor suppression (15Kenyon K. Contente S. Trackman P.C. Tang J. Kagan H.M. Friedman R.M. Science. 1991; 253: 802Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 16Hajnal A. Klemenz K. Schäfer R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8157-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It may be speculated that the different functions described are carried out by different members of the lysyl oxidase family. A prerequisite to test this hypothesis is to obtain these proteins in pure and active form. The purpose of this study was to isolate, characterize, and test the activity of the protein encoded by the LOXL gene. Rather than attempting to isolate a putative mature form of LOXL, which might show strong similarity with and therefore be difficult to separate from LOX, we have used specific anti-LOXL antibodies in order to purify the protein with at least a significant portion of the unique N-terminal domain. Previous experiments from our laboratory (18Decitre M. Gleyzal C. Raccurt M. Peyrol S. Aubert-Foucher E. Csiszar K. Sommer P. Lab.

This tissue was used in the present study to isolate the LOXL enzyme. To exclude any enzymatic activity associated with LOX, we have isolated fractions enriched in LOXL antigens, in which LOX enzyme was undetectable by Western blotting. A final immunopurification step allowed us to obtain in pure form a 56-kDa protein identified as bovine LOXL. This protein was largely inactive, but maturation by BMP-1 gave rise to a form able to cross-link insoluble elastin and fibrillar collagen. Aorta from 21-day-old calves were cut into small pieces, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and milled using a grinder (Universal Mühle M 20, Ika Industries). Soluble proteins from the resulting powder were first extracted in 0.12 m NaCl, 16 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7 (soluble fraction), and after centrifugation, the resulting pellet was further extracted in 4m urea in phosphate buffer as described (19Kagan H.M. Sullivan K.A. Olsson III, T.A. Cronlund A.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Before use, urea solutions were freshly deionized with AG 501-X8 resin (Bio-Rad), and buffers were supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1 mm final concentration. The urea concentration was then reduced to 2 m by dilution, and the extract was batch-incubated overnight with DEAE-cellulose equilibrated with 2 m urea in phosphate buffer. After centrifugation, the pellet containing bound proteins was poured into a chromatography column, and LOX was eluted as described previously (19Kagan H.M. Sullivan K.A. Olsson III, T.A. Cronlund A.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The pH of the supernatant containing the unbound proteins was adjusted to 7.0, and this supernatant was batchwise incubated for 7 h with CM-cellulose equilibrated with 16 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 m urea. The unbound fraction was then recovered by centrifugation. This fraction, which did not bind to DEAE and CM-cellulose, was batch-adsorbed overnight to Heparin-agarose equilibrated with 16 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2m urea. After centrifugation, the gel was packed into a column, and proteins were eluted with a 0–0.2 m NaCl gradient in equilibration buffer. Fractions of interest were then collected, diluted to reduce the urea concentration to 0.5m, and applied to the immobilized purified antibodies (see below). After extensive washing of the gel with 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m urea in 16 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, affinity-bound proteins were eluted using 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, 2 m urea, and fractions were quickly neutralized by adding concentrated Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. To produce anti-LOXL antibodies, these being an essential tool in our purification procedure, steps have been added to the standard protocol previously used for the production and isolation of anti-LOX antibodies (20Sommer P. Gleyzal C. Raccurt M. Delbourg M. Serrar M. Joazeiro P. Peyrol S. Kagan H. Trackman P.C. Grimaud J.A. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 460-470PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a GST·LOXL (residues 231 to 368 from the human sequence) fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose, and used for rabbit immunization. IgG from the resulting serum were partially purified by precipitation with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved and extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Antibodies directed against the GST portion of the GST·LOXL fusion protein and against residualE. coli contaminating proteins were eliminated by binding to a GST-E. coli lysate Sepharose column. IgG in the unbound fraction were further purified by affinity chromatography on GST·LOXL fusion protein coupled to CNBr-Sepharose. Bound antibodies were recovered by rapid elution using 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, followed by neutralization and extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. These affinity-purified antibodies were either used in Western blots or immobilized to CNBr-Sepharose to immunopurify LOXL from tissue. In some experiments, biotinylated purified antibodies were used in Western blots, which were visualized with streptavidin alkaline phosphatase; biotinylation of the antibodies was performed as described previously for decorin (21Font B. Aubert-Foucher E. Goldschmidt D. Eichenberger D. van der Rest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25015-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was assayed by ultrafiltration (22Cronshaw A.D. Macbeath J.R.E. Shackleton D.R. Collins J.F. Fothergill-Gillmore L.A. Hulmes D.J.S. Matrix. 1993; 13: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using an elastin substrate prepared as described previously (23Shackleton D.R. Hulmes D.J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Before addition of the labeled substrates, fractions to be tested were preincubated for 1 h in assay buffer (0.1m Na2B4O7, 0.15m NaCl, pH 8.0) in the presence or absence of 60 μg/ml β-amino-propionitrile, a specific inhibitor of lysyl oxidase.3H-labeled substrate was then added and incubated for 16 h at 35 °C; the volume of the sample was such that the final concentration of urea never exceeded 0.1 m. Fractions in assay buffer were supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 and preincubated for 1 h with 0.4 units of recombinant PCP/BMP-1 purified from the culture medium of baculovirus-infected insect cells (24Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 60 μg/ml β-aminopropionitrile. Control experiments were performed in the same conditions in the absence of PCP/BMP-1 and in the presence of BMP-1 alone to check that it had no effect on background disintegrations per minute released from the 3H-labeled elastin substrate. The full-length coding sequence for murine LOXL was amplified by PCR from 3T6–2 fibroblast cDNA using Expand High FidelityTaq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primers were designed according to the AI788109, BE533400, BF135282, and BF124580EST sequences. The following primer pairs, 5′ and 3′, respectively, were used: GAAGAGCCATCCTGTCCTC (location of bases: −87/−70) and CCGTGACGCGGGATCGTAG (573/591); CTACGATCCCGCGTCACGG (573/591) and CGTAGTTAGGGTCCGGGAC (1216/1234); TCAGCGTGGGTAGTGTGTACC (1160/1180) and CTGCCTTTGCCTTGGGCTAG (1907/1926). The full-length coding sequence for bLOXL was amplified from bovine skin tissue using primers CCAGGATGGACAAAGCTAGAGC (−132/−111) and CCCCAGGATCAGGATTGGAC (1765/1784) designed according to BF075931 andAV597018 EST sequences. The full-length bovine LOX encoding sequence was also amplified from bovine skin tissue using primers TGGGGACAGTCCAGGAAAGG (−25/−6) and TTCCACTTCAGAACACCAGGC (1292/1312) designed according to BF043241, BF042533, andBE668652 EST sequences. Amplified products were subcloned into the TOPOII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The murine and bovine LOXL and bovine LOX cDNA sequences have been submitted to GenBankTM (accession numbers AF357006, AF421185,AF421186). For proteolytic digestion, immunopurified 56-kDa protein was digested with sequencing grade trypsin at 37 °C at pH 8.0 at an enzyme/substrate ratio of ∼1/20. After overnight incubation, tryptic fragments were fractionated by high pressure liquid chromatography using an aqueous acetonitrile gradient (4.5–85.5%, 70 min) in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on an Aquapore RP-300 column (100 × 2.1 mm). Gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207530) Google Scholar); unless otherwise indicated, samples were analyzed in reduced form on 10% acrylamide gels, and where indicated, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting for 2 h in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, 10% methanol. In situ treatment of electroblotted protein allowed us to get sufficient amounts of pure protein and to use optimal experimental conditions for enzyme activity. For this, bands of interest were excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride blot and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 200 μl of 0.25% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 (PVP-40). At the end of the incubation, excess PVP-40 was eliminated by extensive washing with water. Digestion with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase was performed essentially according to Moyer et al. (26Moyer M. Harper G. Payne J. Fowler E. J. Protein Chem. 1990; 9: 282-283Google Scholar); the blot was incubated with 0.25 units of pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Sigma) in 50 μl of 0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. For maturation experiments, 0.1 μg of purified PCP/BMP-1 (about 3 units) was added to the membrane piece incubated in 50 μl of 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Brij 35 in the presence of 10 μg ml−1 leupeptin and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following incubation for 17 h at 30 °C, the membrane pieces were washed three times with water, dried, and inserted into the sequencer cartridge. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems 473 A protein sequencer. As a first step, we selected fractions enriched in antigen recognized by the specific anti-LOXL antibodies and partially devoid of the LOX enzyme. As shown in Fig.1B, lane 2, urea extracts of bovine aorta contained at least two antigens (apparent molecular masses of about 80 and 56 kDa) recognized by Western blotting using the anti-LOXL antibodies. At the present time, we have not identified the 80-kDa band. This antigen, whose apparent molecular mass exceeded the deduced mass of the proenzyme (63 kDa), was also present in the saline extract (Fig. 1B, lane 1) and was recognized by the anti-LOXL antibodies only in denatured form because it did not bind to the immuno-affinity column (see Fig. 3B). These antigens revealed by the anti-LOXL antibodies did not bind to DEAE-cellulose and were recovered in the unbound fraction (Fig.1B, lane 3). Even at the low salt concentration used in these experiments (16 mm sodium phosphate), proteins in this fraction did not bind to CM-cellulose (Fig.1B, lane 4). In contrast, the LOX enzyme of an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa, detected in the urea extract (Fig.1C, lane 2) using specific anti-LOX antibodies (20Sommer P. Gleyzal C. Raccurt M. Delbourg M. Serrar M. Joazeiro P. Peyrol S. Kagan H. Trackman P.C. Grimaud J.A. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 460-470PubMed Google Scholar), was bound to DEAE-cellulose and eluted, as expected, in 0.4m NaCl, 6 m urea (Fig. 1C,lane 5). We thus obtained a fraction unbound to standard ion exchange supports, containing the protein of interest from which the major part of the LOX enzyme was eliminated (Fig. 1, B andC, lane 4).Figure 3Immunopurification of LOXLantigen. Fractions eluted from Heparin-agarose were loaded on the anti-LOXL affinity column (lane 1). Lane 2, unbound fraction; lanes 3 and 4, fractions eluted with glycine/urea. A, Coomassie Blue-stained gel of proteins in unreduced (lanes 1–4) or reduced (lane 5) form. B, Western blot of unreduced proteins visualized with biotinylated anti-LOXL antibodies followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because weak ion exchangers were ineffective, we tested different kinds of chromatographic support. Among these, our results showed (Fig.2B) that at low ionic strength, most of the antigens present in the DEAE and CM-cellulose unbound fractions were able to bind to Heparin-agarose and were eluted early using a 0–0.2 m NaCl gradient in equilibration buffer (Fig. 2B, lanes 7–10), whereas the bulk of unrelated proteins was eluted later (Fig. 2A, lanes 12–18). Considering the low NaCl concentration (about 0.1m) used to elute the protein, we assumed that interaction with heparin was only ionic in nature and not associated with specific affinity for the chromatographic support. Fractions enriched in LOXL antigen by Heparin-agarose chromatography were used for the subsequent step. Although this fraction was more concentrated, the protein of interest represented a minor constituent of the fraction because the bands revealed by the immunoblot in Fig. 2B were not clearly visible on Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig. 2A). An efficient step was thus necessary to achieve purification. Preliminary experiments indicated that the affinity-purified antibodies used in Western blots were also able to recognize at least one of the native forms of the antigen and could be used in immuno-precipitation experiments in the presence of 0.5 m urea (results not shown). We thus devised an immuno-chromatographic step using immobilized affinity-purified antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A) showed that the major part of the proteins loaded onto the affinity column (lane 1) was recovered in the flow-through (lane 2). After extensive washing of the gel with 0.5 m NaCl/0.5m urea, a protein of an apparent molecular mass of 56 kDa (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4) was eluted using 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, 2 m urea. Immunoblots of the same fractions (Fig. 3B, lane 2) revealed that two of the three protein bands recognized in denatured form by the antibodies (the higher and lower molecular mass antigens) did not bind to the column. In contrast, the 56-kDa band absent in the flow-through (Fig. 3B, lane 2) was the only one recognized in native form by the anti-LOXL antibodies and corresponded to the protein eluted by glycine/urea visualized in Fig.3A, lanes 3 and 4. Definitive information concerning the purified protein should be provided by amino acid sequencing. Using trypsin, proteolytic fragments of the 56-kDa antigen were obtained, and after isolation by reverse phase chromatography, three main peptides were analyzed, and their sequences were compared with the LOXL and LOX sequences. As the bovine LOXL sequence was not known, the hitherto unknown full-length bovine LOXL cDNA was cloned from bovine skin tissues and sequenced, and to improve the reliability of the comparison, the unknown murine LOXL and bovine LOX sequences were also determined. The first peptide gave a sequence (Fig. 4, peptide 1) identical to the sequence VLLRFPQRV found in human and bovine LOX as well as in bovine, human, and mouse LOXL. Thus the 56-kDa protein is a member of the lysyl oxidase family. Two additional bovine sequences were obtained (Fig. 4, peptides 2 and3). Peptide 2 was 92% identical to the bovine LOXL deduced sequence His113–Arg125 and to the human and mouse LOXL deduced sequences His117–Arg129with no similarity to LOX, LOXL2, or LOXL3 deduced sequences (see Fig. 1 in Ref. 11Mäki J.M. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Peptide 3 was 92% identical to the deduced sequences Leu386–Gln397, Leu369–Gln380, and Leu402–Gln413 of bovine, human, and mouse LOXL, respectively, and 83% identical to bovine LOX Leu213–Gln224. These sequences clearly proved that we have isolated from bovine aorta a precursor form of LOXL. The apparent molecular mass of the isolated protein was lower than the expected molecular mass calculated from the deduced sequences. Removal of the putative signal peptide should give rise to a protein (residues 23–591) with a deduced molecular mass of 61.9 kDa, which is greater than the 56-kDa apparent molecular mass of the unreduced purified protein. This lower molecular mass could result from cleavage of pro-LOXL by a furin-like enzyme at the level of the Arg-Arg-Arg sequences at residues 83–85 or 89–91 in the bovine protein as suggested by Kenyon et al. (7Kenyon K. Modi W.S. Contente S. Friedman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18435-18437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kim et al. (8Kim Y. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7176-7182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) for the human sequence, leading to 54–55-kDa products. No N-terminal sequence was obtained from the purified 56-kDa protein; similar results were previously obtained with porcine lysyl oxidase (5Cronshaw A.D. Fothergill-Gillmore L.A. Hulmes D.J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because several glutamines are present in the N-terminal domain of the molecule, we suspected pyroglutamic acid as the N-terminal blocking group. Indeed, treatment of the blotted protein with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase as described under “Experimental Procedures” gave rise to deblocked protein, and the sequence obtained ((Q)APSLPXPG) confirmed the suggested cleavage site at residues 89–91 (see Fig. 6), leading to a Gln92–Ser591 protein of deduced molecular mass of 54.6 kDa, which is in good agreement with the apparent molecular mass estimated from SDS-PAGE. When tested with 3H-labeled insoluble elastin in standard conditions, purified bLOXL did not exhibit β−APN-sensitive lysyl oxidase activity. This could be because of the fact that either elastin was not a substrate for the enzyme or that the precursor we have isolated was inactive as reported previously for the recombinant forms of prolysyl oxidase (6Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V. Gacheru S.N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7113-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Another explanation could be that the enzyme was inactivated during the brief exposure to acidic pH, conditions used to elute the protein from the immuno-affinity column. To circumvent this difficulty, we devised a different elution step using 0.15 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, containing 2m urea with reversed flow to obtain concentrated eluted fractions. However, even in these conditions, the 56-kDa protein was still largely inactive. Analysis of the deduced bovine, human, and murine LOXL sequences indicated that two conserved Gly–Asp bonds were present. As reported previously (5Cronshaw A.D. Fothergill-Gillmore L.A. Hulmes D.J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), this was the bond cleaved in the mature form of LOX. Furthermore, as described elsewhere (6Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V. Gacheru S.N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7113-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), BMP-1 was able to cleave this bond in chimeric maltose-binding protein/LOX. We have thus put forward the hypothesis that to give rise to an active form, LOXL should be matured by the same enzyme as the LOX precursor, i.e.PCP/BMP-1. To test this hypothesis, we have, in parallel experiments, analyzed by Western blotting the products obtained during the maturation step and measured using 3H-labeled insoluble elastin the activity of the enzyme. Results of a representative experiment are reported in Fig. 5. Western blotting (Fig. 5A, lane 2) revealed that in addition to the intact 56-kDa form, three major bands of apparent molecular masses of 51, 42, and 37 kDa were observed after incubation with BMP-1, whereas no apparent hydrolysis occurred in the absence of the enzyme (lane 1). In the same experimental conditions (Fig. 5B), incubation of the 56-kDa protein with BMP-1 (lane 2) induced a dramatic increase of β-APN-sensitive enzymatic activity when compared with the incubation without enzyme (lane 1). In addition, we have also observed an enzymatic activity using fibrillar collagen as substrate (results not shown). A perfect correlation was always observed in every experiment between the appearance of lower mass products and enzymatic activity following incubation of the 56-kDa protein with BMP-1, indicating that only the mature form(s) exhibited significant activity, as is true for the LOX enzyme (6Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V. Gacheru S.N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7113-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This result was different from that very recently reported by Ito et al. (12Ito H. Akiyama H. Iguchi H. Iyama K. Miyamoto M. Ohsawa K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24023-24029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with the LOXC enzyme, indicating that this protein was secreted as an 82-kDa active mature enzyme. However, it cannot be excluded that lower molecular mass forms were also present in the conditioned medium of COS-7 cells expressing recombinant LOXC. As already indicated, two Gly–Asp bonds (residues 130–131 and 311–312) are present in the deduced bovine sequence, which is the bond cleaved by BMP-1 in pro-α1(III) collagen (27Kessler E. Adar R. Goldberg B. Niece R. Collagen Relat. Res. 1986; 6: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), pro-LOX (6Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V. Gacheru S.N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22728-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BMP-1 is able to process other collagenous or noncollagenous substrates, including types I and II procollagens at the level of an A–D bond (29Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), procollagen V C-propeptide at a D–D bond (30Kessler E. Fichard A. Chanut-Delalande H. Brusel M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27051-27057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the N-propeptide at a S–Q bond (31Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and probiglycan at a N–D bond (32Scott I.C. Imamura Y. Pappano W.N. Trodel J.M. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30504-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) as well as chordin, at both the N and C termini, at S–D and A–D bonds, respectively (33Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All but one of the bonds cleaved by BMP-1 in these substrates contain aspartic acid in the P1′ position, but a great variability is observed at the level of the P1 residue. Thus several potential cleavage sites are present in the bovine LOXL sequence as indicated in Fig. 6, which could explain the occurrence of more than one maturation product of LOXL by BMP-1 as observed in Fig. 5A, lane 2. To identify possible preferential maturation product(s), blotted LOXL was treated with BMP-1 as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the maturation sites were detected by sequencing. Because the N terminus of the isolated 56-kDa protein was blocked, maturation by BMP-1 should reveal unblocked N-terminal residue(s) corresponding to the P1′ position in the cleaved bonds, thus revealing the protein sequence at the level of the maturation site(s). As reported in Fig. 6, two cleavage sites identified by sequences of 10 residues were observed. The first one, sequence DSTGMARART, began at residue 131 following maturation at the conserved G–D bond, leading to a product of about 51 kDa, which was the apparent molecular mass of one of the products identified by Western blotting (Fig. 5A, lane 2). The second, sequence DAPPPGSERN, corresponded to the conserved S–D bond, which is the bond cleaved in the N-terminal domain of chordin, and led to a lower molecular mass product of about 28 kDa. Taken together, our results indicate that we have isolated, for the first time, the protein encoded by the LOXL gene. This protein is different from the previously described LOX, although it was isolated from the same tissue, bovine aorta. This enzyme has previously been shown to be associated with the extracellular matrix (18Decitre M. Gleyzal C. Raccurt M. Peyrol S. Aubert-Foucher E. Csiszar K. Sommer P. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 143-151PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover this 56-kDa protein was processed to an enzymatically active form by PCP/BMP-1, the metalloproteinase that also transforms the 50-kDa pro-LOX to the mature 32-kDa enzyme. Very recently, it has been reported that mammalian Tolloid and mammalian Tolloid-like 1 and 2 are also able to process chimeric maltose-binding protein/LOX (34Uzel M.I. Scott I.C. Babakhanlou-Chase H. Palamakumbura A.H. Pappano W.N. Hong H.-H. Greenspan D.S. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22537-22543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It will be important in the future to determine whether LOXL is also a substrate for these enzymes and whether LOXL might be a better substrate for mammalian Tolloid-like 2, for which the only reported activity at the present time is the maturation of pro-LOX (34Uzel M.I. Scott I.C. Babakhanlou-Chase H. Palamakumbura A.H. Pappano W.N. Hong H.-H. Greenspan D.S. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22537-22543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that recombinant PCPE, a protein of the extracellular matrix, is able to increase the activity of PCP/BMP-1 on type I procollagen (35Moschovich L. Bernoco S. Font B. Rivkin H. Eichenberger D. Chejanovsky N. Hulmes D.J.S. Kessler E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2991-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to test whether PCPE is also able to regulate PCP/BMP-1 activity on other substrates and specially on prolysyl oxidases; further experiments are in progress in our laboratory to address this question. We thank M. Courteau and D. Mazzocut of the Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Protéines for help with protein sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2142225960,"In view of its multifaceted anti-inflammatory properties, interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been deemed to be potentially anti-atherogenic. We have evaluated the capacity of adenoviral gene transfer of IL-10 for the modulation of de novo atherosclerotic lesion formation by systemic and by local overexpression. Atherogenesis was initiated in the carotid arteries of low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient mice by perivascular placement of silastic collars. One week after collar placement, mice were injected intravenously with 1 x 109 plaque-forming units (pfu's) of IL-10 (AdV.IL-10) or control adenovirus (AdV.empty). Administration of AdV.IL-10 resulted in extended systemic expression of IL-10 (peak serum level 3.0 +/- 1.1 ng/ml) and a reduction in atherosclerotic lumen stenosis by 62.2% (P<0.02). This finding was accompanied by monocyte deactivation and lowering of serum cholesterol levels (maximum decrease 44%). In a second experiment, collared arteries were transfected locally by transluminal instillation of adenovirus (titer 1.5x1010 pfu/ml). Systemic parameters remained unchanged following local transfection, but the degree of stenosis was, nonetheless, decreased by 44.9% (P<0.05). We conclude that a marked inhibition of atherogenesis can be achieved by systemic overexpression of AdV.IL-10, owing to its metabolic and immunomodulatory effects.

Using the GT1–7 cell line, an in vitro model of GnRH-secreting neurons of the hypothalamus, we examined the potential signal transduction pathways activated by melatonin directly at the level of the GT1–7 neuron. We found that melatonin inhibits forskolin-stimulated adenosine 3′-, 5′-cyclic monophosphate accumulation in GT1–7 cells through an inhibitory G protein. Melatonin induced protein kinase C activity by 1.65-fold over basal levels, increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 proteins, and activated c-fos and junB mRNA expression in GT1–7 cells. Using the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89, the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059, we found that the melatonin-mediated cyclical regulation of GnRH mRNA expression may involve the protein kinase C and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 pathways, but not the protein kinase A pathway. We found that melatonin suppresses GnRH secretion by ∼45% in the GT1–7 neurons. However, in the presence of the inhibitors H-89, bisindolylmaleimide, and PD98059 melatonin was unable to suppress GnRH secretion. These results provide insights into the potential signal transduction mechanisms involved in the control of GnRH gene expression and secretion by melatonin.

Melatonin is thought to mediate its circadian and reproductive effects through specific high affinity receptors (1Vanecek J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mammalian melatonin receptors mt1 and MT2 have been cloned and characterized to be members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Ebisawa T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1177-1185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 3Reppert S.M. Godson C. Mahle C.D. Weaver D.R. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Gusella J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8734-8738Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Melatonin has been shown to regulate cell function via intracellular second messengers such as cAMP, Ca2+, cGMP, diacylglycerol, protein kinase C (PKC),1 and arachidonic acid; however, the signaling pathways activated by melatonin appear to be differentially regulated and tissue-specific (reviewed in Ref. 4Vanecek J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 98: 687-721Crossref Scopus (503) Google Scholar). A number of studies have investigated the signal transduction mechanisms in tissues associated with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. At the level of the pituitary, melatonin inhibits adenylate cyclase through both PTX (pertussis toxin)-sensitive and PTX-insensitive G-proteins in ovine pars tuberalis cells (5Morgan P.J. Lawson W. Davidson G. Barrett P. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1990; 2: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Barrett P. Davidson G. Hazlerigg D. Morris M. Ross A. Morgan P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Melatonin also inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced increases in cAMP, diacylglycerol, [Ca2+]i, and c-Fos in neonatal rat gonadotrophs (7Vanecek J. Vollrath L. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 110: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Sumova A. Vanecek J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1997; 9: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At the level of the gonads, melatonin modulates androgen production in rat Leydig cells though a PTX-sensitive mechanism and also through a decrease in GnRH-induced [Ca2+]i release (9Li L. Xu J.N. Wong J.T.Y. Pang S.F. Shiu S.Y.W. J. Pineal Res. 1998; 25: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Valenti S. Giusti M. Guido R. Giodano G. Eur. J.

In prostate epithelial cells, melatonin suppresses cGMP levels through a process that involves the activation of PKC (12Gilad E. Matzkin H. Zisapel N. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4255-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Melatonin also reduces cAMP production by preovulatory follicles in the hamster ovary, but stimulates cGMP in porcine granulosa cells (13Tamura H. Nakamura Y. Takiguchi S. Kashida S. Yamagata Y. Sugino N. Kato H. J. Pineal Res. 1998; 25: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Sirotkin A.V. J. Pineal Res. 1994; 17: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Some evidence suggests that melatonin regulates reproduction by exerting inhibitory effects on the reproductive axis at the level of the hypothalamus (15Kennaway D.J. Rowe S.A. J. Reprod.

Dev. 1999; 39: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As such, melatonin uptake and binding have been demonstrated in rat and hamster hypothalamus (1Vanecek J. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Anton-Tay F. Wurtman R.J. Nature. 1969; 221: 474-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Weaver D.R. Rivkees S.A. Reppert S.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mt1 and MT2 mRNA expression have been detected in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in several mammals including humans and rats (2Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Ebisawa T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1177-1185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar, 3Reppert S.M. Godson C. Mahle C.D. Weaver D.R. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Gusella J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At the level of the hypothalamus, melatonin has been shown to alter SCN cellular function via a PTX-sensitive G protein pathway that activates PKC and reduces norepinephrine-induced activation of prostaglandin E2 and cAMP production in the medial basal hypothalamus (21McArthur A.J. Hunt A.E. Gillette M.U. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Bettahi I. Guerrero J.M. Reiter R.J. Osuna C. J. Pineal Res. 1998; 25: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The signaling mechanisms directly involved in melatonin-mediated regulation of GnRH, a central component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, have not yet been determined. In an attempt to produce a suitable model to study the GnRH gene, a targeted tumorigenesis approach whereby expression of the SV-40 T-Antigen oncogene, driven by the rat GnRH 5′-regulatory region, was used to develop a murine immortal cell line of GnRH-secreting neurons (GT1–7 cells) (23Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P. Pedula C. Roberts J. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Using the GT1–7 GnRH-secreting cell line, we recently provided the first evidence that melatonin may act directly at the level of the GnRH neuron to regulate reproductive function. We have shown that these cells express both mt1 and MT2 G protein-coupled receptors and that melatonin down-regulates GnRH gene expression in a 24-h cyclical pattern (24Roy D. Angelini N. Frieda H. Brown G.M. Belsham D.D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4711-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the present study we have demonstrated that melatonin inhibits forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation though a PTX-sensitive mechanism in GT1–7 cells. In addition, we have provided evidence that in the short term, melatonin increases PKC activity in GT1–7 cells. We demonstrated that melatonin activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) proteins in GT1–7 cells. Melatonin also increased the mRNA expression of the immediate early genes c-fos andjunB in GT1–7 cells. In accordance with studies in the hypothalamus, we observed a melatonin-mediated suppression of GnRH secretion in GT1–7 cells within 1 h of treatment. Furthermore, using inhibitors of the protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, and ERK 1/2 pathways we have examined some of the signal transduction pathways that may be involved in melatonin-mediated regulation of GnRH gene expression and secretion in GT1–7 cells. GT1–7 cells were grown in monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), 4.5 mg/ml glucose and penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 as previously described (23Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P. Pedula C. Roberts J. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Melatonin, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, EDTA, PTX, isobutylmethylxanthine, PKA inhibitorN-(2-[p-bromocinnamylamino]-ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 098,059 were obtained from Sigma. 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (BIS) were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). GnRH RIA kit was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (San Carlos, CA). cAMP kit was obtained from Biomedical Technologies Inc., (Stoughton, MA). Biotrak PKC Enzyme assay kit was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Pierce BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit was obtained from Pierce Ltd. ERK 1/2, phospho-ERK, JNK, phospho-JNK, p38 and phosph-p38 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Data were analyzed using the statistical program package SPSS 6.1.4 for Power Macintosh (University of Toronto site license). GT1–7 cells were split into 24-well plates. In the case of the dose-response curve, medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of fresh DMEM (without FBS) with melatonin (1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, or 10 μm) or vehicle alone in the absence or presence of forskolin (100 nm). In the experiment with the melatonin receptor antagonist luzindole, cells were treated with melatonin (10 μm), luzindole (10 μm), or vehicle alone in the absence or presence of forskolin (100 nm). In the experiment with PTX, medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of fresh DMEM (without FBS) with either 200 ng/ml PTX or vehicle alone (14 nm Me2SO). Following a 6-h PTX treatment, cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM. All drugs were diluted in DMEM containing IBMX (100 μm). Cells were treated with 10 μm melatonin, and ± 100 nm forskolin, or with vehicle alone (Me2SO), 20 nm). After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, 1 ml of ice-cold ethanol was added to each well. Cells were scraped from the plate and kept at −20 °C until the amounts of intracellular cAMP were determined in triplicate by RIA (Biotechnologies Inc., Stoughton, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PKC activity was analyzed as previously described (25Ross A.W. Webster C.A. Thompson M. Barrett P. Morgan P.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, GT1–7 cells were seeded into 35-mm2 Petri dishes as described above and then serum starved (0.1% FBS) for 12 h before stimulation. Cells were then stimulated by addition of serum (10% FBS), TPA (100 nm), and/or melatonin (10 nm). After 30 min stimulation, cells were rinsed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS, then lysed with 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm benzamidine, 0.3% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) and harvested using a rubber scraper. After transfer to microcentrifuge tubes, the lysates were passed seven times through a 25-gauge needle and maintained on ice. PKC activity was determined using a Biotrak PKC assay kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Assay tubes contained 25 μl of component mixture, 25 μl of lysate, and 0.2 μCi [32P]ATP (450,000 cpm ± 20,000 cpm), and reactions were performed for 15 min. GT1–7 cells were grown in 100-mm2 tissue culture plates as described above. Cells were serum-starved (0.1% FBS) for 2 h prior to treatment with melatonin (10 nm) or vehicle alone. Cells were stimulated with melatonin (10 nm) for 10 or 30 min and then washed in cold 1× PBS supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA). Total protein from GT1–7 cells was then isolated. Protein concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce Ltd.). Samples were stored at −20 °C until the time of assay. Total protein (50 μg) was resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (26Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). Membranes were washed briefly in PBS and then incubated in PBST (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% powdered skim milk) for 16 h with 1 μg/ml goat polyclonal ERK 1/2 (K-23), mouse monoclonal phospho-ERK (E-4), rabbit monoclonal JNK, mouse monoclonal phospho-JNK, rabbit polyclonal p38, and mouse monoclonal phospho-p38 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody antisera at 1:10,000 dilution and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), as described by the manufacturer. GTI-7 cells were grown in 100-mm2 tissue culture plates as described above. Cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then treated with melatonin (10 nm) or vehicle alone for 30 min, 60 min, or 120 min. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform extraction method (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA were electrophoresed in 1% formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to Genescreen membranes (Dupont-New England Nuclear) by capillary blotting (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982Google Scholar). The filters were probed with rat c-fos cDNA (29Curran T. Gordon M.B. Rubino K.L. Sambucetti L.C. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar) or junB cDNA (30Kawakami Z. Kitabayashi I. Matsuoka T. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Membranes were prehybridized for 2–6 h and hybridized for 16 h in hybridization buffer (1% w/v bovine serum albumin, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5 m Na2HPO4, 5% w/v SDS, 25% formamide) at 50 °C. The cDNA probes were labeled using random hexamers and [32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) incorporated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (31Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Blots were washed at high stringency (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; 50 °C) and exposed to Fuji film at −70 °C with intensifying screens for 4–24 h. Autoradiographs were scanned with a Hewlett Packard ScanJet 3p Scanner, and c-fos and junB mRNA signals were quantified by densitometry using the NIH Image program. Blots were stripped and then probed with γ-actin cDNA (32Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) as a loading control. GT1-7 cells were grown in 100-mm2 tissue culture plates as described above. Cells were pretreated with PKA, PKC, or MAPK inhibitor (10 μmH-89, 20 nm BIS, and 20 μm PD98050, respectively) for 2 h prior to treatment with melatonin (10 nm), inhibitor, or vehicle alone (0, 12, 24 h). Total cellular RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform extraction method (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described above. The filters were probed with rat GnRH cDNA (33Adelman J.P. Mason A.J. Hayflick J.S. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and human γ-actin cDNA (32Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) as a loading control. Autoradiographs were scanned with a Hewlett Packard ScanJet 3p Scanner and GnRH, and actin mRNA signals were quantified by densitometry using the NIH Image program. GT1–7 cells were split into 24-well plates. Medium was replaced 1 h prior to treatment with 0.5 ml of fresh DMEM (0.1% FBS), with either 1 nm melatonin, 1 nm melatonin + 10 μm luzindole, 10 μm luzindole, 10 μm forskolin (positive control) or vehicle alone (Me2SO, 14 nm) after washing with PBS. In the case of inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with PKA inhibitor, PKC inhibitor, or MAPK inhibitor (10 μm H-89, 20 nm BIS, and 20 μmPD98050, respectively) for 1 h prior to treatment with melatonin (10 nm). Medium was collected at 1 h for all treatments except for the forskolin-positive control, which was collected after 2 h. Protein content per well was assayed using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Protein content was consistently equivalent between wells (≤10% variation). GnRH content in 200-μl aliquots of the cell culture medium samples was assayed in triplicate with a GnRH RIA kit (Peninsula Laboratories, Inc., Belmont, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For assessment of statistical significance, data were analyzed using analysis of variance. Comparisons between individual pairs were determined using Student'st test. In the vast majority of cell types examined, previous studies have shown that 10 μm melatonin inhibits forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation and furthermore, the effects of melatonin are inhibited by PTX pretreatment (4Vanecek J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 98: 687-721Crossref Scopus (503) Google Scholar). As such, most studies have demonstrated melatonin receptor coupling to G proteins belonging to the Gi/ofamily (reviewed in Ref. 4Vanecek J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 98: 687-721Crossref Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In the GT1–7 cells, we used radioimmunoassays to determine the effect of melatonin on cAMP accumulation. Our results indicated that melatonin did not alter basal 3′-, 5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) levels (vehicle, 1.0 ± 0; 1 nm melatonin, 1.08 ± 0.17; 10 nmmelatonin, 0.99 ± 0.14; 100 nm melatonin, 0.8 ± 0.04; 10 μm melatonin, 0.8 ± 0.14), but caused an inhibition of forskolin-stimulated (100 nm) accumulation of cAMP in a dose-dependent manner (vehicle, 6.66 ± 1.7; 1 nm melatonin, 6.4 ± 0.82; 10 nmmelatonin, 6.2 ± 0.8; 100 nm melatonin, 4.0 ± 1.1; 10 μm melatonin, 3.6 ± 0.6 (p< 0.005, Student's t test) (Fig.1A). In the presence of luzindole (10 μm), a specific melatonin receptor antagonist (34Dubocovich M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 902-910PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of melatonin on forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation was not observed (100 nm forskolin, 7.03 ± 0.26; 100 nm forskolin + 10 μm melatonin, 3.8 ± 1.04; 100 nm forskolin + 10 μmmelatonin + 10 μm luzindole, 6.68 ± 0.28). This result suggested that inhibition of cAMP by melatonin was specifically melatonin receptor-mediated (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, PTX pretreatment (100 ng/ml) for 6 h completely abolished the ability of melatonin to inhibit the forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation (10 μm forskolin, 25.01 ± 2.66; 10 μm forskolin + 10 μm melatonin, 19.43 ± 0.6; 10 μm forskolin + 10 μm melatonin + 100 ng/ml PTX, 24.55 ± 4.95) (Fig. 1C). This indicates that the membrane-bound melatonin receptors are coupled to Gi proteins and that melatonin inhibits adenylyl cyclase through a PTX-sensitive mechanism in the GT1–7 cells. Melatonin has previously been shown to alter diacylglycerol levels and PKC activity, both of which are key elements in the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway (7Vanecek J. Vollrath L. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 110: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Melatonin-induced phase shifts of the circadian pacemaker in the SCN have previously been shown to be mediated by the activation of PKC (21McArthur A.J. Hunt A.E. Gillette M.U. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that in SCN tissue, melatonin increased PKC activity by nearly 2-fold in a rapid and transient manner (21McArthur A.J. Hunt A.E. Gillette M.U. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In our study, we examined the effect of melatonin on PKC activity in GT1–7 cells using an assay based upon the PKC catalyzed transfer of the γ-phosphate group of adenosine-5′-triphosphate to a peptide that is specific for PKC (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Cells were serum-starved for 12 h to remove any stimulants from the media and then treated with vehicle alone, serum (10% FBS) (positive control), an activator of PKC (TPA, 100 nm) (positive control), serum + melatonin (10 nm), TPA + melatonin (10 nm), or melatonin alone. Measurement of PKC activity in cell lysates prepared from GT1–7 cells stimulated with serum (10% FBS) and TPA (100 nm) showed enhanced PKC activity within 30 min (vehicle, 1.0 ± 0.08; serum 1.38 ± 0.12; TPA, 1.71 ± 0.12) (Fig. 2). Activation of PKC activity by melatonin (10 nm, 30 min) was modest but significant (vehicle, 1.0 ± 0; 10 nm melatonin, 1.64 ± 0.10) (p < 0.005, Student's ttest) (Fig. 2). Serum or TPA-induced PKC activity did not increase further in the presence of melatonin (serum + melatonin, 1.65 ± 0.24; TPA + melatonin, 1.64 ± 0.20). There have been few studies investigating the effect of melatonin on the MAPK signaling pathway. In the ovine pars tuberalis, the MAPK signaling pathway does not contribute to the melatonin-mediated inhibition of c-fos mRNA expression (25Ross A.W. Webster C.A. Thompson M. Barrett P. Morgan P.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas melatonin was consistently found to be a highly potent inhibitor of the activation of MAPK induced by forskolin but not by IGF-1 (35Hazlerigg D.G. Thompson M. Hastings M.H. Morgan P.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the modulation of estrogen receptor transactivation by melatonin has been associated with changes in MAPK activity (36Ram P.T. Kiefer T. Silverman M. Song Y. Brown G.M. Hill S.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 141: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We used Western blot analysis to determine whether melatonin induced the activation of the MAPK pathways in GT1–7 cells by observing the phosphorylation of the ERK 1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38 proteins. Cells were first serum-starved for 2 h to remove any stimulants from the media and then treated with either vehicle alone or melatonin (10 nm) (10, 30 min). Western blot analysis was performed on total protein using an ERK 1 (p44)- and ERK 2 (p42)-specific polyclonal antibody (K-23) or a specific monoclonal antibody (E-4) reactive with tyrosine 204-phosphorylated (phospho)-ERK 1 and phospho-ERK 2. Similar immunoreactive bands of 44 kDa and 42 kDa were observed in vehicle and melatonin-treated GT1–7 total cell extracts over the entire time course (Fig. 3A). However melatonin treatment alone rapidly increased the amount of phospho-ERK 1 and phospho-ERK 2 immunoreactivity (∼2-fold following 10 min of stimulation and 4-fold following 30 min of stimulation), suggesting that melatonin induces the activation of the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway in the GT1–7 cells (Fig. 3B). Vehicle alone (Me2SO) did not change the amount of phospho-ERK 1/2 immunoreactivity over time. Western blot analysis was also performed on GT1–7 total protein using JNK, phospho-JNK, p38 and phospho-p38-specific antibodies. Similar immunoreactive bands of 54 kDa, 46 kDa, and 38 kDa (JNK2, JNK1, and p38, respectively) were observed in vehicle and melatonin (10 nm) (10, 30, 45 min)-treated GT1–7 total cell extracts. However, we were unable to detect any effect of melatonin on the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 proteins in the GT1–7 cells (data not shown). The effects of melatonin on immediate early gene expression such as c-fos and junB have also been shown to be tissue-specific (4Vanecek J. Physiol.

To determine whether melatonin induced immediate early gene expression in GT1–7 cells, we used Northern blot analysis to examine c-fos and junB mRNA expression. Cells were serum-starved for 12 h to remove any stimulants in the medium and then treated with vehicle or with melatonin (10 nm) (30, 60, and 120 min). Using 10 μg of total RNA, c-fos andjunB mRNA were detected in GT1–7 cells. In the presence of melatonin, c-fos mRNA expression increased significantly (p < 0.005, Student's ttest) within 30 min but returned to basal levels by 60 min (10 nm melatonin; 30 min, 3.5 ± 0.8; 60 min, 1.2 ± 0.2; 120 min, 1.2 ± 0.1) (Fig.4A). In the presence of melatonin, junB mRNA expression increased significantly (p < 0.05, Student's t test) within 30 min but also returned to basal levels by 60 min (10 nmmelatonin; 30 min, 1.65 ± 0.3; 60 min, 0.9 ± 0.2) (Fig.4B). γ-actin mRNA levels, a loading control, were not affected by treatment with melatonin (data not shown). Vehicle alone (Me2SO) did not change the amount of c-fos orjunB mRNA expression over time. Although it has been shown previously that melatonin can alter the transcription of a number of genes including its own receptor (40Guerrero H.Y. Gauer F. Schuster C. Pevet P. Masson-Pevet M.

In ovine pars tuberalis cells, it has been shown that melatonin does not act through PKC activation to reduce mt1 mRNA expression and furthermore it has been suggested that other as yet undefined pathways must play an important role in the regulation of mt1 receptor by melatonin (6Barrett P.

Using GT1–7 cells, we have previously demonstrated that melatonin (1 nm) down-regulates GnRH gene expression in a 24-h cyclical pattern (24Roy D. Angelini N. Frieda H. Brown G.M. Belsham D.D.

Among the nine peptides prepared by the digestion, the peptide Ser20–Lys41 (K3) spontaneously formed amyloid fibrils, confirmed by thioflavin T binding and electron microscopy. The fibrils composed of K3 peptide induced fibril formation of intact β2-m with a lag phase, distinct from the extension reaction without a lag phase observed for intact β2-m seeds. Fibril formation of K3 peptide with intact β2-m seeds also exhibited a lag phase. On the other hand, the extension reaction of K3 peptide with the K3 seeds occurred without a lag phase. At neutral pH, the fibrils composed of either intact β2-m or K3 peptide spontaneously depolymerized. Intriguingly, the depolymerization of K3 fibrils was faster than that of intact β2-m fibrils. These results indicated that, although K3 peptide can form fibrils by itself more readily than intact β2-m, the K3 fibrils are less stable than the intact β2-m fibrils, suggesting a close relation between the free energy barrier of amyloid fibril formation and its stability.

This high species barrier suggests that the amyloid fibrils are stabilized by specific interactions of amyloid proteins, which are governed by the characteristic primary and higher order structures of each amyloid protein.

They have proposed that a nucleation-dependent polymerization model could explain the general mechanisms of amyloid fibril formation in vitro, applicable to various types of amyloidosis. This model consists of two phases, i.e. nucleation and extension phases. Nucleus formation requires a series of association steps of monomers, which are thermodynamically unfavorable, representing the rate-limiting step in amyloid fibril formation in vitro. Once the nucleus (n-mer) has been formed, further addition of monomers becomes thermodynamically favorable, resulting in rapid extension of amyloid fibrils in vitro.Many amyloidogenic proteins carry key regions that are specific to each amyloid protein (7MacPhee C.E.

For an example, a 10-residue peptide of transthyretin can make fibrils that exhibit characteristics typical of the intact (127-amino acid residues) transthyretin (7MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1203-1215Google Scholar). In the case of medin, responsible for aortic medial amyloid, the most common human amyloid, the C-terminal 8-residue peptide, can form the amyloid fibrils (27Höggovist B. Näslund J. Sletten K. Westermark G.T. Mucchiano G. Tjernberg L.O. Nordstedt C. Engström U. Westermark P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8669-8674Google Scholar). Identifying such a key region provides a clue to understanding the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation.In the present study, with the recombinant human β2-m expressed, we investigated the possible key regions responsible for the amyloid formation of β2-m. Using a series of peptides obtained withAchromobacter protease I, we first showed that a peptide of 37 amino acid residues linked by a disulfide bond, i.e.Ser20–Cys25–Lys41 (K3) and Asp76–Cys80–Lys91 (K7), has the potential to form amyloid fibrils. Among the two peptides produced by reduction of the disulfide bond, the N-terminal K3 peptide of 22 amino acid residues retained the potential to form amyloid fibrils, arguing that this peptide contains the minimal sequence. Kinetics of amyloid fibril formation and depolymerization suggested that, although the K3 peptide can form the amyloid fibrils by itself, the fibrils made of K3 are less stable than those of intact β2-m. The results can be interpreted in terms of the change in free energy barriers of the nucleation and extension processes.DISCUSSIONHuman β2-m consists of 99 amino acid residues (14Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Google Scholar, 15Okon M. Bray P. Vucelic D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8906-8915Google Scholar). It is likely that even short peptides including key residues can form amyloid fibrils. In accordance with this expectation, we found that K3 peptide made of 22 amino acid residues retained the potential to form amyloid fibrils. We could not distinguish the fibrils of K3 and intact β2-m on CD (Fig. 4) or electron microscopy (Fig. 5), although we believe that they probably differ in structural details. On the other hand, there were clear differences between K3 peptide and intact β2-m in their kinetics of fibril formation (Figs. 3 and 6) and depolymerization (Fig. 7). These differences as well as the results of cross-reactions between K3 peptide and intact β2-m (Fig. 6) can be explained satisfactorily on the basis of the schematic mechanisms as described below (Fig. 8).The β2-m molecule is assumed to consist of two regions:i.e. essential (or minimal) and non-essential regions. The essential region even after isolation can form fibrils by itself. We considered the K3 peptide to accommodate such a region. We started experiments with various synthetic peptides to narrow the minimal sequence. Preliminary results indicated that a shorter peptide within the K3 region still retains the amyloidogenic potential (data not shown), suggesting that even a limited sequence in K3 peptide can form the amyloid fibrils. Although the non-essential region cannot form the amyloid fibrils by itself, it can participate in fibril formation passively once it is associated with the essential region. In other words, the core β-sheet formed in the essential region can propagate by itself to the rest of the molecule. However, because of its larger size, the nucleation process of β2-m may require more extensive and cooperative conformational changes than that of K3 peptide,i.e. there is a high free energy barrier. This high energy barrier of intact β2-m may explain the difficulty of spontaneous fibril formation of β2-m but not of the K3 peptide. On the other hand, because β2-m has interaction sites more than the K3 peptide, fibrils of β2-m, once formed, would be stabilized to a greater extent than those of K3 peptide, as demonstrated by depolymerization reactions at neutral pH (Fig. 7).This two-region model (essential and non-essential regions) can explain most of the cross-extension reactions between β2-m and K3 peptide (Fig. 6). In the extension reaction with seeds, we can focus only on the extension process by removing the nucleation process. Extension of β2-m with the β2-m fibril seeds is rapid without a lag phase. The same is likely to be true for the homogeneous extension of K3 with the K3 seeds (Fig. 8B). On the other hand, the heterogeneous reactions between intact β2-m and K3 peptide exhibited a lag phase. The conformations of fibrils are probably different between them, and the heterogeneous association of monomers onto the end(s) of the seed fibrils would be thermodynamically unfavorable. After a certain number of the heterogeneous monomers have polymerized onto the ends of seeds, the ends would become similar to those of fibrils of the monomers so that the extension becomes favorable in terms of free energy and rate. In the heterogeneous extension reaction of β2-m with K3 seeds, we observed a maximum in ThT fluorescence intensity, the value higher than that of typical β2-m fibrils (Fig. 6A). The two-region model does not explain this complicated behavior, suggesting that the exact mechanism for the heterogeneous extension includes several fibril conformations different in their affinity to ThT. It is clear that, once the fibrils of intact β2-m are formed with K3 seeds, they are indistinguishable from β2-m fibrils made with intact β2-m seeds. We do not need to assume different fibril conformations depending on the type of seeds as observed for yeast prions (8Santoso A. Chien P. Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2000; 100: 277-288Google Scholar, 9Chien P. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 223-227Google Scholar).The results observed here are very similar to the cross-reactions between Aβ-(1–42) and Aβ-(1–40) in Alzheimer's β-amyloid fibril formation in vitro reported by Hasegawa et al. (22Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Omata S. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15514-15521Google Scholar). They examined homogeneous and heterogeneous extensions with Aβ-(1–42) and Aβ-(1–40). When the species used for seeds was the same as the species of monomers, no lag phase was observed. In contrast, when the two species were different, the lag phase was observed. They argued the importance of a conformational change in order to start the heterogeneous extension reaction between different Aβ peptides. The morphology of the fibrils formed was governed by the major component in the reaction mixture, not by the morphology of preexisting fibrils. This was also the case for β2-m. Therefore, when the different species cross-react, the requirement of the conformational change at the extending end(s) of the seeds will be common to various cases of amyloid fibril formation.In conclusion, we showed that K3 peptide (Ser21–Lys41) constitutes the essential region of β2-m-related amyloid fibril formation. Although K3 peptide of β2-m formed amyloid fibrils more readily than intact β2-m, the stability of K3 fibrils was less than that of intact β2-m fibrils, implying that the high free energy barrier of the nucleation event is important for the high stability of amyloid fibrils. Amyloid fibril formation of globular proteins is considered to be an intriguing example of the complex landscape of protein folding. Because of its moderately small size as a globular protein, we may be able to clarify the topological and topographical relationships between the native, unfolded (monomeric), and fibrillar conformations of β2-m more convincingly than in the cases of other amyloidogenic proteins.

They have proposed that a nucleation-dependent polymerization model could explain the general mechanisms of amyloid fibril formation in vitro, applicable to various types of amyloidosis. This model consists of two phases, i.e. nucleation and extension phases. Nucleus formation requires a series of association steps of monomers, which are thermodynamically unfavorable, representing the rate-limiting step in amyloid fibril formation in vitro. Once the nucleus (n-mer) has been formed, further addition of monomers becomes thermodynamically favorable, resulting in rapid extension of amyloid fibrils in vitro. Many amyloidogenic proteins carry key regions that are specific to each amyloid protein (7MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1203-1215Google Scholar, 27Höggovist B. Näslund J.

For an example, a 10-residue peptide of transthyretin can make fibrils that exhibit characteristics typical of the intact (127-amino acid residues) transthyretin (7MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1203-1215Google Scholar). In the case of medin, responsible for aortic medial amyloid, the most common human amyloid, the C-terminal 8-residue peptide, can form the amyloid fibrils (27Höggovist B. Näslund J. Sletten K. Westermark G.T. Mucchiano G. Tjernberg L.O. Nordstedt C. Engström U. Westermark P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8669-8674Google Scholar). Identifying such a key region provides a clue to understanding the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation. In the present study, with the recombinant human β2-m expressed, we investigated the possible key regions responsible for the amyloid formation of β2-m. Using a series of peptides obtained withAchromobacter protease I, we first showed that a peptide of 37 amino acid residues linked by a disulfide bond, i.e.Ser20–Cys25–Lys41 (K3) and Asp76–Cys80–Lys91 (K7), has the potential to form amyloid fibrils. Among the two peptides produced by reduction of the disulfide bond, the N-terminal K3 peptide of 22 amino acid residues retained the potential to form amyloid fibrils, arguing that this peptide contains the minimal sequence. Kinetics of amyloid fibril formation and depolymerization suggested that, although the K3 peptide can form the amyloid fibrils by itself, the fibrils made of K3 are less stable than those of intact β2-m. The results can be interpreted in terms of the change in free energy barriers of the nucleation and extension processes. DISCUSSIONHuman β2-m consists of 99 amino acid residues (14Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Google Scholar, 15Okon M. Bray P. Vucelic D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8906-8915Google Scholar). It is likely that even short peptides including key residues can form amyloid fibrils. In accordance with this expectation, we found that K3 peptide made of 22 amino acid residues retained the potential to form amyloid fibrils. We could not distinguish the fibrils of K3 and intact β2-m on CD (Fig. 4) or electron microscopy (Fig. 5), although we believe that they probably differ in structural details. On the other hand, there were clear differences between K3 peptide and intact β2-m in their kinetics of fibril formation (Figs. 3 and 6) and depolymerization (Fig. 7). These differences as well as the results of cross-reactions between K3 peptide and intact β2-m (Fig. 6) can be explained satisfactorily on the basis of the schematic mechanisms as described below (Fig. 8).The β2-m molecule is assumed to consist of two regions:i.e. essential (or minimal) and non-essential regions. The essential region even after isolation can form fibrils by itself. We considered the K3 peptide to accommodate such a region. We started experiments with various synthetic peptides to narrow the minimal sequence. Preliminary results indicated that a shorter peptide within the K3 region still retains the amyloidogenic potential (data not shown), suggesting that even a limited sequence in K3 peptide can form the amyloid fibrils. Although the non-essential region cannot form the amyloid fibrils by itself, it can participate in fibril formation passively once it is associated with the essential region. In other words, the core β-sheet formed in the essential region can propagate by itself to the rest of the molecule. However, because of its larger size, the nucleation process of β2-m may require more extensive and cooperative conformational changes than that of K3 peptide,i.e. there is a high free energy barrier. This high energy barrier of intact β2-m may explain the difficulty of spontaneous fibril formation of β2-m but not of the K3 peptide. On the other hand, because β2-m has interaction sites more than the K3 peptide, fibrils of β2-m, once formed, would be stabilized to a greater extent than those of K3 peptide, as demonstrated by depolymerization reactions at neutral pH (Fig. 7).This two-region model (essential and non-essential regions) can explain most of the cross-extension reactions between β2-m and K3 peptide (Fig. 6). In the extension reaction with seeds, we can focus only on the extension process by removing the nucleation process. Extension of β2-m with the β2-m fibril seeds is rapid without a lag phase. The same is likely to be true for the homogeneous extension of K3 with the K3 seeds (Fig. 8B). On the other hand, the heterogeneous reactions between intact β2-m and K3 peptide exhibited a lag phase. The conformations of fibrils are probably different between them, and the heterogeneous association of monomers onto the end(s) of the seed fibrils would be thermodynamically unfavorable. After a certain number of the heterogeneous monomers have polymerized onto the ends of seeds, the ends would become similar to those of fibrils of the monomers so that the extension becomes favorable in terms of free energy and rate. In the heterogeneous extension reaction of β2-m with K3 seeds, we observed a maximum in ThT fluorescence intensity, the value higher than that of typical β2-m fibrils (Fig. 6A). The two-region model does not explain this complicated behavior, suggesting that the exact mechanism for the heterogeneous extension includes several fibril conformations different in their affinity to ThT. It is clear that, once the fibrils of intact β2-m are formed with K3 seeds, they are indistinguishable from β2-m fibrils made with intact β2-m seeds. We do not need to assume different fibril conformations depending on the type of seeds as observed for yeast prions (8Santoso A. Chien P. Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2000; 100: 277-288Google Scholar, 9Chien P. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 223-227Google Scholar).The results observed here are very similar to the cross-reactions between Aβ-(1–42) and Aβ-(1–40) in Alzheimer's β-amyloid fibril formation in vitro reported by Hasegawa et al. (22Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I. Omata S. Gejyo F. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15514-15521Google Scholar). They examined homogeneous and heterogeneous extensions with Aβ-(1–42) and Aβ-(1–40). When the species used for seeds was the same as the species of monomers, no lag phase was observed. In contrast, when the two species were different, the lag phase was observed. They argued the importance of a conformational change in order to start the heterogeneous extension reaction between different Aβ peptides. The morphology of the fibrils formed was governed by the major component in the reaction mixture, not by the morphology of preexisting fibrils. This was also the case for β2-m. Therefore, when the different species cross-react, the requirement of the conformational change at the extending end(s) of the seeds will be common to various cases of amyloid fibril formation.In conclusion, we showed that K3 peptide (Ser21–Lys41) constitutes the essential region of β2-m-related amyloid fibril formation. Although K3 peptide of β2-m formed amyloid fibrils more readily than intact β2-m, the stability of K3 fibrils was less than that of intact β2-m fibrils, implying that the high free energy barrier of the nucleation event is important for the high stability of amyloid fibrils. Amyloid fibril formation of globular proteins is considered to be an intriguing example of the complex landscape of protein folding. Because of its moderately small size as a globular protein, we may be able to clarify the topological and topographical relationships between the native, unfolded (monomeric), and fibrillar conformations of β2-m more convincingly than in the cases of other amyloidogenic proteins. Human β2-m consists of 99 amino acid residues (14Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Google Scholar, 15Okon M. Bray P. Vucelic D.

https://openalex.org/W2056420994,"We previously reported the existence of a special auto-regulation property of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) based on NO near-geminate combination and partial trapping of neuronal NOS (nNOS) through a futile regenerating pathway. On this basis, we developed a kinetic simulation model that was proven to predict nNOS catalytic specificities and mutations effects (Santolini, J., Adak, S., Curran, C. M., and Stuehr, D. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 1233–1243; Adak, S., Santolini, J., Tikunova, S., Wang, Q., Johnson, J. D., and Stuehr, D. J. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 1244–1252). Here we show that the same model simulates and explains the distinct catalytic behaviors of inducible and endothelial NOS (iNOS and eNOS). Their marked differences were linked to variations in three basic parameters (rates of ferric heme reduction, ferric heme·NO dissociation, and ferrous heme·NO oxidation) that together control partitioning between futile and productive pathways and their relative rates. We also incorporated feedback inhibition into the kinetic model to account for potential rebinding of accumulated solution NO. The model accurately simulated the different relative impacts of both NOS·NO interactions (near-geminate combination of NO versus rebinding of solution NO) on catalytic behavior of each NOS isoform, including their speed and extent of heme·NO complex accumulation,Km for O2, and propensity to transform NO into a higher oxide. Thus, individual catalytic behavior of any NOS can be understood through a single unified kinetic model. Because the model defines how different settings of individual kinetic parameters control regulation by two distinct NOS·NO interactions, it sheds light on mechanisms, structural features, and scope of NOS regulation and its physiologic impact."

In marine species without temporal or spatial segregation of spawning events, molecular recognition of egg and sperm surfaces is critical to prevent hybridization. Knowing which steps confer species specificity will further our understanding of the evolution of reproductive isolation and ultimately of speciation and biodiversity.

Once released, the sperm must find and interact with an egg of the correct species. An obligatory event for sperm binding to, and fusion with, the egg is the induction of the acrosome reaction in the sperm, an exocytosis of lytic and binding proteins from a vesicle at the tip of the sperm head.

Both purified sulfated α-l-fucans have equal potency in inducing the acrosome reaction in homologous sperm. The reason that eggs from this species possess two sulfated fucan isotypes remains unknown. For our initial demonstration that sulfated polysaccharides are species-specific inducers of the acrosome reaction, we used polysaccharides from distantly related species expressing marked interspecies structural variation (5Alves A.P.

More recently, we evaluated the finer specificity of recognition in the acrosome reaction with egg jelly sulfated fucans containing the same backbone of 3-linked α-l-fucopyranosyl units, but with different proportions of 2-O- and 4-O-sulfation (7Vilela-Silva A.-C.E.S.

Although we observed a less strict species specificity in sperm recognition of sulfated polysaccharides, the potency of acrosome reaction induction clearly depends on the extent of 2-O- and 4-O-sulfation in the chain of 3-linked α-l-fucopyranosyl units (7Vilela-Silva A.-C.E.S.

Here, we extend our studies to two new sea urchins, the closely related species Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis andStrongylocentrotus pallidus, which both have a circumarctic distribution. The egg jellies of these sea urchins contain sulfated α-fucans with new structures. Our results show expanded possibilities for structural variation among sulfated α-l-fucans from echinoderms and possible biological and evolutionary implications of these unique polysaccharides. Detailed structural characterizations also help evaluate the therapeutic potential of sulfated polysaccharides, as already demonstrated for the anticoagulant activity of sulfated fucans (9Pereira M.S.

Mature females of S. droebachiensisand S. pallidus were collected near Friday Harbor, WA. Atlantic S. droebachiensis females were collected in Bergen, Tromsø, and Svalbard, Norway. Eggs were spawned into filtered sea water after intracelomic injection of 0.55 m KCl. Egg jelly was isolated by pouring eggs repeatedly through nylon mesh, prepared as a 20,000 × g supernatant, and stored at −20 °C or lyophilized after dialysis against distilled water (8Vacquier V.D.

The crude polysaccharides (10 mg) from the egg jelly coats were applied to a Mono Q FPLC1 column (HR5/5; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer and then eluted by a linear gradient of 0–4.0 m NaCl in the same buffer. The flow rate of the column was 0.45 ml/min, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Fractions were checked for fucose and sialic acid by the Dubois reaction (12Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K.

Fractions containing the sulfated α-l-fucan and the sialic acid glycoconjugate were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. Total fucose was measured by the method of Dische and Shettles (15Dische Z. Shettles L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 595-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharide (5.0 m trifluoroacetic acid for 5 h at 100 °C), sulfate was measured by the BaCl2/gelatin method (16Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 242: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The presence of hexoses and 6-deoxyhexoses in the acid hydrolysates was estimated by paper chromatography in 1-butanol/pyridine/water (3:2:1, v/v) for 48 h and by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of derived alditols (17Kircher H.W. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1103-1106Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sulfated fucans were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously (5Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6965-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Vieira R.P. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18176-18183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sample (∼15 μg) was applied to a 0.5% agarose gel and run for 1 h at 110 V in 0.05 m 1,3-diaminopropane acetate (pH 9.0). The sulfated polysaccharides in the gel were fixed with 0.1%N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide solution. After 12 h, the gel was dried and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v). Desulfation of the sulfated fucans was performed by solvolysis in dimethyl sulfoxide as described previously for desulfation of other types of polysaccharides (19Mourão P.A.S. Perlin A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfate esters located at different sites of the fucose residues may have variable susceptibility to the desulfation reaction (5Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6965-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 6Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourão P.A.S.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, the desulfation reaction simultaneously reduced the molecular mass of the polysaccharide. It is necessary to have a balance between removal of sulfate ester and decrease in the polysaccharide chain. For these reasons, we obtained a totally desulfated fucan in some experiments and a partially desulfated fucan in others. The native and desulfated fucans (5 mg of each) were subjected to three rounds of methylation as described previously (21Ciucanu J. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), with the modifications suggested by Patankar et al. (22Patankar M.S. Oehninger S. Barnett T. Williams R.L. Clark G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21770-21776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The methylated polysaccharides were hydrolyzed in 6 mtrifluoroacetic acid for 5 h at 100 °C and reduced with borohydride, and the alditols were acetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine (1:1, v/v) (17Kircher H.W. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1103-1106Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The alditol acetates of the methylated sugars were dissolved in chloroform and analyzed in a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. 1H and 13C spectra of the native and desulfated fucans were recorded using a Bruker DRX 600 apparatus with a triple resonance probe. About 3 mg of each sample was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 99.9% D2O Cambridge Isotope Laboratory. All spectra were recorded at 60 °C with HOD suppression by pre-saturation. COSY, TOCSY, and1H/13C HMQC spectra were recorded using states-time proportion phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the indirect dimension. TOCSY spectra were run with 4096 × 400 points with a spin-lock field of ∼10 kHz and a mixing time of 80 ms. HMQC spectra were run with 1024 × 256 points and globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulses for decoupling. NOESY spectra were run with a mixing time of 100 ms. Chemical shifts are relative to external trimethylsilylpropionic acid at 0 ppm for1H and to methanol for 13C. Sea urchins were induced to spawn by intracelomic injection of 0.55 m KCl. Sperm were collected undiluted from the gonophores and stored on ice, whereas eggs were released into filtered seawater at ambient water temperature. Freshly diluted sperm were added to 480-μl aliquots of gently washed 5% (v/v) egg suspensions in 24-well tissue culture plates. A 1:4 dilution of sperm at each of five steps, starting with a 1:10,000 dilution of sperm, covered the range from near zero to 100% fertilization for intraspecific crosses. Fertilization success was assessed by counting the proportion of eggs (out of 200–300 eggs/well) with an elevated fertilization envelope or of eggs that were cleaving. The concentration of sperm, which differs among species and individuals, was determined later by 10 counts of fixed sperm suspensions in a hemocytometer. The percentages of fertilization were calculated by back-transformation from logistic regressions for multiple male/female combinations crossed over a range of sperm concentrations. To obtain egg jelly for acrosome-reacting sperm, a 5–10% suspension of eggs was poured through Nitex mesh several times. This stripped the eggs of their soluble jelly; the supernatant was pipetted off after the dejellied eggs had settled. Carrying out the final sperm dilution step in conspecific egg jelly water induced the sperm acrosome reaction and is referred to as “pre-reaction with conspecific egg jelly.” Agarose gel electrophoresis in 1,3-diaminopropane acetate buffer followed by toluidine blue staining showed that egg jelly isolated from individual females of East Pacific S. droebachiensis contained either a slow (sulfated fucan I) or fast (sulfated fucan II) migrating fucan isotype (Fig. 1A). Of 22 individual females, 9 had eggs with sulfated fucan I, and 13 had eggs with sulfated fucan II. Surprisingly, nine individual females of the same species, but collected in the Atlantic Ocean, contained only the slow migrating sulfated fucan (isotype I) (Fig. 1B). Small differences in the electrophoretic mobility of sulfated fucans I and II (Fig. 1, A and B) could reflect intermediate sulfation degrees, variation in the molecular mass of the polymers (11Albano R.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 758-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pavão M.S.G. Albano R.M. Lawson A.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9972-9979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or even interaction of the sulfated fucan with other macromolecules (24Takahashi H.K. Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 451-461Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) because the agarose gel electrophoresis was performed with crude egg jelly. These aspects were further investigated using Mono Q FPLC of mixed samples of egg jellies from a large number of S. droebachiensis females. Egg jellies from 31 Pacific females showed two distinct fractions of sulfated fucans (Fig.2A), whereas egg jellies from 19 Atlantic females contained a single fraction eluted at lower NaCl concentration (Fig. 2B). A peak rich in sialic acid was eluted completely by 0.7 m NaCl from the two samples and termed “sialic acid-rich glycoconjugate” in analogy with similar compounds described in other species of sea urchins (25SeGall G.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The absence of intermediate fractions between sulfated fucans I and II suggests that females of S. droebachiensis synthesize either type of fucan with a defined sulfation pattern. If the difference between the sulfated fucans from females of S. droebachiensis were a consequence of temporal variation in the sulfation or related to the stage of oogenesis, one would expect to see intermediate fractions between sulfated fucans I and II upon agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1, A and B) and anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2, A andB). Seven individual females of the sea urchin S. pallidus from the Pacific coast, collected at the same site as the S. droebachiensis females used in the experiment in Fig.1A, contained a single sulfated fucan isotype (Fig.1C). Mono Q FPLC of a mixed sample of egg jellies from 25S. pallidus females confirmed the occurrence of a single sulfated fucan (Fig. 2C) eluting at high NaCl concentration, like sulfated fucan II from S. droebachiensis, in addition to the sialic acid-rich glycoconjugate. Overall, these results indicate that spawned eggs from individual females of the sea urchin S. droebachiensis have one of two possible sulfated fucan isotypes. This polymorphism was observed only in one population. In contrast, all assayed females of the sea urchinS. pallidus contained a single type of sulfated fucan. Both sulfated fucans (purified as in Fig. 2,A and B) migrated on agarose gels (Fig.3) identically as crude egg jelly (shown in Fig. 1, A and B). The slow and fast migrating sulfated fucans were eluted at low and high NaCl concentrations, respectively. Chemical analysis of the purified sulfated fucans (TableI) revealed fucose as the only sugar with a high content of sulfate ester, which increased from sulfated fucan I to sulfated fucan II, as expected from their migration upon agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A) and elution by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2A).Table IChemical composition of the sulfated α-fucans from the egg jellies of two sea urchin species in the genus StrongylocentrotusSpeciesPolysaccharide1-aPurified sulfated α-fucans I and II from S. droebachiensis were obtained by Mono Q FPLC (see Fig. 2, A and B).

Open table in a new tab Methylation of native sulfated fucan I from S. droebachiensis yielded equimolar proportions of 2,3-di-O-methylfucose and 3-methylfucose, whereas 2,3-di-O-methylfucose was the predominant methyl ether derivative from desulfated fucan I (TableII). This indicates a polysaccharide composed of 4-linked fucopyranoside residues, partially 2-O-sulfated. 2An additional round of methylation did not increase the proportion of 2,3-di-O-methyl fucose. Possibly, the sample still contained small amounts of 2-O-sulfate ester. A different sample of desulfated fucan I was used for NMR analysis.This structure was confirmed and further detailed by NMR analysis.

Open table in a new tab The spectra were recorded at 600 mHz in 99.9% D2O. Chemical shifts are relative to external trimethylsilylpropionic acid at 0 ppm for 1H and to methanol for 13C. Values in boldface type indicate positions bearing a sulfate ester, and those in italic type indicate glycosylated positions. NMR spectra of desulfated fucan I show a single anomeric signal (Fig.4B) with a strong downfield shift (∼11 ppm) of C-4 (Fig.5B and Table III), compatible with a linear homopolymer of 4-linked α-fucopyranoside residues. NMR spectra of native sulfated fucan I contain four anomeric signals in near-equal proportions by integration (Figs. 4A and5A). TOCSY and COSY spectra confirmed that the four anomeric signals of native sulfated fucan I correspond to four spin systems, each consistent with α-fucose. The spin systems can be traced, giving the values in Table III. Strong downshifts (approximately −0.65 ppm) of H-2 of residues A and B relative to H-2 of residues C and D indicate that two of the residues are sulfated at C-2. Thus, sulfated α-fucan I from S. droebachiensis is mostly a tetrasaccharide repeat unit consisting of 4-linked residues, two sulfated at theO-2-position and two that are unsulfated. The order of the four residues can be easily deduced. The only possible array is two consecutive 2-O-sulfated residues followed by two unsulfated residues. If the 2-O-sulfated and unsulfated units alternate, the fucan would contain a disaccharide instead of a tetrasaccharide repeating structure. Our proposition was confirmed by the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 6). As in the NOESY spectra of other fucans from echinoderms (5Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol.

In sulfated α-fucan I from S. droebachiensis, H-1 of residue A shows cross-peaks to H-4 of residue B; H-1 of residue B shows cross-peaks to H-4 of residue C; H-1 of residue C shows cross-peaks to H-3 of residue D; and H-1 of residue D shows cross-peaks to H-2 of residue A.

For example, small amounts of three consecutive 2-O-sulfated fucose units followed by three unsulfated residues may occur in the polysaccharide. In this case, the additional structures are either undetectable due to their low proportions or cannot be discriminated by the NMR spectra. Nevertheless, the near-equal proportions by integration of the four anomeric signals (Figs. 4A and 5A) indicate these additional structures cannot account for a substantial proportion of the sulfated fucan structure. The structure of sulfated α-fucan II from S. droebachiensis was investigated using the same methodologies. Methylation of native sulfated fucan II yielded 3-methylfucose, whereas 2,3-di-O-methylfucose was obtained from totally desulfated fucan II (Table II). Clearly, this indicates a linear homopolymer composed of 4-linked and 2-O-sulfated fucopyranoside residues, the structure of which was confirmed by NMR analysis (Figs. 4(C and D) and Fig. 5 (C andD)). The 1H spectrum of sulfated α-fucan II resulting from desulfation processes shows a reduction in intensity of the anomeric residue at 5.30 ppm and a corresponding increase"

This overexpression was associated with an increase in DNA synthesis, suggesting a role of RGC-32 in the cell cycle (16Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26977-26981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this paper we present the cloning of human RGC-32 and experimental evidence indicating the role of RGC-32 in cell cycle activation through regulation of p34CDC2 kinase. In human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC), complement activation induced nuclear translocation of RGC-32 protein. Overexpression of RGC-32 in aortic SMC increased BrdUrd incorporation and the cell number, and these effects of RGC-32 were further increased when cells were exposed to C5b-9. RGC-32 complexes with p34CDC2-cyclin B1 and increases the kinase activity. This kinase enhancing activity appears to require phosphorylation of RGC-32 at threonine 91 by p34CDC2. These findings identify RGC-32 as a substrate and regulator of p34CDC2. To clone human RGC-32, we screened the NCBI EST data base with the rat rgc-32sequence. Among several homologous human ESTs, an EcoRI fragment of the I.M.A.G.E. clone yy46a05 was used to screen 2 × 105 clones of a Human Fetal Brain 5′-STRETCH PLUS λgt11 cDNA Library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). In brief, duplicate filters were prepared using Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were hybridized with ratrgc-32 cDNA and exposed to Kodak Biomax x-ray film. Colonies that were positive on both of the duplicate filters were screened again, and DNA was isolated from positive phage clones using Lambda-TRAP PLUS (CLONTECH). The cDNA inserts were amplified by PCR with the Long Distance Insert Screening Amplimer set for λgt11 and KlenTaq polymerase (CLONTECH). The longest PCR product (742 bp) was subcloned into pGEM4 plasmid and amplified in bacteria. The insert was sequenced at the University of Maryland School of Medicine Biopolymer Laboratory. BLASTN searches of the dbEST data base revealed mouse ESTs with a high identity to rat rgc-32. One such EST (ATCC accession number AI787756, clone μl22 g09.y1, mouse embryonic day 14.5) had an insert length of ∼1000 bp. The insert was sequenced in both orientations. PCR was used to screen a monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel (Quantum Biotechnology, Inc., Montreal, Canada) containing 20 somatic hybrid cell lines plus 3 control DNAs of human, hamster, and mouse. By using PCR primers, hg5′ (CTGCTAAAATCAGCTTACTAG) and hg3′ (ATATTAGCATGGATCGTCTG), amplification was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by Southern blot probed with human RGC-32 labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the oligolabeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Human aortic SMC from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) were grown 3–5 passages for 3–4 days in SMC basal medium, containing supplements of 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 2 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor, and 5 μg/ml insulin. Prior to the experiments, cells were starved for 24 h in SMC basal medium without serum and growth factor supplements. This method produced over 95% of cells resting in G0/G1-phase, as determined by the relative DNA content by propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (12Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were positive for muscle actin by indirect immunostaining using HHF35 monoclonal IgG (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY) Pooled normal human serum (NHS) from healthy adult donors was used as a source of serum complement. Aortic SMC were exposed to sublytic complement attack by sensitizing with a fixed dose of anti-HLA class I antibody (Ab) and then incubating with NHS at 1:10 final dilution. The sublytic dose of Ab was predetermined by measuring cell death in the presence of excess NHS (8Carney D.F. Lang T.J. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 623-629PubMed Google Scholar, 10Niculescu F.

Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To produce a negative control for complement activity of NHS, the hemolytic activity was inactivated by heating NHS at 56 °C for 45 min (HI-NHS). C5b-9 was assembled by incubating aortic SMC sequentially with C5b6 complex for 15 min and C7 for 5 min at room temperature, and then with C8 and C9 at 37 °C for the indicated period, as previously described (9Niculescu F. Rus H. Shin M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4417-4423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Niculescu F. Rus H. Van Biesen T. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4405-4412PubMed Google Scholar). Purified C5-C9 proteins were from Quidel (San Diego, CA), and C5b6 was prepared as described (9Niculescu F. Rus H. Shin M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4417-4423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Niculescu F. Rus H. Van Biesen T. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4405-4412PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified from aortic SMC using guanidine isothiocyanate and ultracentrifugation through a 5.7 m CsCl2cushion for 18 h at 35,000 rpm using an SW60 Beckman rotor (12Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar,17Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). RNA was denatured and electrophoresed (10 μg of RNA/lane) on 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose. A multitissue Northern blot (MTN1,CLONTECH, containing 2 μg of human poly(A)+ RNA per lane) was hybridized with32P-labeled probe generated from the 855-bpRGC-32 cDNA (18Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar). After exposure to x-ray film, radiographic densities of each mRNA band were measured using Computing Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and the integrated volume was calculated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The human RGC-32 open reading frame was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) in frame with the GST gene. Recombinant fusion protein (GST-RGC-32) extracted from bacterial lysates was purified by chromatography using Redipack GST purification module (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with GST-RGC-32. IgG fractions of antisera were screened by Western blotting (16Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26977-26981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To assay tissue expression, protein extracts from human brain, heart, and liver (Protein Medley, CLONTECH) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and then examined by Western blotting with rabbit anti-RGC-32 IgG by indirect peroxidase method and visualized by ECL (Pierce). For immunostaining, aortic SMC grown on plastic slide chambers in SMC basal medium without serum and growth factor supplements were fixed and stained with anti-RGC-32 IgG by indirect immunoperoxidase method using 3-aminoethylcarbazole. The effect of complement activation was examined by treating cells in plastic chambers with Ab and NHS. For in vitro binding, recombinant CDC2-cyclin B1 complex (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was mixed with GST-RGC-32 or GST (negative control) at a final concentration of 5 μm. After 30 min at room temperature, samples were mixed with 20 μl of 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and Sepharose beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.01% Triton X-100. Protein retained on the beads was eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blot, using anti-p34CDC2 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For in vivo binding, aortic SMC lysates treated with C5b-9 or C5b6 for 6 and 18 h were immunoprecipitated with anti-p34CDC2 IgG and then examined by Western blotting. Human recombinant p34CDC2-cyclin B1 (New England Biolabs) was used to examine the effect of RGC-32. GST-RGC-32 was incubated with 1 unit of p34CDC2-cyclin B1 for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample in reaction buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2). Recombinant p27 cell cycle kinase inhibitor (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) (10 μm) was included in some experiments. Phosphorylated histone H1 bands were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (11Niculescu F. Badea T. Rus H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar). Purified GST-RGC-32, p34CDC2-cyclin B, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, as described above, and proteins were analyzed for phosphorylation on 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Thr-91 of RGC-32, a possible target for p34CDC2 (19Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar, 20Colgan D.F. Murthy K.G. Zhao W. Prives C. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), was mutated using the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Clonetics). The selection primer (GGTTTCTTAGATATCAGGTGGCAC) converts theAatII site at 1180 in pGEX-4T-3 to EcoRV; a mutagenic primer was CTGCCACTGTCGCTCCTCAGAAAG, which converts Thr-91 to alanine (T91A). The desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing at the University Biopolymer Facility. Mutated and wild type RGC-32 proteins were used in vitro for kinase and phosphorylation assays. The humanRGC-32 cDNA was subcloned in frame with VP22 and Myc epitope in pVP22/myc-His-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Expression vectors carrying the RGC-32 gene (pVP22-RGC-32) or empty vector (pVP22) were transiently transfected into aortic SMC using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). BrdUrd incorporation was performed in transiently transfected cells using BrdUrd Flow Kit (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). In brief, aortic SMC were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd, harvested by trypsinization, and then permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer provided by the manufacturer. BrdUrd and DNA were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-BrdUrd and 7-aminoactinomycin D, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two-color flow cytometric analysis enumerates and characterizes cells that are actively synthesizing DNA in specific cell cycle. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer and Consort-40 software. In searches of the dbEST and GenBankTM data bases with rat rgc-32sequence, significant homology was found with two human EST clones (yy53e12 and yy46a05) derived from a human multiple sclerosis brain library (7Niculescu F. Rus H. Shin S. Lang T. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 214-224PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that rat rgc-32 (16Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26977-26981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and these human I.M.A.G.E clones shared over 80% DNA sequence identity suggested that the EST sequences may be part of the human RGC-32 gene. We used an EcoRI fragment derived from EST clone yy46a05 to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library. One of the isolated clones had a 722-bp insert containing the 5′-untranslated region and the entire open reading frame of rgc-32. Alignment of this clone with the EST sequences produced an 895-bp sequence (Fig.1A), which approximates the size of the human RGC-32 transcript seen on Northern blots. The nucleotide sequence predicts a 117-amino acid polypeptide with an estimated mass of 12.9 kDa. Human RGC-32 lacks the first 20 amino acids at the NH2 terminus of the rat (16Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26977-26981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and mouse protein (Fig. 1B). Excluding this region, human RGC-32 has 92% sequence similarity with the rat protein (16Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26977-26981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mouse RGC-32 (GenBankTM accession number AF276981) is a 965-bp gene with a start codon at position 151 and a poly(A)+ signal at position 902. The gene encodes a 137-amino acid polypeptide with 92% identity to rat RGC-32, including the 20 NH2-terminal amino acids (Fig. 1B). By data base analysis, human and mouse RGC-32 show no homology with any other known proteins and contain no motif that would indicate a putative biochemical function. Human and mouse RGC-32 do not contain signal sequences or transmembrane domains, as determined by hydrophobicity analysis. Human RGC-32 was assigned to chromosome 13 by screening a monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel using PCR, followed by confirmation by Southern blot (Fig.2). When the human RGC-32sequence was compared with the marker data base of the sequence-tagged sites using BLASTN, we found an identity with a human sequence-tagged site, SHGC-36498. The radiation hybrid mapping of this sequence-tagged site, available through the Stanford Human Genome project (shgc.stanford.edu), confirmed that human RGC-32 resides on the long arm of chromosome 13 in bin 12 and was annotated in the NCBI data base to locus ID 28984, located in the 13q12–13q14 interval. The full-length human RGC-32 cDNA was used to probe a human multitissue Northern blot (Fig.3A). An ∼1-kb transcript was abundantly expressed in placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas and was weakly expressed in heart and brain, whereas no signal was detected in lung. The mRNA was also detected in human aortic endothelial cells and JY25 B lymphoblastoid line (data not shown). Rabbit anti-human RGC-32 IgG identified a 14-kDa band by Western blot of the GST-cleaved and -purified RGC-32 and also detected RGC-32 protein in brain, heart, and liver (Fig. 3B). Tissue expression of mouse rgc-32 mRNA was similar to that of rat rgc-32 mRNA (16Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26977-26981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although the level of RGC-32 mRNA expressed in aortic SMC was not detectable by Northern blot, it increased to a detectable level by treatment with C5b-9 (Fig.4A). The mRNA, detected 3 h after exposure to C5b-9, persisted for up to 6 h and was no longer detected at 18 h. C5b6, a negative control for C5b-9, had no effect on RGC-32 expression. Immunostaining, on the other hand, revealed the presence of RGC-32 as a cytoplasmic protein in unstimulated cells in culture (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Upon stimulation with Ab and NHS, nuclear translocation of RGC-32 protein was noted as early as 6 h (middle panel). Nuclear translocation of RGC-32 may play an important role in nuclear regulation of the cell cycle, as nuclear translocation of RGC-32 preceded DNA synthesis and SMC proliferation occurring at 12 and 48 h after complement activation, respectively (11Niculescu F. Badea T. Rus H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In view of the protein expression, a Northern blot may not be sensitive enough to detect RGC-32 mRNA in unstimulated SMC. This is in agreement with our previous finding that reverse transcriptase-PCR was required to show an increased rgc-32 mRNA in rat OLG in response to C5b-9 (16Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26977-26981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To explore the role of RGC-32 in cell cycle activation, a possible interaction of RGC-32 with p34CDC2 was first examinedin vitro, by GST pull down assay. p34CDC2 was recovered with RGC-32 in GST pull down assay (Fig.5A). As expected, GST alone was unable to pull down p34CDC2. We then tested whether RGC-32 interacts with p34CDC2in vivo by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. We found that p34CDC2 was coimmunoprecipitated with RGC-32 both in stimulated and unstimulated aortic SMC (Fig. 5B). By density analysis, the level of RGC-32 immunoprecipitated with anti-p34CDC2 appears slightly higher (1.5-fold) in cells treated with C5b-9 than in the C5b6 control (Fig. 5B). RGC-32 failed to coimmunoprecipitate with CDK2 or with CDK4 (data not shown). Physical association of RGC-32 with p34CDC2 led us to examine the regulation of CDC2 kinase by RGC-32. We mixed GST-RGC-32 with recombinant p34CDC2-cyclin B1 and then assayed kinase activity using histone H1. RGC-32 dramatically increased the p34CDC2 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Because p34CDC2activity is inhibited by cell cycle kinase inhibitor p27 (21Uren A. Jakus J. de Mora J.F. Yeudall A. Santos E. Gutkind S. Heidaran M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21669-21672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we tested the RGC-32 kinase enhancing activity in the presence of p27. RGC-32 was unable to increase the p34CDC2 kinase activity in the presence of p27 at 10 μm. Thus, RGC-32 can directly bind p34CDC2 and up-regulate its kinase activity but has no effect on p27 inhibition. During the in vitro kinase assay to assess the effect of RGC-32, we noted that RGC-32 was phosphorylated. In the absence of histone H1, p34CDC2-cyclin B1 induced phosphorylation of GST-RGC-32, and the protein complex was detected as a 46-kDa band (Fig.7, A and B). This p34CDC2-mediated phosphorylation was inhibited by p27, and RGC-32 was not autophosphorylated. Cyclin B1, like RGC-32, was also phosphorylated by p34CDC2 in the absence of histone H1. We searched for a p34CDC2 phosphorylation consensus motif ((T/S)PX(K/R)) in human RGC-32. The p34CDC2consensus requires a basic residue at the +3 position (19Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar, 20Colgan D.F. Murthy K.G. Zhao W. Prives C. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We identified a putative p34CDC2 consensus sequence, TPQK, with a threonine at 91, a proline at +1, and a basic residue at the +3 position. A similar sequence was found in the rat and mouse proteins. To test whether Thr-91 is the phosphorylation site, the site was mutated to alanine (T91A), and the corresponding GST fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The mutated protein was purified and used to examine the role of p34CDC2phosphorylation of RGC-32. As shown in Fig. 7B, p34CDC2 failed to phosphorylate RGC-32 T91A. These data indicate that Thr-91 may be the target for p34CDC2 kinase. These data also indicate that RGC-32 is not required for phosphorylation of cyclin B1 by p34CDC2. Phosphorylation of cyclin B also plays a critical role in nuclear import of the p34CDC2-cyclin B complex (22Loyer P. Glaise D. Cariou S. Baffet G. Meijer L. Guguen-Guillouzo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2491-2500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because RGC-32 T91A was not phosphorylated by p34CDC2, we examined whether mutation of Thr-91 affects the ability of RGC-32 to enhance the activity of p34CDC2 (Fig. 8). The T91A mutation markedly reduced the kinase enhancing activity of RGC-32. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr-91 appears to be important for RGC-32 in increasing the CDC2 kinase activity. Because the cell cycle activation in OLG by C5b-9 is associated with a significantly decreased p27 protein level (23Yang J. Song H. Walsh S. Bardes E.S. Kornbluth S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3604-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the p34CDC2 enhancing effect of RGC-32 can be amplified by C5b-9 in vivo through down-regulation of p27. We wanted to examine whether RGC-32 is involved in the cell cycle by using aortic SMC transiently transfected to express RGC-32. About 95% of untransfected cells were arrested in the G1/G0-phase of the cell cycle after 18 h of starvation (Fig. 9,CTR). After transfection, cells were cultured for an additional 18 h in serum- and growth factor-free medium, and then DNA synthesis was assayed by BrdUrd incorporation and DNA content using 7-aminoactinomycin D. The assay time points were chosen based on previous experiments (11Niculescu F. Badea T. Rus H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Starvation periods longer than 18 h greatly increased cell death. Transfection of pVP22/myc-His-TOPO control vector resulted in 16% of cells in S-phase (VP22). Transfection of RGC-32 expression vector induced 50% of cells to enter S-phase and 11% of cells in G2/M-phase (RGC-32). When cells transfected to express RGC-32 were exposed to complement activation, a significant number of cells showed shifting from S-phase (36%) into G2/M (29%) (Fig. 9, RGC-32+C). These data indicate for the first time that RGC-32 is able to induce S-phase entry and mitosis in the absence of serum and growth factors and that RGC-32 is involved in C5b-9-mediated cell proliferation (11Niculescu F. Badea T. Rus H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When aortic SMC were transfected with RGC-32 expression vector in the presence of 7.5 μm butyrolactone, a CDK inhibitor (27Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Takahashi I.S. Okabe T. Ogino H. Taya Y. Hishimura S. Okuyama A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2549-2557PubMed Google Scholar), BrdUrd incorporation was reduced to the level of control vector (data not shown). Thus, our findings are consistent with an involvement of p34CDC2 in RGC-32 mediated S-phase entry and mitosis. This is consistent with our previous finding that C5b-9 increased p34CDC2 activity in primary OLG during late G1and G1/S transition (12Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar). A role of p34CDC2 in regulation of S-phase has been reported. p34CDC2-cyclin B is able to activate DNA replication through phosphorylation of DNA replication factor (28Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 29D'Urso G. Marraccino R.L. Marshak D.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1990; 250: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). p34CDC2 can also activate DNA replication by phosphorylating Thr-376 of Cdk7, a kinase involved in S-phase entry (30Roberts B.T. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, p34CDC2 may also affect the S-phase of cell cycle in aortic SMC, in addition to its role in the M-phase (12Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar, 32Marraccino R.L. Firpo E.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Furukawa Y.

Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 85Google Scholar). In the present paper, we show experimental data to elucidate the role of RGC-32 in the cell cycle. We showed that RGC-32 binds p34CDC2 and increases the activity of the kinase. Both of these activities appear to depend on phosphorylation of RGC-32 by p34CDC2 at a consensus site at Thr-91. Thus, RGC-32 is a new p34CDC2 substrate that can increase the CDC2 kinase activity and enhance S-phase entry (35Nurse P. Cell. 1997; 91: 865-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Proliferation of aortic SMC plays a critical role in atherogenesis and in restenosis following angioplasty and coronary stenting (36Ross R. N. Engl. J.

The crystal structure of UvrB revealed a similar fold as found in monomeric DNA helicases. Homology modeling suggested that the β-hairpin motif of UvrB might be involved in DNA binding (Theis, K., Chen, P. J., Skorvaga, M., Van Houten, B., and Kisker, C. (1999) EMBO J.18, 6899–6907). To determine a role of the β-hairpin ofBacillus caldotenax UvrB, we have constructed a deletion mutant, Δβh UvrB, which lacks residues Gln-97–Asp-112 of the β-hairpin. Δβh UvrB does not form a stable UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex and is inactive in UvrABC-mediated incision. However, Δβh UvrB is able to bind to UvrA and form a complex with UvrA and damaged DNA, competing with wild type UvrB. In addition, Δβh UvrB shows wild type-like ATPase activity in complex with UvrA that is stimulated by damaged DNA. In contrast to wild type UvrB, the ATPase activity of mutant UvrB does not lead to a destabilization of the damaged duplex. These results indicate that the conserved β-hairpin motif is a major factor in DNA binding. UvrB plays a major role in recognition and processing of DNA lesions during nucleotide excision repair.

These results indicate that the conserved β-hairpin motif is a major factor in DNA binding. nucleotide excision repair base pair double-stranded DNA single-stranded DNA wild type Nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 is a highly conserved DNA repair pathway found in bacteria, yeast, and man (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 2Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Google Scholar). NER is remarkable because of the wide variety of chemically and structurally distinct DNA lesions that are substrates for this process (3Lloyd R.S. Van Houten B. Vos J.-M. DNA Damage Recognition. R. G. Landes Co., Biomedical Publishers, Austin, TX1995: 25-66Google Scholar). NER has been fully reconstituted from bacterial and mammalian proteins and can be viewed as four basic steps, damage recognition and processing, incision, repair synthesis, and ligation. One of the best-characterized NER systems is the UvrABC nuclease from Escherichia coli (4Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Google Scholar,5Grossman L. Lin C.I. Ahn Y. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. Nucleotide Excision Repair in Escherichia coli. 1. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 11-27Google Scholar). Repair by UvrABC is initiated when the trimeric complex of UvrA2B recognizes the damaged site. It has been suggested that the UvrA2B complex may locate damage through a limited helicase activity (6Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3638-3642Google Scholar, 7Oh E.Y.

However, more recent studies suggest that the strand-separating activity of the UvrA2B complex is not through a helicase-driven translocation step but in fact is due to local, relatively slow changes within the protein-DNA complex leading to a stable UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex and dissociation of the UvrA dimer (9Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Google Scholar, 10Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Google Scholar, 11Gordienko I. Rupp W.D.

Once the UvrB-DNA complex has formed, UvrC, in what appears to be two different binding modes, first makes an incision four to five nucleotides 3′ to the modified nucleotide in an ATP-dependent step, which is followed by rapid incision seven nucleotides 5′ to the lesion in a step that does not require ATP hydrolysis (13Sancar A. Rupp W.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 249-260Google Scholar). Recent work from Goosen and co-workers (14Verhoeven E.E. van Kesteren M. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6824-6828Google Scholar, 19Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Google Scholar), UvrB has no intrinsic nuclease activity; 3′ incision is mediated by the N-terminal domain of UvrC and 5′ incision appears to be mediated by a nuclease center in the C-terminal domain of UvrC. After the incision reaction UvrD (helicase II) and DNA polymerase I are necessary and sufficient to release the excised oligonucleotide and allow UvrB and UvrC to participate in another round of incision (20Caron P.R. Kushner S.R. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4925-4929Google Scholar, 21Husain I. Van Houten B. Thomas D.C. Abdel-Monem M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6774-6778Google Scholar).UvrB plays a central role in bacterial NER, participating in damage recognition, processing the DNA into a stable pre-incision complex, helping direct the activity of UvrC to perform the dual incisions, and finally staying bound to the non-damaged strand until being dislodged by DNA polymerase I (19Hsu D.S. Kim S.-T. Sun Q. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8319-8327Google Scholar, 22Orren D.K. Selby C.P. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 780-788Google Scholar). UvrB contains six highly conserved sequence motifs, containing 10–40 amino acid residues each, that are found in all DNA helicases (23Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Ortiz-Buysse M. Goosen N. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 294-307Google Scholar, 24Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. van de Putte P. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 12. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 103-123Google Scholar). Three laboratories have independently solved the crystal structures of UvrB from thermophilic bacteria (25Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Google Scholar, 26Machius M. Henry L. Palnitkar M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11717-11722Google Scholar, 27Nakagawa N.

Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Google Scholar). UvrB is folded into five structural domains, 1a, 1b, 2, 3, and 4. The structure of domain 4, disordered in crystals of the full-length protein, has been determined separately (29Sohi M. Alexandrovich A. Moolenaar G. Visse R. Goosen N. Vernede X. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Champness J. Sanderson M.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 161-164Google Scholar). Domains 1a and 3 contain the six helicase motifs, placing UvrB as a member of the helicase superfamily II (30Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Google Scholar).Superpositioning of UvrB onto other helicase structures has revealed that UvrB domains 1a and 3 are structurally closely related to the monomeric helicase fold found in PcrA, NS3, and Rep (28Theis K. Skorvaga M. Machius M. Nakagawa N. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Google Scholar). Domains 1b and 2 are unique to UvrB, the latter being a binding site for UvrA. Comparing the structure of UvrB with these helicase structures revealed that UvrB contains all the structural properties of a helicase that couple ATP binding and hydrolysis to domain motions. However, if UvrB binds DNA in a similar manner as observed in the DNA complexes of these helicases, then the translocated DNA strand would be partially covered by a flexible β-hairpin structure. This unique structural element (see Figs. 1, A and B) connecting domains 1a and 1b was found to be highly conserved in all bacterial species. The β-hairpin is held in place with respect to domain 1b by two salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions at the base and the tip of the hairpin. Similar β-hairpin motifs found in PcrA and RNA polymerase II are thought to be essential for the strand opening performed by these two proteins (31Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Velankar S.S. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 137-148Google Scholar, 32Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the DNA in the UvrB-DNA complex is partially melted over a 5-bp region (12Zou Y. Van Houten B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4889-4901Google Scholar). Based on these data, the UvrB structure, and comparisons to helicase structures and properties, a padlock binding mode for UvrB DNA interactions has been proposed in which UvrB wraps the β-hairpin around one DNA strand of partially unwound DNA in the pre-incision complex (25Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Google Scholar, 28Theis K. Skorvaga M. Machius M. Nakagawa N. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Google Scholar). One critical test for this model is whether mutations in the β-hairpin affect binding and processing of damaged DNA.Only one known mutation has been made in this motif, Glu-99 in UvrB (of E. coli), which was found to decrease the incision activity of the UvrABC system. To investigate the role of the β-hairpin motif in more detail, we constructed a β-hairpin mutant that replaced residues 97–112 with a glycine residue. We report here that this β-hairpin deletion mutant is greatly reduced in its ability to support incision, bind to a damaged containing duplex, and destabilize a damage containing 26-mer but has retained the ability to hydrolyze ATP in a UvrA- and damaged DNA-dependent manner. Thus, ATP hydrolysis and formation of the UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex are uncoupled in this mutant. The ability of the mutant to form a UvrA2B-DNA complex and to hydrolyze ATP combined with its inability to form the UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex strongly suggests that the deleted residues are directly involved in DNA binding by UvrB.RESULTSTo test our padlock DNA binding model and the importance of the β-hairpin motif in the recognition of DNA damage, we have constructed a β-hairpin deletion mutant of the B. caldotenax UvrB protein, designed as Δβh UvrB, with amino acid residues from Gln97 to Asp112 removed and the resulting gap bridged by a glycine residue (Fig. 1, A and B). In the resulting deletion mutant only the upper half of the β-hairpin was removed. To test the properties of this mutant, we reconstituted the B. caldotenax UvrABC nuclease system with purified UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC (Fig. 1C), each obtained via intein fusion proteins.UvrABC-mediated Incision of a Fluorescein-containing 50-bp Duplex Using the UvrB β-Hairpin Deletion MutantWe first investigated the effect of Δβh UvrB on UvrABC endonuclease mediated-incision. The substrate was a 50-bp duplex containing a fluorescein moiety in the middle of the top strand (position F26, see Fig.2A), labeled at its 5′ terminus with [γ-32P]ATP. Results of the UvrABC endonuclease incision kinetics of F26-50 dsDNA are shown in Fig. 3. Panel A contains data for wild type UvrB, panel B contains data for Δβh UvrB, and panel C summarizes the incision kinetics. The results show that Δβh UvrB does not support UvrABC-mediated incision of substrate DNA. The residual incision of ≤5–6% represents the level of background for the substrate used. Clearly, deleting the β-hairpin of UvrB disrupts one of the steps that lead to incision of the damaged DNA.Figure 3Δβh UvrB does not support incision of a fluorescein containing a 50-bp duplex. The F26-50 dsDNA substrate (2 nm) (sequence shown in Fig. 2A with a 5′ terminally labeled modified strand) was incubated with UvrA (20 nm), UvrB (60 nm), and UvrC (50 nm) at 55 °C for 1 h. The samples were analyzed by PAGE under denaturating conditions. Panel A, wt UvrB; Panel B, Δβh UvrB. Panel C, kinetics of the incision reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Loading of the Δβh UvrB Protein onto the Site of DamageThe failure of Δβh UvrB to confer endonuclease activity to the UvrABC system might be due to failure to recognize the damage or failure to incise the damage after successful recognition. We used a gel mobility shift assay to test whether the intermediate between these processes, the UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex, is formed with the Δβh UvrB mutant (Figs. 4 and5). The Δβh UvrB protein does not form a stable complex with the damaged DNA neither at low concentrations (1–20 nm; Fig. 4A) nor at higher amounts (50–200 nm; Fig. 4B), whereas loading of wild type UvrB is very efficient, even at 5 nm (Fig.4A, lane 7). It is interesting to note that the band corresponding to the UvrA2-DNA complex (Fig.4B, lane 2) migrates slightly faster than the samples containing the Δβh UvrB protein (Fig. 4B,lanes 4–6). This slower mobility band probably represents the UvrA2Δβh UvrB-DNA complex. To further investigate whether Δβh UvrB is able to bind to UvrA, we have conducted competition experiments between the mutant and the wild type UvrB for binding to UvrA and F26-50 dsDNA. In these experiments (Fig. 5) there is a clear difference in mobility between the UvrA2-DNA and UvrA2Δβh UvrB-DNA complexes (Fig. 5, compare lane 2 with lanes 3–5). Increasing amounts of Δβh UvrB (10, 50, 100 nm) at a constant wild type UvrB concentration (5 nm) resulted in a significant reduction of the amount of wt UvrB-DNA complex (Fig.5, lanes 4–6 versus lane 8). This dominant negative effect of Δβh UvrB supports the idea that Δβh UvrB is properly folded and shows that it is capable of interacting with UvrA, resulting in the reduction of the amount of UvrA molecules available to interact with wild type UvrB.Figure 4Binding of Δβh UvrB to F26-50dsDNA. UvrA (20 nm) was incubated with various amounts of wild-type or mutant (Δβh) UvrB as indicated at 55 °C for 20 min in the presence of 2 nm F26-50 duplex DNA with the modified strand 5′ terminally labeled. The reaction mixtures were analyzed on 4% polyacrylamide native gels in the presence of ATP (1 mm) and MgCl2 (10 mm).Panel A, lower concentrations of Δβh UvrB (1–10 nm); panel B, higher concentrations of Δβh UvrB (50–200 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Competition between wt and Δβh UvrB in binding to F26-50 dsDNA.

The limited strand opening by the UvrA2B complex has been shown previously to be important for dynamic recognition of DNA damage (11Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 889-895Google Scholar, 12Zou Y. Van Houten B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4889-4901Google Scholar) and has been called a limited helicase activity (6Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3638-3642Google Scholar, 7Oh E.Y. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1336-1343Google Scholar). To evaluate the importance of the β-hairpin motif for the presumed helicase activity of the UvrA2B complex, we assayed Δβh UvrB in a strand destabilization assay that measures the release of a radioactively labeled 26-mer containing fluorescein annealed to a single-stranded DNA circle (M13mp19(+) strand). The results are shown in Fig.7, with kinetics of the 26-mer release summarized in panel C. Although wild type UvrB supports the release of the fluorescein-containing 26-mer very efficiently, reaching about 80% release of oligomer after 60 min, the β-hairpin deletion mutant has very low, if any, activity. It is critical to realize that the “release” of the oligomer is assayed after the addition of a stop buffer containing1% SDS and 0.1 m EDTA.Figure 7Δβh UvrB is not capable of destabilizing or incising a fluorescein-containing 26-mer annealed to ssHS1F-M13mp19(+) DNA. For the kinetics of release, HS1F-M13mp19(+) DNA (8 fmol) (sequence shown in Fig. 1B, with the modified strand 5′ terminally labeled) was incubated with UvrA (50 nm) and UvrB (100 nm), wt, or Δβh at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time. The reactions were terminated with stop buffer containing SDS, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by 12% native PAGE. The figure shows the kinetics of 26-mer release by wt UvrB (panel A), Δβh UvrB (panel B), and graphic comparison of both wt and Δβh UvrB (panel C). Panel D, incision of a 26-mer containing fluorescein. HS1F-M13mp19(+) DNA (8 fmol) with a 5′ terminally labeled modified strand was incubated with UvrA (20 nm), UvrB (60 nm), and UvrC (50 nm) at 55 °C for 1 h. The samples were analyzed by PAGE under denaturing conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Incision of Strand-destabilizing Substrate by Δβh UvrBIf UvrB is capable of true strand displacement like a bona fidehelicase, then the displaced strand would be single-stranded. However, single-stranded damaged DNA is not a substrate for the UvrABC system. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 7D, the helix-destabilizing substrate, a 5′-labeled 26-mer containing a fluorescein adduct annealed to M13mp19 ssDNA, was incised by the UvrABC nuclease system. The incision efficiency supported by wild type UvrB was ∼55% (at 42 °C for 1 h; Fig. 7, panel D, lane 2), whereas the Δβh UvrB mutant did not support any incision of the 26-mer-fluorescein/M13 substrate. Based on this incision of the strand-displacement substrate with wild type UvrB (as part of the UvrABC endonuclease), we suggest that UvrA2B does not completely release the damage-containing 26-mer from a ssDNA circle until SDS is added as part of the stop buffer. Therefore, we feel it is inappropriate to call this activity a true helicase, and we suggest it is better to call this property of UvrA2UvrB a strand-destabilizing activity.ATPase Activity of Δβh UvrBIt has been shown previously that ATP binding/hydrolysis is absolutely required for NER (6Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3638-3642Google Scholar). In our padlock model (25Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Google Scholar) we suggest that the formation of a stable UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex requires free energy, which might be available either through ATP hydrolysis by UvrA2B or as a result of complex formation. To test whether the altered DNA binding properties of Δβh UvrB are due to an altered ATPase activity, we have examined this activity for both wild type UvrB and Δβh UvrB (TableI). By itself, Δβh UvrB has a very low ATPase activity at 37 °C (2.88 μmol of ATPase/min/mg of protein), similar to wild type UvrB (1.40 μmol/min/mg). In this respect, B. caldotenax UvrB resembles E. coliUvrB that has a cryptic ATPase activity. It has been shown that full ATPase activity of UvrB requires the presence of both UvrA and DNA (33Caron P.R. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10891-10902Google Scholar). Our data show that the ATPase activity of Δβh UvrB is not affected by deletion of the β-hairpin motif. In fact, in the presence of UV-irradiated DNA, the ATPase activity of the UvrA2ΔβhUvrB complex is higher than that of the UvrA2 wt UvrB complex (29, 22 μmol/min/mg, respectively). This is further evidence that UvrA and Δβh UvrB interact, as was suggested from our previous experiments (gel mobility shifts, CD spectra, helicase assay). The deletion of the β-hairpin does not interfere with the ATP hydrolysis by UvrB in the UvrA2B complex, but apparently the free energy of hydrolysis is not coupled to proper processing of the DNA that is necessary for UvrC binding and incision.Table IATPase activity of B. caldotenax UvrA, and UvrBSamplesATPase activityμmol of ATP hydrolyzed/μmol of protein/minUvrA13.2 ± 0.6UvrA + UV ↯>DNA17.0 ± 1.0UvrB1.4 ± 0.1UvrB + UV ↯>DNA1.4 ± 0.1UvrA + UvrB18.3 ± 1.1UvrA + UvrB + UV ↯>DNA22.0 ± 0.5Δβh UvrB2.8 ± 0.1UvrA + Δβh UvrB19.0 ± 0.6UvrA + Δβh UvrB + UV ↯>DNA29.0 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONMutational analysis of UvrB has not yet identified which parts of UvrB are involved in DNA binding (reviewed in Ref. 28Theis K. Skorvaga M. Machius M. Nakagawa N. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Google Scholar). One complication is that UvrB has an ATPase activity that is stimulated by DNA binding and is necessary for the formation of the pre-incision complex. Thus, defects of UvrB mutants defective in DNA binding might be due to defects in ATP binding/hydrolysis and vice versa. So far, mutants characterized for both properties showed either inactivation of both or no effect on either. Most of the mutations that affect DNA binding are located in the six highly conserved sequence motifs found in helicases of superfamily I and II. In a previous report (25Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Google Scholar) we presented a three-dimensional structure of the UvrB protein from the thermophilic bacterium B. caldotenax. The crystal structure of B. caldotenax UvrB has a significant level of similarity with that of helicase NS3 (34Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 89-100Google Scholar). By superposition of B. caldotenax UvrB with the helicase domains of NS3 complexed with DNA, we have hypothesized a model for the UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex, which has a pivotal role in the mechanism of damage recognition by the UvrABC system. In our model we propose a padlock-like binding mode of UvrB to wrap around one DNA strand by inserting a β-hairpin between the two strands of DNA (28Theis K. Skorvaga M. Machius M. Nakagawa N. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Google Scholar).To test our model and investigate the functional role of the β-hairpin motif, we constructed a β-hairpin deletion mutant (Δβh UvrB) in which residues 97–112 are replaced by a glycine, removing the tip of the β-hairpin. Data presented here show that the β-hairpin deletion mutant 1) is greatly reduced in its ability to support incision, 2) is unable to bind to a damage-containing duplex, 3) cannot destabilize a damage-containing 26-mer, and 4) has retained the ability to hydrolyze ATP in a UvrA and damaged DNA-dependent manner. Thus, functions of UvrB required for the formation of the UvrB-DNA complex, namely UvrA binding and ATP hydrolysis, are not disrupted in the deletion mutant. Nevertheless, Δβh UvrB is unable to form a stable complex with DNA, strongly suggesting that the deleted residues are directly involved in DNA binding.During the late 1980s and early 1990s Grossman and co-workers developed a “helicase scanning model” of damage recognition (6Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3638-3642Google Scholar, 7Oh E.Y. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1336-1343Google Scholar, 8Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Google Scholar). In this model, UvrA2B can displace short oligonucleotides and also generate negative and positive supercoiled DNA as it migrates through the helix in search of damage. It was predicted that the helicase machine will stall at a lesion. However, UV was found to stimulate the negative/positive supercoiling, inconsistent with this earlier model (8Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Google Scholar).Because of these discrepancies Gordienko and Rupp (11Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 889-895Google Scholar) developed a “damage-processing model” in which damage clearly increased the displacement of oligonucleotides (11Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 889-895Google Scholar). In this model UvrA2B finds damage by random diffusion. Once a lesion is encountered, the affinity of UvrA for DNA and UvrB is somehow weakened, and the dissociation of UvrA results in a UvrB-DNA complex. The DNA in this complex is greatly distorted, and it is believed that it is this step that requires ATP binding/hydrolysis to allow UvrB to facilitate cleavage upon UvrC binding. It is important to note that although these experiments have described the activity of UvrA2B as helicase-like, the DNA in these complexes is only destablized and not fully dissociated. In agreement with these results, we show here that the release of the 26-mer containing the damage does not occur until the addition of the loading buffer containing SDS. Because UvrC can still incise the destabilized strand, these results are inconsistent with a true helicase activity in which the strand is fully displaced from the complement strand. Our results in Fig. 7 demonstrate that deletion of the β-hairpin inhibits the helix destabilization step.The pre-incision complex between UvrB and damaged DNA is a key intermediate in excision repair linking damage recognition to the location of dual incision. Once the pre-incision complex is formed UvrB has to remain bound tightly to the DNA without translocating, ensuring precise incisions by UvrC and subsequent removal of the damaged fragment. In contrast to many non-sequence specific protein-DNA complexes, the UvrB-DNA pre-incision complex does not dissociate at high ionic strength, suggesting a hydrophobic mode of DNA binding. It has been suggested that UvrB might form favorable hydrophobic interactions with aromatic amino acid side chains and the DNA bases; however, this has never been directly determined (35Van Houten B. Snowden A. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 51-59Google Scholar) and awaits the solution of a co-crystal structure.We hypothesize that there are five critical regions in UvrB that are necessary and sufficient for DNA damage binding and processing: 1) a damage recognition pocket located at the base of the β-hairpin; 2) a flexible β-hairpin, which acts as a padlock to secure the non-damaged strand in place; 3) an ATP binding site, which facilitates conformational changes in UvrB; 4) the coiled-coiled C terminus of UvrB, which interacts with UvrC; and finally, 5) residues in domain 3 that contain helicase motifs IV-VI which help drive a conformational change in the DNA, leading to incision. How might the β-hairpin motif participate in allowing UvrB to bind and process damage? In our padlock DNA binding model of UvrB, the β-hairpin must first open to accept a strand of DNA and then close to lock one DNA strand; we favor the non-damaged strand, forming a stable UvrB-DNA interaction. Taking a closer look at the anatomy of the β-hairpin reveals four critical regions, three of which were removed in the Δβh mutant. The tip of the β-hairpin is hydrophobic in character and interacts with hydrophobic residues in domain Ib. Two salt bridges located in the middle of the hairpin provide further strength to the lock. Preserved in the Δβh mutant is an aromatic base containing several Tyr and Phe residues that are 100% conserved in all bacterial species examined to date. We propose that these residues are part of the damage recognition pocket. However, the interaction energy of these residues with the damaged strand without the strong padlock holding onto the non-damaged strand are apparently insufficient to provide sufficient binding energy in the Δβh mutant for producti"

In yeast, this adaptation involves phosphorylation of the translation eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2α by the kinase GCN2. This leads to the increased translation of the transcription factor GCN4, which in turn increases transcription of amino acid biosynthetic genes, at a time when expression of most genes decreases. Here it is shown that translation of the arginine/lysine transporter cat-1 mRNA increases during amino acid starvation of mammalian cells. This increase requires both GCN2 phosphorylation of eIF2α and the translation of a 48-amino acid upstream open reading frame (uORF) present within the 5′-leader of the transporter mRNA. When this 5′-leader was placed in a bicistronic mRNA expression vector, it functioned as an internal ribosomal entry sequence and its regulated activity was dependent on uORF translation. Amino acid starvation also induced translation of monocistronic mRNAs containing the cat-1 5′-leader, in a manner dependent on eIF2α phosphorylation and translation of the 48-amino acid uORF. This is the first example of mammalian regulation of internal ribosomal entry sequence-mediated translation by eIF2α phosphorylation during amino acid starvation, suggesting that the mechanism of induced Cat-1 protein synthesis is part of the adaptive response of cells to amino acid limitation.

Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, stress-response proteins are synthesized under conditions when global protein synthesis is inhibited (2Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An adaptive response to amino acid starvation for any single amino acid has been extensively characterized in yeast; translation of the transcription factor GCN4 increases during total or single amino acid starvation, causing a transcriptional induction of the amino acid biosynthetic genes (2Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell.

Yeast have developed a sophisticated mechanism to increase translation of the GCN4 mRNA when eIF2α is phosphorylated and levels of eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAMet ternary complexes decrease (6Hinnebusch A.G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 21: 277-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); initiation at the GCN4 ORF is inversely related to the concentration of ternary complexes in the cell (5Hinnebusch A.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The regulatory system that mediates the response of yeast to amino acid starvation is known as a general amino acid control mechanism. Mammalian cells have also developed an adaptive response to changes in amino acid availability (7Laine R.O. Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 219-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given that essential amino acids have to be transported into cells via membrane-spanning amino acid transporter proteins, part of the adaptive response involves the increased expression of amino acid biosynthetic and transporter genes (8Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 305-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A significant part of this adaptive response is the increased expression of the cationic amino acid transporter 1 gene (cat-1), the main transporter of the essential amino acids arginine and lysine (9Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that amino acid starvation induces the stability (10Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol.

This report demonstrates that the mechanism of increased translation of the cat-1 mRNA by amino acid limitation shares features with the general amino acid control mechanism as described in yeast. All the cat-15′-UTR-containing bicistronic mRNA expression vectors were generated by PCR amplification of the cat-1 5′-UTR cDNAs using the SalI/NcoI site of the pSVCAT/ICS/LUC plasmid (12Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) by replacing the ICS DNA sequence. The plasmids containing the hairpin were constructed by replacing the ICS within the pSVhpCAT/ICS/LUC (12Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) vector, at the SalI/NcoI sites. The cat-1 5′-UTRf mutants were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis. The mutf-stop was generated by mutating the uORF stop codon (Fig. 1A, TGA to TTA within thecat-1 5′-UTRf) thus placing the uORF/ATG in frame with the LUC start codon. The mutf-start was generated by mutating the uORF/ATG from ATG to TTG within thecat-1 5′-UTRf and cat-15′-UTRt DNAs. The cat-1 5′-UTRf andcat-1 5′-UTRt have an NcoI site at the 3′ end, which contains the start codon ATG for the LUC cistron. The context of the A+1TG LUC/start codon within the mutf-stop and mutf-start vectors is AGCGCCCA+1TG (compare this sequence with Fig.1A). The monocistronic expression vectors, cat-15′-UTRf/LUC and cat-15′-UTRmutf/LUC, were generated by cloning theSalI/XbaI cat-15′-UTRf/LUC and cat-1 5′-UTRmutf/LUC fragments from the bicistronic vectors into theEcoRI/XbaI site of the pUHD10–3 vector. In this vector, transcription is directed by the minimal cytomegalovirus promoter (13Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). The EcoRI cloning site is 76 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site (13Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for the PERK, PERK-mut, GCN2, eIF2α S-A, and eIF2α S-D were kindly provided by D. Ron (New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY). All vectors contained the corresponding inserts within theXbaI/HindIII site of pCDNA3. In this vector, transcription is directed by the cytomegalovirus promoter and the selectable marker gene was replaced with the CD2 cell surface marker gene (14Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The GCN2mut expression vector contained the GCN2mut cDNA (15Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D.A. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) within the same vector system as the rest. All cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (CON). Plasmid DNA was transfected into C6 rat glioma cells using the calcium phosphate technique (9Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cotransfections were performed with equimolar amounts of plasmid DNA. Amino acid-fed (F) cells were incubated in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with FBS dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (9Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Amino acid-starved cells (S) were incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer supplemented with dialyzed FBS (9Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). No difference in the regulation of the cat-1 gene by amino acid starvation was observed when Krebs-Ringer buffer containing all amino acids was used in place of DMEM/F-12 medium (9Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19951-19957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Treatments were performed by culturing cells (5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) for 48 h in growth medium followed by culture under fed or starved conditions for the appropriate times. Thapsigargin was added to 400 nm as described (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Stable C6-GCN2-mut cell lines were generated by transfecting the GCN2-mut-containing expression vector and aneo-expressing vector in a molar ratio of 10:1. Mass cultures were generated from cells selected in 0.1% G418. RNA was isolated from transfected cells with the bicistronic mRNA expression vectors and analyzed by Northern blotting using a LUC-specific hybridization probe. The correct size RNAs for the full-length bicistronic transcripts were observed for all vectors tested in this study. Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for LUC (Tropix luciferase assay kit) and CAT activities as described previously (17Leahy P. Crawford D.R. Grossman G. Gronostajski R.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8813-8822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The activities were normalized to the protein content of the cell extracts, which was measured using the Bio-Rad DC assay. Expression of the eIF2αs was evaluated as described in detail previously (18Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells at 36 h after transfection were incubated with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) and cell extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer. Equal amounts of protein extracts were analyzed on an SDS-acrylamide gel and prepared for autoradiography. Details of the phosphorylation status of the eIF2αs and regulation of translation have been described (18Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar,19Choi S.Y. Scherer B.J. Schnier J. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. Hershey J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 286-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The previously described leader (5′-UTR) for thecat-1 mRNA was 224 bases (cat-15′-UTRt) and was incomplete (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, this truncatedcat-1 5′ UTRt functioned as an IRES and was regulated by amino acid starvation (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To further study this regulation, a full-length 5′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA was obtained by isolating a rat genomic DNA clone that contained the promoter region, the first exon, and the first intron of thecat-1 gene. 2J. Fernandez, R. Mishra, A. Aulak, D. Robinson, and M. Hatzoglou, manuscript in preparation. The transcription start site was determined in C6 cells (data not shown). This full-length UTR (Fig. 1A,cat-1 5′-UTRf) consists of exon 1 (154 nucleotides, in blue), exon 2 (98 nucleotides, in red), and the 5′ end of exon 3 (18 nucleotides, in red). An interesting feature of thecat-1 5′-UTR is the presence of a uORF. Bothcat-1 5′-UTRt and cat-15′-UTRf contained a 48-amino acid uORF, starting 46 bases 3′ to the mRNA cap site (Fig. 1, A andB). The ability of the cat-1 5′-UTRf sequence to mediate internal translation initiation was tested in a bicistronic expression vector (12Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In these vectors (Fig.2A), the CAT enzyme is translated from the first cistron by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism (12Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The second cistron, encoding the firefly LUC enzyme, is efficiently translated only if it is preceded by an IRES in the intercistronic spacer region (Fig. 2A). Translation of the second cistron should be independent of translation of the first cistron. A vector that contained a stable RNA hairpin (hp) upstream of the CAT cistron (Fig. 2A) was used to demonstrate that when translation of the CAT cistron is inhibited, translation of the LUC cistron is unaffected. Two bicistronic expression vectors were generated by introducing the cat-1 5′-UTRf into the intercistronic space of the empty expression vector: CAT/cat-1 5′-UTRf/LUC and hpCAT/cat-15′-UTRf/LUC (Fig. 2A). The LUC/CAT ratio was 20-fold higher for the hpCAT/cat-1 5′ UTRf/LUC when compared with the CAT/cat-1 5′-UTRf/LUC. C6 cells were transiently transfected with these vectors, and LUC and CAT activities were analyzed. This increase was because of decreased CAT and sustained LUC activities in the hairpin-containing vector (data not shown). These data demonstrated that the full-length cat-15′-UTRf leader has IRES activity. Transfection of these vectors into C6 cells demonstrated that translational control mediated by the full-length cat-1 5′-UTRf was indistinguishable (data not shown) to the previously tested truncatedcat-1 5′-UTRt (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Notice that bothcat-1 5′-UTRf and cat-15′-UTRt contain the uORF (Fig. 1). The following studies have been performed using both the truncated (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the full-length (Fig. 2A) UTRs within the bicistronic expression vectors (12Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that cat-1 5′-UTRt/IRES-mediated translation increased during amino acid starvation (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the kinetics of induction of IRES-mediated translation during amino acid starvation were different from the kinetics of induction of eIF2α phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of eIF2α transiently increased during the first hour of amino acid starvation (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereascat-1 IRES-mediated translation increased between 6 and 12 h and declined thereafter (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that eIF2α phosphorylation does not directly regulate cat-1IRES activity. This is in contrast to the regulation of theGCN4 and other mammalian mRNAs (5Hinnebusch A.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). In these cases, mRNA translation increases at the time when eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAMet ternary complexes decrease (5Hinnebusch A.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In yeast, uncharged tRNAs, which accumulate in cells depleted by any single amino acid, bind to and activate the yeast GCN2 cellular kinase, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2α and translational control (21Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2697-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To gain an insight on the involvement of eIF2α phosphorylation on the increased cat-1 mRNA translation during amino acid starvation, the regulation of cat-1 IRES-mediated translation by individual amino acids was studied in C6 cells. Depletion of any single essential amino acid increased cat-1IRES activity with the same kinetics and to the same degree as described for total amino acid starvation (Fig. 2B and TableI). This is in agreement with translational control of the GCN4 mRNA by amino acid depletion (2Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and supports the hypothesis that eIF2α phosphorylation is involved indirectly in cat-1 IRES translational control.Table IAbsolute values of LUC and CAT activities from experiments described in Fig. 2ExperimentsCATLUCLUC/CATunits/μg proteinunits/μg proteinExp. from Fig. 2B Control97 ± 498 ± 191.0 ± 0.2 -Arg73 ± 2993 ± 4613 ± 0.3 -Cys56 ± 6998 ± 8017 ± 2.4 -His57 ± 6974 ± 10017 ± 2.0 -Ile64 ± 21061 ± 3916 ± 1.0 -Leu59 ± 31016 ± 6317 ± 0.8 -Lys57 ± 3903 ± 9916 ± 0.1 -Met56 ± 2925 ± 9516 ± 1.1 -Phe59 ± 4923 ± 2715 ± 0.6 -Thr61 ± 31036 ± 10717 ± 1.7 -Trp58 ± 1943 ± 4216 ± 0.6 -Tyr64 ± 41120 ± 6518 ± 1.0 -Val55 ± 4871 ± 8516 ± 0.5Exp. from Fig. 2C ControlFed72 ± 3158 ± 282.2 ± 0.4Starved49 ± 61341 ± 25428 ± 6.8 GCN2Fed73 ± 9119 ± 361.7 ± 0.5Starved50 ± 31950 ± 21139 ± 2.5 GCN2-mutFed74 ± 1186 ± 161.2 ± 0.1Starved57 ± 2166 ± 332.9 ± 0.6 PERKFed69 ± 16190 ± 122.8 ± 0.4Starved42 ± 21478 ± 37134 ± 8.1 PERK-mutFed77 ± 6103 ± 161.3 ± 0.2Starved59 ± 3795 ± 13613 ± 2.2 PKR+/+Fed31 ± 3247 ± 558.0 ± 0.7Starved22 ± 21048 ± 7247 ± 1.8 PKR0/0Fed32 ± 2232 ± 277.2 ± 0.5Starved20 ± 1925 ± 7546 ± 4.5 Open table in a new tab We therefore tested whether eIF2α phosphorylation and mammalian GCN2 kinase activation are involved in cat-1 IRES activation during amino acid starvation. To test this hypothesis, C6 cells were transfected with the bicistronic expression vector containing thecat-1 5′-UTRt along with expression vectors expressing either the wild type mammalian GCN2 kinase (22Berlanga J.J.

Therefore, activation of the endogenous wild type GCN2 (23Sood R. Porter A.C. Ma K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) is inhibited, leading to inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation by amino acid starvation. The transfected wild type and mutant GCN2 kinases contained the FLAG epitope (15Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D.A. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which allowed us to monitor expression of the mutant proteins by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Following 36 h of transfection, cells were incubated in either amino acid-containing (F) or amino acid-depleted (S) medium for 9 h as described previously (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As shown, expression of the mutant kinase inhibitedcat-1 IRES activation by amino acid starvation (Fig.2C, compare the -fold change of the ratio LUC/CAT). Induction in LUC activity was 9-fold for control, 15-fold for the GCN2 wild type, and 2-fold for GCN2 mutant-expressing cells (Table I). The increases in LUC/CAT ratios were 13-, 21-, and 2.5-fold respectively (Fig. 2C and Table I). The CAT activity decreased by 30% (Table I). When the bicistronic cat-15′-UTRf-containing mRNA was tested, regulation of translation of the LUC cistron was indistinguishable from thecat-1 5′-UTRt (data not shown). It was concluded that cat-1 IRES translational activation by amino acid starvation depends on GCN2 activity. However, these experiments were transient transfections and did not allow the evaluation of the degree of eIF2α phosphorylation by amino acid starvation in cells expressing the mutant GCN2 kinase. This was demonstrated in a stable C6 cell line that expressed the mutant GCN2 kinase (Fig.3A). Amino acid starvation of this cell line caused a small increase in phospho-eIF2α levels (phospho-eIF2α levels increased 3-fold in control (data not shown) and 1.4-fold in GCN2-mut cells). However, cat-1IRES-mediated translation did not increase (Fig. 3B and Table II). The ability of eIF2α to be phosphorylated in the GCN2-mut cells was tested by treating them with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-causing agent thapsigargin. As expected (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), thapsigargin treatment of cells induced eIF2α phosphorylation by 3-fold (Fig. 3A). The expression of the GCN2 mutant kinase decreased during the time course of amino acid starvation, as was expected, because of the decreased cap-dependent translation of the GCN2-mut mRNA (Fig.3A). 4E-BP-1 is dephosphorylated during the time course of amino acid starvation, thus decreasing cap-dependent translation by sequestering the cap-binding protein eIF4E (Fig.3A). However, expression of the mutant kinase is critical the first hour of amino acid starvation when the endogenous GCN2 kinase is activated (15Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D.A. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphorylates eIF2α. At 1 h of amino acid starvation, the mutant kinase was expressed at the same level as in amino acid-fed cells (Fig. 3A). These data further demonstrate that decreasing cap-dependent translation is not the cause for increased cat-1 IRES-activation. This is in agreement with our previous finding that treatment of cells with rapamycin did not alter cat-1 IRES-mediated translation (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that eIF2α phosphorylation by the GCN2 kinase is required for increased cat-1 IRES-mediated translation by amino acid starvation. This finding is in agreement with the regulation of translation of the yeast GCN4 mRNA by the yeast GCN2 kinase (5Hinnebusch A.G. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the yeast paradigm, eIF2α phosphorylation regulates cat-1 IRES-mediated translation indirectly.Table IIAbsolute values of LUC and CAT activities from experiments described in Fig. 3Fig. 3BexperimentCATLUCLUC/CATunits/μg proteinunits/μg proteincat-1 5′-UTRf CON412 ± 56772 ± 1241.9 ± 0.1 S3405 ± 14970 ± 232.3 ± 0.1 S6397 ± 241246 ± 463.1 ± 0.0 S9410 ± 271037 ± 732.5 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab At least four kinases are known to phosphorylate eIF2α: GCN2, PERK, PKR, and HRI (24de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To determine the specific requirement for GCN2, the ER stress-induced ER-resident transmembrane kinase PERK (16)was tested. We transfected C6 cells with the bicistronic mRNA expression vector that contained the cat-1 5′-UTRt along with expression vectors expressing either the wild type PERK (14Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) or a mutant PERK, which lacked kinase activity (14Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). As with GCN2, overexpression of the mutant kinase forms dimers with the wild type PERK; however, this should not affect the activation of GCN2 by amino acid starvation. The expression of the mutant kinase was monitored by Western blot analysis of cell extracts prepared from transfected cells using an antibody against a Myc epitope (14Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) that was contained at the NH2 terminus of the kinase (data not shown). The levels of the mutant PERK kinase were sustained at the same level for the first 6 h of amino acid starvation and gradually declined thereafter (data not shown). Following 36 h of transfection, cells were incubated in either amino acid-fed or amino acid-starved medium for 9 h as described previously (11Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Expression of the PERK kinases did not affect induction of cat-1 IRES activity by amino acid starvation (Fig. 2C, compare the -fold change of the ratio LUC/CAT in PERK and PERK-mut cells). Amino acid starvation increased the LUC activity by 8-fold and decreased the CAT activity by 35 and 25%, respectively, in PERK wild type- and PERK mutant-expressing cells (Table I). The LUC/CAT ratio increased 12-fold for the PERK and 11-fold for the PERK-mut cells (Fig. 2C). It should be noted that the expression of the mutant PERK kinase decreased basal cat-1 IRES activity. This was because of a decrease in basal eIF2α phosphorylation levels in these cells (data not shown). The involvement of the PKR eIF2α kinase was tested next. PKR is activated by binding double-stranded RNA (25Clemens M.J. Bommer U.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To address the role of the PKR kinase, mouse embryo fibroblasts that either expressed the endogenous PKR kinase (PKR+/+) or had the kinase inactivated (PKR0/0) by homologous recombination were used (27Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). cat-1 IRES-mediated translation was measured following 9 h of amino acid starvation. The basal activity for LUC and CAT were similar in PKR+/+ and PKR0/0 cells (Fig.2C and Table I). Amino acid starvation of cells induced the LUC activity by 4-fold and decreased the CAT by 40% in both cell lines (Fig. 2C and Table I). The LUC/CAT ratio increased 6-fold in the PKR+/+ and 5.5-fold in the PKR0/0 cells (Fig. 2C). The increase of cat-1 IRES activity was lower than C6 cells (4-fold as compared with 7-fold in C6 cells). The lower induction in PKR cells may be because of cell type differences. The latter is supported by the fact that the basal LUC activity in PKR cells was 4-fold higher than the equivalent in C6 cells (Table I). These data suggest that eIF2α phosphorylation andcat-1 IRES translational induction during amino acid starvation depend on GCN2 activation. To further demonstrate that phosphorylation of eIF2α is required for cat-1 IRES activation, we overexpressed an eIF2α that can either not be phosphorylated (Ser-51 changed to Ala) or mim"

The calcium pools can be induced to release Ca2+ via two main types of calcium channel receptor: the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the ryanodine receptor. Starfish oocytes have often been used to study intracellular calcium mobilization during oocyte maturation and fertilization, but how the intracellular calcium channels contribute to intracellular calcium mobilization has never been understood fully, because these molecules have not been identified and no specific inhibitors of these channels have ever been found. In this study, we utilized a novel IP3R antagonist, the “IP3 sponge,” to investigate the role of IP3 during fertilization of the starfish oocyte. The IP3 sponge strongly and specifically competed with endogenous IP3R for binding to IP3. By injecting IP3 sponge into starfish oocyte, the increase in intracellular calcium and formation of the fertilization envelope were both dramatically blocked, although oocyte maturation was not blocked. To investigate the role of IP3R in the starfish oocyte more precisely, we cloned IP3R from the ovary of starfish, and the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that the starfish IP3R has 58–68% identity to mammalian IP3R types 1, 2, and 3. We then raised antibodies that recognize starfish IP3R, and use of the antibodies to perform immunoblot analysis revealed that the level of expression of IP3R remained unchanged throughout oocyte maturation.

This rise in Ca2+ is essential to the stimulation of many subsequent events in egg activation, including exocytosis of cortical granules (which establish polyspermy blocks), and reentry of the egg into the meiotic cell cycle. Ca2+ can be released from internal stores via two main types of calcium channel receptors: (i) the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R),1 which is responsive to the second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and (ii) the ryanodine receptor (RyR), which is insensitive to IP3 but can be stimulated by calcium or other agents, including ryanodine, caffeine, and the naturally occurring metabolite cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose. Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate is also known to release Ca2+ from internal stores in sea urchin eggs (4Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M.

Kline D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the effects of heparin are difficult to interpret because of its lack of specificity. In some studies, heparin has been found to reduce ryanodine-induced (25Sardet C. Speksnijder J. Terasaki M. Chang P. Development. 1992; 115: 221-237PubMed Google Scholar) and cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose-induced (26Shen S.S. Buck W.R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) Ca2+ release, and heparin has been reported to inhibit cortical granule exocytosis even after a Ca2+ rise of near normal amplitude has occurred (27Buck W.R. Rakow T.L. Shen S.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, frog eggs injected with ∼300 μg/ml heparin have been reported to often exhibit splotchy pigmentation characteristic of unhealthy eggs (23Nucitelli R. Yim D.L. Smart T. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 18A10, which binds to the carboxyl terminus of IP3R and specifically inhibits IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR), provides a more specific approach. In hamster eggs, complete inhibition was obtained with more than 100 μg/ml IP3R antibody 18A10, whereas 200∼800 μg/ml heparin only partially inhibited Ca2+ release during fertilization (28Miyazaki S. Yuzaki M. Nakada K. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1992; 257: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). However, 18A10 does not always cross-react with IP3Rs from other species, because it was raised against mouse IP3R1 (mIP3R1) and its epitope is not conserved well among all the reported IP3Rs of different species and types. In fact, we have confirmed by immunoblot analysis that 18A10 does not recognize starfish IP3R (data not shown). In this study, we used a novel IP3R antagonist, the “IP3 sponge,” which we recently developed to identify the physiological role of IP3R in starfish oocytes (29Yoshikawa F. Uchiyama T. Iwasaki H. Tomomori-Satoh C. Tanaka T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 2T. Uchiyama, F. Yoshikawa, A. Hishida, T. Furuichi, and K. Mikoshiba, submitted for publication. IP3R is composed of three major functional domains: an N-terminal ligand-binding domain, a modulatory domain in the middle, and a transmembrane domain near the C terminus (30Mignery G.A. Südhof T.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 31Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryo Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we found that amino acids (aa) 226–578 of mIP3R1 are the core region for IP3 binding and that the bacterially expressed aa 224–604 has markedly higher binding affinity than aa 1–604 (29Yoshikawa F. Uchiyama T. Iwasaki H. Tomomori-Satoh C. Tanaka T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).2 Although the IP3 binding core region of aa 224–604 was not efficiently expressed as a soluble active form, this problem was overcome by N-terminal fusion of aa 224–604 with glutathione S-transferase. The resulting fusion protein was called “G224.” G224 showed high IP3binding activity, approximately ∼1000 times greater than that of endogenous IP3R in mouse cerebellar microsomes (see Fig. 1and “Experimental Procedures”).2 G224 strongly, specifically, and dose-dependently competed with endogenous IP3R for binding to IP3. We therefore decided to call G224 the “IP3 sponge,” because it blocked IICR by absorbing IP3. Fully grown immature starfish oocytes have a large nucleus called the “germinal vesicle” (GV) and are arrested at the first meiotic prophase. The prophase arrest is released in response to a starfish maturation-inducing hormone, 1-methyladenine (1-MA), which acts on the oocyte surface (32Kanatani H. Shirai H. Nakanishi K. Kurosawa T. Nature. 1969; 221: 273-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). At 20 °C, germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD; nuclear disassembly), a sign of resumption of meiosis reinitiation, occurs ∼20 min after application of 1-MA. After GVBD, oocytes acquire increased sensitivity to sperm and IP3, which results in a release of calcium from intracellular stores and a rise in intracellular free calcium (16Chiba K. Kado R.T. Jaffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We expressed IP3 sponge inEscherichia coli and injected it into immature starfish oocytes to investigate the role of IP3R during oocyte maturation and fertilization. Moreover, to identify the role of IP3R in starfish more precisely, we cloned the starfish IP3R cDNA and used the predicted amino acid sequence of starfish IP3R to raise antibodies that recognize the receptor and to investigate the level of expression of IP3R during oocyte maturation. We also examined immunocytochemistry to investigate changes in localization of the IP3R in oocytes during maturation. Starfish Asterina pectinifera were collected on the Pacific coast of Honshu and kept in a laboratory aquarium supplied with circulating sea water at 17 °C. In this paper we use the term “oocyte” to refer to fully grown immature oocytes at meiotic prophase and “egg” to refer to the maturing oocytes after GVBD stimulated with 1-MA to resume meiosis. 1-MA was obtained from Sigma and used at 1–2 μm. Isolated ovaries were incubated in ice-cold calcium-free sea water to remove follicle cells, and the oocytes released were washed twice in ice-cold calcium-free sea water and stored in artificial sea water at 20 °C. Sperm were collected from an excised testis and stored on ice without dilution. Except as noted, the sperm were diluted with artificial sea water (106times volume of the testis extract) before addition to the chamber containing the eggs. Preparation of the IP3 sponge was described elsewhere (29Yoshikawa F. Uchiyama T. Iwasaki H. Tomomori-Satoh C. Tanaka T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).2 Briefly, to express N-terminal fused proteins of residues 224–604 of mIP3R1 with the glutathione S-transferase gene, the cDNA that encodes aa 224–604 of mIP3R1 was amplified by PCR by using pET-1–604 (29Yoshikawa F. Uchiyama T. Iwasaki H. Tomomori-Satoh C. Tanaka T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as a template and subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Site-directed mutagenesis of K508A was introduced by two-step PCR, as described elsewhere (33Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18227-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant proteins inE. coli was carried out by the low temperature method (33Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18227-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and purification of these proteins with glutathione-Sepharose CL4B beads was done according to the manufacturer's method (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were then applied to a PD-10 column containing Sephadex G-25 m (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with elution buffer (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2). Protein concentration was determined using a kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard and adjusted to a concentration of 2 mg/ml with elution buffer. The volume injected was 5% of the oocyte volume (oocyte volume was ∼3 nl). The concentrations of IP3 sponge, GST-m30, and GST in cytoplasm were ∼1.5, 1.5, and 3 μm, respectively. The injection was made with a micropipette with an oil-filled constriction connected to a syringe (34Kiehart D.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 25: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 35Kishimoto T. Methods Cell Biol. 1988; 27: 379-394Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The oocytes were held between two coverslips separated by two pieces of double-stick tape during the microinjection and the observation period (36Chiba K. Tadenuma H. Matsumoto M. Takahashi K. Katada T. Hoshi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). IP3 was dissolved in 100 mm potassium aspartate, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, at a series of concentrations ranging from 10−7 to 10−4m. The injected volume was 1% of the cell volume. The fluorescence from an oocyte injected with 1 mm Fura2-dextran was collected with a ×20, 0.5 N.A. objective and focused onto a photomultiplier (Nikon, P1) mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope; excitation filters at 360 ± 10 and 380 ± 10 nm, dichroic beam splitter at 400 nm, and long pass emission filters at 420 and 450 nm were used. Fura-2 fluorescence was observed at 20 °C by exciting Fura-2 at 380 nm. Fura-2 fluorescence induced by excitation at 360 nm was observed both at the beginning and at the end of the observation period to calibrate bleaching of the dye. Total RNA from starfish ovary was purified on an RNeasy column (Qiagen-GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). The degenerate oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: 5′-1 (5′-GTT(T/C)CAIGC(T/C)GA(A/G)CA(A/G)GA(A/G)AA(A/G)TT-3′) and 3′-1a (5′-G(T/C)TTIGC(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TA(T/C)TC(T/C)TG(A/G)TT(T/C)TT-3′) plus 3′-1b (5′-G(T/C)TTIGC(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TG(T/C)TC(T/C)TG(A/G)TT(T/C)TT-3′); 5′-2 (5′-GAA(A/G)AA(T/C)GTITA(T/C)ACIGA(A/G)AT(T/C/A)AA(A/G)TG-3′) and 3′-2 (5′-G(A/G)TA(A/G/T)AT(T/C)TC(T/C)TTCA(T/C)TCIAC(T/C)TCIGT(A/G)TC-3′); 5′-3 (5′-GGA(A/G)TA(T/C)TG(T/C)CA(A/G)GGICCITG(T/C)CA(T/C)GA(A/G)AA(T/C)CA-3′ and 3′-3 (5′-G(A/G)TCIGC(A/G)AAIGT(A/G)TC(A/G/T)AT(A/G/T)ATIACICC(A/G)AA-3′), as described in the legend to Fig. 6A.Figure 6Primary structure of starfishIP3R.

The thermocycler was programmed for 94 °C denaturation for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 45 s, 50 °C annealing for 45 s, and 72 °C extension for 1 min. The final cycle was followed by an additional extension at 72 °C for 6 min. These products were subcloned into the T/A vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced with the dideoxy method. Other pairs of primers used to clone the residual parts of IP3R were 5′-0.5 (5′-CCACCAAA(A/G)AA(A/G)TT(C/T)AGAGA-3′) and 3′-0.5 (5′-CCTCAGGAAGATGTAGCTCT-3′), 5′-1.5 (5′-GCATTCTCAGGCTGTCACAG-3′) and 3′-1.5 (5′-TCCAGTGGTAGCAGGGAGTG-3′), and 5′-2.5 (5′-GGAGGATGCCTACATCAACT-3′) and 3′-2.5 (5′-TTGATGTCGTTCAGTATGAG-3′), as described in the legend to Fig. 6A. PCR was performed using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The thermocycler was programmed for 94 °C denaturation for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 15 s, 50 °C annealing for 30 s, and 68 °C extension for 3 min. The final cycle was followed by an additional extension at 68 °C for 7 min. These products were subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBlueScript KS (−) (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). 5′- and 3′-untranslated region were isolated with the 5′-RACE System for Amplification of cDNA Ends, version 2.0 (Invitrogen) and the 3′-RACE System for Amplification of cDNA Ends (Invitrogen), respectively. The gene-specific primers used were as follows: 5′-RACE gene-specific primer-1, 5′-CTCTTGCTCAGCATGGAAGA-3′; 5′-RACE gene-specific primer-2, 5′-TCTTCTCTAGCAAGGCTGGT-3′; 3′-RACE gene-specific primer-1, 5′-TACCAACACCTGGGTGCATA-3′; 3′-RACE gene-specific primer-2, and 5′-TGCTCTGACAGCCTGAGAAT-3′, as described in the legend to Fig.6A. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to amino acid residues 595–604 of mIP3R1 (LAEDTITALLHNNRK) (37Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 328-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The peptide was coupled via an additional N-terminal cysteine to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with the cross-linking reagentm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. Mice (C3HB6, female, 6 weeks) were used to raise monoclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide based on the sequence of amino acid residues 2684–2698 of starfish IP3R (INLLSSPSIPQMGGP). The peptide was coupled via an additional N-terminal cysteine to mouse albumin with the cross-linking agentm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. Splenocytes from immunized mice were fused to PAI (BALB/c mouse-derived myeloma) to produce a hybridoma. The hybridoma cells were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and positive cells were diluted to a single clone. Antibody classes were identified with a mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit RPN29 (Amersham Biosciences). A 30-fold volume of SDS sample buffer was added to pellets of defolliculated immature oocytes and mature eggs, and the specimens were heated for 15 min at 55 °C. Samples of the specimens were subjected to 5% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli's method (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins in the gel were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated in 5% skim milk (Snow Brand, Sapporo, Japan) dissolved in PBS-Tween 20 (0.1%) for 2 h, and then incubated with monoclonal antibody (culture supernatant of hybridoma) overnight at 4 °C. After washing the membrane with PBS-Tween 20, it was exposed to the secondary antibody (1:1000; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin from donkey; Amersham Biosciences), and the labeled bands were identified on x-ray film using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The density of each band was analyzed by LAS-1000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Oocytes were treated with 0.02% Pronase (Kaken Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) at 20 °C in artificial sea water and washed several times with ice-cold Ca2+-free artificial sea water to remove the vitelline membrane. The oocytes were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and permeabilized with PBS-Triton X-100 (0.1%). Sperm nuclei were stained by staining the inseminated eggs with 0.1 μg/ml DAPI for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. The starfish IP3R was immunostained by using the polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution) described above as the primary antibody subsequently after blocking with 2% of normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (from goat) (Cappel, Organon Teknika Corp., West Chester, PA) was used as the secondary antibody. After washing with PBS, the specimens were mounted in Vectorshield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Specimens were observed by confocal microscopy, TCS NT (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany). The “IP3 sponge” is a truncated form of IP3R that consists of the ligand binding domain fused to GST (Fig. 1). The IP3 sponge has been found to exhibit high IP3binding affinity, approximately ∼1000 times higher than that of endogenous IP3R in mouse cerebellar microsomes (Fig.1),2 and thus it blocked IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) by absorbing IP3. GST-m30 is a mutant of IP3 sponge in which Lys-508 is substituted for Ala, and it displays low affinity for IP3, approximately ∼0.25 times lower than that of endogenous IP3R in mouse cerebellar microsomes (Fig. 1).2Accordingly, GST and GST-m30 can be used as negative controls of IP3 sponge. First, we examined whether IP3 sponge inhibited IICR in starfish oocyte by injecting various concentrations of IP3into oocyte (Fig. 2). After injecting more than 10−6m IP3(10−8m IP3 in cytoplasm, after 1% injection) into mature eggs that have been injected with 3 μm GST (equal to 0.1 mg/ml in cytoplasm), a Ca2+ peak was observed, and a fertilization envelope was formed. By contrast, after injecting less than 10−6m IP3, no fertilization envelope formation or Ca2+ peak was observed in eggs that had been injected with 1.5 μm IP3 sponge (equal to 0.1 mg/ml in cytoplasm). However, after injecting more than 10−4m IP3 (10−6mIP3 in cytoplasm, after 1% injection), both a calcium rise and a fertilization envelope were observed in eggs injected with IP3 sponge. At 10−5mIP3, an increase in Ca2+ was not observed in most cases, but in some cases, a Ca2+ peak was observed after a delay (about 5 min), or, in some cases, the baseline increased gradually and reached a plateau within 5 min (data not shown). In these cases, a fertilization envelope was observed after measurement of intracellular Ca2+. Thus, injection of a high dose of IP3 overcame the inhibitory effects of IP3sponge, suggesting that the effect of IP3 sponge was specific. Next, we used IP3 sponge to investigate the physiological roles of IP3R during starfish oocyte maturation and fertilization. When immature oocytes injected with 1.5 μmIP3 sponge were treated with 1–2 μm 1-MA to induce maturation, 85% (90 of 106) of oocytes underwent GVBD, similar to results with control oocytes injected with 3 μm GST (94%; 138 of 147) or 1.5 μm (equal to 0.1 mg/ml in cytoplasm) GST-m30 (96%; 67 of 70) did (Figs.3 and 4). Thus, the IP3 sponge did not inhibit 1-MA-induced oocyte maturation.Figure 4Microinjection of oocytes withIP3 sponge prevents formation of fertilization envelope: Statistical analysis. Oocytes were injected with IP3sponge, treated with 1-MA, 2 μm, and inseminated. GST and GST-m30 were utilized as negative controls. The y axis shows the percentages of oocytes that underwent normal GVBD in response to 2 μm 1-MA (left) or the percentages of eggs that developed a normal fertilization envelope when inseminated (right). The number of oocytes that underwent normal GVBD was calculated 1 h after stimulation with 1-MA. The number of eggs that developed a normal fertilization envelope was counted 15 min after insemination. Each bar shows the results for oocytes injected with GST (open bar), GST-m30 (dotted bar), or IP3 sponge (filled bar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After GVBD, these eggs injected with recombinant proteins were inseminated with sperm diluted to 10−6. IP3sponge did not inhibit sperm penetration, since DAPI staining of these eggs showed that sperm nuclei had entered into the cells preinjected with IP3 sponge (Fig. 3D). Polar body extrusion was also unaffected by the IP3 sponge (Fig. 3B). However, the formation of a fertilization envelope was clearly inhibited in eggs injected with IP3 sponge (13%; 12 of 90), whereas those injected with control proteins developed a fertilization envelope (GST: 94%, 129 of 138; GST-m30: 90%, 60/67) (Figs. 3 and 4). Since the intracellular calcium rise during fertilization is known to be involved in the formation of the fertilization envelope, the IP3 sponge probably inhibited IICR. Indeed, when the concentration of intracellular calcium ion was measured with Fura-2 dextran, the transient increase in Ca2+ during fertilization was greatly reduced of the eggs preinjected with IP3 sponge (Fig.5B), whereas GST had no such inhibitory effect (Fig. 5A). When treated with sperm diluted to 10−4, a delay of the Ca2+ peak or a gradual base-line elevation was observed in the oocyte that had been injected with IP3 sponge. These results may have occurred because the IP3 sponge in oocytes was saturated with IP3, thereby diminishing the inhibitory effect of IP3 sponge. To investigate the roles of IP3R in starfish oocyte further, we cloned the IP3R from starfish ovary by RT-PCR. Degenerate oligonucleotides encoding the sequence conserved among all of the reported IP3Rs of different species and types were used as the primers, and they are shown in Fig.6A. Although we used degenerate primers encoding the sequence conserved among all of the reported IP3Rs of different species and types, the sequences of the PCR products were identical to the sequence shown in Fig. 6B, and there were no products with different sequences. The 9374-nucleotide sequence of the cloned starfish IP3R contained a single open reading frame of 8094 bp encoding a protein of 2698 amino acids (Fig. 6B), and the calculated molecular mass of starfish IP3R was 308 kDa. Sequence alignment of starfish IP3R with known full-length human IP3R sequences showed that starfish IP3R most closely resembled IP3R1. The amino acid sequence of starfish IP3R was 68% identical to human IP3R1 (hIP3R1) (39Yamada N. Makino Y. Clark R.A. Pearson D.W. Mattei M.G. Guenet G.L. Ohama E. Fujino I. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T.

https://openalex.org/W2113839914,"A signaling cascade termed the ""spindle checkpoint"" monitors interactions between the kinetochores of chromosomes and spindle microtubules to prevent precocious separation of sister chromatids. We have investigated the role of human inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) surviving in regulation of cell division. We demonstrate that HeLa and PtK1 cells transfected or microinjected with surviving anti-sense oligonucleotides produce significantly more polyploid and micronucleated progeny cells and show abortive mitosis when treated with spindle poisons. Furthermore, perturbation of surviving function in HeLa and PtK1 cells with anti-surviving antibodies at the beginning of mitosis affects the normal timing of separation of sister chromatids and disturbs the 3F3/2 phosphoepitope-recognized tension sensing mechanism of the spindle checkpoint. This leads to premature separation of sister chromatids, which results in an uneven distribution of chromosomes between the newly formed progeny cells-an event associated with tumor formation in many cell types. Finally, cells injected with anti-surviving antibody exit mitotic block induced with microtubule drugs. Our data suggest that surviving protein may function within the spindle checkpoint pathway."

At low population densities, acyl-HSLs are rapidly dissipated by diffusion into the surrounding environment. The contribution of each signal-producing cell is additive, and if population density increases, the relative acyl-HSL concentration is elevated, eventually reaching an inducing concentration and stimulating a programmed set of adaptive responses. The release and subsequent detection of acyl-HSLs therefore enable bacteria to monitor their own population density, a process often referred to as quorum sensing (3Fuqua W.C. Winans S.C.

Synthesis of acyl-HSLs in most cases is mediated by proteins that resemble the LuxI protein ofVibrio fischeri, whereas most of the receptors of these signals are acyl-HSL-dependent transcriptional regulators and resemble the V. fischeri LuxR protein.

Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A region in the amino-terminal half of the protein has conserved residues known to be required for 3-oxo-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone binding by LuxR (14Hanzelka B.L. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 815-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of the protein contains a helix-turn-helix motif (position 193–211) that has been implicated in DNA binding for both TraR and LuxR (15Egland K.A. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). There is genetic and biochemical evidence that interaction with 3-oxo-C8-HSL results in the formation of stable TraR dimers that can bindtra boxes and activate transcription (17Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4832-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 18Qin Y. Luo Z.-Q. Smyth A.J. Gao P. Beck von Bodman S. Farrand S.K.

A. 2001; 98: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In contrast to most other LuxR-type proteins, the activity of TraR is directly influenced by several other regulatory proteins (Fig. 1). The TrlR protein (previously designated TraS) is a truncated homologue of TraR that contains sequences necessary for dimerization but lacks the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (20Oger P. Kim K.-S. Sackett R.L. Piper K.R. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Zhu J. Winans S.C. Mol.

Microbiol. 2001; 40: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The activity of TraR is also under the influence of the Ti plasmid-encoded TraM regulator, a small protein thus far only identified in A. tumefaciens and other members of the family Rhizobiaceae (23Fuqua C. Burbea M. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Freiberg C. Fellay R. Balroch A. Broughton W.J. Rosenthal A. Perret X.

TraM inhibits the activity of the TraR protein, and this inhibition is absolutely required for the normal operation of the A. tumefaciens quorum sensor. Mutants in traM are hyperconjugal and, in contrast to wild type, will transfer the Ti plasmid to recipient cells at high efficiency even at low densities of conjugal donors (6Fuqua W.C. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2796-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 23Fuqua C. Burbea M. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Piper K.R. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In effect, TraM acts to set the threshold level of acyl-HSL-TraR complex required to activate the expression of Ti plasmid tra genes. Therefore, TraM plays a crucial role in determining what constitutes a bacterial quorum and when Ti plasmid conjugal transfer is initiated. Recent studies (27Hwang I. Smyth A.J. Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28Luo Z.-Q. Qin Y. Farrand S.K. J. Biol.

Yeast two-hybrid studies and far-Western analysis of TraM binding to immobilized TraR suggest that TraM associates with a region in the carboxyl-terminal half of the transcription factor (27Hwang I. Smyth A.J. Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28Luo Z.-Q. Qin Y. Farrand S.K. J. Biol.

Mutational analysis of the nopaline-type Ti plasmid (pTiC58) traM coding sequence identified two amino acid residues in the carboxyl terminus of the protein, where alterations resulted in reduced inhibitory function (27Hwang I. Smyth A.J. Luo Z.-Q. Farrand S.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our findings analyzing TraM from the octopine-type Ti plasmid pTiR10 are consistent with the formation of a TraR-TraM anti-activation complex. We expand on this previous work, analyze TraM inhibition at additional TraR-binding sites, and demonstrate TraR-TraM complex formation in solution. Moreover, kinetic analysis of the interaction between these two proteins using SPR reveals that the anti-activation complex assembles slowly but once formed is highly stable. Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis of traM has identified a substantial number of important residues required for productive inhibition of TraR, clustered in two regions of the protein. Phenotypic analysis of several mutant TraM proteins in vivoand in vitro suggests a mechanistic separation between binding to TraR and inhibition of its DNA binding activity.

The 1027-bp amplification product, digested with NheI andBamHI (BamHI cleaves the fragment at an internal site downstream of the traM coding sequence to generate a 592-bp fragment), was ligated withNheI-BamHI-digested pRSETA (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA) to create pMB107. In pMB107 the amino-terminal end of thetraM-coding sequence is fused to the RGS(H)6affinity tag of pRSETA, under the control of the T7 promoter (PT7). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to construct mutations in the A. tumefaciens traM gene on pMB107. Mutations were introduced using the Quick-change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and mutated plasmids were checked with automated DNA sequencing by the Indiana Molecular Biology Institute. Following sequence confirmation the mutated traM alleles were PCR-amplified with Pfu Polymerase (Stratagene) using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGCGGTACCCTGATAAACAGGAAACAGCTATGGAACTGGAAGATGCAAACGTGACG (KpnI cleavage site, Shine-Delgarno sequence and start codon are underlined) and the pRSETA reverse primer 5′-TAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and BamHI (which cleaves within the pRSETA multiple cloning site internal to the 3′ primer), followed by ligation to the BHR expression vector pBBR1-MCS5, also cleaved with KpnI and BamHI (32Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop R.M.I. Peterson K.M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2721) Google Scholar). These derivatives expressed the traM mutant alleles from the E. coli Plac promoter on pBBR1-MCS5. Translation of the lacZα peptide was terminated at two tandem stop codons (in bold type) just downstream from the KpnI site, and translation of the nativetraM gene was initiated at its own ATG codon further downstream. The complete traM-coding sequence was determined for each BHR construct prior to phenotypic analysis. The BHR plasmids described above were introduced into A. tumefaciens NTL4 (a strain cured of the Ti plasmid), harboring a plasmid carrying aPtraI-lacZ fusion (pCF372) and plasmid expressing traR either strongly as aPtetR-traR fusion (pCF218) or moderately as a PBAD-traR fusion (pCF436). The plasmids expressing traR also carry the E. colilacIQ repressor gene, which allows for controlled expression of the Plac-traM transcriptional fusions (33Chen C.-Y. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of PtraI-lacZ in cultures grown in ATGN minimal media with a variety of supplements was monitored by β-galactosidase assays (33Chen C.-Y. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the traMmutant alleles, the ratio of traI-lacZ expression (Miller units of β-galactosidase activity) in the presence of thePlac-traM inducer IPTG relative totraI-lacZ expression in the absence of IPTG was calculated. This activity ratio was subtracted from 1 to obtain inhibitory activity. Percent inhibitory activity was determined as the ratio of inhibitory activities of mutant traM alleles to wild typetraM. E. coli BL21/λDE3 harboring pMB107 and several of its mutant derivatives were used to overproduce H6TraM fusion proteins. For purification, 250 ml of cells were incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking in LB medium supplemented with Ap. When cultures reached an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of 0.6, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce expression of thePT7-H6traM gene. After 3 h of additional incubation, cells were collected by centrifugation (11,760 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and suspended in Extraction Buffer (300 mm NaCl and 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0). Cells were disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell (Aminco, Urbana, IL) at 18,000 pounds/square inch. Unlysed cells and debris were removed by centrifugation (38,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Particulate material was removed by ultracentrifugation of extracts (287,000 × g, 1 h, 22 °C). H6TraM was purified by affinity chromatography on an Akta-FPLC (AP Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) using a XK-16 column containing 13 ml of Talon cobalt affinity resin (CLONTECH Inc, Palo Alto, CA) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Following washing in Extraction Buffer plus 5 mm imidazole, the bound H6TraM was eluted from the resin using a linear gradient of 5–500 mm imidazole in Extraction Buffer and was obtained as a large single peak at ∼200 mm imidazole. Active TraR was purified from cultures ofE. coli BL21/λDE3 (pJZ358) cultured in the presence of 3-oxo-C8-HSL as described previously (19Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the technique of Gill and von Hippel (34Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar) and confirmed using the Micro-BCA assay (Pierce). Plasmids pJZ304 and pCF361 were cleaved with the appropriate restriction endonuclease (see text) and end-labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I by standard techniques. Gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described in Zhu and Winans (19Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Briefly, a range of TraR concentrations was added to the labeled DNA (2,500 cpm) in reaction buffer (12 mm HEPES-NaOH, 4 mmTris-Cl, 60 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol) and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were loaded directly on 8% polyacrylamide (80:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gels and electrophoresed. The gels were dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Unless otherwise indicated, TraR and H6TraM were allowed to preincubate for 20 min at 25 °C, followed by addition of the labeled DNA to the binding reaction, and a subsequent 30-min incubation. Radiolabeled preparations of TraR and H6TraM derivatives were obtained by a standardin vivo technique (30Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. Wiley, New York1997: 3-50Google Scholar). LB-grown overnight cultures ofE. coli BL21/λDE3 harboring plasmids containingtraR or traM genes expressed from the T7 promoter were diluted 100-fold into ATGN broth supplemented with an 18-amino acid mixture (lacking methionine and cysteine), thiamine (5 μg/ml), and Ap (1 mg/ml). Organically synthesized 3-oxo-C8-HSL (1 μm) was also added to cultures expressing TraR. Cultures expressing H6TraM derivatives were cultivated at 37 °C, whereas those expressing TraR were cultured at 28 °C. When cultures reached an A600 of 0.5, IPTG was added (0.5 mm). After incubation for 30 min, rifampicin was added to inhibit the E. coli RNA polymerase. After 30 min, 50 μCi of [35S]Met (5000 Ci/mmol) was added to the cultures, and incubation was continued for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (11,760 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and lysed using a French pressure cell as described above. To analyze complexes between the two regulatory proteins in vitro, E. coli lysates containing radiolabeled H6TraM, radiolabeled TraR, or both were prepared in TTEDG buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl) as described above. The lysates were mixed in equal proportions and incubated for 15 h at room temperature to allow complete complex formation. Following incubation, these reactions were applied to a pre-equilibrated 15-ml Superdex 75 gel filtration column in a mobile phase of TTEDG at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Fractions (0.2 ml) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. RGSHis monoclonal antibodies (Qiagen Inc.) were used to confirm the identity of the band representing presumptive H6TraM. We prepared [35S]Met-labeled wild type and mutant H6TraM proteins from E. coli BL21/λDE3 as described above. Whole cell lysates containing the radiolabeled H6TraM were generated using B-PER nonionic lysis reagent (Pierce) following the supplier's recommendations. Several dilutions of each lysate were fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels, and the dried gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager. The amount of labeled H6TraM in each lysate was determined, and they were normalized for the concentration of radiolabeled H6TraM. Lysates of E. coli BL21/λDE3 (pJZ358) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was washed extensively in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.01% Tween 20 (TTBS) and blocked with TTBS + 5% skim milk (Blotto). The blocked membranes were incubated with separate BPER lysates containing different [35S]Met-H6TraM proteins on a rocking platform for 17 h at room temperature. Following incubation, the membranes were washed five times in TTBS, air-dried, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. The BIACORE 3000 system (BIA-CORE Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) was used to perform SPR analysis of TraR-TraM interactions. TraR was immobilized via primary amine cross-linking to the CMD fibers of a CM5 research grade chip. Carboxyl groups on the CMD fibers were first activated by injection of a mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide. TraR (50 nm) purified as a complex with 3-oxo-C8-HSL was injected in maleate buffer (5 mm maleic acid, pH 7.0) into the flow cell at 2 μl/min to allow covalent bonding to the activated CMD fibers. Unreacted CMD fibers were titrated using acidified ethanolamine (pH 8.5), and the response units (RU) of TraR immobilized on the chip surface were determined. H6TraM was bound to a CM5 chip by conjugating the protein via a thiol linkage to its single dispensable Cys at position 64 (see “Results”) using maleimide coupling chemistry. To do this, a CM5 chip was activated using theN-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide mixture described above, followed by ethylenediamine treatment. The heterobifunctional cross-linker Sulfo-MBS (Pierce) was injected and conjugated to the CMD fibers on the sensor chip surface. H6TraM (650 nm) was injected in maleate buffer and reacted with the immobilized cross-linker via its thiol side chain. Remaining active maleimide residues were titrated using 100 mm l-cysteine. Immobilized TraR and immobilized H6TraM surfaces were used to analyze TraR-TraM interactions. The analyte, TraR or H6TraM, was injected in a buffer containing HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 3 mm EDTA and 0.005% polysorbate 20 (HBS-EP). Binding was monitored as an increase in RU. The dissociation of the complex was monitored as a decrease in RU following termination of analyte injection and continued mobile phase flow. The surface was regenerated with a short pulse of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) for 1 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min as described by Schusteret al. (35Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). HBS-EP buffer was applied at 25 μl/min for 5 min to remove GdnHCl. Regeneration was checked by repeated injections of analyte. Determination of kinetic constants was performed at low ligand surface densities over a range of protein concentration in a randomized series with injections performed in triplicate for each concentration. Reported values are based on averaged data for each analyte concentration in triplicate. To test the anti-activator function of TraM, gel mobility shift assays were performed using a DNA fragment containing tra box I, a TraR-binding site located between divergent pTiR10 traoperons (Fig. 1, see Refs. 11Fuqua C. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 435-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 19Zhu J. Winans S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Addition of TraR (10 nm) resulted in quantitative formation of TraR-DNA complexes (Fig. 2,panel A). Preincubation of TraR with high concentrations of purified H6TraM completely abolished complex formation. No additional complexes were observed, indicating that H6TraM does not itself bind to the tra box. Heat denaturation of H6TraM prior to these assays destroys its inhibitory activity (Fig. 2, panel B). The inhibition of DNA binding activity is dose-dependent with respect to H6TraM, with a 32-fold molar excess of H6TraM (320 nm) over TraR providing full inhibition in 20 min co-incubation period assays (Fig. 2, panel A). A one-to-one molar ratio of H6TraM to TraR provides virtually complete inhibition after extended incubation periods (>15 h), whereas reactions with excess TraR cannot be completely inhibited (data not shown). Addition of H6TraM to preformed TraR-DNA complexes gave similar results, indicating that TraM can disrupt TraR-DNA complexes. Inhibition was completely unaffected by addition of 3-oxo-C8-HSL up to 30 μm(250-fold molar excess over TraM, data not shown). The region upstream of traIcontains two sequences that resemble tra box I (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, panel A). The promoter proximal element (tra box II) is required for transcriptional activation of traI, and, as withtra box I, is centered at −42.5 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site (11Fuqua C. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 435-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another element (tra box III) is located at position −167 relative totraI but is not required for traI expression (11Fuqua C. Winans S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 435-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,36Li P.-L. Farrand S.K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A plasmid carrying both tra box II and III (pCF361) was cleaved to separate the two elements from each other, generating fragments II and III (Fig. 3, panel A).

https://openalex.org/W1963512312,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays an important role in immune and inflammatory responses. Expression of the IL-4 gene is tightly controlled at the level of gene transcription by both positive and negative regulatory elements in the IL-4 promoter. Several constitutive nuclear factors have been identified that can interact with IL-4 promoter elements in DNA binding assays. Here we report that the zinc-finger protein YY-1 (Yin-Yang 1) can bind to multiple elements within the human IL-4 promoter. Cotransfection of Jurkat T cells with different IL-4 promoter/reporter constructs together with expression vectors encoding antisense, wild-type, or zinc finger-deleted mutant YY-1 suggested that YY-1 enhanced IL-4 promoter activity in a DNA-binding domain-dependent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a proximal YY-1-binding site, termed Y0 (−59TCATTTT−53), was essential for YY-1-driven IL-4 promoter activity. In addition, cotransfected YY-1 enhanced both IL-4 promoter activity and endogenous IL-4 gene expression in nontransformed peripheral blood T cells. Thus, YY-1 positively regulates IL-4 gene expression in lymphocytes. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays an important role in immune and inflammatory responses.

Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dysregulated expression of IL-4 has been linked with autoimmune and allergic diseases (2Casolaro V. Georas S. Song Z. Ono S. Curr.

In T cells, IL-4 gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by both ubiquitous and cell type-restricted factors (4Szabo S. Gold J. Murphy T. Murphy K. Mol. Cell.

These factors interact with a proximal promoter region composed of multiple regulatory elements and can both positively and negatively influence transcriptional activation (see Fig. 1). Other regions have been identified outside of the proximal IL-4 promoter that can regulate IL-4 gene expression, including the IL-4/IL-13 intergenic region (12Loots G.G. Locksley R.M. Blankespoor C.M. Wang Z.E. Miller W. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Science. 2000; 288: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), the IL-4 second intron (13Henkel G. Weiss D. McCoy R.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 643-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Some of these elements appear to coordinately regulate IL-4 gene expression at the chromatin level (15Lee R.L. Fields P.E. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 447-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Major insights into the regulation of IL-4 gene expression came from studies using transgenic or knockout approaches to investigate the molecular basis of Th2 differentiation in mice (reviewed in Ref. 16Murphy K.M.

Using these approaches, several transcription factors have been identified that are critical for this process, including Stat6 (17Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J.

A two-step model has recently been proposed to explain IL-4 gene expression in Th2 cells (25Agarwal S. Viola J.P. Rao A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 103: 990-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on the appearance of DNase-hypersensitive sites in the IL-4 gene locus (26Agarwal S. Rao A.

Although chromatin remodeling is likely an important regulatory step during Th2 differentiation, the proximal IL-4 promoter confers a high degree of tissue specificity when linked to reporter genes in transgenic mice (15Lee R.L.

Thus, an analysis of the factors that regulate the activity of the proximal IL-4 promoter will enhance our understanding of IL-4 gene expression. We recently performed a detailed deletional analysis of the human proximal IL-4 promoter and discovered novel binding sites for several transcription factors, including NFAT (nuclearfactor of activated T cells) (9Burke T.F. Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), CP-2 (30Casolaro V. Keane-Myers A.M. Swendeman S.L. Steindler C. Zhong F.

Cumberland J. Burke T. Chen R. Park E. Ono S. Casolaro V. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This analysis also uncovered binding sites for several other constitutive nuclear factors, in keeping with previous studies on the IL-4 promoter in other systems (4Szabo S. Gold J. Murphy T. Murphy K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 5Chuvpilo S. Schomberg C. Gerwig R. Heinfling A. Reeves R. Grummt F. Serfling E.

Krammer P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4122-4133PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the inducible IL-4 promoter-binding factors that have been intensively studied, only a few of these constitutive factors have been well characterized. Here we report that YY-1 (Yin-Yang 1), a constitutive nuclear member of the GLI-Krüppel family of zinc-finger transcription factors, can interact with four binding sites in the human proximal IL-4 promoter. We use site-directed mutagenesis together with cotransfection assays to define the role of YY-1 in regulating the transcriptional activation of the IL-4 promoter. A luciferase-based human IL-4 promoter construct containing 270 bp upstream from the transcription start site and ending at +65 (termed 270luc) was synthesized as described (9Burke T.F. Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A construct containing 235 bp upstream from the transcription start site was amplified by PCR from 270luc and ligated into the pCR-2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), followed by ligation into the XhoI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega). A construct containing 145 bp upstream from the transcription start site was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and ligated into the KpnI and SacI sites of pGL3. Mutations were introduced into the Y0 YY-1-binding site within 270luc using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to generate construct 270lucY0mut. The following mutations specifically disrupted the Y0 site (see Fig. 4): wild-type 270luc,−59TCATTTT−53; to 270lucY0mut,−59TgtaTTT−53 (mutations in lowercase). All products were sequenced to confirm accurate replication. An SV40 promoter-driven YY-1 expression vector was synthesized by ligating theEcoRI insert from pcDNA1-YY-1 (described in Refs. 34Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T. Hogan P. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4138-4145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and35Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI sites of pSG5 (Stratagene). An expression vector encoding a YY-1 mutant with a deletion of amino acids 333–408 within the zinc-finger domain (ZFDmut) was synthesized by restricting pSG5-YY-1 with HindIII and BamHI and religation using the following linkers: HindIII, 5′-AGCTTCCAACAACCAGTGAG-3′; and BamHI, 5′-GATCCTCACTGGTTGTTGGA-3′. The antisense YY-1 vector was a kind gift of Dr. Michael Atchison (University of Pennsylvania) and has been described (32Breslin M.B. Vedeckis W.V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 67: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding full-length NFATp (pREP4-NFATp) and NFATc (pSH107-NFATc) were gifts of Dr. Timothy Hoey (Tularik Inc.) and Dr. Gerald Crabtree (Stanford University), respectively. Jurkat T cells (courtesy of Dr. Jack Strohminger, Harvard University) were maintained and transfected using 2.5 × 106 cells, 1 μg of reporter, and 3 μl of Superfect® (QIAGEN Inc.) per μg of plasmid DNA as previously reported (22Chen R. Burke T. Cumberland J. Brummet M. Beck L. Casolaro V. Georas S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Jurkat cells and a Jurkat subline stably transfected with the SV40 large T antigen (JTAg cells, kindly provided by Dr. Ron Wange, NIA, National Institutes of Health) were transfected using electroporation as follows. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 8 × 106 cells/300 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) together with the indicated amounts of reporter plasmid and then electroporated at 300 V and 960 microfarads in cuvettes with a 0.4-cm gap width (Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser II). Transfection efficiencies of standard Jurkat and JTAg cells using electroporation averaged 40 and 85%, respectively, as determined by analyzing green fluorescence of cells cotransfected with a GFP expression vector (data not shown). Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were lysed and analyzed by luminometry using a Monolight 3010C luminometer and luciferase assay kit (Analytical Bioluminescence, Gaithersburg, MD). In some experiments, cells were incubated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem) for 18 h prior to analysis of reporter gene expression as indicated. Two strategies were taken to control for transfection efficiency. First, at least three different reporter plasmid and expression vector preparations were used, and cells of similar passage number were transfected under identical reaction conditions. In cotransfection experiments, cells were also transfected with empty vector to keep the total amount of DNA constant in a given condition. Second, the efficiency of transfection was monitored in some experiments by cotransfecting a second internal control plasmid. In these experiments, cells were cotransfected with pSEAP2-Control (1 μg; CLONTECH), and firefly luciferase activity was normalized to secreted alkaline phosphatase measured by chemiluminescence (Great EscAPe SEAP kit,CLONTECH). pSEAP2 was chosen because, compared with other standard internal control vectors, its expression was affected the least by cell stimulation, and it did not interfere with YY-1 overexpression in pilot cotransfection experiments (data not shown). In experiments with the antisense YY-1 vector, cell growth was analyzed by (i) counting viable cells using trypan blue exclusion and (ii) comparing total protein content in lysates of control and antisense-transfected cells. Highly enriched peripheral blood T cells were obtained by countercurrent elutriation of leukapheresis packs (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center). This procedure yielded ∼70% pure CD3+ cells as assessed by flow cytometry (data not shown). Cells were transfected by electroporation according to the method of Cron et al. (33Cron R.Q. Schubert L.A. Lewis D.B. Hughes C.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as follows. Cells were first incubated for 18 h in the presence of 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Calbiochem). Subsequently, 10 × 106 cells were resuspended in a volume of 300 μl Opti-MEM with 10 μg of reporter together with the indicated amounts of expression vector or empty vector to keep total DNA constant. Cells were electroporated using a 0.4-cm gap width cuvette and a 1-s duration pulse at 300 V and 960 microfarads (Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser II). These settings were determined in pilot experiments to yield maximal luciferase expression (data not shown). Omission of phytohemagglutinin from the overnight culture significantly reduced transfection efficiency (data not shown). Cells were stimulated with calcium ionophore (1 μmA23187) plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml) or Me2SO control for 18 h prior to analysis of reporter gene activity by luminometry as described above. IL-4 protein secretion was measured in supernatants using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ultrasensitive IL-4 kit, detection limit of 0.27 pg/ml, BIOSOURCE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All measured values fell within the standard curve. Whole cell, cytoplasmic, and nuclear lysates were obtained from Jurkat cells. Nuclear extracts from mouse Th1 (AE7) and Th2 (D10) clones were kindly provided by Dr. Anuradha Ray (Yale University). Cell extracts were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Trans-Blot transfer medium polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, membranes were probed with mouse anti-YY-1 monoclonal antibody H-10 (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 10 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:3000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After a final washing step, immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography using the ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. The following 30-bp oligonucleotides and their complements were synthesized: 5′-ATTGCTGAAACCGAGGGAAAATGAGTTTACATTG-3′ (P0, −36 to −69), 5′-TGAGTTTACATTGGAAATTTTCGTTACACCAGATTG-3′ (P1, −57 to −92), 5′-TCTGATTTCACAGGAACATTTTACCTGTTT-3′ (P2, −175 to −146), 5′-AATCAGACCAATAGGAAAATGAAACCTTTTTAA-3′ (P3, −169 to −201), 5′-AGTTTCAGCATAGGAAATTACACCATAATTTGC-3′ (P4, −216 to −248), and 5′-GCAGTCCTCCTGG GGAAA GATAGAGTAATATCA-3′ (P5, −340 to −372). Mutations were introduced into the P0 and P2 consensus YY-1-binding sites (underlined) as indicated in Figs. 2 and 4. A recombinant fragment of murine NFATp (including 298 amino acids of the DNA-binding domain, highly conserved among different NFAT family members) was expressed as a hexahistidine-tagged protein and extracted as described (34Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T. Hogan P. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4138-4145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recombinant YY-1 was extracted from bacteria transformed with a histidine-tagged YY-1 expression vector. Nuclear extracts were obtained from 5 × 106 Jurkat cells using the method of Schreiber et al. (35Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed using 5 μg of nuclear protein and γ-32P-end-labeled probe with 0.8 μg of poly(dG·dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in a final volume of 10 μl. Experiments with recombinant proteins were performed with 1-μl aliquots of the recombinant NFATp DNA-binding domain with or without 1 μl of YY-1, and the final buffer composition in all samples was adjusted to contain 84 mm KCl, 34 mm NaCl, 7% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Free probes and protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 5% PAGE with 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. In some experiments, extracts were incubated with 1 μl of the following antisera for 30 min at 4 °C prior to addition of probe: rabbit anti-NFATp polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-YY-1 polyclonal antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Stat6 polyclonal antibody S-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and isotype- and species-matched control IgG (Sigma). The IL-4 promoter contains multiple binding sites for members of the NFAT family of transcription factors, termed the P elements P0–P5 (4Szabo S. Gold J. Murphy T. Murphy K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4793-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 5Chuvpilo S. Schomberg C. Gerwig R. Heinfling A. Reeves R. Grummt F. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5694-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 9Burke T.F. Casolaro V. Georas S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). During a detailed deletional analysis of the human IL-4 promoter, we identified a factor (termed complex IV) that bound downstream of NFAT to the P2 element (10Georas S. Cumberland J. Burke T. Chen R. Park E. Ono S. Casolaro V. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (A–C), multiple nuclear factors from Jurkat cells recognized this element in EMSAs. These included a slowly migrating factor with apparent repressor properties (termed Rep-1 (10Georas S. Cumberland J. Burke T. Chen R. Park E. Ono S. Casolaro V. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)), a Ca2+-induced factor containing NFATp, and the constitutive complexes III–V. We previously reported that complex IV binds in a sequence-specific manner and that its formation is not competed for by a panel of consensus oligonucleotides, including those containing high affinity NFAT and AP-1 sites (10Georas S. Cumberland J. Burke T. Chen R. Park E. Ono S. Casolaro V. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis revealed that the formation of complex IV required sequences located just downstream of the NFAT consensus sequence −163GGAACA−158(Fig. 2, A and B). Inspection of this region revealed a sequence (−160ACATTTT−154) highly homologous to a consensus YY-1-binding site, which we termed Y2 (Fig.2B). The most conserved nucleotide in the YY-1 consensus sequence is the second cytosine (5′-CCATNTT-3′), which appears to be required for high affinity DNA binding (36Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). When we mutated this nucleotide within the P2 element, we did not detect complex IV binding in EMSA using Jurkat nuclear extracts (data not shown). Using anti-transcription factor antibodies and nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells in EMSA, we found that complex IV indeed contained immunoreactive YY-1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and6). Fig. 2D also shows that factors previously shown to bind to the P2 region, such as NFATp and Stat6 (23Georas S. Cumberland J. Burke T. Chen R. Schindler U. Casolaro V. Blood. 1998; 92: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not affect complex IV. YY-1 appeared to bind in a competitive manner with complex III, which bound just upstream of the NFAT site (Fig.2A, compare lanes 1 and 7). The identities of the constitutive complexes III and V are currently unknown. Because the IL-4 promoter P elements are homologous even outside of the NFAT core consensus sequence, we speculated that YY-1 would interact with additional sequences within the IL-4 promoter. Fig.3 shows that a YY-1-immunoreactive complex formed on oligonucleotide probes encompassing the P3 and P4 (but not P1 and P5) elements using Jurkat nuclear extracts in EMSA. Importantly, sequence inspection revealed five of six base pair matches for the YY-1 consensus sequence (including the critical second cytosine) within the P3 and P4 (but not P1 and P5) oligonucleotides (Fig. 3). The most proximal IL-4 NFAT site (termed P0) has been shown to bind both constitutive and inducible nuclear factors and to contribute to promoter activity in T cell lines and Th2 cells (29Wenner C.A. Szabo S.J. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 765-773PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6397-6405PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence inspection revealed a potential YY-1-binding site located immediately adjacent to the P0 NFAT consensus sequence (Fig.4). Fig. 4A shows that a YY-1-immunoreactive complex formed on the P0 element using Jurkat nuclear extracts in EMSA. To precisely map the YY-1-binding site in this region, we introduced mutations into the YY-1 consensus sequence and studied the ability of recombinant YY-1 to bind to wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 4B, mutation of two nucleotides within the YY-1 consensus sequence (including the second cytosine, C−59) drastically impaired the ability of YY-1 to bind to this region (compare lanes 4 and6). As a control, we also found that recombinant YY-1 readily bound to the P2 oligonucleotide. These experiments mapped the proximal IL-4 promoter YY-1-binding site to sequence−59TCATTTT−53, which we termed Y0. The introduced mutations also inhibited the binding of native YY-1 to the Y0 element (Fig. 4C). Note that a constitutive complex that was partially inhibited by the anti-YY-1 antibody (Fig.4A, asterisk) bound equally well to the mutant probe (Fig. 4C). The identity of this complex, which does not represent sequence-specific binding by YY-1, is currently unknown. We did not detect NFATp binding to the P0 element in these experiments (data not shown), in keeping with prior studies showing that the P0 element binds NFAT with lower affinity than other P elements (37Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6397-6405PubMed Google Scholar). Our biochemical data showed that YY-1 can interact with four binding sites in the proximal IL-4 promoter. Sequence inspection and computer analysis did not detect additional YY-1-binding sites within ∼1000 bp surrounding the IL-4 transcription start site. To test the functional significance of YY-1 in regulating IL-4 promoter activity, we next studied the effect of cotransfecting an antisense YY-1 expression vector with different promoter constructs into Jurkat T cells. These experiments were prompted by the observations that (i) the IL-4 promoter is constitutively active in transiently transfected Jurkat cells (30Casolaro V. Keane-Myers A.M. Swendeman S.L. Steindler C. Zhong F. Sheffery M. Georas S.N. Ono S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36605-36611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and (ii) YY-1 is a constitutive nuclear protein in these cells (Fig. 2). We used both a full-length promoter construct (270luc) and a minimal construct containing only the Y0 site (145luc; see “Experimental Procedures”) together with an antisense YY-1 vector that has been shown to inhibit glucocorticoid receptor expression by ∼50% in other systems (32Breslin M.B. Vedeckis W.V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 67: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cotransfection of antisense YY-1 inhibited transcription driven by the full-length IL-4 promoter by ∼80% (Fig.5). The activity of the minimal construct 145luc was also reduced by antisense YY-1, although this result did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06). Transfection of antisense YY-1 did not appear to affect cell growth (see “Experimental Procedures”). These results suggest that YY-1 contributes to constitutive IL-4 promoter activity in Jurkat cells. We next overexpressed YY-1 and reasoned that increasing the cellular concentration of this factor would further enhance IL-4 promoter activity. In these experiments, Jurkat cells were cotransfected by electroporation with a series of IL-4 promoter constructs and a wild-type YY-1 expression vector. Cotransfection of YY-1 resulted in a concentration-dependent enhancement of transcription driven by the full-length IL-4 promoter (data not shown) as well as of transcription driven by 145luc (Fig.6A). Western blot analysis confirmed that total cellular YY-1 content was also increased in a concentration-dependent manner in these cells (Fig.6A). Overexpressed YY-1 also enhanced IL-4 promoter activity in transiently transfected JTAg cells, a subline of Jurkat cells stably transfected with the SV40 T antigen (Fig. 6B; see “Experimental Procedures”). In both JTAg and standard Jurkat cells, the expression of YY-1 was confined largely to the cell nucleus, indicating that the subcellular localization of overexpressed YY-1 was faithfully regulated (Fig. 6B and data not shown). The detection of some YY-1 within the cytoplasmic fraction likely reflects ongoing expression of YY-1 from the transfected construct. In parallel experiments, we examined the effects of overexpressing YY-1 on IL-4 promoter activity in non-lymphoid COS-7 cells. IL-4 145luc was constitutively active in these cells, as was reported for the human IL-4 promoter in non-lymphoid HeLa cells (38Li-Weber M. Eder A. Krafft-Czepa H. Krammer P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1913-1918PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, cotransfection of YY-1 sufficient to increase total cellular YY-1 expression as determined by Western blotting down-regulated the IL-4 promoter in COS-7 cells (∼70% inhibition; n = 4) (data not shown). Thus, IL-4 promoter enhancement by YY-1 appears to be cell type-specific. The observation that 145luc, which contains only the Y0 element, can be transactivated by overexpressed YY-1 suggests that the Y0 element is critical for YY-1-dependent IL-4 promoter activity. To test this hypothesis, we mutated Y0 in the context of the full-length promoter to generate the construct 270lucY0mut and studied promoter activity under a variety of experimental conditions."

Most substitutions resulted virtually in a complete loss of RNase H activity. However, three mutants, Y501F, Y501W, and Y501R, possessed RNase H activities comparable with wild-type enzyme. Whereas BBNH inhibited Y501F RT RNase H activity with potency equivalent to wild-type RT, the Y501W mutant showed a 6-fold resistance to inhibition by BBNH, and the Y501R mutant was completely resistant to inhibition by BBNH. The replication “fitness” of HIV molecular clones with the Y501W or Y510R mutation was significantly compromised compared with wild-type virus. Importantly, BBNH was an effective inhibitor of the DNA polymerase activity of all Y501X mutants tested.

RT RNase H is also crucial for the strand transfer reactions that are essential for the synthesis of viral DNA. Because of the essential role of HIV-1 RT in virus replication, numerous anti-chemotherapeutic agents have been developed against this enzyme (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Parniak M.A. Sluis-Cremer N.

Virtually all of these inhibitors are directed against RT DNA polymerase activity with very few inhibitors of RT RNase H so far identified. The few inhibitors of HIV RT RNase H include illimaquinone (3Loya S. Tal R. Kashman Y. Hizi A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 2009-2012Google Scholar), azidothymidylate (4Tan C.-K. Civil R.

Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar) and phenylhydrazones such as PD029687 (12Gabbara S. Davis W.R. Hupe L. Hupe D. Peliska J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13070-13076Google Scholar). We were the first group to describe a reasonably potent inhibitor of HIV-1 RT RNase H activity (11Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar). This inhibitor,N-(4-tert-butylbenzoyl)-2-hydroxynaphthaldehyde hydrazone (BBNH, Fig. 1), is one of a family of metal-binding hydrazones, which were developed primarily as antitumor agents and antioxidants (13Baker E. Richardson D. Gross S. Ponka P. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 492-501Google Scholar). BBNH inhibits both the HIV-1 RT DNA polymerase and RNase H domains (11Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar). BBNH also inhibits the RNase H activity of HIV-2 RT, Moloney murine leukemia virus RT, andEscherichia coli RNase HI (11Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar). We have suggested that this multifunctional inhibition is the result of the binding of two molecules of BBNH/molecule of HIV-1 RT with one molecule interacting close to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor-binding pocket (NNIBP) in the polymerase domain of the enzyme and the second molecule binding in the spatially distinct RNase H domain of the enzyme (11Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar). Molecular modeling suggested that BBNH binds to the RT RNase H domain close to the active site, and that residue Tyr-501 is integral in the binding interaction. We therefore altered Tyr-501 by site-directed mutagenesis to better define this potential interaction. Our results indicate that this residue appears to be essential for RT RNase H activity, because most substitutions abrogate enzyme activity. The Y501F, Y501W, and Y501R mutants retained appreciable RNase H activity, and only the Y501F mutant remained sensitive to BBNH inhibition, an observation consistent with the molecular model for BBNH binding to the RNase H domain. Importantly, the introduction of the Y501W and Y501R mutations in molecular clones of HIV-1 resulted in virus that was significantly attenuated in replication fitness. BBNH andN-(4-tert-butylbenzoyl)-2-hydroxy-1-salicylylhydrazone (BBSH) were synthesized by standard methods (14Edward J.T. Gauthier M. Chubb F.L. Ponka P. J. Chem. Eng. Data. 1988; 33: 538-540Google Scholar). 1H NMR and elemental analyses of these compounds were entirely consistent with the expected chemical structures. [3H]TTP, [γ-32P]ATP, and the homopolymeric template/primer poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12–18 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. All other reagents were of the highest quality available and were used without further purification. A model for the interaction of BBNH with HIV-1 RT was constructed using the x-ray crystallographic coordinates for HIV-1 RT complexed with nevirapine (15Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession number 3HVT). This structure was chosen because of the presence of magnesium atoms bound in the RNase H active site. The initial conformation of BBNH was derived from its x-ray crystal structure (16Lanthier C.M. Parniak M.A. Dmitrienko G.I. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 1557-1562Google Scholar). Docking and energy minimization experiments were carried out with the anneal function of Sybyl 6.5 (Tripos Inc., St Louis, MO). Charges were calculated by the Gasteiger-Huckel method, and iterative minimization was carried out with the Tripos force field until the energy difference between iterations was <0.01 kcal/mol/Å. The p66- and p51-kDa subunits of HIV-1 RT were cloned into a pBAD/HisB prokaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) between the XhoI and HindIII restriction endonuclease cleavage sites. Mutations at position 501 were introduced into the gene encoding for the p66-kDa subunit of HIV-1 RT by site-directed mutagenesis using either the SculptorTMin vitro mutagenesis (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) or QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) systems. All clones were sequenced for the desired mutation using a T7-sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). WT and mutant RT p66/p51 heterodimers were purified as described previously (17Fletcher R.S. Holleshak G. Nagy E. Arion D. Borkow G. Gu Z. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 27-32Google Scholar). The specific activities of WT and mutant RT were determined by measuring the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of each enzyme using 0.2 units/ml of poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12–18, 20 μm[3H]dTTP, and 8.5 nm purified RT p66/p51 heterodimer in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and then quenched by the addition of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate. After a 20-min incubation on ice, samples were filtered using a 1.2-μm glass fiber type C filter multi-well plates (Millipore) and washed sequentially with 10% trichloroacetic acid and ethanol. The extent of radionucleotide incorporation was then determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Assays for the inhibition of RT DNA polymerase activity by BBNH were carried out as described previously (11Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar). More detailed inhibition kinetic analysis of RT RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity employed a heteropolymeric template/primer prepared as previously described (18Arts E.J. Li X. Gu Z. Kleiman L. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14672-14680Google Scholar) using the T7 polymerase RNA transcript fromAccI-linearized plasmid pHIV-PBS as template and a synthetic 18-nucleotide deoxyoligonucleotide as DNA synthesis initiation primer. Reaction assays comprised 0.5 units/ml of heteropolymeric template/primer, variable concentrations of a mixture of equimolar [3H]dATP, [3H]dCTP, [3H]dGTP, [3H]TTP (ranging from 1–20 μm total dNTP concentration), and 10 nmpurified RT p66/p51 heterodimer in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2. Samples were incubated and processed as described above. Inhibition data were analyzed by Dixon plot analysis. RNase H activity was assayed using an 18-nucleotide 5′-32P-heteropolymeric RNA template (5′-GAUCUGAGCCUGGGAGCU-3′) annealed to a complementary 18-nucleotide DNA oligomer (5′-AGCTCCCAGGCTCAGATC-3′). 14 nm 5′-[32P]RNA-DNA duplex was incubated with 5 nm RT heterodimer in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2 in 10 μl of final volume. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and then quenched with an equal volume of gel loading dye (98% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol). RNase H-generated degradation products were resolved by electrophoresis using 14% acrylamide/7 m urea sequencing gels visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. For assay of BBNH or BBSH inhibition of RT RNase H activity, WT or mutant RT (30 nm) was preincubated with BBNH or BBSH (dissolved in Me2SO) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml of ovalbumin in a final volume of 50 μl for 10 min. The final concentration of Me2SO never exceeded 2%. 10-μl aliquots of the preincubation mixture was then added to 40 μl of an assay mixture containing 14 nm RNA-DNA duplex and assayed as described above. Inhibition data were calculated from Dixon and Lineweaver-Burk plots. Plasmid SVC21-BH10 encodes an infectious molecular clone of the IIIB strain of HIV-1 and carries an SV40 origin of replication for expression in COS cells (19Fisher A.G. Collati E. Ratner L. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1991; 316: 262-265Google Scholar). Mutations in the region corresponding to residue 501 of the RT gene were introduced using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Virus was prepared by transfection of COS-7 cells using a standardized calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cell-free supernatants were collected 48 h following transfection, and the amount of virus in these supernatants was quantified by analyzing the levels of HIV-1 p24 antigen. Aliquots of these supernatants, containing equal amounts of viral p24, were then added to cultures of CD4+ MT2 lymphoblastoid cells. Cells were examined daily for the appearance of HIV-1-induced syncytium formation. In addition, aliquots of cell-free supernatants were reserved for the assessment of viral p24 levels. The model for the binding of BBNH to the RNase H domain of HIV-1 RT is shown in Fig. 2. Crystallographic analysis shows BBNH to be a flat planar molecule (16Lanthier C.M. Parniak M.A. Dmitrienko G.I. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 1557-1562Google Scholar). Our docking studies indicate a good fit between the inhibitor and a region close to the RNase H active site that is open and accessible to ligand binding (Fig. 2A). Residues within 4 Å of the bound inhibitor include Asn-474, Gln-475, Arg-448, Glu-478, Ser-499, His-539, and Tyr-501 (Fig. 2B). Two major binding determinants were identified. The first involves the coordination of one of the hydrazone-linkage nitrogen atoms and the hydrazone carbonyloxygen to the RNase H active site metal. This interaction is consistent with our observations that BBNH inhibition of RT RNase H activity is a metal-dependent process (i.e. metal coordination is essential), and that BBNH is a competitive inhibitor of RT RNase H activity (11Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar). The second major interaction identified is an aromatic-stacking interaction between the phenyl ring of Tyr-501 and the second naphthyl ring of BBNH (Fig. 2A). To confirm this possibility, we examined the inhibitory potency of a BBNH analog,N-(4-tert-butylbenzoyl)-2-hydroxy-1-salicylylhydrazone (Fig. 1), in which a single aromatic ring replaces the naphthyl double ring system of BBNH. The salicylyl single ring is not positioned to participate in aromatic stacking with Tyr-501, and in accordance with our model BBSH, was an exceptionally weak inhibitor of RT RNase H activity (Table I). Nevertheless, BBSH retained significant inhibitory potency against RT DNA polymerase activity.Table IInhibition of the DNA polymerase and RNase H activities of HIV-1 RT by BBNH and BBSHActivityBBNHBBSHIC50KiIC50KiμmμmRDDP0.9 ± 0.12.2 ± 0.52.5 ± 0.45.6 ± 1.3RNase H3.6 ± 0.54.3 ± 0.1>50>50Values are the means ± S.D. from three independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate.

Most of these mutant enzymes had significantly impaired RNase H activity (Fig. 3, TableII), and some also showed attenuated RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (Table II) compared with the WT enzyme. Only the Y501F, Y501W, and Y501R mutants retained appreciable RNase H activity.Table IIRelative RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) and RNase H activities of Y501X mutant HIV-1 RTEnzymeRelative specific activityRDDPRNase H% wild-type enzymeWild-type1002-aThe specific activity of wild-type p66/p51 RT was 460 pmol/min/μg determined with poly(rA) · oligo(dT)12–18 as template/primer as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1002-bRelative values were determined by densitometric assessment of the decrease in the amount of 18-nucleotide [32P]-5′-RNA oligonucleotide when duplexed to complementary DNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Y501F104 ± 28 85Y501W85 ± 15100Y501R105 ± 18 90Y501Q135 ± 18inactiveY501G65 ± 9inactiveY501L56 ± 11inactiveY501S45 ± 6inactiveY501E17 ± 6 25Y501A<5inactiveY501H<5inactive2-a The specific activity of wild-type p66/p51 RT was 460 pmol/min/μg determined with poly(rA) · oligo(dT)12–18 as template/primer as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-b Relative values were determined by densitometric assessment of the decrease in the amount of 18-nucleotide [32P]-5′-RNA oligonucleotide when duplexed to complementary DNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab BBNH inhibited the RNase H activity of Y501F RT as effectively as WT RT (Table III). However, the Y501W mutant showed a 6-fold decreased sensitivity to inhibition of its RNase H activity by BBNH, and the RNase H activity of the Y501R mutant enzyme was completely resistant to BBNH inhibition.

Open table in a new tab –, virus was non-infectious; n.a., not applicable. We previously suggested that the ability of BBNH to inhibit multiple RT activities might be because of the binding of the inhibitor to two different sites on the enzyme based on biochemical and kinetic data (11Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar). Our hypothesis was that binding to a site at or near the NNIBP in the polymerase domain of RT results in the inhibition of the DNA polymerase activity of the enzyme, whereas binding to the second site in the RNase H domain provides inhibition of the RNase H activity of the enzyme. However, it was still possible, although unlikely, that the inhibition of both activities might arise from single site binding of the inhibitor. Indeed, certain non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have been shown to affect RT RNase H activity despite binding only to the NNIBP (21Gopalakrishnan V. Benkovic S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4110-4115Google Scholar). Molecular modeling showed that BBNH can be readily docked into the RT RNase H domain in a manner consistent with previously reported data (Fig. 2A). For example, a major interaction involves the coordination of the metal-chelating moieties of BBNH with the active site metal in the RNase H domain. This is consistent with the metal dependence for BBNH inhibition of RT RNase H activity as well as the competitive nature of this inhibition (11Borkow G. Fletcher R.S. Barnard J. Arion D. Motakis D. Dmitrienko G.I. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3179-3185Google Scholar). Despite considerable effort, very few potent small molecule inhibitors of HIV-1 RT RNase H have been identified. This may partly be attributed to the fact that the RNase H active site has a rather open structure (as might be expected for an active site that must accommodate the large RNA-DNA duplex substrate), and initially it appears that the region possesses insufficient potential contacts to allow for reasonable binding interactions with small molecules. However, BBNH is a flat molecule with an extended planar structure (16Lanthier C.M. Parniak M.A. Dmitrienko G.I. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 1557-1562Google Scholar) and possesses metal-binding properties that allow interaction with the active site metal. Interestingly, the only other potent inhibitor of RT RNase H, the phenylhydrazone PD029687, was recently shown to also be capable of metal binding. Thus, metal binding may be an important parameter for the identification of RNase H inhibitors. The molecular model also predicts that aromatic ring-stacking interactions between the phenol ring of Tyr-501 and the second ring of the naphthyl moiety of BBNH is important for the non-metal binding interactions of the inhibitor with the RT RNase H active site. The observation that BBSH, a BBNH analog with a reduced ring system, is unable to inhibit RT RNase H is also consistent with this model. Furthermore, BBSH remains a potent inhibitor of RT DNA polymerase activity, implying that this analog can still bind to the RT polymerase domain presumably at or near the NNIBP. This observation provides further evidence that the inhibition of multiple RT activities by BBNH arises from the binding of the inhibitor to multiple sites on RT. Mutational analyses of Tyr-501 also support the prediction that this residue is crucial for the binding of BBNH. In the absence of bound nucleic acid duplex substrate, Tyr-501 is completely exposed to solvent, and the phenol ring is free to “flip” around its Cβ–Cγ bond. This conformational flexibility enables the phenol side chain of Tyr-501 to readily assume an orientation to interact with the naphthyl ring system of BBNH, thereby providing the crucial stacking interaction. The Y501F substitution would not affect the side chain conformational flexibility. Thus, the RNase H activity of Y501F RT is fully sensitive to BBNH inhibition. The increased side chain bulk of the Y501W mutant could decrease the rotational freedom about the Cβ–Cγ bond. This decreased mobility would restrict the side chain from adopting the appropriate orientation to facilitate BBNH binding, consistent with the decreased sensitivity of the Y501W mutant to BBNH inhibition. Whereas arginine is capable of π-bonding interactions, the size and non-planar nature of the Y501R mutation is such that interactions with BBNH would be difficult. Indeed, the RNase H activity of the Y501R mutant RT is completely insensitive to BBNH inhibition. Importantly, the DNA polymerase activity of the Y501F, Y501W, and Y501R mutants remains fully sensitive to inhibition by BBNH, additional evidence that the inhibition of multiple RT activities of WT enzyme arises from multiple site binding of the inhibitor. Our mutational analyses of Tyr-501 also provided the surprising observation that most substitutions at this position resulted in significant losses of RNase H activity, suggesting an essential role for Tyr-501 in RT RNase H activity. In this context, it is interesting to note that virtually all RNases H for which sequence information is available have a tyrosine residue in the position corresponding to that of Tyr-501 in the HIV-1 RT RNase H domain (22Mizuguchi K. Deane C.M. Blundell T.L. Overington J.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2469-2471Google Scholar, 23Crouch R.J. Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. Toulmé J.J. Ribonucleases H. Editions INSERM, Paris1998: 79-100Google Scholar). The functional role of Tyr-501 is unclear at present, however, it is interesting to note that each of the amino acid substitutions at Tyr-501, which allowed retention of enzyme activity, namely phenylalanine, tryptophan, and arginine, are capable of participating in π-stacking interactions. One possibility is that Tyr-501 participates in stacking interactions with base moieties of the RNA-DNA nucleic acid duplex substrate, thereby assisting in positioning the substrate in the RNase H active site. Indeed, crystal structures of the binary and ternary complexes of HIV-1 RT bound with double-stranded DNA suggest that Tyr-501 contacts the bound nucleic acid duplex (24Ding J. Das K. Hsiou Y. Sarafianos S.G. Clark A.D. Jacobo-Molina A. Tantillo C. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1095-1111Google Scholar, 25Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Google Scholar). However, further structural information is needed to clarify the role of Tyr-501 in RT RNase H and the equivalent residue in other RNases H. Although the Y501F, Y501W, and Y501R mutant RT retained WT levels of DNA polymerase and RNase H activity in in vitro assays, molecular clones of HIV-1 containing these same mutations showed varying decreases in viral replication fitness. Whereas the Y501F mutant virus was only slightly decreased in replication efficiency, the Y501W mutant virus showed a 5-fold decrease in replication compared with WT virus, and the Y501R virus was unable to replicate. These observations provide additional evidence of the essential nature of Tyr-501 and also suggest that Tyr-501 may be “immutable” in the context of viral fitness. The development of antiviral drug resistance is a major problem in the therapy of HIV infection, and it may be advantageous to identify drugs that “target” essential protein residues such as Tyr-501. Although it is certainly likely that HIV-1 will develop resistance to such compounds, the development of this resistance may be delayed relative to some other therapeutics, thereby providing prolonged clinical utility. Whereas BBNH is one of the few relatively potent inhibitors of HIV-1 RT RNase H so far identified, its inhibitory potency is significantly less than other antivirals in clinical use, and as such it should be considered mainly as an interesting lead compound for the development of more potent RNase H inhibitors. Our molecular model suggests that the bound BBNH may be within contact distance of several other RT residues, namely Arg-448, Asn-474, Gln-475, Ser-499, and His-539 (Fig.2B). BBNH analogs that possess structural moieties, which can take advantage of these potential additional contacts, might demonstrate significant improvements in inhibitory potency. Such studies are underway in our laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W2146881325,"We recently characterized a heparin-deficient mouse strain generated by targeting the gene for N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-2 (NDST-2). The NDST-2-/- mice show severe defects in their organization of mast cell (MC) secretory granules, with an almost total absence of the various heparin-binding MC proteases. In the present report we have studied the consequences of heparin/MC protease deficiency for extravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis. Addition of prothrombin to peritoneal cells-a mixture of macrophages, lymphocytes, and MCs-resulted in formation of thrombin but the accumulation of thrombin occurred faster in the NDST-2-/-cells than in normal controls. Further, the generated thrombin was subsequently inactivated in the NDST-2+/+ cell cultures but not in the NDST-2-/- cells. Plasminogen was activated to plasmin at an apparently higher rate in peritoneal cells from NDST-2 null mice than in the normal controls. Similar to thrombin, the generated plasmin was inactivated by NDST-2+/+ but not by the NDST-2-/- cells. Subsequent experiments with normal cells showed that cell surface-associated MC chymase, in a strongly heparin-dependent manner, was responsible for both the thrombin-inactivating- and plasmin-inactivating activities. These results show that MC chymase-heparin complexes have the potential to regulate extravascular coagulation processes, as well as the plasminogen activator/plasmin system."
https://openalex.org/W2095543692,"Nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II), also designated RNA helicase A, is a multifunctional protein involved in transcription, RNA processing, and transport. Here we report that NDH II binds to F-actin. NDH II was partially purified from HeLa nuclear extracts by ion-exchange chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 and DEAE-Sepharose. Upon gel-filtration chromatography on Sepharose 4B, partially purified NDH II resolved into two distinct peaks. The first NDH II peak, corresponding to the void volume of Sepharose 4B, displayed coelution with an abundant 42-kDa protein that was subsequently identified as actin. Several nuclear proteins such as RNA polymerase II, the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-associated WD40 protein, and heterogeneous nuclear RNPs (hnRNPs) copurified with NDH II. However, only hnRNPs A1 and C were found together with NDH II and actin polymers during gel filtration. NDH II and hnRNP C from the HeLa nuclear extract coeluted with F-actin on Sepharose 4B in an RNase-resistant manner, whereas hnRNP A1 was nearly completely removed from F-actin-associated hnRNP complexes following RNA digestion. The association of NDH II and hnRNP C with F-actin was abolished by gelsolin, an F-actin-depolymerizing protein that fragments actin polymers into oligomers or monomers. Furthermore, NDH II co-immunoprecipitated with F-actin and hnRNP C, respectively. In vitro translated NDH II coeluted with F-actin on Sepharose 4B, whereas no coelution with F-actin was observed for in vitro translated hnRNP A1 or C1. Binding to F-actin requires an intact C terminus of NDH II and most likely a native protein conformation. Electron microscopy indicated a close spatial proximity among NDH II, hnRNP C, and F-actin within the HeLa nucleus. These results suggest an important function of NDH II in mediating the attachment of hnRNP-mRPP RNP complexes to the actin nucleoskeleton for RNA processing, transport, or other actin-related processes. Nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II), also designated RNA helicase A, is a multifunctional protein involved in transcription, RNA processing, and transport. Here we report that NDH II binds to F-actin.

The first NDH II peak, corresponding to the void volume of Sepharose 4B, displayed coelution with an abundant 42-kDa protein that was subsequently identified as actin. Several nuclear proteins such as RNA polymerase II, the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-associated WD40 protein, and heterogeneous nuclear RNPs (hnRNPs) copurified with NDH II. However, only hnRNPs A1 and C were found together with NDH II and actin polymers during gel filtration. NDH II and hnRNP C from the HeLa nuclear extract coeluted with F-actin on Sepharose 4B in an RNase-resistant manner, whereas hnRNP A1 was nearly completely removed from F-actin-associated hnRNP complexes following RNA digestion. The association of NDH II and hnRNP C with F-actin was abolished by gelsolin, an F-actin-depolymerizing protein that fragments actin polymers into oligomers or monomers. Furthermore, NDH II co-immunoprecipitated with F-actin and hnRNP C, respectively. In vitro translated NDH II coeluted with F-actin on Sepharose 4B, whereas no coelution with F-actin was observed for in vitro translated hnRNP A1 or C1. Binding to F-actin requires an intact C terminus of NDH II and most likely a native protein conformation. Electron microscopy indicated a close spatial proximity among NDH II, hnRNP C, and F-actin within the HeLa nucleus. These results suggest an important function of NDH II in mediating the attachment of hnRNP-mRPP RNP complexes to the actin nucleoskeleton for RNA processing, transport, or other actin-related processes. nuclear DNA helicase II double-stranded RNA ribonucleoprotein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein small nuclear ribonucleoprotein messenger ribonucleoprotein Nuclear DNA helicase II (NDH II)1 is a nucleic-acid helicase that unwinds double-stranded DNA and RNA in a nucleotide-dependent manner (1Zhang S.

Ganetzky B. Baker B.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 935-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). NDH II comprises two double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding domains at the N terminus, a helicase catalytic domain in the central part, and a glycine-rich single-stranded nucleic acid-binding domain (RGG box) at the C terminus (9Gibson T.J. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2552-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that NDH II contains seven helicase core motifs that are conserved among the DEX(D/H) helicase superfamily (4Lee C.-G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16822-16830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zhang S. Maacke H. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16422-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NDH II displays significant similarities to a group of yeast pre-mRNA splicing factors, including prp2, prp16, andprp22 (4Lee C.-G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16822-16830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, nucleic-acid helicases may adopt an enzymatic mechanism that transforms energy from nucleotide hydrolysis into the mechanical work for protein translocation and/or disruption of nucleic acid duplices (11Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by a helicase are governed by two Walker nucleotide-binding motifs (A and B), which have been originally defined from several ATPases, including F1-ATPase, adenylate kinase, myosin, and RecA (12Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic data support the presence of a RecA-type topology in a DEX(D/H) protein, which implies a common mechanism involving nucleic acid binding and protein conformational changes coupled with ATP hydrolysis (13Story R.M. Li H. Abelson J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 1465-1470Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although NDH II shares sequence homology with DEXH proteins within its core helicase motifs, the protein carries two additional nucleic acid-binding domains, i.e. the two N-terminal dsRNA-binding domains and a C-terminal RGG box. This domain arrangement is reminiscent of the architectural features of some nucleic acid-binding proteins such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), many of which contain multiple copies of the RNP motif at the N terminus and/or an RGG box at the C terminus (14Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). A homolog of NDH II in Drosophila, designated maleless protein (MLE), participates in X chromosome dosage compensation, a process that leads to a 2-fold increase in transcription from the single X chromosome in males compared with the two individual X chromosomes in females (8Kuroda M.I. Kernan M.J. Kreber R. Ganetzky B. Baker B.S. Cell. 1991; 66: 935-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Transcriptional enhancement of the male X chromosome is driven by the cooperative functions of male specific lethal (MSL) proteins, MLE, and regulatory RNAs (ROX) transcribed from the same X chromosome (15Pannuti A. Lucchesi J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MLE possibly mediates protein-nucleic acid interactions for the assembly of X chromosomal regulatory complexes (16Kageyama Y. Mengus G. Gilfillan G. Kennedy H.G. Stuckenholz C. Kelley R.L. Becker P.B. Kuroda M.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2236-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to this sex-related function, MLE is required in both sexes for suppressing the aberrant splicing of thepara-Na+ channel pre-mRNA (17Reenan R.A. Hanrahan C.J. Ganetzky B. Neuron. 2000; 25: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which indicates a function of this protein in pre-mRNA processing. In mammals, NDH II is essential for embryonic development (18Lee C.-G. da Costa-Soares V. Newberger C. Manova K. Lacy E. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13709-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NDH II stimulates transcription by an interaction with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300 (19Nakajima T. Uchida C.

Nakajima T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4460-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). NDH II also binds to the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)-associated protein for its recruitment to the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (22Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence exists that NDH II is bound to the promoter-proximal sequence for the regulation of transcription (23Myöhänen S. Baylin S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1634-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or to RNA structures such as the transactivation response element (TAR), involved in human immunodeficiency virus gene expression (24Fujii R. Okamoto M. Aratani S. Oishi T. Ohshima T. Taira K. Baba M. Fukamizu A. Nakajima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5445-5451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The post-transcriptional functions of NDH II have been initially identified from its specific binding to the constitutive transport element of retroviral RNA (25Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). NDH II influences retroviral RNA splicing or transport, leading to an overall stimulation of the transcription level of retroviral RNAs (26Li J. Tang H. Mullen T.-M. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has been found that NDH II carries signal sequences at the C terminus that facilitate its shuttling through the nuclear pore complexes (27Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An involvement of NDH II in RNA transport has been supported by its physical interaction with the nuclear transport proteins HAP95 (28Yang J.P. Tang H. Reddy T.R. Wong-Staal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30694-30700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Tap (29Tang H. Wong-Staal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32694-32700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In search for the cellular functions of NDH II, we have previously investigated the localization of this protein in different mammalian cell lines (30Zhang S. Herrmann C. Grosse F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1055-1064PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhang S. Herrmann C. Grosse F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2693-2703PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have confirmed the close spatial relationship of NDH II to transcriptionally active loci, although NDH II is preferentially recruited to different gene types in different species, such as rDNA in the nucleolus of murine cells (31Zhang S. Herrmann C. Grosse F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2693-2703PubMed Google Scholar). Here we performed experiments to differentiate physical associations of NDH II with nuclear proteins involved in transcription, RNA processing, or transport. Surprisingly, this led to the finding that NDH II is a protein that directly binds to filamentous actin in the nucleus. NDH II was also found within hnRNP complexes attached to actin filaments. These results uncover an as yet unidentified function of NDH II, i.e. mediating the attachment of nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes to actin filaments, which may be related to RNA processing, transport, or other actin-dependent functions in the nucleus (32Rando O.J. Zhao K. Crabtree G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 92-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum against bovine NDH II was previously produced in our laboratory (5Zhang S. Maacke H. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16422-16427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum against human RNA helicase A was kindly donated by J. Hurwitz (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against hnRNPs A1 (4B10) and C (4F4) were provided by G. Dreyfuss (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the U5 snRNP-associated WD40 protein was a gift of R. Lührmann (Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysikalische Chemie, Göttingen, Germany). A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the N terminus of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A mouse monoclonal antibody against actin (2G2) was obtained from H. Hinssen (Department of Biochemical Cell Biology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany). The mouse monoclonal antibody C4 against actin was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). The mouse monoclonal antibody AC-15 and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against actin were obtained from Sigma. A pBluescript plasmid containing full-length NDH II cDNA was derived from a previously described screen of a human λ-ZAP cDNA library (10Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains the human full-length NDH II open reading frame together with an 80-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region and a 314-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region. Plasmids containing cDNA of hnRNP A1 (pBS01) and hnRNP C1 (pHC12) were as described (33Burd C.G. Swanson M.S. Görlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Human recombinant full-length NDH II proteins containing amino acids 1–1269 and NDH II deletion proteins containing amino acids 1–952, 313–1269, and 313–952, respectively, were constructed for baculovirus expression in insect cells (10Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All these baculovirus recombinant proteins carried a 6-His tag at the N terminus. A bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 953–1269 of NDH II has been described (10Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (C.C.Pro GmbH, Neustadt/Weinstrasse, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 320 × g for 10 min. After being washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl) and recentrifugation, the cell pellets were suspended at 1.5 ml/g in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na2S2O5, 250 mm sucrose, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Trasylol (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) and homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. After centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was extracted (0.5 ml/g) for 30 min in buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 10 mm Na2S2O5, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 350 mm NaCl, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. This step was repeated one more time, and the supernatants were combined as nuclear extract. HeLa nuclear extract was used directly for gel-filtration chromatography on Sepharose 4B or for partial purification of NDH II on Bio-Rex 70 and DEAE-Sepharose prior to chromatography on Sepharose 4B. Western blotting with rabbit antiserum against bovine NDH II was performed to monitor the elution of the helicase. Purification of NDH II (from ≈100 g of HeLa cell pellets) on Bio-Rex 70 and DEAE-Sepharose was performed as described (1Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NDH II eluted from DEAE-Sepharose was concentrated ≈10-fold by overnight dialysis against solid sucrose. Samples of 2 ml were then loaded onto Sepharose 4B (1 × 40 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (30 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Elution of Sepharose 4B was performed with buffer A at a flow rate of ≈0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the protein was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Protein pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and samples (2.5–5 μl from each fraction) were analyzed by Western blotting or by silver staining after SDS-PAGE. The elution volumes of Sepharose 4B were calibrated with the molecular mass standards blue dextran (2000 kDa) and bovine albumin (66 kDa). To examine direct protein-protein interactions in vitro, 5–10 μg of rabbit muscle actin (Sigma) was mixed with in vitro translated NDH II, hnRNP A1, or hnRNP C1 (see below) or with baculovirus-expressed NDH II in buffer containing 5 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the mixtures were chromatographed on Sepharose 4B (0.8 × 12 cm) in the same buffer. Eluted proteins (collected from 200 μl/fraction) were precipitated in the presence of 10% trichloroacetic acid and then dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected either by autoradiography of the [35S]methionine-labeled translation products or by immunoblotting of the baculovirus-expressed recombinant NDH II proteins with rabbit antiserum against NDH II. Western blot experiments were performed by electrophoresis of proteins on 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to a Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using a semidry electroblotter. Immunodetection was achieved with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Polyclonal antibodies against bovine NDH II, human RNA helicase A, RNA polymerase II, and the U5 snRNP-associated WD40 protein were each diluted 1:1000. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against hnRNPs A1 and C were each diluted 1:5000. Mouse monoclonal antibodies C4 and 2G2 against actin were diluted 1:1000 and 1:500, respectively. Both the biotinylated secondary antibody and the streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex were diluted 1:5000. F-actin was sedimented by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. Following protein precipitation in 10% trichloroacetic acid, the supernatant and pellet were both adjusted to the same volume with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (10 μl). Equal amounts (10 μl) of samples from the supernatant and pellet were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by silver staining or Western blotting. F-actin sedimentation assays were used to examine the effect of gelsolin (Sigma), which converts F-actin into shorter fragments or to actin monomers. In this experiment, 50 ng of gelsolin was added to the F-actin-containing solution in a volume of 50 μl (1.2 μg of F-actin, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.15 m KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the samples were processed for the sedimentation assay as described above. Immunoprecipitations were performed for HeLa nuclear proteins collected from the void fractions of Sepharose 4B. The HeLa cell pellet (∼1 g) was used to prepare HeLa nuclear extracts. The nuclear extract (2 ml) was immediately loaded onto Sepharose 4B for gel-filtration chromatography. Fractions 10–12 of the void volume were pooled (3 ml) and then divided into two samples of equal volume. One was mixed with mouse IgG as a control, and the other was mixed with anti-actin (AC-15) or anti-hnRNP C (4F4) monoclonal antibody, both bound to protein A-Sepharose (50 μl; Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany). Nonspecific binding was blocked by 5% milk powder in binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. The mixtures were shaken on ice for 2 h, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with a 10× bed volume of binding buffer and recentrifuged. This was repeated three times. Proteins were eluted by dissolving the pellet in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were examined by Western blot analysis. In vitrotranscription/translation of NDH II, hnRNP A1, and hnRNP C1 was performed with the TNT T7 or SP6 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The reactions were performed using T7 RNA polymerase for the pBluescript plasmid encoding full-length NDH II, as described above, and for the plasmid (pBS01) encoding hnRNP A1 (33Burd C.G. Swanson M.S. Görlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) or using SP6 RNA polymerase for the plasmid (pHC12) encoding hnRNP C1 (33Burd C.G. Swanson M.S. Görlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All translation products were radiolabeled by the incorporation of [35S]methionine. Post-embedding immunogold labeling of HeLa cells for electron microscopy was performed as described (30Zhang S. Herrmann C. Grosse F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1055-1064PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhang S. Herrmann C. Grosse F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2693-2703PubMed Google Scholar). Double immunogold labeling of HeLa cell ultrathin sections was performed with different combinations of mouse and rabbit primary antibodies against actin, NDH II, or hnRNP C, followed by incubation with a 5-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse IgG and a 10-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (Plano). The mouse monoclonal antibodies against actin (2G2) and hnRNP C (4F4) and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against actin were diluted 1:10, rabbit antiserum against NDH II was diluted 1:100. All gold-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted 1:100. An anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody was used for anti-actin monoclonal antibody 2G2. In-gel digestion of proteins by trypsin, isolation of individual tryptic peptides by reverse chromatography on Sephasil C18 2.1/10, and automated N-terminal amino acid sequencing were performed as described (34Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). In view of the current suggestions that NDH II may be involved in transcription by its interaction with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and in RNA processing or transport because of its specific binding to regulatory sequences of retroviral RNAs, we examined the association of NDH II with other nuclear proteins of human cells. The already established method for the purification of NDH II (1Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was adapted to follow NDH II-copurifying proteins during column chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 and DEAE-Sepharose, followed by gel filtration on Sepharose 4B to determine the apparent size of NDH II-containing complexes in comparison with other nuclear components (Fig.1A). A silver-stained gel of the partially purified proteins revealed the copurification and enrichment of a prominent protein with a molecular mass of ∼42 kDa (Fig. 1B, arrow). Western blotting revealed that NDH II eluted from Bio-Rex 70 at 300 mm NaCl and from DEAE-Sepharose at 320 mm NaCl (Fig. 1C). Simultaneously, we followed the elution of RNA polymerase II, hnRNPs A1 and C, and the U5 snRNP-associated WD40 protein (35Achsel T. Ahrens K. Brahms H. Teigelkamp S. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6756-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All these proteins could be detected in fractions that contained partially purified NDH II after chromatography on Bio-Rex 70 and DEAE-Sepharose (Fig. 1D). Unexpectedly, when fractionated by gel filtration, NDH II displayed two elution peaks. The earlier peak eluted with the void volume, corresponding to a molecular mass of ≥107 Da. The second peak corresponded to a molecular mass of oligomeric or monomeric NDH II (Fig.2A). SDS-PAGE was subsequently performed to examine proteins that coeluted with NDH II on Sepharose-4B. Silver staining revealed an abundant 42-kDa protein that came off with fractions containing NDH II eluting with the void volume (Fig. 2B). A gradual enrichment of this 42-kDa protein during purification of NDH II could also be seen (see Fig.1B). This 42-kDa protein was subjected to an in-gel trypsin digestion procedure, followed by the purification of tryptic products by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the separated oligopeptides. From three tryptic peptides, we obtained the partial amino acid sequences AGFAGDDAPR, DSYVGDEAQSK, and GYSFTTTAER. These sequences correspond to human β-actin (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number P02570) from amino acids 19 to 28, 51 to 61, and 197 to 206, respectively. Directed by this result, Western blot analysis with a mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin was performed. This confirmed that the 42-kDa protein was indeed β-actin (Fig.2C). The exclusion of 42-kDa β-actin from Sepharose 4B indicated a polymeric form, i.e. F-actin. Other nuclear proteins that accompanied NDH II on Bio-Rex 70 and DEAE-Sepharose were also examined for their elution positions on Sepharose 4B. Although ion-exchange column chromatography may lead to an enrichment of ribonucleases that causes the degradation of ribonucleoprotein complexes, a fraction of hnRNPs A1 and C remained excluded from Sepharose 4B together with NDH II and actin filaments, indicating a potential physical association between them (Fig. 2, E andF). In contrast, the elution of RNA polymerase II and the WD40 protein did not coincide with actin filaments under the same conditions (Fig. 2, D and G).Figure 2Partially purified NDH II coelutes with F-actin on Sepharose 4B. The NDH II-containing fractions from DEAE-Sepharose were chromatographed on Sepharose 4B. Two elution peaks of NDH II were detected by Western blotting (A). SDS-PAGE and silver staining were performed to visualize the eluted proteins (B). A 42-kDa protein that coeluted with the first NDH II peak was revealed as β-actin by N-terminal sequencing. This was further confirmed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against β-actin (C). Additional Western blotting was performed to examine the elution positions of RNA polymerase II (RNP Pol II; D), hnRNP C (E), hnRNP A1 (F), and the U5 snRNP-associated WD40 protein (G).

Here, we demonstrate that the wild type FEN-1 binds tightly to chromatin in conjunction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) recruitment after MMS treatment, and the nuclease-defective FEN-1 increased the sensitivity of the cells to methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) and to UV light but not to ionizing radiation. In contrast, the cells expressing the nuclease-defective and PCNA binding-defective double mutant FEN-1 exhibited sensitivities similar to those in the cells expressing the wild type FEN-1. MMS treatment caused a prolonged delay of S phase progression and impairment in colony-forming activity of cells expressing nuclease-defective FEN-1. A comet assay demonstrated that DNA repair after MMS or UV treatment was impaired in the cells expressing nuclease-deficient FEN-1 but not in the cells with double-mutated FEN-1. Taken together, these findings suggest that FEN-1 plays an essential role in the DNA repair processes in mammalian cells and that this activity of FEN-1 is PCNA-dependent.

The 5′-flap structure is a common DNA structural intermediate occurring during DNA replication, recombination, and repair. In eukaryotic DNA replication, displacement of an upstream primer by incoming polymerase can result in the formation of the 5′-flap structure (1Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henrichsen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In vitro, FEN-1 is highly active toward 5′-flap DNA. It acts as an endonuclease to cleave the displaced flap strand at the single strand/double strand junction. It also acts as a 5′–3′ exonuclease. Acting as an exonuclease, FEN-1 participates in hydrolysis of double-stranded DNA substrates containing a nick, gap, or 3′-overhang. During lagging strand DNA synthesis, RNA primers are removed by RNase H1. However, this enzyme cannot excise the final 5′-terminal ribonucleotide at the RNA-DNA junction. The completion of RNA primer removal by FEN-1 is essential for Okazaki fragment processing in reconstituted replication assays (2Robins R. Pappin D.J.C. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. J. Biol.

The 5′-flap intermediates are also formed during double-stranded break repair, homologous recombination, and excision repair (4Kim C.-Y. Shen B. Park M.S. Olah G.A. J. Biol.

To remove damage and maintain the integrity of the genome, a number of DNA repair pathways are provided. The major repair pathway in mammalian genomic DNA is thought to be the base excision repair (BER), although other pathways such as nucleotide excision repair, recombination repair, and translesion DNA synthesis can also be involved. BER is initiated by the enzymatic removal of the altered base or by chemical hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond connecting the damaged base to the sugar phosphate backbone. Recent evidence has indicated that BER in mammalian cells is mediated through at least two subpathways that are differentiated by their repair patch sizes and the enzymes involved and are designated as single-nucleotide BER and long patch BER (5Frosina G. Fortini P. Ross O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol.

The choice of subpathways in BER depends on whether the dRP intermediate can be efficiently removed by the polymerase β lyase activity to yield a 5′-phosphorylated DNA strand capable of serving as a substrate for DNA ligase (7Srivastava D.K.

https://openalex.org/W1999857129,"We cloned and characterized the rat homologue of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-interacting protein (WIP). Rat WIP shows 86% amino acid sequence identity to human WIP. Northern analyses revealed two major mRNA species of 5.0 and 3.8 kb, which were ubiquitously expressed, though predominantly in spleen and lung. Minor species of 2.4, 1.8, 1.4, and 1.1 kb were also detected in some tissues and cell lines. Thus, WIP is subject to tissue-specific alternative splicing. WIP bound to N-WASP in vivo, as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of WIP in rat fibroblasts revealed a clear co-localization with actin stress fibers. However, expression in tumor cells lacking actin cables did not restore these structures. Interestingly, co-expression of WIP and N-WASP resulted in redistribution of N-WASP, abrogating its dominant nuclear expression and leading to co-localization with WIP in the perinuclear area and with actin in membrane protrusions. Moreover, stress fibers and, concomitantly, the associated WIP were largely dissolved. Very similar effects were seen upon epidermal growth factor stimulation of serum-starved cells. Our results suggest that WIP might be involved in transmitting mitogenic signals to cytoskeletal functions, perhaps by modulating the subcellular localization of N-WASP. Interaction of N-WASP with WIP may in turn lead to mobilization of actin from stress fibers and nucleation of new actin filaments in filopodia.

Li R. Oegema K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 2Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F.

To fulfill these functions under appropriate situations, the cytoskeleton is linked to external as well as internal signals. Thus, mitogenic stimulation of cells may result in gross remodeling of the cytoarchitecture, governed by polymerization and depolymerization reactions, which in turn are mediated by associated factors such as gelsolin, myosin, actinin, etc. Molecules involved in translating extracellular stimuli to remodel the actin cytoskeleton include members of the Rho family of small GTPases, including Cdc42, Rac, and Rho (5Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5215) Google Scholar, 6Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Of these, Cdc42 induces filopodia formation, Rac regulates membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation, and Rho triggers the assembly of focal contacts and stress fibers (7Aspenström P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism at the molecular level by which these proteins induce assembly and disassembly of the actin filament system is not fully understood. One class of adaptor molecules that bind multiple signaling and cytoskeletal proteins is the WASP1 (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family. WASP was originally identified as a protein that was altered in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a genetic immunodeficiency disorder characterized by reduced mobility of lymphoid cells (8Ochs H.D. Slichter S.J. Harker L.A. Von Behrens W.E. Clark R.A. Wedgwood R.J. Blood. 1980; 55: 243-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian WASP family consists presently of five members, WASP itself, which is exclusively expressed in lymphoid tissues (9Derry J.M. Ochs H.D. Francke U. Cell. 1994; 78: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), neural WASP (N-WASP), which is predominantly expressed in brain but also in other tissues (10Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and the related protein group SCAR/WAVE1 (suppressor of cAMP receptor mutation/WASP family verprolin homologous protein 1) (11Bear J.E. Rawls J.F. Saxe C.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 12Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), WAVE2, and WAVE3 (13Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). WASP proteins have been recognized as key molecules transducing Cdc42- and Rac-dependent signals to filopodia and lamellipodia formation, respectively (12Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 14Bi E. Zigmond S.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 9: R160-R163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32531-32534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Due to its lymphoid-specific expression, WASP may perform some specialized function, perhaps in immune receptor signaling, since T lymphocytes of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients show diminished proliferative response to stimulation through the T cell receptor-CD3 complex (16Molina I.J. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Rosen F.S. Remold-O'Donnell E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4383-4390PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, N-WASP seems to be involved in general signal transduction, since it has been isolated by virtue of its interaction with Grb2, an SH2/SH3 domain-containing adapter that is directly linked to receptor tyrosin kinase (10Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it plays an important role in neurite extension (17Banzai Y. Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11987-11992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, since the majority of N-WASP is located in the nucleus (10Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 18Bear J.E. Krause M. Gertler F.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), its biological role remains obscure. Recently, a human WASP-interacting protein (WIP) was isolated in a two-hybrid screen (19Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). WIP is a proline-rich 503-amino acid protein. It binds to WASP within the NH2-terminal region, at a site distinct from the Cdc42-binding site. Interestingly, this region of WASP is frequently mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients (9Derry J.M. Ochs H.D. Francke U. Cell. 1994; 78: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar,20Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Thus, impairment of WASP-WIP interaction may contribute to the disease. Like WASP, WIP contains a number of putative SH3 domains, which might provide links to signaling molecules, and several domains implicated in binding, either directly or indirectly to actin (19Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Overexpression of WIP in human lymphoma BJAB cells led to accumulation of F-actin and induced actin-containing projections beneath the cell membrane, suggesting a role for WIP in actin polymerization. We isolated the rat homologue of the human WIP gene. Northern blotting analyses revealed extensive differential splicing in a tissue-specific manner. Expressing WIP as green fluorescence protein (GFP) or FLAG-tagged fusion protein in rat fibroblasts demonstrated a clear co-localization with the actin cytoskeleton, while N-WASP was predominantly in the nucleus. Interestingly, co-expression of WIP and N-WASP resulted in nuclear exclusion of N-WASP, partial dissolution of the actin cytoskeleton, and formation of filopodia. Similar effects were seen upon EGF stimulation. These data suggest that WIP might be a regulator of N-WASP and that both proteins contribute to the dynamic changes of the actin cytoskeleton in response to appropriate signals. Normal rat embryo fibroblast (REF52.2) cells, the tumor cell lines TZ102, TZ103, and TZ107 derived from SV40 large T-antigen (LT)-induced rat brain tumors and the LT-immortalized E14-2 rat fetal brain cells (21Weggen S. Bayer T.A. Koch A. Salewski H. Scheidtmann K.H. Pietsch T. Wiestler O.D. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 10% CO2. PC12 (pheochromocytoma) cells were grown on collagen-coated plates in RPMI (Invitrogen) containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum at 5% CO2. The generation of the cDNA library and the two-hybrid screening have been described previously (22Klawitz I. Preuss U. Scheidtmann K.H. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from TZ103 cells, reverse-transcribed, and inserted into the HybriZAPTMvector (23Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) using the ZAPExpressTM cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Two-hybrid screening was performed with the large T-antigen cDNA fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain as bait. His and LacZ-positive clones were isolated and the cDNA inserts were further analyzed by cloning and sequencing (22Klawitz I. Preuss U. Scheidtmann K.H. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). For the isolation of the full-length WIP cDNA, a 1100-bp cDNA fragment was labeled by random primer labeling with [α-32P]dCTP (Megaprime Labeling Kit, Amersham Biosciences Inc., Freiburg, Germany) and used as probe for screening the TZ103 cDNA library. One of the positive clones containing an insert of 3.8 kb was regarded full-length and completely sequenced (MWG Biotech, Munich, Germany). Sequence comparisons were performed with the EMBL Gene Data Base using the BLAST analysis program. For further analyses, rat WIP was expressed as GFP or FLAG-tagged fusion protein in mammalian cells. To this end, a 1681-bp fragment, including the complete coding region of the WIP cDNA, was amplified by PCR with primers containing either PstI orXbaI restriction sites and cloned into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) or into pCMV-Tag 2B expression vector (Stratagene) to generate NH2-terminal fusion proteins with EGFP or FLAG (denoted GFP-WIP or FLAG-WIP, respectively). Likewise, a COOH-terminally truncated form of WIP coding for the NH2-terminal 400 amino acids was cloned into pCMV-Tag 2B to yield FLAG-WIP400, thus lacking the WASP binding region. Blotting membranes containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane from eight different rat tissues (CLONTECH) or 26 μg of total RNA from various cell lines, respectively, were used for Northern analyses. Filters were prehybridized and hybridized in 50% deionized formamide, 2× Denhardt's, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 100 μg/ml tRNA. Blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with different [α-32P]dCTP-labeled WIP cDNA fragments, as specified in the text, and processed according to standard procedures (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After autoradiography, the membranes were dehybridized by immersion in boiling 0.1% SDS, and a further round of hybridization was performed with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe. REF52.2 cells and COS-7 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104cells onto coverslips and transiently transfected with 100 ng each of GFP-WIP, FLAG-WIP, or FLAG-WIP400 expression vectors or co-transfected with any of the former and the following N-WASP constructs, pcDL-SRαII-N-WASP (10Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T.

Way (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). Transfections were perfomed with LipofectAMINETM(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 42 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. The cells were treated with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and stained with an affinity-purified polyclonal N-WASP antibody (10Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T.

As secondary antibodies, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used at 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 30 min. Actin staining was performed either with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) at room temperature for 15 min. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min and subsequently washed, as described above. Cells were examined with an Axiophot fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and a 63× oil immersion objective. For extraction experiments, WIP-transfected cells were treated with 0.1% to 1% Trition X-100 in microtubule-stabilizing buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6,9, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 4% polyethylene glycol) for 10 s to 1 min immediately before fixation. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with 7.5 μg of FLAG vector, FLAG-WIP, FLAG-WIP400, and with the same amount of N-WASP expression vector as described above. 42 h post-transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine (specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences Inc.) per 9-cm culture dish in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal calf serum for 2 h. After labeling, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in isotonic lysis buffer (10 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 50 μmleupeptin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Stratagene) or with the N-WASP polyclonal antibody (10Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was added and incubated for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to standard protocols. Proteins were visualized by fluorography. The 3′-untranslated region of the rat WIP cDNA was originally identified as an apparently false positive clone in a yeast two-hybrid screen intended to search for novel interaction partners of SV40 LT (22Klawitz I. Preuss U. Scheidtmann K.H. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the 5′ portion of this 1.1-kb cDNA clone showed 83% sequence identity to a murine expressed sequence tag of 407 bp (data base number AA62345.emest16). Northern analysis (see below) indicated that our clone was incomplete. Using the 1.1-kb cDNA fragment as probe, we screened a cDNA library from TZ103 cells and identified 10 positive clones out of 200,000, one of which, containing an insert of 3.8 kb, was further analyzed. Sequence analysis revealed 3797 nucleotides with an open reading frame for 487 amino acids. Search in the GenBankTM data base revealed that the isolated cDNA clone was 82% identical to human WIP cDNA (Ref. 19Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, accession number AF031588; Ref. 26Stewart D.M. Tian L. Nelson D.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5019-5024PubMed Google Scholar, accession number NM_003387), and to Prpl2, a partial human cDNA sequence isolated from tonsillar B cells (accession number X86019). Sequence alignment of our original two-hybrid cDNA clone revealed that it was derived from the 3′-untranslated region of the 3.8-kb cDNA, thus excluding the possibility that WIP does interact with LT. Fig. 1 shows alignments of the deduced amino acid sequence of rat WIP with the human homologues Prpl2 and WIP. The sequences of the human proteins are identical except for one additional valine residue at position 361 in Prpl2 and the COOH terminus, where the last 7 residues in Prpl2 are replaced by 17 different residues in WIP. The rat sequence is identical to human WIP at these positions. It is possible that the Prpl2 protein represents a splicing variant (see below). In the following text we will refer only to the sequence of Ramesh et al. (19Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The rat and human WIP proteins show an overall sequence identity of 86% with some gaps in the rat versus the human protein. Generally, the protein is extremely rich in proline and glycine. Forty-two glycine residues are clustered between amino acids 64 and 221, whereas the proline residues are distributed throughout the molecule. Furthermore, there are particular sequence modules that are completely identical between rat and human WIP, some of which occur several times. There are two so-called verprolin homology (VH) domains, also referred to as WASP homology (WH-2) domains (residues 32–60 and 92–108), that occur also in its binding partners WASP and N-WASP. The VH domain binds actin and, in cooperation with the cofilin homology and the acidic domains, participates in activation of the Arp2/3 complex (27Mullins R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Within the first VH domain, the WIP proteins share a KLKK motif, marked by asterisks, which has been implicated in actin binding (29Van Troys M. Dewitte D. Goethals M. Carlier M.F. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the proteins contain three copies of the unique proline-rich motif GRSGPXPPXP. Two copies of this motif are also present in WASP proteins and have been implicated in binding to SH3 domain-containing proteins,i.e. Src, Fyn, Fgr, and phospholipase Cγ1 (30Banin S. Truong O. Katz D.R. Waterfield M.D. Brickell P.M. Gout I. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 981-988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Finan P.M. Soames C.J. Wilson L. Nelson D.L. Stewart D.M. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26291-26295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Finally, the WIP proteins contain several identical APPPPP sequences, so-called actin-based motility sequences (ABM-2 motifs), required for binding to profilin, a protein that regulates actin polymerization (32Purich D.L. Southwick F.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the human and rat cDNAs differ greatly in their 3′-untranslated regions. In contrast to 82% identity in the coding region, they show only 72% sequence identity in the 3′-untranslated region. However, the human sequence extends only for 365 nucleotides, while our rat cDNA continues for additional 1810 nucleotides. The differences may reflect alternative splicing variants (see below). The complete sequence of the 3.8-kb rat WIP cDNA has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base, accession number AJ303456. When we probed a multiple tissue Northern blot with a probe derived from the 5′ end of the coding region of rat WIP cDNA (nucleotides 49–561), we detected two major WIP-related transcripts with estimated sizes of 5.0 and 3.8 kb, the 5.0-kb species being the most prominent one (Fig. 2). These presumably represent alternative splice forms as also seen in human tissues (19Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Expression of these two transcripts was highest in spleen and lung, less prominent in heart, brain, liver, and kidney, and rather low in testis. Identical results were obtained with the complete coding sequence as probe. However, the precise relative abundance is difficult to judge, because glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is commonly used as reference has clearly different expression levels in the different tissues (see lower panel in Fig. 2). Since identical results were obtained with another blot, we assume that equal amounts of mRNA had been loaded on these blots. Interestingly, a large transcript of 6.9 kb was specific for skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observed signals at ∼2.4 kb in liver, at 1.8 kb in testis, and at 1.4 kb in heart, liver, and testis. They all may represent alternatively spliced transcripts of the WIP gene (see below and “Discussion”). Our data are in general agreement with those of Ramesh et al. (19Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) on human WIP showing ubiquitous expression of three mRNA species of 5.0, 3.5, and 2.4 kb, the former with highest abundance. The 6.9-kb species in skeletal muscle and the smaller transcripts have not been mentioned by these authors. We next wanted to see whether the pattern of WIP transcripts observed in rat tissues was resembled in cell line TZ103, the origin of the isolated cDNA clone. For comparison, we included an additional tumor cell line, TZ102, and two nontransformed cell lines, E14-2 and TZ107 (21Weggen S. Bayer T.A. Koch A. Salewski H. Scheidtmann K.H. Pietsch T. Wiestler O.D. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). Using the same 5′ probe as above (designated WIP1 in Fig. 3A), we detected five mRNA species, the two prominent species of 5.0 and 3.8 kb, as above, and at least three additional species of 2.4, 1.8, and 1.1 kb. The 1.4-kb transcript was not seen. To investigate whether these minor transcripts indeed represent splicing variants or transcripts of related genes, we employed additional probes from the coding region as well as from the 3′-untranslated region that together span almost the entire sequence of our WIP cDNA clone (WIP1, nucleotides 49–561; WIP2, nucleotides 589–1059; WIP3, nucleotides 1059–1408; WIP4, nucleotides 1618–1972; and WIP5, nucleotides 2521–3620, respectively). The probes originating from the 3′-untranslated region (WIP4 and WIP5) hybridized only with the 5.0- and 3.8-kb mRNA species, indicating that the smaller transcripts lacked (most of) the 3′-untranslated regions (data not shown). Interestingly, hybridization with fragments from the coding region (WIP1–3) revealed distinct patterns for each probe. They all hybridized equally with the 5.0- and 3.8-kb transcripts (Fig.3A), but differentially with the smaller transcripts. Thus, the WIP2 fragment hybridized only with the 1.8-kb transcript, present in all cell lines, while WIP3 hybridized only with the 1.4-kb transcript in addition to the 5.0- and 3.8-kb transcripts. Interestingly, the 1.4-kb transcript was the most abundant WIP transcript in E14-2 cells. These data are summarized in Fig.3B. Included is a schematic representation of the putative exon composition of the coding region of rat WIP cDNA, as deduced from the genomic structure of the human WIP gene (compare accession numbers AF031588 and NT_005182). The positions of the three probes (WIP1, -2, and -3) used in this study are indicated below. The coding region of the human WIP gene includes exons 2–8 with the start and stop codons in exons 2 and 8, respectively. From this structure, we derived the putative exon composition of the different splicing variants. Thus, the 5.0- and the 3.8-kb transcripts include all exons, whereas the 2.4- and the 1.1-kb species apparently miss exons 5–7, the 1.8-kb species only exons 6 and 7. Moreover, the difference in size between the 1.1- and the 1.8-kb species corresponds exactly with the size of exon 5 (736 bp). The 1.4-kb transcript only consists of exons 6 and 7. Taken together, these results indicate that WIP is subject to extensive alternative splicing resulting in at least seven different species. Of these, the smaller species not only lack the 3′-untranslated region but differ in their coding region, too. The possible consequences of differential splicing are discussed below. To analyze the subcellular localization of WIP, we employed a GFP-WIP fusion construct. This construct was transfected into REF52.2 cells, and its localization was examined by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig.4A, GFP alone exhibited a diffuse distribution, filling the entire cell, as previously reported (33Pines J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 326-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, GFP-WIP (Fig. 4C) showed a diffuse enrichment in the perinuclear area, which was superimposed by a filamentous pattern, resembling actin fibers. Indeed, co-staining the transfected cells with TRITC-labeled phalloidin, which specifically binds to F-actin (34Wulf E. Deboben A. Bautz F.A. Faulstich H. Wieland T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4498-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), revealed an identical pattern (Fig.4D) indicating that rat WIP co-localized with actin filaments. Compared with neighboring untransfected cells, there was no obvious alteration of the actin network upon ectopic expression of GFP or GFP-WIP (Fig. 4, B and D). Identical results were obtained with COS-7 cells, the only difference being that COS-7 cells contained fewer and shorter stress fibers (data not shown). To ensure that the observed co-localization of GFP-WIP with actin filaments was not influenced by the GFP fusion partner, we employed a FLAG-tagged WIP fusion protein in our studies. As shown in Fig.4E, the subcellular distribution of FLAG-WIP was identical to that of GFP-WIP, again without a noticeable effect on actin fibers (Fig. 4F). We further included a truncated WIP mutant (denoted FLAG-WIP400) containing the actin binding KLKK motif and two profilin binding ABM-2 sequences, but lacking the WASP binding region, which in human WIP was mapped to amino acids 417–503 (19Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Hartwig J.H. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14671-14676Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this case, association with actin fibers was even more pronounced (Fig. 4,G and H) often accompanied with thickening of stress fibers (compare the transfected and surrounding cells in Fig.4H). These results demonstrate a direct association of WIP with the actin cytoskeleton in vivo. Whether WIP binds directly to actin or merely to actin-associated proteins cannot be deduced from this study. To address this issue, we mutated the putative actin interaction motif, KLKK in the NH2-terminal region. Surprisingly, this mutant associated with actin fibers like wild-type WIP (data not shown). To investigate whether wild-type an"

Here we show that the intracellular parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi encodes a complete mRNA capping apparatus consisting of separate triphosphatase (EcCet1), guanylyltransferase (EcCeg1), and methyltransferase (Ecm1) enzymes, which we characterize biochemically and genetically. The triphosphatase EcCet1 belongs to a metal-dependent phosphohydrolase family that includes the triphosphatase components of the capping apparatus of fungi, DNA viruses, and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. These enzymes are structurally and mechanistically unrelated to the metal-independent cysteine phosphatase-type RNA triphosphatases found in metazoans and plants. Our findings support the proposed evolutionary connection between microsporidia and fungi, and they place fungi and protozoa in a common lineage distinct from that of metazoans and plants.

RNA triphosphatase presents an attractive target for antiprotozoal/antifungal drug development. dithiothreitol wild-type 5-fluoroorotic acid The 5′ cap is a distinctive feature of eukaryotic mRNA. The cap consists of 7-methyl guanosine linked via an inverted 5′-5′ triphosphate bridge to the initiating nucleoside of the transcript. Cellular mRNAs are capped via three enzymatic reactions. (i) The 5′ triphosphate end of the nascent pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA 5′ triphosphatase, (ii) the diphosphate RNA end is capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase, and (iii) the GpppN cap is methylated by RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Although the three capping reactions are universal in eukaryotes, there is a surprising diversity in the genetic organization of the cap-forming enzymes in “lower” versus “higher” eukaryotes, as well as a complete divergence in the structure and catalytic mechanism of the RNA triphosphatase component (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Metazoans and plants have a two-component capping system consisting of a bifunctional triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase polypeptide and a separate methyltransferase polypeptide, whereas fungi and the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum have a three-component system consisting of separate triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and methyltransferase gene products (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar, 2Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The primary structures and biochemical mechanisms of the fungal and mammalian guanylyltransferases and cap methyltransferases are conserved. However, the atomic structures and catalytic mechanisms of the fungal and mammalian RNA triphosphatases are completely different (3Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Metazoan and plant RNA triphosphatases belong to the cysteine phosphate enzyme superfamily, which is defined by the conserved phosphate-binding loop motif HCXXXXXR(S/T). Mammalian RNA triphosphatase catalyzes a two-step ping-pong phosphoryl transfer reaction in which the conserved cysteine of the signature motif attacks the γ phosphorus of triphosphate-terminated RNA to form a covalent protein-cysteinyl-S-phosphate intermediate and expel the diphosphate RNA product (4Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate is hydrolyzed to liberate inorganic phosphate. The reaction does not require a divalent cation cofactor. In contrast, the RNA triphosphatases of fungal species such asSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, andSchizosaccharomyces pombe are strictly dependent on a divalent cation. The fungal enzymes belong to a new family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that embraces the triphosphatase components of the poxvirus, baculovirus,Chlorella virus, and P. falciparum mRNA capping systems (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar, 2Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Ho C.K.

The signature biochemical property of this enzyme family is the ability to hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates and inorganic phosphate in the presence of manganese or cobalt. The defining structural features of the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases are two glutamate-containing motifs (β1 and β11 in Fig. 1) that are required for catalysis by every family member and that comprise the metal-binding site. The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase Cet1 revealed a novel tertiary structure in which the active site is situated within a topologically closed hydrophilic tunnel composed of eight antiparallel β strands (3Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The β strands comprising the tunnel walls are displayed over the Cet1 protein sequence in Fig. 1. Each of the eight strands contributes at least one functional constituent of the active site (7Pei Y.

The 15 individual side chains within the tunnel that are important for Cet1 function in vitro and in vivo are denoted bydots in Fig. 1. When and how did the RNA triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus diverge during eukaryotic evolution, and can the differences in the organization of the capping apparatus provide a useful guide to phylogenetic relationships among taxa? We are pursuing these questions by systematically identifying the cap-forming enzymes of unicellular eukaryotes and evaluating their structural and mechanistic relatedness to exemplary fungal, viral, and mammalian enzymes. Initial studies revealed that the triphosphatase of the protozoan parasite P. falciparum belongs to the yeast-like RNA triphosphatase family (2Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we undertook a “post-genomics” inquiry into the capping apparatus of the microsporidian organism Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Microsporidia are amitochondrial obligate intracellular parasites that cause disease in animals and humans (13Vivarès C.P. Méténier G. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). E. cuniculi, which infects a variety of mammalian hosts, has the smallest genome of any eukaryotic organism characterized to date, consisting of ∼2900 kbp of DNA organized in 11 chromosomes (14Katinka M.D. Duprat S. Cornillot E. Méténier G. Thormarat F. Prensier G. Barbe V. Peyretaillade E. Brottier P. Wincker P. Delbac F. El Alaoui H. Peyret P. Saurin W. Gouy M. Weissenbach J. Vivarès C.P. Nature. 2001; 414: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Complete sequencing of the E. cuniculi genome reveals a highly compact arrangement of 1997 potential protein-coding genes (14Katinka M.D. Duprat S. Cornillot E. Méténier G. Thormarat F. Prensier G. Barbe V. Peyretaillade E. Brottier P. Wincker P. Delbac F. El Alaoui H. Peyret P. Saurin W. Gouy M. Weissenbach J. Vivarès C.P. Nature. 2001; 414: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar).E. cuniculi encodes a multisubunit RNA polymerase II with a prototypal carboxyl-terminal domain on its largest subunit consisting of 13 tandem repeats of the heptapeptide YSPTSPS. Among its many known or imputed functions, the carboxyl-terminal domain acts as a landing pad for the targeting of the mRNA capping apparatus to the transcription elongation complex (15Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12758-12760Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The pertinent questions about capping in this intracellular parasite are as follows. (i) Does E. cuniculi encode a full set of mRNA capping enzymes, or might it acquire one or more capping enzymes from the host organism? (ii) If E. cuniculi does encode its own capping apparatus, how are the components organized genetically (separately encoded as in fungi or fused as in metazoans, plants, and poxviruses)? (iii) Is the triphosphatase component related to the cysteine-phosphatase metazoan-type enzymes or to the metal-dependent yeast-type enzymes? Using genomic sequence information to identify candidate capping enzymes, and biochemical and genetic approaches to establish their activities, we show that E. cuniculi has a complete three-component capping system similar to that of fungi. The evolutionary implications are discussed. The EcCEG1, EcCET1, andECM1 genes encoding the putative RNA guanylyltransferase, RNA triphosphatase, and RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase enzymes were amplified by PCR from E. cuniculi genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce an NcoI restriction site at the translation initiation codon and aBamHI site 3′ of the translation stop codon of each gene. The PCR products were digested with NcoI andBamHI and then inserted between the NcoI andBamHI sites of the yeast shuttle vector pYX132 (CEN TRP1) to generate pYX132-EcCEG1, pYX132-EcCET1, and pYX132-ECM1, respectively. The plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the E. cuniculi gene inserts were identical to the genomic DNA sequences (14Katinka M.D. Duprat S. Cornillot E. Méténier G. Thormarat F. Prensier G. Barbe V. Peyretaillade E. Brottier P. Wincker P. Delbac F. El Alaoui H. Peyret P. Saurin W. Gouy M. Weissenbach J. Vivarès C.P. Nature. 2001; 414: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Expression of the E. cuniculi genes in these plasmids is under the control of the constitutive yeast TPI1promoter. A yeast 2μ vector bearing EcCEG1 was constructed by transferring an AatII-NheI fragment from pYX132-EcCEG1 into pYX232 (2μ TRP1) to generate pYX232-EcCEG1. Expression of the EcCEG1 gene in the 2μ vector driven is by the TPI1 promoter. Alanine substitution mutations were introduced into the EcCEG1, EcCET1, andECM1 genes by the PCR-based two-stage overlap extension method. The mutated genes were inserted into pYX132. The resulting pYX132-EcCEG1-Ala, pYX132-EcCET1-Ala, and pYX132-ECM1-Ala plasmid inserts were sequenced completely to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. The EcCEG1-K63A mutant was transferred into the 2μ TRP1 vector to generate pYX232-EcCEG1-K63A. An NcoI-BamHI fragment containing the EcCET1 reading frame was excised from pYX132-EcCET1 and then inserted between the NcoI andBamHI sites of the customized T7 RNA polymerase-based vector pET16bNco (which contains an NcoI site instead of theNdeI in pET16b) so as to fuse the EcCet1 polypeptide in-frame with an NH2-terminal 21-amino acid leader peptide containing 10 tandem histidines. pET16 plasmids encoding EcCet1-Ala mutants were constructed by transfer of the EcCET1-Ala genes from pYX132 plasmids as described for the wild-type gene. The pET-EcCet1 and pET-EcCet1-Ala plasmids were introduced intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3). A 500-ml culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-EcCet1 was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached 0.6. The culture was placed on ice for 30 min and then adjusted to 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% (v/v) ethanol. After further incubation for 17 h at 18 °C with constant shaking, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 300 μm and 100 μg/ml, respectively. After incubation on ice for 30 min, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1% and the lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 18,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble extract was mixed for 30 min with 1 ml of Ni+2-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm imidazole. The slurry was poured into a column, and the resin was washed with 10 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and 5 mm imidazole. EcCet1 was then step-eluted with 1-ml aliquots of 10, 50, 100, and 200 mm imidazole in buffer B. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The 200 mmimidazole eluate fraction containing EcCet1 was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT,1 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and then stored at −80 °C. The EcCet1-Ala mutants were purified using the same procedure. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. A BamHI fragment containing the EcCEG1 gene was inserted into the BamHI site of pET28-His6-Smt3 (a gift of Chris Lima, Cornell Medical College) so as to fuse the EcCeg1 polypeptide in-frame to the NH2-terminal His6-Smt3 leader. The pET-His6-Smt3-EcCeg1 plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). A 500-ml culture was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin until theA600 reached 0.6. The culture was placed on ice for 30 min and then adjusted to 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% (v/v) ethanol. After further incubation for 17 h at 18 °C with constant shaking, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C. The cells were lysed, and the His6-Smt3-EcCeg1 protein was purified as described above for His10-EcCet1. We identified a candidate RNA triphosphatase gene on E. cuniculi chromosome 4 encoding a 221-amino acid polypeptide with primary structural similarity to the catalytic domain of fungal, viral, and Plasmodium RNA triphosphatases. We named this E. cuniculi gene product EcCet1 (for E.cuniculicappingenzyme triphosphatase 1). EcCet1 is slightly larger than the “minimal” RNA triphosphatase ofChlorella virus PBCV-1 (193 amino acids), but is considerably smaller than the RNA triphosphatases of S. cerevisiae (Cet1; 549 amino acids), C. albicans(CaCat1; 520 amino acids), and S. pombe (Pct1; 303 amino acids). Cet1 and CaCet1 contain large nonessential NH2-terminal extensions (8Pei Y. Lehman K. Tian L. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1885-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Shuman S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and EcCet1. EcCet1 includes the two metal-binding motifs characteristic of the fungal, viral, and Plasmodiumtriphosphatases, plus putative homologs of all of the other β strands that comprise the active site tunnel of Cet1 (Fig.1). Fourteen of the 15 hydrophilic amino acids that are essential for catalysis by Cet1 are conserved in theE. cuniculi polypeptide. The EcCET1 gene was cloned into a T7 RNA polymerase-based pET vector so as to place the open reading frame in-frame with an NH2-terminal His tag. The expression plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3), a strain that contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of thelac promoter. A new ∼30-kDa polypeptide corresponding to His-EcCet1 was detectable by SDS-PAGE in extracts of IPTG-induced bacteria bearing the pET-EcCet1 plasmid (data not shown). Initial purification of the His-EcCet1 protein was achieved by adsorption to nickel-agarose and elution with 200 mm imidazole. The nickel-agarose preparation was highly enriched with respect to the EcCet1 polypeptide, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2A). We found that recombinant EcCet1 catalyzed the release of32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of manganese and that the extent of ATP hydrolysis was proportional to enzyme concentration; the substrate was hydrolyzed completely at saturating enzyme (Fig. 2B). There was no detectable ATP hydrolysis in the absence of a divalent cation (Fig.3A). Hydrolysis of 1 mm ATP was optimal at 2 mm MnCl2and declined slightly at 3–5 mm MnCl2 (Fig.3A). Cobalt also satisfied the metal requirement and activity was optimal at 2–4 mm CoCl2. No activity was observed when the manganese and cobalt concentrations were below the level of input ATP. Magnesium failed to support ATP hydrolysis at up to 5 mm concentration (Fig.3A). Specificity for NTP hydrolysis in the presence of manganese and cobalt is characteristic (indeed, virtually diagnostic) of the fungal-type RNA triphosphatase family. The rate of release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP was identical to the rate of conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP in a parallel reaction mixture containing the same concentration of EcCet1 (Fig.3B). We detected no formation of [α-32P]AMP during the reaction. Hence, we conclude that EcCet1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. EcCet1 also converts [α-32P]GTP to [α-32P]GDP (data not shown). Kinetic parameters for EcCet1 were determined by measuring the extent of 32Pi formation during a 15-min reaction as a function of input [γ-32P]ATP concentration in the range of 3–200 μm (Fig. 3C). A double-reciprocal plot of the data fit well to a linear function (Fig. 3C,inset). We calculated a Km of 96 μm ATP and a kcat of 3 s−1. The turnover number of EcCet1 in ATP hydrolysis is lower than the values reported for Cet1 (25 s−1), CaCet1 (17 s−1), and Pct1 (67 s−1), but is in the same range as that noted for S. cerevisiae Cth1 (2 s−1) and Chlorella virus cvRtp1 (1.5 s−1). The Km of EcCet1 for ATP (96 μm) is higher than the values reported for other family members: Cet1 (3 μm), cvRtp1 (7 μm), CaCet1 (9 μm), and Cth1 (75 μm). EcCet1 residues Glu-32 and Glu-34 in β1 and Glu-193 and Glu-195 in β11 (Fig. 1) were replaced individually by alanine. The E32A, E34A, E193A, and E195 proteins were expressed as His-tagged fusions and purified from soluble bacterial lysates by Ni-agarose chromatography. The purity of the recombinant E32A, E34A, E193A, and E195A proteins was comparable with that of wild-type EcCet1 (Fig. 2A). The E32A, E34A, E193A, and E195A mutants were unable to hydrolyze [γ-32P]ATP even at a level of input enzyme (400 ng) that sufficed for quantitative release of32Pi by wild-type EcCet1 (Fig. 2B). Using these data, we calculated that the specific ATPase activities of E32A, E34A, E193A, and E195A were <0.1% of the activity of wild-type enzyme. The four essential glutamates are broadly conserved in the RNA triphosphatases encoded by fungi, Plasmodium, andChlorella virus (Fig. 1) and in the RNA triphosphatase of poxviruses, African swine fever virus, and baculoviruses (9Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5486-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of Cet1, three of the essential glutamates directly coordinate the manganese at the active site, and the fourth essential glutamate coordinates a water molecule bound to the metal (3Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The β1 and β11 strands of the Cet1 comprise the “floor” of the tunnel and consist of alternating charged side chains interdigitated with alternating aliphatic/aromatic side chains (Fig. 1). The hydrophilic face is pointed into the tunnel and comprises the metal binding site, whereas the hydrophobic face points down into the globular core of the protein upon which the tunnel rests. This hydrophilic/hydrophobic sequence pattern is reprised in EcCet1 (Fig. 1) and suggests that the structural context for its metal-binding site is similar to that of Cet1. The native size of recombinant EcCet1 was analyzed by sedimentation of the protein through a 15–30% glycerol gradient. Marker proteins catalase (248 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and cytochrome c (13 kDa) were included as internal standards in the same gradient. After centrifugation, the polypeptide compositions of the gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). A plot of the S values of the three standards versus fraction number yielded a straight line (not shown). His-EcCet1 (a 28-kDa polypeptide) sedimented as a single peak coincident with bovine serum albumin. We surmise that EcCet1 is a homodimer. The triphosphatase activity profile paralleled the abundance of the EcCet1 polypeptide (Fig. 4). The same distribution of EcCet1 protein and ATPase activity was observed when the enzyme was sedimented in the absence of internal standards (data not shown). The homodimeric quaternary structure of EcCet1 is a feature that is shared with the RNA triphosphatases ofS. cerevisiae and S. pombe (3Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Pei Y. Schwer B. Hausmann S. Shuman S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14996-15002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We identified a candidate mRNA guanylyltransferase gene on E. cuniculi chromosome 9 encoding a 364-amino acid polypeptide with extensive similarity to fungal, protozoal, metazoan, and virus-encoded RNA guanylyltransferases (Fig. 5A). We named thisE. cuniculi gene product EcCeg1 (forE.cuniculicappingenzyme guanylyltransferase). EcCeg1 is intermediate in size between the “minimal” guanylyltransferase ofChlorella virus PBCV-1 (330 amino acids) and the RNA guanylyltransferases of S. cerevisiae (Ceg1; 459 amino acids), S. pombe (Pce1; 402 amino acids), and C. albicans (Cgt1; 449 amino acids). EcCeg1 contains the six conserved peptide motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, V, and VI) that comprise the active site of GTP binding and nucleotidyl transfer (Fig.5A) (19Håkansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the experiments presented below, we test biochemically and genetically whether EcCeg1 has the requisite activities of a cap-forming enzyme in vivo and in vitro. Recombinant EcCeg1 was produced in bacteria as a His6-Smt3 fusion protein (21Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and isolated from a soluble bacterial extract by nickel-agarose chromatography. The 58-kDa His6-Smt3-EcCeg1 polypeptide adsorbed to the affinity resin and was eluted with 50–200 mm imidazole (Fig. 5B). All known cellular guanylyltransferases employ a ping-pong reaction mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer through a covalent enzyme-(lysyl-N)-GMP intermediate (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, guanylyltransferase activity can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity by label transfer from [α-32P]GTP to the enzyme. To assay guanylyltransferase activity of the expressed EcCeg1 protein, we incubated the initial soluble bacterial extract and the nickel-agarose column fractions with [α-32P]GTP and a divalent cation. This resulted in the formation of an SDS-stable ∼58-kDa nucleotidyl-protein adduct (Fig.5B). The guanylyltransferase activity eluted in parallel with the His6-Smt3-EcCeg1 protein. Initial characterization of the guanylyltransferase activity was performed using the nickel-agarose fraction. Formation of the covalent intermediate required a divalent cation cofactor, either magnesium or manganese (data not shown). The reaction was specific for GTP, insofar as we could detect no formation of a protein-NMP complex during reaction of EcCeg1 with [α-32P]ATP (data not shown). As there are no methods available to manipulate the E. cuniculi genome in vivo, it is not possible to test directly whether the EcCEG1 gene is essential for E. cuniculi viability or to assess its role in mRNA metabolism. To circumvent this problem, we exploited a yeast-based system for genetic analysis of heterologous capping enzymes (22Shuman S. Liu Y. Schwer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12046-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Saha N. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16553-16562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The system provides the capacity to answer the following questions concerning the EcCeg1. Can the E. cuniculi protein function in the cap-synthetic pathway and sustain the growth of yeast cells that lack the endogenous mRNA guanylyltransferase Ceg1? If so, does complementation of the yeast ceg1Δ mutation byEcCEG1 depend on its catalytic activity in cap formation? We cloned the EcCEG1 gene into a yeast 2μ TRP1plasmid under the transcriptional control of the constitutive yeastTPI1 promoter. The function of the EcCEG1 gene was tested by plasmid shuffle in yeast ceg1Δ cells that contain CEG1 on a CEN URA3 plasmid. Theceg1Δ strain is unable to form colonies on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), a drug that selects against theURA3 plasmid, unless it is transformed with a second plasmid bearing CEG1 or a functional homolog from another source. We found that 2μ EcCEG1 supported the growth ofceg1Δ cells on 5-FOA at 30 °C. The 2μEcCEG1 cells grew as well as wild-type CEG1 cells on rich medium (YPD agar) at 30 °C, but formed tiny colonies at 25 °C, and failed to grow at either 18 °C or 37 °C (Fig.6). These results show thatEcCEG1 encodes a biologically active RNA guanylyltransferase, albeit one that is both cold-sensitive and temperature-sensitive in vivo in yeast. The basis for the conditional growth defects of EcCeg1 yeast cells remains to be clarified. Motif I of EcCeg1 (63KSDGVR68) contains the conserved lysine nucleophile to which GMP becomes covalently attached in other well characterized capping enzymes (19Håkansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We mutated the Lys-63 codon to an alanine codon and tested the K63A allele in the plasmid shuffle assay. K63A was unable to support the growth of ceg1Δ on 5-FOA (data not shown). Thus, the catalytic nucleophile is required for in vivo activity of EcCeg1. We identified a candidate cap methyltransferase gene on E. cuniculi chromosome 10 that encodes a 298-amino acid polypeptide with similarity to fungal and human cap methyltransferases (Fig. 7). We named this gene product Ecm1 (Encephalitozooncapmethyltransferase). Ecm1 is considerably smaller than the cap methylating enzymes of humans (Hcm1; 476 amino acids), C. albicans (Ccm1; 474 amino acids), S. cerevisiae (Abd1; 436 amino acids), and S. pombe (Pcm1; 402 amino acids).

The concentrations of Mg2+, ATP, and pyrophosphate were systematically varied, and the results led to the conclusion that the nucleotidyl transfer proceeds according to a two-metal ion mechanism. According to this mechanism, only the di-magnesium-coordinated form Mg2ATP0 reacts with the enzyme forming the covalent complexE·AMP. The reverse reaction (ATP synthesis) occurs between the mono-magnesium-coordinated pyrophosphate form MgP2O 72−and the enzyme·MgAMP complex.

T4 DNA ligase shows notably higher rates of ATP binding and of subsequent adenylylation compared with RNA ligase, in part because it decreases the Kd of Mg2+ for the enzyme-bound Mg2ATP0 more than 10-fold. To elucidate the role of Mg2+ in the nucleotidyl transfer catalyzed by T4 DNA and RNA ligases, we propose a transition state configuration, in which the catalytic Mg2+ ion coordinates to both reacting nucleophiles: the lysyl moiety of the enzyme that forms the phosphoramidate bond and the α−β-bridging oxygen of ATP.

The first step of catalysis requires a divalent metal cofactor and consists of the binding of ATP with the subsequent formation of the ligase-AMP complex and the release of pyrophosphate (1Lehman I.R.

Although the T4 DNA ligase (EC 6.5.1.1) and T4 RNA ligase (EC 6.5.1.3) have been first purified more than 30 years ago, relatively few studies have been performed on the interaction between the ligase, ATP, pyrophosphate, and Mg2+. In the past, the pyrophosphate exchange reaction catalyzed by these enzymes have been studied, and the apparent Km values for ATP in the DNA-joining reaction on different DNA substrates have been determined (4Weiss B.

X-ray structures of the related enzymes, T7 DNA ligase and mRNA capping enzyme from Chlorella virus PBCV-1 in complex with the nucleoside triphosphate as well as the enzyme-adenylylate complex of DNA ligase from Chlorella virus PBCV-1 have been solved (10Subramanya H.S.

It was shown that the nucleotide is oriented in the binding cleft of the ligase by stacking interactions and by hydrogen bonding with the adenine ring, the ribose moiety, and the α-phosphate. However, the position of the metal cofactor in complex with the nucleoside triphosphate and ligase or its stoichiometry remained unknown. A steady-state kinetic analysis of the nucleotidyl transfer reaction catalyzed by T4 RNA ligase has been performed by previous researchers (13Zagrebel'nyi S.N. Zernov Iu P. Knorre D.G. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 1984; 18: 227-233PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of isotope equilibration studies of the Mg2+-dependent pyrophosphate exchange reaction, these authors proposed a two-metal ion mechanism in which the di-magnesium-coordinated forms of ATP and pyrophosphate would be the true catalytic substrates. In this report we present a pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the interactions of T4 DNA ligase and T4 RNA ligase with ATP, pyrophosphate, and Mg2+. By varying the experimental conditions we were able to isolate individual steps of the binding reaction. Using dATP and dCTP instead of ATP we could observe the nucleotide-binding step without the subsequent covalent attachment of the nucleotide to the ligase. In the case of ATP, addition of pyrophosphate to the reaction mixture allowed us to suppress the first-order adenylylation of the enzyme, so that only the binding of ATP was observed. As was previously shown, addition of ATP to the ligase in the absence of Mg2+ leads to non-covalent binding of the nucleotide (10Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). So, we were able to study covalent catalysis separately from nucleotide binding by mixing the pre-formed non-covalent nucleotide-enzyme complex with Mg2+. The dissociation constants of ATP complexes with Mg2+, Na1+, and Tris0 are known (14Moe O.A. Butler L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7308-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Frey C.M.

Changing the Mg2+ concentration at fixed concentrations of enzyme and nucleotide allowed us to determine the binding rates of the different Mg2+-coordinated forms of the nucleotide and to obtain information on the stoichiometry of Mg2+ in the forward (cleavage of nucleoside triphosphate) and the reverse (ATP synthesis) reaction. Our results indicate that the di-magnesium form, Mg2ATP0, is the true substrate for the adenylylation of T4 DNA ligase and T4 RNA ligase, whereas the MgP2O 72− form is the true substrate for the ATP synthesis, the latter being opposite to what has been proposed previously (13Zagrebel'nyi S.N. Zernov Iu P. Knorre D.G. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 1984; 18: 227-233PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report we describe an expanded kinetic scheme of the nucleotidyl transfer catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase and T4 RNA ligase and discuss the mechanism in general terms of the metal-dependent enzymic catalysis of the phosphoryl transfer reactions.Table IIIEquilibrium and kinetic constants of ATP and pyrophosphate forms in aqueous solution availing in the literatureReactionKdkon3-aEstimated values that were used for computation of Scheme FS3.koffRef.mm−1s−1s−1HATP3− ↔ H+ + ATP4− (pKa = 6.57)2.7 × 10−71010b2.7 × 103(15Frey C.M.

The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA, protein determination kit (Pierce). Transient state kinetic experiments were performed on the Bio Sequential Stopped-Flow Reaction Analyzer SX-18MV (Applied Photophysics, UK) using an ozone-free 150-watt xenon arc light source. For the kinetic experiments T4 DNA ligase or T4 RNA ligase were diluted yielding final concentrations after mixing of 2.5 ± 0.1 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH = 7.8, 1 mm dithioerythritol in the presence of 0.025 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (buffer A). Two types of stopped-flow experiments have been performed as follows. For these experiments a 5 μm solution of T4 DNA ligase or T4 RNA ligase was prepared in buffer A supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2. The nucleotide solution was prepared in the same buffer with MgCl2 at a concentration of ∼200 μm. Concentrations of nucleotide were determined optically (with ε259 = 15.4 mm−1 cm−1 for ATP, ε259 = 15.2 mm−1cm−1 for dATP, and ε271 = 9.3 mm−1 cm−1 for dCTP). Stocks with lower concentration were prepared by 2-fold serial dilutions of a 200 μm stock solution into buffer A, containing 5 mm MgCl2. To calculate the dilution coefficients with high accuracy, components were weighed on an analytical balance (±0.2-mg precision). Pyrophosphate was added to both the nucleotide stock and the dilution buffer to a final concentration of ∼620 μm in case we wanted to suppress the adenylylation of the ligase. All enzyme and nucleotide stocks were stored on ice and used within 1 h after preparation. For the stopped-flow experiments, enzyme and nucleotide stocks were incubated in the syringes at 20 ± 0.05 °C for 5 min and mixed at 1:1 ratio. Ligase solution (5 μm) was prepared in the presence of ∼150 μm ATP in buffer A without Mg2+. Mg2+ or Mg2+ and pyrophosphate stocks were prepared separately by serial dilutions as mentioned above. The reaction was started by mixing the ligase solution with the Mg2+ solution. The SX-18MV software package for single-wavelength operation mode was used for the optical measurements. Tryptophan emission was excited at 280 nm and measured as the light passed through a <320-nm cut-off filter. Kinetic traces were obtained by averaging 3–10 shots (protein fluorescence emission) or 10–15 shots in case of optical absorbance at 260 nm. Numerical solving of kinetic equations, fitting, and minimization was performed in the Mathematica v. 4.0 software package (Wolfram Research), Scientist v. 2.0 (MicroMath), and Igor Pro v. 3.15 (Wavemetrics). Error estimates for the data values in graphs and tables represent 95% confidence intervals calculated using the Student distribution function. In the first set of experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”), the enzyme was mixed with different amounts of nucleotide in the presence of Mg2+, and changes of the tryptophan fluorescence emission and the optical absorbance at 260 nm were followed (Figs.1 and 2). As expected from the structures of the related nucleotidyltransferases (10Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we observed a decrease of absorbance at 260 nm (Fig. 2), which corresponds to the π-stacking between the adenine ring and the aromatic residue in the active site of the ligase. In addition, the fluorescence emission of both enzymes was partially quenched, implying that the optically active tryptophan residue is located in the ligase active site. Kinetic traces indicate that the binding of the nucleotide is a biphasic process. In the case of T4 DNA ligase, a decrease of emission is followed by its increase, and the final emission is lower than that of the free enzyme (Fig. 1A, TableI). In the case of T4 RNA ligase, we observed a decrease of the fluorescence emission for both phases (Fig.1C, Table I). For both enzymes, the rate of the faster phase increases proportionally to the concentration of ATP, corresponding to second order kinetics of the nucleotide binding (Fig.3, A and B). The rate of the following slower phase, which at low concentrations of ATP is determined by the rate of the initial binding phase, reaches its maximum at ∼30 μm ATP (Fig. 3C). To verify that the first phase represents binding and the second represents the formation of the covalent enzyme-AMP complex, we used dCTP and dATP instead of ATP, the former two nucleotides known to be poor substrates in the nucleotidyl transfer reaction (4Weiss B. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Live T.R. Fareed G.C. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4543-4555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cranston J.W. Silber R. Malathi V.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7447-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From Fig.4 it follows that the second slower process is absent in the case of dCTP and negligible in the case of dATP, which is expected if this process would correspond to the formation of the covalent enzyme·nucleotide complex. Further evidence for this conclusion was obtained by changing the conditions of the experiment: The ligase was mixed with both ATP and pyrophosphate pre-equilibrated with Mg2+. The concentration of pyrophosphate was chosen high enough to drive the nucleotidyl transfer reaction backwards, so that the enzyme would remain in the non-adenylylated form. As a result, we observed only (non-covalent) binding of ATP, whereas the second slower process disappeared (Fig. 1,B and D). The concentration of ATP was varied in a range to maintain the pseudo-first order conditions (keeping the concentration of Mg2+ and pyrophosphate fixed). The values of the observed binding rate constants in the presence and in the absence of pyrophosphate were so similar (Fig. 3, A andB), that one may conclude that pyrophosphate and nucleotide do not compete for binding in the active site of the ligase. Taking this into account, the nucleotidyl transfer reaction catalyzed by T4 ligases as observed in our experiments can be sufficiently described by Scheme 1.Figure 2Changes of absorbance at 260 nm upon mixing of T4 DNA ligase (A) or T4 RNA ligase (B) with ATP in the presence of Mg2+.Concentrations after mixing −2.5 ± 0.1 μm enzyme (A, B); 0, 2.55, 7.66, 17.81, 26.3, and 39.43 μm ATP (A); 4.84, 9.39, and 20.07 μm ATP (B).

From Figs. 3 and 4 and TableII it can be seen that T4 DNA ligase binds ATP, dATP, and dCTP with similar k −1app rate constants, and that its affinity to the nucleotide is dependent solely on the stability of the enzyme·nucleotide complex. The dissociation rate constant of ATP, k −1app is less than 1 s−1 (taking into account equilibrium competition binding studies (19Cherepanov A.V. de Vries S. Biophys.

For comparison, T4 DNA ligase binds ATP approximately three times faster than T4 RNA ligase at the same Mg2+ and ATP concentrations, whereas the equilibrium dissociation constants for ATP for these two enzymes are similar (Table II).Table IIApparent rate constants for nucleotide binding and self-adenylylation catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase and T4 RNA ligaseMg2+T4 DNA ligaseT4 RNA ligasek +1app12-aCalculated from Scheme 1.k −2app12-aCalculated from Scheme 1.k +2app12-bCalculated from Scheme 2.k −2app12-bCalculated from Scheme 2.k +1app12-aCalculated from Scheme 1.k −1app12-aCalculated from Scheme 1.k +2app12-bCalculated from Scheme 2.k −2app12-bCalculated from Scheme 2.mmm−1s−1s−1s−1m−1s−1m−1s−1s−1s−1m−1s−1502.3 ± 0.7 × 1052-cCalculated assuming thatk −1app <1 or <0.3 s−1 for T4 DNA ligase or RNA ligase, respectively.ND2-dND, not determined.19.23 ± 0.393.1 ± 1.5 × 1047.3 ± 2.2 × 1042-cCalculated assuming thatk −1app <1 or <0.3 s−1 for T4 DNA ligase or RNA ligase, respectively.ND6.12 ± 0.477.7 ± 3.4 × 10358.7 ± 0.11 × 105<112.83 ± 0.124.07 ± 0.86 × 1053.09 ± 0.13 × 105<0.31.78 ± 0.195.82 ± 0.79 × 104ATP0.42 ± 0.3 × 1062-cCalculated assuming thatk −1app <1 or <0.3 s−1 for T4 DNA ligase or RNA ligase, respectively.ND2.86 ± 0.291.12 ± 0.39 × 1051.5 ± 0.4 × 1062-cCalculated assuming thatk −1app <1 or <0.3 s−1 for T4 DNA ligase or RNA ligase, respectively.ND05.3 ± 2.4 × 1062-cCalculated assuming thatk −1app <1 or <0.3 s−1 for T4 DNA ligase or RNA ligase, respectively.ND4.8 ± 1.4 × 1062-cCalculated assuming thatk −1app <1 or <0.3 s−1 for T4 DNA ligase or RNA ligase, respectively.NDdATP55.91 ± 0.25 × 1054.3 ± 0.9dCTP59.23 ± 0.46 × 10513 ± 22-a Calculated from Scheme 1.2-b Calculated from Scheme 2.2-c Calculated assuming thatk −1app <1 or <0.3 s−1 for T4 DNA ligase or RNA ligase, respectively.2-d ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Formation of the covalent enzyme-AMP product and the release of the pyrophosphate occur as a slow process, following binding of the ATP coenzyme. The observed rate constant of this process, k 2obs, increases with the ATP concentration reaching its maximal value at ∼30 μm ATP (Fig. 3C). To separate the nucleotide binding phase from the adenylylation of the ligase, we modified the experimental conditions: Mg2+-free ligase was pre-equilibrated with excess ATP so that the enzyme·nucleotide complex would be formed without further adenylylation. Subsequently, this complex was mixed with Mg2+, triggering a first order nucleotidyl transfer (Fig.5). In this set of experiments, similar to Fig. 1, the intensity of the fluorescence emission of T4 DNA ligase increases during the reaction, whereas that of T4 RNA ligase decreases. Because at the [Mg2+] used here the binding of Mg2+ to the nucleotide occurs significantly faster (TableIII), the observed emission changes could result only from the adenylylation of the enzyme. The same can be concluded from the pronounced dependence of k 2obs on the pyrophosphate concentration (see below), and on pH (not shown). The k 2obs drastically increases at alkaline pH, which is expected, because only the deprotonated lysine residue participates in the nucleophilic substitution (3Arabshahi A. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8586-8588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, the adenylylation of the enzyme is as fast as that observed in the experiments with the Mg2+-pre-equilibrated nucleotides (for example, compare the first and second traces from the top in Fig. 5). The adenylylation occurs without any delay, confirming that the second order binding of Mg2+ to the ligase·ATP is, indeed, faster and, therefore, can not be seen as a separate kinetic phase. It also implies that binding of Mg2+ to ATP does not require the dissociation of the enzyme·ATP complex. Otherwise, the adenylylation would be limited by k −1app for ATP from the enzyme·ATP complex, which is quite low (<1 s−1, TableII). To separate the kinetic phases of the forward (cleavage of ATP) and the reverse (ATP synthesis) reaction, different amounts of pyrophosphate pre-equilibrated with Mg2+ were mixed with the enzyme·ATP complex. Upon increasing the pyrophosphate concentration, the observed reaction rate increases while the amplitude of the fluorescence decreases (Fig. 5). In fact, the fluorescence jump can be suppressed nearly completely by addition of a 200-fold excess of pyrophosphate over the enzyme. This shows that the equilibrium of the reaction under these conditions is shifted to the non-covalent enzyme·MgATP complex and that most of the enzyme remains in the non-adenylylated form even in the presence of free Mg2+. The rate of ATP synthesis catalyzed by both T4 DNA and RNA ligases is proportional to the concentration of pyrophosphate (Figs. 6 and 7).Figure 7Observed rate constantk 2obs as a function of both [Mg2+] and [P2O7].

https://openalex.org/W2083505946,"Phospholipase D (PLD) plays a central role in the control of vesicle budding and protein transit. We previously showed that in resting epithelial HT29-cl19A cells, PLD is implicated in the control of constitutive protein transit, from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane, and that phorbol ester stimulation of protein transit is correlated with PLD activation (Auger, R., Robin, P., Camier, B., Vial, G., Rossignol, B., Tenu, J.-P., and Raymond, M.-N. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 28652–28659). In this paper we demonstrate that: 1) PLD is not implicated in the earliest phases of protein transit; 2) PLD controls apical but not basolateral protein transit; 3) HT29-cl19A cells express PLD1b and PLD2a mRNAs and proteins; 4) the expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PLD2 (mPLD2-K758R) significantly inhibited apical constitutive protein transit whereas expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PLD1 (hPLD1b-K898R) prevented increases in the rate of apical transit as triggered by phorbol esters; 5) PLD2 appears to be located in a perinuclear region containing the Golgi whereas PLD1, which is scattered in the cytoplasm in resting cells, is translocated to the plasma membrane after phorbol ester stimulation. Taken together, these data lead to the conclusion that in HT29-cl19A cells, both PLDs regulate protein transit between the trans-Golgi network and the apical plasma membrane, but that they do so at different steps in the pathway.

PLD1 is activated in vitro by small GTPases such as ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and RhoA and by protein kinase C (PKC). A lipid cofactor, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, is also required. PLD2 is a 933-amino acid enzyme that shares about 50% identity with PLD1. Three splice variants have been sequenced, but only the longest variant, PLD2a, has been functionally characterized. PLD2 exhibits high basal activity in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate but does not further respond to a PKC stimulation in vitro. The domain structures of PLD1 and PLD2 are very similar. They contain the four core domains I-IV; domain IV contains a relatively short sequence motif termed “HKD” which plays an important role in catalysis. The replacement of the lysyl residue of this motif (Lys-898 in PLD1, Lys-758 in PLD2) by an arginyl residue results in catalytically inactive enzymes (13Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A.

We previously demonstrated that in those cells, PLD is implicated in the regulation of protein transit (8Auger R. Robin P. Camier B. Vial G. Rossignol B. Tenu J.-P. Raymond M.-N. J. Biol.

To identify the PLD species responsible for the control of protein trafficking, we stably transfected HT29-cl19A cells with the catalytically inactive mutants of PLD1 and PLD2 (13Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J.

Biet al. (6Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and Boisgard and Chanat (10Boisgard R. Chanat E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed that PLD was required for influenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein and caseins transport from the ER to the Golgi complex in Chinese hamster ovary and mammary cells, respectively. On the other hand we demonstrated here, exploiting the transphosphatidylation activity of PLD, that α1-antitrypsin in HT29-cl19A cells is transported from the ER to Golgi in a PLD-independent manner (Fig. 1B). Such a result was also obtained for whey acidic protein in mammary cells (10Boisgard R. Chanat E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We can thus hypothesize that the transport of those proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus would be by bulk flow whereas the packaging of hemagglutinin and caseins would be via a selective PLD-regulated mechanism. Concerning the exit from the TGN, it is now clearly established that secretory vesicle formation and secretion is PLD-dependent in many cell-types (2–5 and 7–9). Our findings (Fig. 1, C-E) extend these proposed models by showing that in the constitutive secretory pathway, apical but not basolateral transit is regulated by PLDs. This finding will be discussed further.Two isoforms of PLD have been described; it was thus important to determine which isoform is implicated in the control of protein trafficking. We transfected HT29-cl19A cells with the catalytically inactive mutants of PLD1 and PLD2. These mutants have been previously shown to be devoid of activity in vivo and in vitro using PC as a substrate (13Sung T.-C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar); they have been recently successfully used to determine the PLD isoforms implicated in different physiological processes (26Rizzo M.A. Shome K.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Our results concerning PLD activity measurements indicate that PDBu-stimulated PLD activity is reduced in the cells transfected with the inactive PLD1 whereas in the cells expressing the inactive PLD2, the PDBu-stimulated PLD activity remains close to that of the wild-type cells. These data indicate that in HT29-cl19A cells, PLD2 is not implicated in the PDBu-triggered PLD activation. The 25% inhibition of PDBu-stimulated PLD activity in P1 cells appears low, but since the PLDs are thought to be essential enzymes for physiological functioning of the cells, reducing PLD1 activity beyond this point might have led to inviability. The amount of this enzyme may be strictly controlled, since recent data reported that overexpression of active PLD1 is generally toxic (28Lu Z. Hornia A. Joseph T. Sukezane T. Frankel P. Zhong M. Bychenok S. Xu L. Feig L.A. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Freyberg Z. Sweeney D. Siddhanta A. Bourgoin S. Frohman M. Shields D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).The results obtained regarding apical protein secretion were very striking. Constitutive secretion in P1 cells is not affected by transfection with the inactive PLD1, but the PDBu-stimulated increase in secretion observed in wild-type cells is about 60% blocked in those transfected cells. On the other hand, in P2j and P2r cells transfected with the inactive PLD2, constitutive secretion toward the apical pole of the cells is 55 to 70% reduced whereas the PDBu-stimulated increase in secretion is close to that determined for wild-type cells.Taken together, these results indicate that both PLDs control apical protein transit: in resting cells constitutive secretion appears mainly regulated by PLD2 but, subsequent to phorbol ester stimulation, the increase in secretion is PLD1-dependent. These results are consistent with the known properties of the two isoforms of the enzyme, PLD2 has been described to be constitutively active to varying extents in cells whereas PLD1 requires activation, one mechanism of which is through the action of PKC (11Frohman M.A. Sung T.-C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 12Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).In contrast with apical secretion, basolateral secretion is scarcely modified in either type of transfected cells. These results strengthen the data presented in Fig. 1, D and E, which showed that ethanol had no effect on basolateral secretion of proteins. Thus, basolateral secretion does not appear to be regulated by PLDs.The results concerning the sorting and the transit of proteins toward apical membranes are interesting: we showed that in wild-type cells about 79% of the secreted α1-antitrypsin is transported to the apical surface. This finding suggests that α1-antitrypsin is sorted in the TGN via a positive signal. This signal can be either aN-glycan-dependent signal as proposed by Schelffele et al. (31Schelffele P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) or a proteinaceous apical sorting signal as suggested for the corticosteroid-binding protein, a glycoprotein that belongs to the same serpin family as α1-antitrypsin (32Larsen J.E. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Vogel L.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Vogel L.K. Larsen J.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In cells transfected with inactive PLD2, secretion of α1-antitrypsin and all the proteins apically released is reduced whereas basolateral transit is not modified. We can thus hypothesize that PLD2 could be implicated in the regulation of the machinery that addresses proteins to the apical membrane. These results would suggest that the mechanisms controlling apical and basolateral vesicle formation and (or) fusion are not dependent on the same enzymes. Such a conclusion had been drawn by Pimplikar and Simons (34Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, protein kinases A and C selectively stimulate apical transport.We do not presently know the exact mechanism of action through which the inactive PLD1 and PLD2 isoforms inhibit specific steps in protein transit as demonstrated here. It is likely that those inactive enzymes, which have only one conservative amino acid substitution in their active pocket, have a structural conformation similar to that of the native enzymes; therefore, since the inactive PLDs localize to the same sites as the endogenous enzymes, they may compete with the endogenous active PLDs for binding to substrate, cofactor, or activator(s) at the immediate site of action. Furthermore, since we found that the levels of expression of the inactive enzymes are lower than those of the endogenous PLDs, it is not surprising that we only observed partial inhibitions of the phenomena under study. With regards to possible perturbations of some upstream PLD effectors by the inactive PLDs, this appears rather unlikely: in the cells expressing the inactive PLD1, apical constitutive protein transit (controlled by PLD2 as shown by our data) is normal. Those data indicate that in the transfected P1 cells: 1) the regulators of protein transit others than PLDs do not appear to be affected by the expression of the inactive PLD1; 2) the inactive PLD1 does not block endogenous PLD2 access to PC substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate cofactor or potential PLD2 activators. Furthermore, in the transfected P2 cells, the PDBu-stimulated increase in the rate of protein transit (regulated by PLD1 as shown by our data) is not significantly modified. This indicates that the inactive PLD2 does not block access of endogenous PLD1 to PC, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, or the PLD1 activators such as PKC.Our finding showing an implication of PLD2 in the control of the final steps of apical protein transit would potentially suggest a TGN localization for PLD2. Nevertheless the results concerning the cellular localization of the PLDs remains confusing: ARF-regulated PLD activity was found in secretory vesicles in control neutrophils and was mobilized to the plasma membrane upon stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe (35Morgan C.P. Sengelov H. Whatmore J. Borregaard N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Tagged-PLD1s were localized solely to perinuclear regions (the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and late endosomes) in rat embryo fibroblasts (36Colley W.C. Sung T.-C. Roll R. Jenco J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in a perinuclear region in COS-7 cells (40Sung T.-C. Zhang Y. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3659-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Very recently endogenous PLD1 was shown to be present in nuclei and enriched in the Golgi apparatus of GH3 and NRK cells (30Freyberg Z. Sweeney D. Siddhanta A. Bourgoin S. Frohman M. Shields D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) but associated with the plasma membrane in chromaffin cells (29Vitale N. Caumont-Primus A.-S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Bader M.-F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our own results concerning the localization of the endogenous PLD1 are different as we showed that under phorbol ester stimulation, PLD1 translocates from small dots scattered in the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Those apparent discrepancies in the results reported in the literature may be due to the fact that an overexpression of tagged-PLD1 may result in its mislocalization in different vesicular structures (30Freyberg Z. Sweeney D. Siddhanta A. Bourgoin S. Frohman M. Shields D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) but it can also reflect physiological differences as many cell types were examined. Concerning PLD2, there is little data on its localization and relatively few cell types or tissues have been examined in this regard. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PLD2 was shown to be associated with intracellular membranes (41Millar C.A. Jess T.J. Saqib K.M. Wakelam M.J.O. Gould G.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The tagged-enzyme has been localized primarily to the plasma membrane in rat embryo fibroblasts (36Colley W.C. Sung T.-C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), and in ruffling membranes formed upon epidermal growth factor stimulation of HeLa cells (42Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Our own results which concern the localization of the endogenous enzyme are in favor of a Golgi localization for this PLD2 isoform.The question of the role of each of the PLDs in the control of protein traffic is far from clear. It has been proposed that PLDs could control secretory vesicle budding from the TGN or regulate the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane; we cannot exclude the possibility that they could be implicated at these two steps (or more) of the secretory pathway. hPLD1 added to permeabilized GH3 cells was found to stimulate the release of nascent secretory vesicles (3Chen Y.-G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.-C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown in RBL-2H3 mast cells that ARF1-mediated exocytosis occurs via PLD (43Way G. O'Luanaigh N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 63-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLD1 has also been described to act at the very last steps of regulated exocytosis in PC12 cells (29Vitale N. Caumont-Primus A.-S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Bader M.-F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Those data concern the fusion of secretory granules to plasma membrane, a phenomenon triggered by an external stimulus. Nevertheless, in HT29-cl19A cells, the enhancement of apical secretion triggered by phorbol esters may also be due to a PLD1-controlled increase of the fusion process between secretory vesicles and plasma membrane. This hypothesis is supported by our immunofluorescence results showing a plasma membrane translocation of PLD1 after phorbol ester stimulation. On the other hand, our results concerning the localization of PLD2 are more in favor of a PLD2-control of secretory vesicle formation at the TGN level.Protein trafficking can be regulated by PLDs at different steps of the secretory pathway but the measurement of protein secretion does not identify in which compartment the PLDs act. Our biochemical and immunofluorescence results allow us to hypothesize that in epithelial HT29-cl19A cells, PLD2 controls protein sorting and apical transit, likely at the TGN level and that PLD1, after PKC activation, may regulate the transit partly at the plasma membrane. Nevertheless we have to be cautious with those conclusions since, in many respects, secretion is a “circular” process that depends not only on the generation and outflow of vesicles, but also the return of membrane to the TGN; disruption of this process at any step by the catalytically inactive PLDs could decrease secretion. Results from several laboratories have demonstrated that lipases are implicated in the regulation of intracellular protein transit in different cell types. As long ago as 1993, Stutchfield and Cockcroft (1Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) showed that phospholipase D (PLD)1 activity was correlated with secretion in HL60 cells. More recently, PLD and phosphatidic acid produced by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by PLD have been shown to stimulate the formation of secretory vesicles (2Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A.

https://openalex.org/W1973496342,"We carried out a steady state kinetic analysis of the bacteriophage T4 DNA-[N6-adenine]methyltransferase (T4 Dam) mediated methyl group transfer reaction fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to Ade in the palindromic recognition sequence, GATC, of a 20-mer oligonucleotide duplex. Product inhibition patterns were consistent with a steady state-ordered bi-bi mechanism in which the order of substrate binding and product (methylated DNA, DNAMe andS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, AdoHcy) release was AdoMet↓DNA↓DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑. A strong reduction in the rate of methylation was observed at high concentrations of the substrate 20-mer DNA duplex. In contrast, increasing substrate AdoMet concentration led to stimulation in the reaction rate with no evidence of saturation. We propose the following model. Free T4 Dam (initially in conformational form E) randomly interacts with substrates AdoMet and DNA to form a ternary T4 Dam-AdoMet-DNA complex in which T4 Dam has isomerized to conformational state F, which is specifically adapted for catalysis. After the chemical step of methyl group transfer from AdoMet to DNA, product DNAMe dissociates relatively rapidly (koff = 1.7 s−1) from the complex. In contrast, dissociation of product AdoHcy proceeds relatively slowly (koff = 0.018 s−1), indicating that its release is the rate-limiting step, consistent withkcat = 0.015 s−1. After AdoHcy release, the enzyme remains in the F conformational form and is able to preferentially bind AdoMet (unlike form E, which randomly binds AdoMet and DNA), and the AdoMet-F binary complex then binds DNA to start another methylation cycle. We also propose an alternative pathway in which the release of AdoHcy is coordinated with the binding of AdoMet in a single concerted event, while T4 Dam remains in the isomerized form F. The resulting AdoMet-F binary complex then binds DNA, and another methylation reaction ensues. This route is preferred at high AdoMet concentrations. We carried out a steady state kinetic analysis of the bacteriophage T4 DNA-[N6-adenine]methyltransferase (T4 Dam) mediated methyl group transfer reaction fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to Ade in the palindromic recognition sequence, GATC, of a 20-mer oligonucleotide duplex. Product inhibition patterns were consistent with a steady state-ordered bi-bi mechanism in which the order of substrate binding and product (methylated DNA, DNAMe andS-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, AdoHcy) release was AdoMet↓DNA↓DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑. A strong reduction in the rate of methylation was observed at high concentrations of the substrate 20-mer DNA duplex. In contrast, increasing substrate AdoMet concentration led to stimulation in the reaction rate with no evidence of saturation. We propose the following model. Free T4 Dam (initially in conformational form E) randomly interacts with substrates AdoMet and DNA to form a ternary T4 Dam-AdoMet-DNA complex in which T4 Dam has isomerized to conformational state F, which is specifically adapted for catalysis. After the chemical step of methyl group transfer from AdoMet to DNA, product DNAMe dissociates relatively rapidly (koff = 1.7 s−1) from the complex. In contrast, dissociation of product AdoHcy proceeds relatively slowly (koff = 0.018 s−1), indicating that its release is the rate-limiting step, consistent withkcat = 0.015 s−1. After AdoHcy release, the enzyme remains in the F conformational form and is able to preferentially bind AdoMet (unlike form E, which randomly binds AdoMet and DNA), and the AdoMet-F binary complex then binds DNA to start another methylation cycle. We also propose an alternative pathway in which the release of AdoHcy is coordinated with the binding of AdoMet in a single concerted event, while T4 Dam remains in the isomerized form F. The resulting AdoMet-F binary complex then binds DNA, and another methylation reaction ensues. This route is preferred at high AdoMet concentrations. methyltransferase S-adenosyl-l-methionine S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine methylated DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-containing T4 αgt− βgt−(unglucosylated) DNA model selection criterion DNA methyltransferases (MTases)1 are involved in a variety of important cellular functions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Ahmad I.

In addition, DNA MTases are excellent subjects for detailed studies of specific protein-DNA interaction because they are highly specific and have a comparatively simple organization. Elucidating the kinetic mechanism of the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes still remains an important problem to investigate in the area of biological DNA methylation.

Biol. 1989; 209: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes exhibit a sequential bi-bi mechanism; however, they differ with respect to the order of substrate binding and rate-limiting step. For instance, whereas the rate of methyl group transfer is at least 300-fold faster than the rate of dissociation of the products for EcoRI (12Reich N.O. Mashhoon N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9191-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast, the rate of methyl group transfer is the rate-limiting step in the TaqI methylation reaction (14Wolcke J. The kinetic mechanism of the DNA methyltransferase from Thermus aquaticus and selection of a DNA-binding peptide by means of phage displayPh. D. Dissertation. University Dortmund, Germany1998Google Scholar). Furthermore, several different modes of MTase binding to the substrates DNA (17Klimasauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wuthrich K.

Biol. 1997; 265: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) have been distinguished. In addition, changes in enzyme conformation (isomerization) associated with binding substrate DNA and/or AdoMet may also influence the reaction kinetics. Allosteric activation by methylated DNA was observed with human Dnmt1 MTase (9Bacolla A. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The binding of two AdoMet molecules was reported for the EcoDam (21Bergerat A. Guschlbauer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4369-4375Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and PvuII MTases (22Adams G.M. Blumenthal R.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and an effector role was suggested for the second AdoMet molecule. The precise binding stoichiometry of AdoMet, as well as its double role as methyl donor and allosteric effector, remains to be fully characterized for T4 Dam (24Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4659-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to the apparently universal ternary structure of the catalytic domains (23Gong W. O'Gara M. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,26Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol.

Bestor T.H. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the existing biochemical data are complex and not clear enough for generalizations to be made concerning the kinetics of the reactions catalyzed by the different DNA MTases. Therefore, further investigation is required. The Dam DNA-[N6-adenine]MTase encoded by phage T4 catalyzes methyl group transfer from AdoMet to the N6position of an Ade residue in the palindromic sequence, 5′-GATC-3′ (30Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Gene. 1983; 22: 139-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). T4 Dam belongs to the large family of α-group type II DNA MTases (31Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), in which there are at least 50 members known today and almost half of them are [N6-adenine] GATC-specific isoschizomers. Furthermore, the enzymes that modify the N6-amino nitrogen of adenine share not only the nine conserved motifs, but also possess striking similarity in their target recognition domains, although they have different targets;e.g. GATC, GANTC, GATATC, and non-palindromic CATCC (28Tran P.H. Korszun Z.R. Cerritelli S. Springhorn S.S. Lacks S.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 1563-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Such homology may, in turn, indicate that a considerable amount of similarity exists in their three-dimensional structures, as well as in their mechanism of action. Recently, more progress has been made in the study of this family of enzymes; the first crystal structure for the GATC-specific DpnM MTase complexed with AdoMet was reported (28Tran P.H. Korszun Z.R. Cerritelli S. Springhorn S.S. Lacks S.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 1563-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and an extensive biochemical investigation of the GATATC-specificEcoRV MTase was performed (15Gowher H.

Previously, catalytic turnover and Michaelian constants were obtained for the T4 Dam methylation reaction using either polymeric 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-containing T4 αgt−βgt− (unglucosylated)dam− (unmethylated) DNA (hmCyt-DNA) or a set of synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes containing one or more defect(s) or substitution(s) in the target sequence (36Kossykh V.G.

In this communication, we report a detailed steady state kinetic analysis of the methylation of a synthetic 20-mer oligonucleotide duplex catalyzed by T4 Dam; and, we propose a kinetic reaction scheme for this member of the α-group GATC-family of DNA MTases. [3H-CH3]S-adenosyl-l-methionine (15 Ci/mmol; 1 mCi/ml) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and sinefungin were from Sigma. Unlabeled AdoMet (Sigma) was purified further by chromatography on a C18 reversed-phase column as described previously (36Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The synthetic 20-mer duplex used as substrate had the following sequence shown in Structure I.5′­CAGTTTAGGATC¯CATTTCAC­3′3′­GTCAAATCCTAG¯GTAAAGTG­5′STRUCTURE IA modified duplex containing N6-methyladenine in the recognition sequence GATC (underlined) in both strands was used in the product inhibition studies. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380A/380B DNA synthesizer, and concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. The duplexes were obtained by heating and annealing complementary oligonucleotide chains from 90 to 20 °C over 7–12 h. T4 Dam was purified to homogeneity as described previously (36Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar), which yielded values in close agreement with those determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm from the known composition and molar extinction coefficients of individual aromatic amino acid residues in pH 6.5, 6.0 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.02 m phosphate buffer (40Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). DNA MTase assays were similar to that previously reported (38Malygin E.G. Zinoviev V.V. Petrov N.A. Evdokimov A.A. Jen-Jacobson L. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1135-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). T4 Dam reactions were carried out at 25 °C in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (36Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A low concentration of T4 Dam (1 nm) was used for most experiments to increase the accuracy of the calculation of the initial reaction velocities by reducing the influence of any burst in product formation (37Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Gorbunov Y.A. Malygin E.G. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The concentrations of AdoMet, substrate DNA, and inhibitors varied according to the individual experiment. The reactions were initiated by addition of prewarmed T4 Dam to preincubated mixtures of [3H-CH3]AdoMet and substrate DNA (with or without inhibitors; final volume is 25 μl). The reaction time used was selected to ensure initial velocity conditions; i.e.product formation was less than 15% of the initial substrate and added product inhibitor concentrations during the time of the reaction. At appropriate intervals, an aliquot (15 μl) was withdrawn from each mixture and spotted on a DE81 anion-exchange filter disc (Whatman, 1.5 cm). Filters were washed three times with 0.02 mNH4HCO3, twice with water, once with 75% ethanol, and then dried. They were counted in a toluene liquid scintillator. The molar concentrations of [3H-CH3] groups incorporated into DNA were quantified as described previously (41Thielking V. Dubois S. Eritja R. Guschlbauer W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 407-415PubMed Google Scholar). The validity of the quantification procedure was confirmed under complete methylation conditions (about 1 h at a 1:2 enzyme/substrate ratio), where the calculated concentrations of [3H-CH3] groups incorporated into DNA coincided with the reaction mixture concentrations of methylatable Ade residues. All experiments were done at least twice. Kinetic data were analyzed using the program Scientist 2.01 (MicroMath®) for non-linear regression analysis. We used the statistical model selection criterion (MSC) recommended by program developers to determine the goodness of fit for each kinetic model. The MSC is defined by the formula in Equation1, MSC=ln∑i=1nwi(Yobsi−Ȳobs)2∑i=1nwi(Yobsi−Ycali)2−2pnEquation 1 where n is the number of points,wi are the weights applied to each point,Yobs is the weighted mean of the observed data and p is the number of parameters. The model that has the largest MSC value is by definition the best or most appropriate model. The ability of T4 Dam to catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from methylated DNA to AdoHcy was tested using an [N6-3H-methyl]adenine-containing 20-mer DNA duplex at a concentration of 200 nm. Reactions were performed in the presence of 50 nm T4 Dam and 0, 5, or 50 μm AdoHcy. No tritium loss from the [N6-3H-methyl]adenine containing 20-mer was observed over a period of 270 min (data not shown). This indicated that the reverse reaction is at least 500-fold slower than the forward one. Therefore, the transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to DNA can be considered irreversible for the T4 Dam MTase; this has been previously shown for the HhaI (4Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) andMspI (8Bhattacharya S.K. Dubey A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14743-14749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) MTases. Initial velocities (V) were determined at various concentrations of the substrates, [3H-CH3]AdoMet and 20-mer duplex DNA. The substrate concentrations used in these experiments were up to 5-fold above Km for AdoMet (Km AdoMet = 490 nm) and 15-fold above Km for DNA (Km DNA = 6.3 nm) (37Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Gorbunov Y.A. Malygin E.G. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, both double-reciprocal plots gave a series of straight lines that intersected to the left of the 1/V axis, which rules out a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism. An ordered rapid-equilibrium mechanism is also unlikely because the double-reciprocal plot lines should have intersected at the 1/V axis for the second substrate that binds. In addition, secondary plots of the slopes and 1/V intercepts versus reciprocal concentrations of substrates were approximately linear (not shown), permitting calculation of conventional kinetic parameters. In accordance with graphical predictions, the experimental data fit an equation that corresponds to either a steady state-ordered bi-bi or a rapid-equilibrium random bi-bi mechanism (42Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) according to Equation2. V=Vmax·[A]·[B]/(KiA·KmB+KmA·[B]+KmB·[A]+[A]·[B])Equation 2 Because the conversion step (kmeth = 0.56 s−1) in the T4 Dam methylation reaction (43Malygin E.G. Lindstrom W.M. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S.M. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4207-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was much faster than the catalytic turnover constant (kcat = 0.015 s−1), a rapid equilibrium random mechanism appears to be ruled out. Results of product inhibition studies below support this conclusion. Product inhibition studies are commonly performed to determine whether there is a preferential order of substrate binding for a particular multiple substrate reaction (44Rudolph F.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 411-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We used this approach to determine whether T4 Dam first binds substrate DNA or AdoMet (Fig.2 and TableI). We found that AdoHcy was a competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet (Fig. 2A) and a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to 20-mer DNA duplex (Fig.2B); this is consistent with previous results (36Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar inhibition patterns were also obtained with sinefungin, another non-reactive AdoMet analog (data not shown). The other reaction product, fully methylated 20-mer DNA duplex, exhibited non-competitive inhibition with respect to both AdoMet and unmethylated 20-mer DNA duplex (Fig. 2, C and D). Secondary plots of the slopes and 1/V intercepts versus concentration of inhibitor were approximately linear (not shown). Thus, these product inhibition patterns (Table I) are consistent with a steady state-ordered bi-bi mechanism (44Rudolph F.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 411-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), in which the substrate binding and product release order are AdoMet↓DNA↓DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑.Table IProduct inhibition analysis of reaction catalyzed by the T4 Dam MTaseInhibitorVariable substrateFixed substrateInhibition typeAdoHcyAdoMetDNACompetitiveSinefunginAdoMetDNACompetitiveAdoHcyDNAAdoMetNoncompetitiveSinefunginDNAAdoMetNoncompetitiveDNAMeAdoMetDNANoncompetitiveDNAMeDNAAdoMetNoncompetitive Open table in a new tab Generally, DNA MTases may form binary complexes with either of their reaction substrates. Binding of AdoMet in the absence of substrate DNA has been confirmed, in particular by co-crystal structures (5O'Gara M. Zhang X. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. J. Mol.

On the other hand, MTases are capable of recognizing and binding at specific DNA sequence(s) and flipping the target base in the absence of AdoMet or its non-reactive analogs (17Klimasauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wuthrich K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Jeltsch A. Roth M. Friedrich T. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); although, as a rule, AdoMet (or its non-reactive analogs) increases the enzyme's affinity for substrate DNA (13Szilak L. Der A. Deak F. Venetianer P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Klimasauskas S. Szyperski T. Serva S. Wuthrich K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4393-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, DNA MTases can also form stable, non-functional (dead-end) enzyme-product-substrate ternary complexes, as has been observed for the MTase-AdoHcy-DNA complex ofHhaI (53O'Gara M. Klimasauskas S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 634-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, if the initial concentration of the second substrate to bind were sufficiently high, a steady state-ordered reaction (which has a specific order of substrate binding and product release) would show inhibition of the initial reaction velocity due to the formation of non-productive binary and/or dead-end ternary complexes (54Cleland W.W.

In contrast, a rapid equilibrium random bi-bi mechanism should show no substrate inhibition when the initial concentration of either (or both) substrate(s) is high (54Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 500-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The results in Fig.3 show a strong inhibition in T4 Dam initial reaction velocity at high concentrations of substrate 20-mer DNA duplex. This indicates that T4 Dam does not obey a rapid equilibrium random bi-bi mechanism. Rather, the data are consistent with a steady state-ordered bi-bi mechanism, as we had concluded from the product inhibition analysis. In contrast to the results with the substrate 20-mer DNA duplex, increasing the concentration of AdoMet led to a progressive stimulation in the reaction rate (Fig. 4). Whereas the initial portion of the concentration dependence curve corresponded approximately to a conventional hyperbolic dependence (Fig. 4,inset), saturation was never achieved. In fact, the rate of the reaction was linearly proportional to the AdoMet concentration up to 30 μm (60-fold above the Km for AdoMet). We will present possible explanations of this unexpected effect in the “Discussion.” The HhaI (4Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MspI (8Bhattacharya S.K. Dubey A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14743-14749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) DNA MTases have been analyzed for their ability to perform the reverse of the methylation reaction; e.g. transferring the methyl group from [methyl-3H]DNA to AdoHcy to form [methyl-3H]AdoMet. Both enzymes were incapable of performing the reverse catalytic reaction, and we have shown here that T4 Dam is also unable to do so. Therefore, the T4 Dam-catalyzed methylation reaction appears to be irreversible, which has facilitated further kinetic analysis. The product inhibition patterns obtained for the T4 Dam MTase (Fig. 2, Table I) are consistent with a steady state-ordered bi-bi mechanism, in which the order of substrate binding and product release are AdoMet↓DNA↓DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑. However, the stimulatory effect of high AdoMet concentrations on DNA methylation rate indicates that the mechanism is more complex; that is, the release of AdoHcy from the MTase-AdoHcy complex appears to be associated with the binding of AdoMet in a concerted event (discussed below). In a previous study, polymeric T4 αgt−βgt− (unglucosylated)dam+ hmCyt-DNA (previously methylated in vitro by T4 Dam) was observed to be a competitive inhibitor of unmethylated substrate hmCyt-DNA (36Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here; however, methylated 20-mer DNA duplex was a non-competitive inhibitor of the unmethylated 20-mer DNA duplex DNA. The difference in the nature of the inhibition can be explained, as a formal analysis indicates (not shown here), by a preferentially processive methylation mechanism of polymeric DNA, in contrast to a distributive methylation mechanism of the 20-mer duplex. This question is currently under investigation. The preferential order of substrate binding proposed for T4 Dam is identical to that found for two other [N6-adenine]MTases, EcoRI (11Reich N.O.

ACAT1 is an integral membrane protein with multiple transmembrane domains. Human ACAT1 contains nine cysteine residues; its activity is severely inhibited by various thiol-specific modification reagents including p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid, suggesting that certain cysteine residue(s) might be near or at the active site. We constructed various ACAT1 mutants that contained either single cysteine to alanine substitution at various positions, contained a reduced number of cysteines, or contained no cysteine at all. Each of these mutants retained 20% or more of the wild-type ACAT activity. Therefore, cysteine is not essential for ACAT catalysis. For the cysteine-free enzyme, its basic kinetic properties and intracellular localization in Chinese hamster ovary cells were shown to be very similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. The availability of the cysteine-free ACAT1 will facilitate future ACAT structure function studies. Additional studies show that Cys467 is one of the major target sites that leads top-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid-mediated ACAT1 inactivation, suggesting that Cys467 may be near the ACAT active site(s).

The physiological functions of ACAT1 and ACAT2 in various tissues are under active investigation in several laboratories. ACAT1 is an integral membrane protein with four identical subunits (11Yu C.

It is mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (12Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

Davis M.A. Lee R.G. Skinner K. Anderson R.A. Rudel L.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3675-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The recombinant human ACAT1 overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been solubilized in the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS and has been purified to homogeneity with retention of catalytic activity (14Chang C.C.Y.

When placed either in vesicles or in mixed micelles, the purified enzyme responds to its substrate cholesterol in a sigmoidal manner but responds to the other substrate oleoyl-coenzyme A in a hyperbolic manner. These results imply that the enzyme is allosterically regulated by cholesterol but not by oleoyl-coenzyme A (14Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of ACAT allosterism is unknown. With regard to the nature of the ACAT active site, little information is available at present. For hamster ACAT1, a serine to leucine mutation (corresponding to Ser269 in human ACAT1) caused the mutant ACAT1 to lose enzyme activity when expressed in CHO cells (15Cao G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or in yeast cells (16Guo Z. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1282-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This serine is conserved in ACAT2 and in DGAT1. Joyce and colleagues (13Joyce C.W. Shelness G.S. Davis M.A. Lee R.G. Skinner K. Anderson R.A. Rudel L.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3675-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) showed that the same mutation caused loss of enzyme activity in ACAT2 when the mutant enzyme was assayed in extracts of transfected cells. These results support the hypothesis that Ser269 may constitute part of the ACAT active site. On the other hand, the S269L mutation also caused the resultant ACAT1 protein to be expressed at a much lower level than that of the wild-type (WT) enzyme in transfected cells (15Cao G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Guo Z. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1282-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Ser269 is not part of the active site; instead, the S269L mutation may cause gross structural alteration of the enzyme that leads to rapid degradation of the enzyme. Guo et al. (16Guo Z. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1282-1291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently proposed that several residues might constitute part of the ACAT substrate-binding site(s). A family of more than 20 membrane-boundO-acyltransferases from different species has been identified (17Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 111-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This gene family encodes membrane proteins that transfer organic acids onto hydroxyl groups of membrane-embedded targets. A histidine (460 in human ACAT1) within a long hydrophobic region is invariant within this family, suggesting that it might be part of the active site. In the 1980s, before molecular probes of ACAT were available, Kinnunenet al. (18Kinnunen P.M. DeMichele A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7344-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Kinnunen P.M. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7351-7356Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) used isolated microsomes from rabbit tissue homogenates, performed chemical modification studies, and concluded that certain cysteine residue(s) and certain histidine residue(s) may be near or at the ACAT active site. In the current study, we first purified the histidine-tagged recombinant human ACAT1 (HisACAT1) (14Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) expressed in infected insect High Five (H5) cells to homogeneity. We next showed that the purified ACAT1 is sensitive to various thiol modification reagents including p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid (pCMBS). Human ACAT1 contains 9 cysteine residues. We utilized site-directed mutagenesis to replace each cysteine with an alanine and found that each of the single Cys to Ala mutants retained a significant amount of ACAT activity. We then constructed various ACAT1 mutants with reducing numbers of cysteines, as well as an ACAT1 mutant that completely lacks cysteine. We found that each of these additional mutants retained at least 20% of the activity found in the WT ACAT1; their Km values for oleoyl-CoA and the sigmoidal responses to cholesterol concentration were all similar to those of the WT enzyme. These results indicate that none of the cysteines is essential for ACAT1 catalysis. We also showed that Cys467is one of the major pCMBS target sites that leads to ACAT1 inactivation. Together, our results suggest that pCMBS inhibits ACAT activity by covalently attaching a bulky group to Cys467near the ACAT active site(s). CHAPS, taurocholate, fetal bovine serum, oleoyl-coenzyme A, egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesteryl oleate, cholesterol, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, pCMBS,N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate (DTNB), and iodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma. Dithiothreitol and disuccinimidyl suberate were purchased from Pierce. Reagent grade organic solvents were obtained from Fisher. [9,10-3H(N)]Oleic acid was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (30 Ci/mmol). [3H]Oleoyl-coenzyme A was synthesized as described (20Bishop J.E. Hajra A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cobalt metal affinity resin was fromCLONTECH Laboratories. The monoclonal antibody against human ACAT1 was from Vancouver Biotech. Fugene 6 transfection reagent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Mutagenesis primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. BaculoGold virus DNA and pVL1393 transfer vector were from PharMingen. The F-12 medium was from Cellgro; Grace's medium and Opti-MEM medium were from Invitrogen. His6-tagged human ACAT1cDNA (HisACAT1) (14Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was cloned in pGEM-7Z(−) vector (Promega). Using this construct as a template, various ACAT1 mutants containing single Cys to Ala substitutions were generated by high fidelity PCR-based mutagenesis, using Stratagene's QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Table Ilists the pairs of primers used in the PCR mutagenesis experiments. The mutated ACAT1 cDNAs were released from pGEM-7Z(−) vector by EcoRI and NsiI double digestion and then inserted into EcoRI- and PstI-treated transfer vector pVL1393. The ACAT1-positive transfer vectors were co-transfected into insect SF9 cells with linearized BaculoGold DNA. Five days after transfection, recombinant viruses produced from transfected cells were harvested from the medium and then amplified using SF9 cells. To construct various additional cysteine-deficient mutants, including the one devoid of cysteines, multiple rounds of PCR mutagenesis and subcloning were performed. The construction procedures are briefly described as follows: 1) using the mutant ACAT1C333A construct as the template and appropriate primers, Cys345 and Cys365 were mutated to alanines to produce the construct ACAT1 C6, with 6 cysteines remaining (at positions 92, 387, 467, 516, 528, and 546). 2) Using the mutantACAT1 C467A as the template and appropriate primers, Cys516 and Cys546 were mutated to alanines; the resultant construct was then cut by NdeI andHindIII. The released fragment that contained the region from residues 240 to the C terminus was directionally cloned into the truncated mutant ACAT1 construct C92A produced by cutting the construct by the same enzymes. This procedure produced the mutant construct ACAT1 C5, with 5 cysteines remaining (at positions 333, 345, 365, 387, and 528). 3) The C6 construct was sequentially digested with NcoI and StyI; the released region containing residues 223–464 was swapped with the corresponding region present in the C5 construct by restriction digestion and directional cloning. The resultant construct only retained Cys387 and Cys528 and is designated as C2 (387/528). 4) Using construct C2 (387/528) as the template and appropriate primers, a similar strategy was used to produce construct C1 (528), which has only one cysteine remaining (at position 528), and to produce construct C0, which has no cysteine remaining. 5) The construct C2 (528/546) was produced by reverting the Ala in position 546 back to Cys through mutagenesis, using construct C1 (528) as the template. The C1 (467) mutant and C1 (345) mutant were generated in a similar manner. After PCR mutagenesis, the authenticity of all of the mutations present in mutant cDNAs and in mutant viruses were verified by automatic DNA sequencing at regions flanking the mutations. Viral DNAs were isolated using a published procedure (21O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 141-142Google Scholar). The results verified that all of the mutant cDNAs and all of the mutant viruses contained the correct mutations as predicted.Table ISites of cysteine to alanine mutagenesis in HisACAT1MutationsSense strand primerAnti-sense strand primerC92AGATAATGGTGGGgccGCTCTCACAACCGGTTGTGAGAGCggcCCCACCATTATCC333AGCACAGGTCTTTGGTgccTTTTTCTATGTGCACATAGAAAAAggcACCAAAGACCTGTGCC345ACTTTGAAAGGCTTgctGCCCCCTTGTTTCGGCCGAAACAAGGGGGCageAAGCCTTTCAAAGC365ACGTGTTCTGGTCCTAgctCTATTTAACTCCGGAGTTAAATACageTAGGACCAGAACACGC387AGCCTTTTTGCACgcgTGGCTCAATGCGGCATTGAGCCAcgcGTGCAAAAAGGCC467AGCCTTGGCTGTTgccTTGAGCTTTTTCGAAAAAGCTCAAAggcAACAGCCAAGGCC516AGCAATGGAGTCTTACTCgccTTTTATTCTCAAGCTTGAGAATAAAAggcGAGTAAGACTCCATTGCC528AGGTATGCACGTCGGCACgctCCTCTGAAAAATCGATTTTTCAGAGGagcGTGCCGACGTGCATACCC546ACCACGTTCCTGGACTgctCGTTACGTGTTTTAGCTAAAACACGTAACGagcAGTCCAGGAACGTGGHisACAT1 cDNA was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis, creating nine individual C to A mutations as indicated.

The purification procedure was adopted with modifications from the one published earlier using CHO cells as the enzyme source (14Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In brief, insect H5 cells were cultured in 20–30 150 mm-size tissue culture plates with Grace's medium plus 5% fetal bovine serum. Each plate was infected by a high titer recombinant ACAT1 baculovirus; all of the recombinant ACAT1s contain a His6 tag at their N termini. The cells were harvested by hypotonic shock and scraping after 48 h of infection. The protein concentration of the cell homogenates was kept at 2–4 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris at pH 7.8, with 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell extracts were solubilized in 2% CHAPS and 1 mKCl. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min, the supernatants were loaded onto a 10-ml (1.6 × 5 cm) cobalt affinity column pre-equilibrated with buffer that consists of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5% CHAPS, and 1 mKCl. The column was extensively washed with the column equilibration buffer and then eluted with a buffer of similar composition but containing 10 mm imidazole. Next, the ACAT1-containing fractions were eluted out by using buffer with higher imidazole concentration (50 mm). The active fractions were pooled and further purified by using a 5-ml ACAT1 monoclonal antibody affinity column according to the procedure described previously (14Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The assays were carried out in bile salt/cholesterol/PC mixed micelles as described before (14Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For each reaction, 20 μl of purified WT ACAT1 or various partially purified mutant ACAT1s in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5% CHAPS, and 1m KCl were incubated with 1 μl of a specific thiol modification reagent, prepared individually as stock solutions in Me2SO, at 4 °C for 30 min. Next, the mixtures were diluted 5-fold by adding 80 μl of taurocholate/PC/cholesterol mixed micelles, and the ACAT activity was measured at 37 °C for 5 min after adding 20 μl of labeled oleoyl-CoA/bovine serum albumin mixture (5 nmol). The activities of the enzyme treated with 1 μl of Me2SO only were used as the 100% values. The protein contents of purified ACAT1 were determined by using Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE, using bovine serum albumin as the standard for quantitation purposes. All other protein determinations were made using Peterson's modification of the Lowry method (22Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). Salt and detergent present in each sample were removed using the chloroform/methanol extraction procedure (23Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3184) Google Scholar). All samples were then resuspended in loading buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 9% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue, incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. DM10, the affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit IgGs against ACAT1 amino acid residues 1–131, were used as the primary antibodies for immunoblotting (24Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29532-29540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of immunoblot signals was performed using National Institutes of Health imaging software. Previously, we had purified the recombinant HisACAT1 to homogeneity from a stable transfectant of CHO cells that overexpress hACAT1 (14Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The amount of purified ACAT1 protein from this source is very limited. To seek a better source as starting material for enzyme purification, we attempted to express HisACAT1 through a recombinant virus infection in insect H5 cells, using a procedure similar to the one previously developed in this laboratory (25Cheng D. Chang C.C.Y. Qu X. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We found that the specific activity of ACAT1 present in homogenates of infected H5 cells was 5–10 times higher than that of the same enzyme stably expressed in CHO cells. We thus used this source as the starting material and developed a purification scheme as summarized in Fig.1A. Using this scheme, we purified HisACAT1 protein to electrophoretic homogeneity, as shown in Fig.1B (lanes 6 and 7). We can routinely obtain 5–10 μg of purified ACAT1 protein from 20 150-mm tissue culture plates of infected insect cells. The specific activity of the final preparation is 3,500–4,000 nmol/min/mg, which is comparable with the specific activity of the final preparation obtained by using the CHO cells as the enzyme source (14Chang C.C.Y.

Using purified HisACAT1 as the source, we tested its susceptibility to inactivation by various thiol modification reagents. Four different −SH modifying reagents were employed: pCMBS, DTNB, NEM, and iodoacetamide. We found that either pCMBS or DTNB, each containing a bulky group, inactivated ACAT1 at relatively low concentration (with IC50 at about 10 μm), whereas NEM, a reagent smaller in size, inactivated the enzyme at much higher concentrations. The IC50 for NEM-mediated inhibition is about 50-fold higher than that of pCMBS-mediated or DTNB-mediated inhibition. We also found that iodoacetamide, which is smaller than NEM, did not inactivate ACAT activity even at 1 mm concentration (Fig.2). Therefore, the inhibitory efficiency of these modification reagents seems to correlate well with their sizes. The above result supported the hypothesis that certain Cys residue(s) may be near or at the ACAT active site. We undertook the site-specific mutagenesis approach to further investigate this issue. Human ACAT1 contains 9 cysteines, with their locations indicated in Fig.3A. Among them, Cys92, Cys365, Cys467, and Cys516 are conserved in ACAT1s from various species; Cys333, Cys345, Cys387, Cys528, and Cys546 are conserved in both ACAT1s and ACAT2s. On the other hand, none of these cysteines is conserved in DGAT1, an ACAT homolog that also uses long chain fatty acyl-CoA as a substrate. We converted each of these 9 cysteines to an alanine, then incorporated each mutant into the recombinant baculovirus genome, and expressed it in H5 cells. The ACAT protein expression levels were monitored by performing Western blotting using anti-ACAT1 IgGs (DM10) and by measuring ACAT activity in the crude cell extracts. The results showed that, similar to the WT ACAT1, each mutant ACAT1 was expressed as a single, undegraded 50-kDa band (Fig. 3B, bandsnear the top). The ACAT enzyme specific activity determinations showed that each mutant ACAT1 was at least partially active when compared with the activity of the WT ACAT1 (Fig.3B, bars near the bottom). The expression levels of individual ACAT1 mutants varied to some extent, as judged by the intensities of bands in Western blot analysis (Fig.3B). When the activities of the WT and mutant ACATs present in the cell extracts were normalized by the ACAT protein content, the results showed that all of the Cys to Ala mutants contained 50% or more of the WT ACAT activity (Fig. 3C). The variations in activity in some of the ACAT1s with single Cys to Ala substitutions might be caused by subtle structural alteration(s) induced by the individual mutations. The above result suggested that cysteines might not be required for ACAT1 catalysis. We asked whether mutant ACAT1s with reducing numbers of cysteines still retain enzyme activity. To test this possibility, we produced the following mutant ACAT1 viruses: C6 (retaining cysteines at positions 92, 387, 467, 516, 528, and 546); C5 (retaining cysteines at positions 333, 345, 365, 387, and 528); C2 (387/528) (retaining cysteines at positions 387 and 528); C2 (528/546) (retaining cysteines at positions 528 and 546); C1 (528) (retaining cysteine at position 528); and C0 (retaining no cysteines). The enzyme activities of these mutant proteins expressed in infected cells were then analyzed. The results showed that all of the Cys-deficient ACAT1s examined retained at least partial enzyme activity (based on specific activity measurement (Fig. 4A)). To compare the relative ACAT activity in a more precise manner, we loaded the same amount of ACAT activity found in each cell extract and then monitored their relative ACAT protein contents by Western analysis. When analyzed in this manner, one expects that those cell extracts containing higher intrinsic enzyme activity will give less intense ACAT1 protein signals. The results (Fig. 4B) showed that mutant ACAT1 C6 contained essentially the same activity as the WT ACAT1; other mutant ACAT1s (C5, C2 (387/528), and C1 (528)) contained ∼33–59% of the activity of WT ACAT1. The one completely devoid of cysteines (C0) still contained ∼40% of the activity of WT ACAT1. We next expressed several Cys-deficient mutant ACAT1s (the C2 (528/546), C1 (528), and the C0) in ACAT-deficient CHO cells (AC29) by transient transfections. The relative enzyme activities of these mutants were evaluated by performing [3H]oleate incorporation in intact cells (Fig.5A) and by immunoblot (Fig.5B). The normalized ACAT activities were calculated by dividing the values in Fig. 5A by the values in Fig.5B. The result showed that the C1 (528) mutant and the C0 mutant still contained a significant amount of residual enzyme activity, supporting the conclusion derived from insect cell expression studies. The expression levels of the C1 and C0 mutant ACAT1s in CHO cells were much lower than that of the WT ACAT1 (Fig. 5B), and it is difficult to precisely evaluate their relative contents within the same blot. Therefore, for ACAT-specific activity determinations, the results obtained in Fig. 5C may not be as precise as those obtained in Fig. 4B. To examine the intracellular location of the C0 mutant in CHO cells, we performed double immunofluorescence experiments using laser scanning confocal microscopy with differential interference contrast optics. We found that the mutant ACAT1 C0 extensively colocalized with the ER marker Bip (Fig. 5D). Its localization pattern is essentially the same as what we had previously reported for the WT ACAT1 expressed in CHO cells (12Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.S. Chen J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The same localization patterns were also found for ACAT1 mutant C2 (528/546) and for mutant C1 (528) (results not shown). We had previously used chemical cross-linking in intact cells as one of three methods to estimate the oligomeric state of WT ACAT1 (11Yu C. Chen J. Lin S. Liu J. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36139-36145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that the amine-specific homo-bifunctional chemical cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate caused the formation of material two to four times the size of the monomeric enzyme when added to intact insect cells expressing either WT ACAT1 or mutant ACAT1 C0 (Fig. 6). This result suggested that mutant ACAT1 C0, similar to WT ACAT1, is also a homotetrameric enzyme.Figure 5Cys-deficient HisACAT1s expressed in CHOcells are catalytically active, and are localized mainly in theER.

HIP proteolysis by thrombin and chymotrypsin generates essentially two fragments, an NH2-terminal fragment of 25 kDa (N25) and a COOH-terminal fragment of 18 kDa (C18) that appear to be well folded and stable as indicated by circular dichroism and recombinant expression in Escherichia coli. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of the respective fragments indicates that both proteases cleave HIP within a predicted α-helix following the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) region, despite their different specificities and the presence of several potential cleavage sites scattered throughout the sequence, thus suggesting that this region is particularly accessible and may constitute a linker between two structural domains. After size exclusion chromatography, N25 and C18 elute as two distinct and homogeneous species having a Stokes radius of 49 and 24 Å, respectively. Equilibrium sedimentation and sedimentation velocity indicate that N25 is a stable dimer, whereas C18 is monomeric in solution, with sedimentation coefficients of 3.2 and 2.3 S andf/fo values of 1.5 and 1.1 for N25 and C18, respectively, indicating that the N25 is elongated whereas C18 is globular in shape. Both domains are able to bind to the ATPase domain of HSC70 and inhibit rhodanese aggregation. Moreover, their effects appear to be additive when used in combination, suggesting a cooperation of these domains in the full-length protein not only for HSC70 binding but also for chaperone activity. Altogether, these results indicate that HIP is made of two structural and functional domains, an NH2-terminal 25-kDa domain, responsible for the dimerization and the overall asymmetry of the molecule, and a COOH-terminal 18-kDa globular domain, both involved in HSC70 and unfolded protein binding.

Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). During this process, HSP70 switches between two forms, an ADP-bound state and ATP-bound state, depending on the efficiency of ATP hydrolysis and that of ADP to ATP exchange and on the modulation by regulatory proteins called cochaperones. InEscherichia coli HSP70 (DnaK), the cochaperone DnaJ activates the hydrolysis of ATP by DnaK, thereby stabilizing the protein in its high affinity ADP form, while the cochaperone GrpE stimulates the exchange of ADP by ATP, thus helping the protein to switch back to its low affinity ATP form (6Theyssen H.

In mammals, however, the situation is less clear, and only homologues of the DnaK-ATPase stimulation factor DnaJ have been found in all cell compartments (10Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem.

HIP, a protein of 368 residues, regulates HSC70 chaperone activity by binding to its NH2-terminal domain and stabilizing the protein in its ADP form, which has a high affinity for the polypeptide substrates (18Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It also participates in the maturation of the progesterone receptor by cooperating with HSP70, HSP90, and in the maturation complex (19Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar). High resolution structure of HIP has not been determined, but the polypeptide is assumed to comprise a series of consecutive modules based on sequence alignment criteria and mutagenesis studies (20Irmer H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2230-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Prapapanich V. Chen S. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6200-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On this basis, the protein appears to be composed of an NH2-terminal module (residues 1–15) responsible for the protein oligomerization, a central TPR module (residues 113–214) involved in HSC70 binding followed by a highly charged region (residues 229–271) and a GGMP-rich module (residues 282–310) with unknown function. Although this structural representation may give some insight into the overall organization of the protein and its possible relation to function, it gives little information on the number, the nature, and the actual boundaries of the domains in the folded protein. Since protein domains are usually made of well structured, independently folded units that are linked together by solvent accessible, unstructured regions (22Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev.

Oppliger W. Vergeres G. Demel R. Jeno P. Horst M. de Kruijff B. Schatz G. Azem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Freedman R.B.

This approach takes advantage of the fact that mild proteolysis will affect preferentially unstructured accessible regions rather than well structured and compactly folded domains (27Muhlberg A.B.

In this report, we describe direct studies of the domain organization of HIP based on limited proteolysis of the native protein as well as structural and functional characterization of the isolated domains. All size exclusion chromatography experiments were performed using an AKTA-FPLC system and columns from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Thrombin from human plasma and α-chymotrypsin from bovine pancreas (type VII 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated) were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant HIP was expressed and purified as described by Velten et al. (32Velten M. Villoutreix B.O. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HIP was submitted to proteolysis by thrombin (10−4 units/μg of HIP/μl) or α-chymotrypsin (2 × 10−6 units/μg of HIP/μl) at 37 °C in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 2.5 mmCaCl2. At the indicated times, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed, treated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1 mm to stop the reaction, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteolysis fragments (∼10 μg each) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the Transblot cell from Bio-Rad. Proteins corresponding to the bands on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were then subjected to NH2-terminal automatic sequence determination. The CD spectra of HIP, N25, and C18 at about 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate at pH 8 were acquired with a Jobin-Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter at room temperature. To optimize the signal/noise ratio, the spectra were recorded on two contiguous regions, one between 182 and 200 nm, using an integration time of 5 s per step, and the second between 200 and 260 using a 1-s integration time per step. A constant step of 0.5 nm was used in both regions. Each spectrum results from averaging five successive scans. The base line was acquired under the same conditions. The CD intensities were converted in terms of differential molar extinction per residue. The protein concentrations were determined from amino acid analyses of the samples, using alanine, or tyrosine or phenylalanine as reference. The normalized spectra were then deconvoluted using the Varselec program (30Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). HIP was subjected to proteolysis by thrombin (57 × 10−6units/μg of HIP/μl) for 40 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1 mm. To separate the two domains, the reaction mixture was injected at room temperature onto a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column preequilibrated in buffer A. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and those containing either N25 or C18 were separately concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM10 membrane; Amicon) and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Vectors expressing N25 or C18 fused to a histidine tag at the amino-terminal extremity were constructed by subcloning the corresponding polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of the rat HIP cDNA into a pET28 plasmid (Novagen). N25 contains residues 1–226, and C18 contains residues 227–368 of rat HIP. The two constructions were controlled by nucleotide sequencing. Tagged N25 and C18 were expressed and purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column, according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen). The plasmid expressing the C15 mutant was kindly provided by David Smith and Viravan Prapapanich (31Prapapanich V. Chen S. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The corresponding protein was purified as described for HIP (32Velten M. Villoutreix B.O. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PAGE in denaturing conditions (SDS) was carried out in 0.75-mm-thick 12% acrylamide slab gels. Gels were run using the Mini-Protean II apparatus from Bio-Rad. Western blot was performed by transferring the proteins, after migration on a 15% acrylamide gel, to a nitrocellulose membrane using the Transblot cell from Bio-Rad. The membrane was then incubated with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody diluted 1:2000 (Invitrogen). This antibody is conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and therefore has been detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Samples of N25 and C18 in buffer A were loaded at room temperature on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 preequilibrated in buffer A. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and absorbance was measured at 280 nm. Proteins of known molecular weight and Stokes radius were used for the calibration curve representing the Stokes radius (RS) as a function of the distribution coefficientKav (33Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar, 34le Maire M. Rivas E. Moller J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The molecular mass standards used were ferritin (440 kDa, RS = 61 Å), catalase (232 kDa, RS = 52.2 Å), aldolase (158 kDa,RS = 48.1 Å), albumin (67 kDa,RS = 35.5 Å), ovalbumin (43 kDa,RS = 30.5Å), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa,RS = 20.9 Å), and RNase A (13.7 kDa,RS = 16.4 Å). N25 and C18 molecular masses could be estimated by a combination of the Svedberg and Stokes equations, using the experimental Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an AnTi 60 titanium four-hole rotor with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces, as previously described (35Benaroudj N. Batelier G. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The compartments were filled with 400 μl of three different concentrations of N25 (0.3, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml) or C18 (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/ml) in buffer A and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm at 4 °C. Radial scans of the absorbance at 280 or 230 nm were taken at 5- or 8-min intervals, respectively, for N25 and C18. Experimental base lines were measured for each sample at the end of the run. N25 and C18 remained stable during the time of the run as shown by SDS-PAGE before and after the run. Data analysis was performed, and hydrodynamic parameters were evaluated as described in Ref. 32Velten M. Villoutreix B.O. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. The molecular mass of the monomer (N25, 25,596 Da; C18, 17,966 Da) and the partial specific volume at 4 °C (vN25 = 0.720 cm3·g−1; vC18 = 0.714 cm3·g−1) and at 20 °C (vN25 = 0.726 cm3·g−1; vC18 = 0.720 cm3·g−1), calculated from the amino acid composition, and the solvent density (ρ4 °C = 1.00462 g/cm3; ρ20 °C = 1.00294 g/cm3) were obtained as previously described (32Velten M. Villoutreix B.O. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For C18, the amino acid composition takes into account the addition of Myc epitope and the histidine tag at the COOH terminus of the protein. The degree of hydration of the N25 and C18 proteins (0.495 gH2/gprotein and 0.450 gH2/gprotein, respectively) was estimated on the basis of the amino acid composition and corrected as described in Ref. 32Velten M. Villoutreix B.O. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar. Thus, degrees of hydration of 0.346 gH2/gproteinfor N25 and 0.315 gH2/gprotein for C18 were used for the calculation of the axial ratioa/b of the hydrodynamically equivalent prolate ellipsoid of revolution. The frictional ratiof/fo was calculated using the corrected sedimentation coefficient, s 20,w0, and the molecular weight obtained by sedimentation equilibrium. Molecular mass of N25 and C18 proteins was determined by sedimentation equilibrium at 4 °C using three loading concentrations of N25 (0.3, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml) or C18 (0.075, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/ml) in buffer A and three rotor speeds (9000, 12,000, and 17,000 rpm for N25; 14,000, 20,000, and 28,000 rpm for C18). Radial scans of the absorbance at 280 nm for N25 or 230 nm for C18 were taken at 3-h intervals, and samples were judged to be at equilibrium by the absence of systematic deviations in overlaid successive scans and when a constant average molecular weight was obtained in plots of molecular weight versus centrifugation time. N25 and C18 proteins remained stable during the time of the run as shown by SDS-PAGE before and after the run. Multiple data sets were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares procedures provided in the Beckman Optima XL-A software package. Base line offset was obtained from meniscus depletion of the sample at 40,000 rpm at the end of the run. Data analysis was performed as previously described (32Velten M. Villoutreix B.O. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rhodanese was denatured in 6m guanidinium HCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C for 1 h and then diluted 100-fold to a final concentration of 0.5 μm into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, in the presence or absence of 1 μm of effector (HIP, N25, or C18) or lysozyme as a control. Turbidity of the samples under constant agitation was measured at 320 nm for 20 min at 25 °C. 10 μmhistidine-tagged protein (HIP, N25, or C18) was incubated with 20 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid bed resin (Quiagen) in a final volume of 40 μl in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mm KCl) for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with 0.5 ml of buffer B and was then incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with a 20 μm concentration of the ATPase domain of HSC70 (N-HSC70) or citrate synthase as a control, in buffer B containing 0.1 mm ADP in a final volume of 40 μl (N-HSC70 was purified as described (36Benaroudj N. Fouchaq B. Ladjimi M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8744-8751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The resin was washed four times with 0.5 ml of buffer B containing 0.1 mm ADP. Specifically retained protein was eluted by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with buffer B containing 1 mm ATP in a final volume of 40 μl. Tagged protein was then eluted by incubation for 10 min at 4 °C with buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole in a final volume of 40 μl. The washing fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. HIP was submitted to a mild proteolysis by thrombin and chymotrypsin for different time periods and subsequently analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig.1A, proteolysis by thrombin led to the complete disappearance of HIP and the formation of essentially two fragments with apparent molecular masses of 35 and 20 kDa. Longer incubation times with the protease resulted in further cleavage of the 35-kDa fragment, yielding a 30-kDa fragment. Proteolysis by chymotrypsin, a protease having a different specificity, gave two major fragments of 36 and 18 kDa and two minor fragments of 30 and 13 kDa. These 30- and 13-kDa fragments seemed to be formed to the detriment of the 36- and 18-kDa fragments, as indicated by the kinetics of cleavage and the fact that the former fragments accumulated at the expense of the latter. This was corroborated by NH2-terminal sequencing of the different fragments and comparison of the amino acid sequences obtained with that of HIP. As shown in Table I, HIP was cleaved between residues 237 and 238 by chymotrypsin, giving the two major fragments of 36 and 18 kDa apparent molecular mass, which in turn were cleaved at their COOH-terminal extremity, resulting in the formation of the 30- and 13-kDa fragments, respectively, as indicated by the nature of their NH2 termini (Table I). Similarly, thrombin cleaved HIP between residues 226 and 227, within the same main region as that recognized by chymotrypsin. Thus, the 35-kDa fragment (thrombin) and 36-kDa fragment (chymotrypsin) are NH2-terminal fragments, while the 20-kDa fragment (thrombin) and 18-kDa fragment (chymotrypsin) are COOH-terminal fragments of HIP.Table ICharacterization of proteolytic fragmentsProteaseApparent mass1-aEstimated from migration by SDS-PAGE.N-terminal residue1-bThe number of the residue in full-length HIP is indicated.N-terminal sequencekDaThrombin351-cFor clarity, the 35-kDa and 20-kDa fragments used in this study are called N25 and C18 based on their theoretical molecular mass and their position in the HIP sequence.1MDPRKVSE30ND1-dND, not determined.ND201-cFor clarity, the 35-kDa and 20-kDa fragments used in this study are called N25 and C18 based on their theoretical molecular mass and their position in the HIP sequence.227AQKIAEHChymotrypsin361MDPRKVSE301MDPRKVSE18238ERKREEREI13238ERKREEREIRecombinant HIP was treated with either thrombin or α-chymotrypsin.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant HIP was treated with either thrombin or α-chymotrypsin. The resulting fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing. Confirmation of this came from Western blot analysis of the proteolysis products, since HIP used in this study bears a Myc epitope at its COOH-terminal extremity. As shown in Fig. 1B, only the 20-kDa fragment obtained after thrombin cleavage and the 18-kDa fragment obtained after chymotrypsin digestion are revealed by an anti-Myc antibody. Altogether, these results are summarized in Fig.2, where the cleavage sites are mapped onto the primary structure and sequence modules of HIP as determined previously by sequence alignment, structural modeling, and mutagenesis studies (20Irmer H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2230-2235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Prapapanich V. Chen S. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell.

Thus, both proteases cleave HIP within a highly charged region that is adjacent to the TPR region and predicted to have an α-helical structure, yielding an NH2-terminal fragment of 226 (thrombin) or 237 (chymotrypsin) residues and a COOH-terminal fragment of 160 (thrombin) or 149 (chymotrypsin) residues. Since the work that follows was performed with thrombin proteolysis fragments, and for clarity, the 35-kDa fragment will be named N25, and the 18-kDa fragment will be named C18 (see also Table I), based on their theoretical molecular mass and their respective positions in the HIP sequence. To obtain large quantities of N25 and C18 fragments of HIP for subsequent purification and analysis, limited proteolysis by thrombin was performed on a preparative scale, and the resultant reaction mixture was subjected to size exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig. 3, two well defined peaks are obtained, peaks 1 and 2, having apparent molecular masses of about 170 and 30 kDa, respectively, that correspond to the N25 and C18 as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, inset). Thus, the two fragments of HIP eluted as two distinct species, having well defined molecular masses and Stokes radii, indicating either that they do not interact in the entire protein or that their interaction is lost after cleavage. Furthermore, the fact that N25 elutes as a 170-kDa protein and C18 as a 30-kDa protein, while their molecular mass deduced from amino acid composition corresponds to 25 and 18 kDa, respectively, indicates that N25 is oligomeric whereas the C18 is rather monomeric. Since these results suggested that N25 and C18 fragments may correspond to two independent structural domains, recombinant expression inE. coli of cDNAs corresponding to residues 1–226 (N25) and 227–368 (C18) of HIP fused to a histidine tail have been performed using pET expression vectors. Significant amounts of the respective proteins have been obtained in a soluble form and purified using affinity chromatography (results not shown). Recombinant N25 and C18 were found to be indistinguishable from their proteolytic counterparts in terms of Stokes radius and the ability to inhibit rhodanese aggregation and to bind to the NH2-terminal domain of HSC70 (results not shown). Thus, N25 and C18 could be expressed in soluble forms and purified from E. coli as independent structural and functional units. N25 and C18 proteolysis fragments could not only be produced in E. coli as active independent units, but they also show a high content in secondary structure comparable with that found in authentic proteins. As shown in Fig.4A, the far-UV CD spectra of N25 and C18 fragments are typical of well structured polypeptides with a large amount of α-helices (maximum at 191–192 nm; minima at 207–208 and 222 nm). The deconvolution of these spectra fits the experimental data well. As shown in TableII, the proportions of α-helix and β-structures of N25 are very close to those of HIP. Moreover, the coincidence between the spectrum of the stoichiometric mixture of N25 and C18 and the sum of the individual spectra of isolated fragments (not shown) is in agreement with the absence of any detectable interaction between the fragments as observed by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3). By contrast, and as shown in Fig.4B, there is a difference between the CD spectrum of HIP and that corresponding to the stoichiometric mixture of N25 and C18. This difference clearly indicates a structural change in the corresponding regions of HIP upon proteolysis, or when the fragments are produced as individual polypeptides. This is corroborated by the fact that the proportion of α-helices in C18 is significantly smaller than in HIP.Table IISecondary structure of HIP and its proteolytic fragmentsHIPN25C18N25/C182-aEquimolar mixture of N25 and C18 fragments.α-helix (%)55534047Anti-parallel β-sheet (%)69910Parallel β-sheet (%)3421Turns (%)21202418Other (%)21273324Total (%)1.001.131.081.00RMS2-bRoot mean square deviation given by the Varselec fitting procedure (30).0.1340.1320.1590.129Secondary structure contents of isolated HIP, N25, C18, or an equimolar mixture of N25 and C18 were determined by circular dichroism experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-a Equimolar mixture of N25 and C18 fragments.2-b Root mean square deviation given by the Varselec fitting procedure (30Manavalan P.

A fragment of TFIIIC131 that contains the hydrophilic amino terminus and two TPR arrays, with five and four repeats, respectively (Nt-TPR9), is sufficient to support an interaction with TFIIIB70. Here we evaluate the contribution of each TPR array to TFIIIB70 binding. Both TPR arrays bind independently to TFIIIB70 with TPR6–9 having a 4-fold higher apparent affinity than TPR1–5. However, the TPR arrays are not sufficient for a high affinity interaction with TFIIIB70. The addition of amino-terminal sequences increases the affinity of TPR1–5 18-fold to create a high affinity TFIIIB70 binding site (Nt-TPR5, 44 ± 6 nm). Although the Nt-TPR5 and TPR6–9 fragments are contained entirely within the Nt-TPR9 fragment, the affinity of the latter is significantly lower than either of these smaller fragments. The results demonstrate that the TFIIIB70 binding sites in TFIIIC131 are subject to autoinhibition. We propose that the binding of TFIIIB70 to these sites within the TFIIIC complex may proceed in an ordered fashion.

RNA polymerase III transcription factor tetratricopeptide repeat protein phosphatase 5 intervening region TATA-binding protein In eukaryotic cells, the transcription of 5 S rRNA, tRNA, and related genes by RNA polymerase III (pol III)1 is dependent on transcription factor (TF) IIIC for promoter recognition and recruitment of the initiation factor TFIIIB to the DNA upstream of the transcription start site (1White R.J.

Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The TPR motif is a degenerate 34-amino acid motif that is often found in tandem arrays (17Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem.

TPR-containing proteins are ubiquitous and participate in a diverse range of processes that are linked only by the primary function of the TPR as a protein·protein interaction domain (19Hirano T.

Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). For example, in the seven tandem TPRs of PEX5, TPRs1–3 and TPRs5–7 are arranged in two antiparallel superhelices separated by a hinge region (TPR4). The TPR4 hinge forms a single long helix rather than the usual TPR fold and thus enables the two TPR superhelices to surround the ligand (23Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues that line the TPR superhelical groove provide the ligand binding interface and confer binding specificity, as exemplified by the TPR domains of the co-chaperone Hop (26Scheufler C.

Alternatively, the internal groove can function as a scaffold upon which a non-TPR ligand binding interface is organized, as for the p67phoxsubunit of NADPH oxidase (24Lapouge K. Smith J.S. Walker A.P. Gamblin J.S. Smerdon J.S. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). TPR domains may also function as ligand-dependent modifiers of protein activity: Either deletion of or lipid binding to the TPR domain of protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) activates the catalytic activity of the enzyme (27Sinclair C. Borchers C. Parker C. Tomer K. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23666-23672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). TFIIIC131 contains 11 TPRs organized into two tandem arrays of five and four repeats, respectively, and two single repeats (28Marck C. Lefebvre O. Carles C. Riva M. Chaussivert N. Ruet A. Sentenac A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4027-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Dominant mutations in and around the second TPR increase pol III transcription from a tRNA A block promoter mutant in vivo, and thus the function of this region has been implicated in an important limiting step (10Moir R.D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies with TFIIIC preparations from the dominant TPR mutant strains have demonstrated that increased transcription of wild-type and mutant templates results from the facilitated recruitment of TFIIIB70 (10Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying this facilitated recruitment is complex: Biochemical data for the PCF1–2 mutation (T167I in TPR2) are consistent with a conformational change within TFIIIC131 that affects the extent to which the binding reaction can proceed (10Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TPR-mediated changes in the nature and/or accessibility of the TFIIIB70 binding site may also underlie the 4-fold decrease in the two-hybrid interaction that occurs when the minimal TFIIIB70 interaction domain, τ131–1TPR-(1–165), is extended up to the end of TPR9 (8Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Changes in the conformation of TFIIIC131 during preinitiation complex assembly are also indicated by site-specific DNA·protein photocross-linking experiments (7Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and have been proposed to underlie the capacity of TFIIIC to vary the placement of TFIIIB on the DNA (30Joazeiro C.A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although a role for TPRs in this conformational flexibility of TFIIIC has been suggested (3Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), the function of TPRs in the recruitment of TFIIIB to DNA is not well understood at the present time. To better understand the contribution that each TPR domain makes to the recruitment of TFIIIB70, we have characterized fragments of TFIIIC131 using a quantitative equilibrium binding assay (31Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that each TPR array (TPR1–5 and TPR6–9) binds independently to TFIIIB70 with differential affinity and that addition of the amino terminus to TPR1–5 creates a high affinity site for TFIIIB70 binding (Nt-TPR5). Finally, because the binding sites in Nt-TPR5 and TPR6–9 have higher affinity for TFIIIB70 than a larger fragment (Nt-TPR9) containing both of these sites, the results provide evidence for autoinhibition in the interaction between TFIIIC131 and TFIIIB70. A wild-type clone of the gene encoding the 131-kDa subunit of yeast TFIIIC131 (PCF1/TFC4 (28Marck C. Lefebvre O. Carles C. Riva M. Chaussivert N. Ruet A. Sentenac A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); Nt-TPR5, amino acids 1–303; TPR1–5, amino acids 118–303 with the substitutions Q118M and R119G; TPR1–9, amino acids 118–580 with the substitutions Q118M and R119G; IVR+TPR6–9, amino acids 298–580 with the substitution R298M; and TPR6–9, amino acids 432–580 with the substitution I432M. In addition, proteins terminating at amino acid 580 contained the substitution N579L, whereas those terminating at amino acid 303 contained the substitution A303E. Nt-TPR9 was expressed and purified under native conditions on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen), followed by heparin-agarose and hydroxylapatite (Bio-gel HTP, Bio-Rad) column chromatography as previously described (31Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All other TFIIIC131 derivatives were purified under denaturing conditions on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Nt-TPR5 and TPR1–9 were then further purified by preparative SDS-PAGE. The proteins were detected by negative staining with 4 m sodium acetate, electroeluted (Elutrap, Schleicher and Schuell), and then passed over Extracti-Gel D columns (Pierce Chemical Co.) to remove the SDS. Proteins prepared under denaturing conditions were dialyzed into 6m guanidine-HCl and then into refolding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.5 m sodium acetate, 5% glycerol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol containing 8 m urea. Brij-58 (0.01%) was added to the samples, and the urea concentration was reduced by dialysis following sequential 2-fold dilutions of the dialysate. The purified proteins were stored in refolding buffer containing 0.5 m urea at −70 °C and at concentrations of 60–400 μm. The concentration of the purified proteins was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients calculated from the protein sequences (GCG software). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining to calculate purity and to independently estimate protein concentration by comparison to a standard curve of affinity-purified bovine serum albumin. Digital images of the stained gels were analyzed using ImageQuaNT version 5.0 software. Concentrations of fragments determined by absorbance and by Coomassie Blue staining relative to bovine serum albumin were the same ±10%. For IVR+TPR6–9, the concentration of the full-length fragment, determined by Coomassie staining as described above, was used to estimate binding affinity. The preparation of recombinant TBP, TFIIIB70, and TFIIIB90 and purified yeast TFIIIC has been described previously (31Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transcription complex assembly and electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels was performed as previously described (10Moir R.D. Sethy-Coraci I. Puglia K. Librizzi M.D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7119-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions in 20 μl contained a sup3-eST probe (10 fmol, quantified by fluorescence analysis using PicoGreen reagent, Molecular Probes, Inc.), yeast TFIIIC (10 fmol), TFIIIB70 (3000 fmol), TBP (1000 fmol), and TFIIIB90 (400 fmol) as required in various experiments and were incubated at 20 °C for 60 min before heparin treatment and electrophoresis. At this level of input TFIIIC, TFIIIB70 was limiting and both TBP and TFIIIB90 were present in saturating amounts for TFIIIB·DNA complex assembly. In assays containing truncated TFIIIC proteins, these proteins were added to preformed TFIIIC·DNA complexes prior to the addition of the TFIIIB subunits. Digital images collected on phosphor storage screens were quantified using ImageQuaNT software. Individual lines, one lane wide, were analyzed using Peak Finder to calculate peak areas corresponding to the TFIIIB·DNA complex. These values, when paired with the corresponding TFIIIC131 fragment concentration, yielded a transition curve describing the inhibition reaction. Importantly, the TFIIIC·DNA concentration in complex assembly assays never exceeded 0.25 nm. This is more than 150-fold lower than the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant determined for the complex with the highest affinity (Table I). Thus, under the conditions employed, the difference between the total and free TFIIIC131 fragment concentration in the reactions is negligible. The upper limit of complex assembly was determined by non-linear least squares analysis using the Hill equation in Microcal Origin version 5.0 software (Microcal Software Inc.) This limiting value was used to generate a scaled inhibition isotherm in which the relative level of TFIIIB·DNA complex formation is expressed as a function of TFIIIC131 fragment concentration. Multiple scaled data sets for each TFIIIC131 fragment were then simultaneously re-fit to the Hill equation. Errors associated with the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants and the Hill co-efficients were determined during curve fitting. Inhibition by TPR1–5, unlike the other TFIII131 fragments, was incomplete and reached a plateau at around 9–24% of the uninhibited level in different experiments. This fragment also did not easily remain in solution at high concentrations (>400 μm). However, at concentrations of ≤0.5 μm, fragment inhibition of complex assembly was well described by the Langmuir binding polynomial (i.e. the Hill equation with the Hill co-efficient fixed at 1.0).Table ITFIIIB70 binding properties of truncated TFIIIC131 proteinsTFIIIC131 fragmentApparent KD for fragment · TFIIIB70 interaction1-aErrors were determined during curve fitting of multiple concatenated datasets using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm.

Open table in a new tab S. cerevisiae TFIIIC131 homologs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (AL031535.1), Homo sapiens (AF133123.1), and Kluyveromyces lactis (AF229182.1) were recovered from the NCBI by BLASTp searches and were used as annotated. A protein query of S. cerevisiae TPR2 to unfinished nucleotide sequence data bases recovered homologies in Candida albicans andDrosophila melanogaster(gnl Stanford_5476 C.albicans_Con4–2667 C. albicansunfinished fragment of complete genome, D. melanogasterAE003804 [Full Sequence] genomic scaffold 142000013386047). The respective contigs were translated in all reading frames to identify the extent of homology to S. cerevisiae TFIIIC131. Because many non-related TPR-containing proteins were recovered in this manner, TFIIIC131 homologs were required to conform in size and TPR domain organization to TFIIIC131. The putative Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog (Z70783.1) was excluded from our analysis because sequence homology was limited to only the first TPR array and the carboxyl terminus. The initial protein alignment was generated using ClustalW software, Version 1.8 (available at www.workbench.sdsc.edu), and subsequent realignment was made manually after visual inspection. In a previous study, we expressed the amino-terminal half of TFIIIC131 up to the end of TPR9 (Fig. 1A,Nt-TPR9) and characterized its structure in solution by circular dichroism and partial proteolysis (31Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additionally, using a coupled equilibrium binding assay, we showed that the interaction between Nt-TPR9 and TFIIIB70 is well described by a single-site binding model and an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 333 nm. To examine the ability of different TFIIIC131 structural domains to interact with TFIIIB70, we have now expressed and analyzed a series of truncated derivatives of Nt-TPR9 (Fig. 1A). The individual TPR arrays were expressed independently, with (Nt-TPR5 and IVR+TPR6–9) or without (TPR1–5 and TPR6–9) adjacent non-TPR sequences. Among these fragments, Nt-TPR5 is known to encompass the minimal TFIIIB70 interaction domain defined by two-hybrid experiments (8Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, a fragment containing both TPR arrays and the intervening region (IVR) was also prepared (TPR1–9). These truncated proteins were expressed as carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine fusions in Escherichia coli, purified under denaturing conditions on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, and refolded. The Nt-TPR5 and TPR1–9 proteins were additionally purified to separate the full-length proteins from smaller species (see “Experimental Procedures”). With one exception (IVR+TPR6–9, see below), all of the protein preparations were >90% pure (Fig. 1B). For IVR+TPR6–9, the full-length protein was determined to be 50% pure. The remainder of this preparation contained two smaller TFIIIC131 fragments in approximately equimolar proportions. The larger of these fragments contained TPRs6–9 with about 5 kDa of IVR sequence, whereas the smaller fragment had its amino terminus within the TPR array (Fig. 1B). In our previous work (31Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we noted the aberrant mobility of Nt-TPR9 (apparent molecular mass of 79 kDa compared with the predicted value of 69 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. This property is attributed to the hydrophilic amino terminus, because an uncharacteristic mobility is also seen for Nt-TPR5 (apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa compared with the predicted value of 36 kDa) but not for TPR1-TPR9 (predicted molecular mass of 55 kDa, Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3). Our previous characterization of Nt-TPR9 showed that it interacts with TFIIIB70 in solution and inhibits the formation of TFIIIB70·TFIIIC·DNA complexes as assayed by native gel electrophoresis (31Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We therefore assayed each of the truncated TFIIIC131 proteins for the ability to interact similarly with TFIIIB70. At a concentration of 3 μm, all of the truncated TFIIIC131 proteins were competent for binding to TFIIIB70 (Fig.1C). The loss of TFIIIB70·TFIIIC·DNA complexes upon addition of the TFIIIC131 fragments is readily detected by native gel electrophoresis and can be quantified directly if the gel quality is high. However, even in the best experiments, accurate quantitation is technically demanding because of the limited separation of the TFIIIC·DNA and TFIIIB70·TFIIIC·DNA complexes and requires the use of peak-fitting software. We therefore chose to quantify the interaction between the TFIIIC131 fragments and TFIIIB70 indirectly using our previously described coupled equilibrium binding assay (31Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This assay monitors the inhibition of heparin-resistant TFIIIB·DNA complex formation that occurs when TFIIIC131 fragments compete with TFIIIC·DNA for binding to TFIIIB70 in the presence of excess TBP and TFIIIB90. Titrations of each TFIIIC131 fragment were performed, and the heparin-stripped TFIIIB·DNA complexes were resolved on native gels. The quantitation of these complexes as a function of TFIIIC131 fragment concentration produces an inhibition isotherm (see “Experimental Procedures”). Global (simultaneous) analysis of multiple titrations of each fragment is then performed to accurately describe the pattern of inhibition and to determine an apparent dissociation constant for the fragment·TFIIIB70 interaction. Representative titrations of Nt-TPR9 and Nt-TPR5 (Fig.2A) indicate that these fragments exhibit a concentration-dependent difference in the inhibition of TFIIIB·DNA complex assembly. This difference was confirmed in a global analysis of multiple independent titrations of Nt-TPR9 and Nt-TPR5 (Fig. 2B). The global analysis yielded Hill coefficients of approximately one as expected for single-site non-cooperative binding of each of these proteins to TFIIIB70 (TableI). Titrations of Nt-TPR9 performed subsequent to our initial analysis of this fragment confirmed the apparent KD for the Nt-TPR9·TFIIIB70 complex reported previously (Fig. 2, Table I and ref. 31Moir R.D. Puglia K.V. Willis I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26591-26598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, the data showed that the apparent KD for the Nt-TPR5·TFIIIB70 complex was more than 7-fold higher than that determined for Nt-TPR9 (Fig. 2B and Table I). These experiments establish that Nt-TPR5 contains a high affinity binding site for TFIIIB70. Because Nt-TPR5 is contained entirely within Nt-TPR9, the sequences downstream of TPR5 must negatively affect the affinity of Nt-TPR5 for TFIIIB70. This result is consistent with two-hybrid data showing that the interaction between Nt-TPR5 and TFIIIB70 decreased 2.8-fold upon addition of sequences up to and including TPR9 (8Chaussivert N. Conesa C. Shaaban S. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15353-15358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The sequences following TPR5 could either reduce the affinity of the Nt-TPR5 site (e.g. by a partial steric effect) or mask it completely and substitute a second, lower affinity"

The gene (Cil) contains the C-terminal region of the Chk1 gene, but the 5′-end is derived from a sequence in the intron of Chk1preceding the C-terminal domain by differential RNA splicing. The kinase domain of Chk1 gene is absent in this isoform. Tissue RNA and protein blot analyses indicated that Cil was specifically expressed only in rat liver, and its expression increased with liver development. Expression of Cil was found to be reduced in three rat hepatoma cell lines examined. A promoter trap experiment suggested that a promoter was located in the intron preceding the C-terminal domain ofChk1, and transcription from this novel promoter generated the new 5′ noncoding exon of Cil. Thus Cil was generated by both alternate promoter usage and differential RNA splicing. UV irradiation induced caffeine-sensitive phosphorylation of both Chk1 and Cil at Ser-345 in Chk1 and its equivalent site in Cil, implying a role for ATR kinase in the phosphorylation of both proteins. We demonstrated the interaction between the kinase domain of Chk1 and Cil using a yeast two-hybrid assay and pull-down technique. In contrast to the effect of Chk1, Cil was found to decrease the transactivating function of p53, and the S63A mutation of Cil abolished this effect.

The inhibition is reversed by Cdc25 after completion of DNA replication or repair by removing the inhibitory phosphorylation. One of the effector protein kinases that regulates Cdc25 is Chk1 (13Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J.

Chk1 was first identified in fission yeast involved in cell cycle arrest when DNA was damaged (16Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells a Chk1 homolog was shown to phosphorylate Cdc25A, -B, and -C (13Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J.

In addition to Cdc25, Wee1 and p53 have also been found to be phosphorylated by Chk1 when checkpoint is activated (18Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol.

When DNA is damaged by ionizing radiation, UV, or hydroxyurea, Chk1 is found to be phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner (22Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell.

In the present report we presented evidence for the existence of a rat liver-specific Chk1 isoform (Cil forChk1 isoform in liver). This isoform was found to be transcribed using a novel promoter residing in the intron of the Chk1 gene preceding the C-terminal domain, and mature mRNA was formed by the joining of the new noncoding exon within the intron to the remaining exons of Chk1 through splicing, deleting the kinase domain of Chk1. We showed that Cil associated with the Chk1 kinase domain using yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays and that it down-regulated p53-mediated gene transcription. Furthermore, we showed that Cil was phosphorylated at a serine residue corresponding to Ser-345 in Chk1 following UV irradiation and that mutation of this phosphorylation site eliminated its effect on p53 activity.

Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and overlaid with the diluted DNA-lipid complexes. We used 5′- and 3′-RACE1 (Marathon cDNA Amplification System from CLONTECH) to clone the Cil cDNA from rat liver following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Second-strand synthesis was performed using a mixture ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and E. coli ligase. After the T4 DNA polymerase reaction, the double strand cDNA was ligated to the Marathon cDNA adapter. PCR was performed for 30 cycles with a forward primer AP1 and a reverse primer 2-6-3 for 5′-RACE. The 5′-RACE products were then cloned and sequenced. A 5′-RACE clone with a novel DNA sequence was identified. According to the 5′-RACE result, a specific primer for the isoform was designed for the 3′-RACE experiment. Finally, the same cDNA clone of Cil was also isolated from rat liver cDNA library (Stratagene, Inc.) by screening using 32P-labeled Chk1 probe. The mammalian expression vector pCMVTag-2A/B/C and p53-luciferase (p53-Luc) reporter plasmids were purchased from Stratagene. Reporter vector pGL2-Basic and pGL2-Control were purchased from Promega. pCMVβ plasmids were purchased fromCLONTECH. p53 expression vector (pCMVTag-2C-rp53) was constructed by inserting the rat p53 coding region in-frame into pCMVTag-2C. Chk1 and Cil expression plasmids were constructed by inserting PCR products of the coding region in-frame into pCMVTag2B vector (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of the corresponding proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The reporter plasmids of Cil promoter were constructed by inserting different fragments amplified from the putative promoter region and inserted into the pGL2-Basic plasmid. The primers used for constructing these promoter reporter plasmids were: Chk1 g-05, Chk1 g-06, Chk1 g-16, Chk1 g-19, Chk1 g-20, Chk1 g-21, Chk1 g-22, Chk1 g-29, and Chk1 g-30. Tissues from Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) using a Polytron homogenizer, cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and stored frozen at −70 °C. For Western blot analysis, 20 μl of protein extracts were denatured by boiling for 5 min and loaded in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3). After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to a Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody against the C-terminal portion of Chk1 (custom-produced by Zymed Laboratories Inc. against an oligopeptide in the C-terminal domain of Chk1) for 1 h and washed twice in TBS-T buffer. The immunoblot was then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and analyzed using the ECL detection system according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For analysis of Chk1 Ser-345 phosphorylation, Western blots of proteins from cells transfected with Chk1 and/or Cil expression plasmids with or without UV irradiation were probed with antibody specifically against Ser-345-phosphorylated Chk1 (Cell Signaling). Typically cells in a 60-mm culture dish were transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmids and 1 μg of pCMVβGal (CLONTECH) as internal standard. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer in a luciferase assay system (Promega). Cell lysates were collected and centrifuged briefly. For the luciferase activity assay, cell lysates were freeze-thawed and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min, 10-μl aliquots were loaded into the AutoLumat LB953 (EG&G Berthold), and 100 μl of luciferase substrate were injected into each sample. The luminescence obtained was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. To assay the transfection efficiency, 30 μl of each supernatants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by adding 3 μl of 100× magnesium solution (0.1 m MgCl2, 4.5 mβ-mercaptoethanol), 66 μl of an o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside solution (4 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5), and 20 μl of sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.5). The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min or until yellow color was developed. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate, and optical absorption at 420 nm was measured. A Multi-Tissue RNA blot containing 2 μg of poly(A) mRNA from various normal rat tissues was purchased from CLONTECH and probed with Chk1 probe according to the procedure of the manufacturer. Total RNA was extracted from rat liver tissue and from cultured cells using the RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen). For RT-PCRs, 1 μg of total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen) for 15 min. DNase was inactivated by adding 1 μl of 25 mm EDTA and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. 500 ng of oligo(dT)12–18 was added, and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using 200 units of SUPERSCRIPT II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 42 °C. The reaction was terminated by heating at 70 °C for 15 min. Subsequent PCRs were carried out using primers specific to Chk1 or Cil. A rat multiple tissue cDNA panel used as a template for PCR to confirm tissue-specific expression of Cil was purchased from Promega. The Gal4-based MATCHMAKER Two-hybrid System II (CLONTECH) was used for two-hybrid analysis. Plasmids pAS2-1 and pACT2, encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-BD) and Gal4-activating domain (Gal4-AD), respectively, were used to express hybrid proteins. The yeast strain AH109 was co-transformed with pAS2-1-Chk1KD and pACT2-Cil using the lithium acetate method (28Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 201425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar, 29Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic dropout agar plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, adenine, and histidine. The positive yeast colony was transferred onto Whatman no. 5 paper and processed by the β-galactosidase filter assay. Negative controls were performed by co-transformation of empty vector pAS2-1 with pACT2, pAS2-1 empty vector with pACT2-Cil, pACT2 empty vector with pAS2-1-Chk1KD, or pACT2-Cil with pVA3-1, which express fusion protein of GAL4-DB and murine p53 (amino acids 72–390). In vitro transcription-translation was performed using the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System kit from Promega according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For each reaction, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was used in a 50-μl total reaction volume. An amino acid mixture minus methionine was added to each reaction, and reactions were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For GST pull-down assays, glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were prewashed in NETN (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.5% powdered milk. Fusion proteins in the bacterial lysate were purified with the prewashed glutathione-Sepharose beads (25 μl of beads/ml of lysate) by incubation for 1.5 h at 4 °C on a rotary mixer. The beads were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with NETN+P (NETN containing protease inhibitors), and resuspended in 1 volume of NETN+P prior to use. 50 μl of beads, containing GST fusion proteins or GST alone (negative control), were incubated overnight at 4 °C in tubes containing 935 μl of NETN+P and 5 μl of the in vitro-translated35S-labeled protein. The beads were then washed four times with NETN, resuspended in 50 μl of 1× protein loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The gel was dried, and radiolabeled protein was detected by autoradiography. We have previously cloned and sequenced rat Chk1 cDNA (Fig.1). During our analysis of tissue expression of Chk1 gene expression in rat we noticed a second RNA band specifically observed only in the liver tissue (Fig. 2A). We then cloned this shortened Chk1 RNA species from rat liver using 5′- and 3′-RACE techniques based on a primer derived from the rat Chk1 sequence. DNA sequencing of the clones obtained showed that the liver-specific Chk1 isoform, or Cil in short, contained the exon 6 to 3′-untranslated region of rat Chk1gene linked to a 90-bp unknown sequence at its 5′-end. Sequence analysis of the intron between exons 5 and 6 of the Chk1genomic sequence in rat showed that the novel 5′ sequence was derived from the internal portion of this intron. The 3′ boundary of the intron-derived sequence abuts the splicing donor consensus sequence GT, consisting with splicing of this sequence with exon 6 (Fig.3). To confirm the existence of this mRNA species in rat liver we also used the Chk1 sequence to clone the isoform cDNA from the rat liver cDNA library. Clones obtained this way contained a sequence consistent with the RACE-derived clones. A protein product with the molecular weight predicted from the isoform RNA was also observed in Western blot analysis in the adult liver tissue and to a lesser extent in the fetal liver of an 18-day embryo (Fig. 4). A Chk1-related isoform was also observed in the kidney tissue, but its nature is still under investigation.Figure 2Northern blot analysis of Chk1 expression in different tissues. Panel A, a rat multitissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was hybridized with a 1.4-kb rat Chk1 probe. Panel B, the rat multitissue Northern blot was stripped and reprobed with β-actin probe.

Molecular mass markers are in units of kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm liver-specific expression, we examined Cil expression in different rat tissues by RT-PCR. When both Chk1- and Cil-specific primers were used, two RT-PCR products were observed in the liver tissue, corresponding to the expected products of Chk1 and Cil, respectively (Fig. 5A). The other tissues contained only one band corresponding to that of Chk1. This result confirmed the liver-specific expression pattern we first observed in the Northern blot. The identity of the second band in the RT-PCR product as Cil was confirmed by DNA sequencing. We next examined the expression of Cil during embryo development. Total RNA was extracted from rat livers of 18-day fetal liver, liver from days 1 and 5 postnatal liver, adult liver, and adult spleen. RT-PCR analysis showed that Cil was expressed at a low amount in the 18-day fetal liver, but the level of expression increased to adult level after birth (Fig. 5B). Again no Cil isoform was observed in the spleen sample. To examine whether the expression of this liver-specific isoform was altered in tumor cells, we analyzed the relative mRNA levels of Chk1 and Cil using RT-PCR in rat hepatoma cell lines. As shown in Fig. 5C, three rat hepatoma cell lines were found to express this isoform, but the Cil/Chk1 ratio was much lower than that of normal adult liver, suggesting down-regulation of Cil in tumor cells. The sequence of Cil suggests a promoter 5′ to the first exon, somewhere in the fifth intron of the Chk1 gene. To examine this possibility we assayed the promoter activity of DNA sequences immediately adjacent to the 5′-end of Cil using the luciferase reporter gene system. As shown in Fig.6, a 300-nucleotide fragment upstream of the first exon of Cil was found to contain promoter activity when assayed for luciferase reporter gene expression. Deletion analysis indicated that the promoter activity resided in the 3′ half of the 300-bp fragment. Sequence analysis of the 300-bp region revealed three potential transcription factor-binding sites for AP-2, SP1, and the liver-specific LF-A1 transcription factor (30Hardon E.M. Frain M. Paonessa G. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 32Ramji D.P. Tadros M.H. Hardon E.M. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Deletion of the LF-A1 binding sequence reduced the promoter activity by 30–40%. SinceChk1 has been shown to be activated after DNA damage by the phosphorylation at serines 317 and 345 located in the C-terminal domain (22Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), we examined whether Cil could also be phosphorylated at serine 63 (corresponding to Ser-345 of Chk1) following UV irradiation. We used the commercial antibody that specifically recognizes the Chk1 peptide phosphorylated at serine 345 to examine the phosphorylation status of Cil in Cil-transfected cells before and after UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7, no phosphorylation was found in Chk1 without UV irradiation, but the phosphorylated form became detected after UV irradiation as expected, albeit at a low level. Cil, on the other hand, showed a low level of phosphorylation even before UV irradiation, but the phosphorylation was enhanced after UV treatment. These results indicate UV-induced phosphorylation of both Chk1 and Cil at the site corresponding to Ser-345 in Chk1. When Chk1 was co-transfected with Cil its phosphorylation was found to be enhanced relative to the transfection of Chk1 alone. This result suggests that Cil enhanced UV-activated phosphorylation of Chk1. ATR kinase has been shown to be involved in the phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser-345. Since ATM/ATR kinase is sensitive to the inhibition by caffeine (33Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 34Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the phosphorylation of Cil after UV irradiation could be blocked by caffeine. Treatment of cells after UV irradiation with 2 mm caffeine blocked the phosphorylation of both Chk1 and Cil (Fig. 7), consistent with the interpretation that both proteins were phosphorylated by ATR kinase. Chen et al. (27Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) have shown recently that the kinase domain fragment of Chk1 is 20 times more active in kinase activity in vitro than the full-length Chk1. They suggested that the C-terminal portion of Chk1 might function as a negative regulator of Chk1 kinase activity. Since Cil contained only the C-terminal sequences of Chk1 without the kinase domain, we suspected that Cil might function as a competitive inhibitor of Chk1. Because Chk1 has been shown to phosphorylate p53 and to regulate the amount of p53 in a co-transfection experiment (20Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether Cil could inhibit the transactivation activity of p53. We used the luciferase p53 transactivation assay to examine this possibility. As shown in Fig.8, co-transfection of plasmid containing the Chk1 gene in the p53 transactivation assay boosted the p53 transactivation activity 50%. This result is similar to that obtained previously (20Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Cil was found to reduce the reporter activity by about 50%. Furthermore, the stimulation of reporter gene activity by Chk1 was abolished by co-transfection with Cil, suggesting that Cil was dominant over Chk1 in this activity assay. Since Cil serine 63 (corresponding to Chk1 serine 345) was phosphorylated even without UV treatment, we analyzed the effect of eliminating Cil serine 63 phosphorylation in the inhibition of p53 transactivation activity. As shown in Fig. 8, mutation of Cil serine 63 to alanine resulted in the total loss of the Cil-mediated inhibition of p53 transactivation activity. On the other hand, serine 35 (corresponding to Chk1 Ser-317, another site phosphorylated in vivo) to alanine mutation resulted in a less inhibitory effect on p53 transactivation activity. These results indicated that serine 63 in Cil played an important regulatory role in the function of Cil. Based on crystallographic analysis and in vitroanalysis of Chk1 kinase activity, Chen et al. (27Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) recently suggested that the C-terminal domain of Chk1 could negatively interact with the kinase domain. Because the coding sequence of Cil resides in the C-terminal domain of Chk1, we sought to determine whether Cil could interact with the kinase domain of Chk1. To this end, we cloned the Chk1 kinase domain and analyzed the interaction with Cil by the yeast two-hybrid assay. The Chk1 kinase domain indeed was found to interact with Cil (Fig. 9), whereas no interaction was found between Chk1 and Cil (data not shown). To further demonstrate the interaction between Cil and the Chk1 kinase domain we used anin vitro transcription-translation system and the pull-down assay to address this question. As shown in Fig. 9, the kinase domain and Cil could be pulled down together. These results indicated that the two molecules indeed could interact with each other. On the other hand, no interaction was observed between Chk1 and Cil under the same condition. In the present study we report the isolation of a novel isoform of Chk1 specifically expressed in rat liver tissue. The isoform represents the C-terminal portion of Chk1 without the kinase domain. The structure and sequence arrangement of this isoform suggest that it was generated by both alternate promoter usage and alternative RNA splicing. The promoter was found within the intron preceding the C-terminal domain exons. Alternate promoters within an intron of a gene have been observed previously (35Galgoczy P. Rosenthal A. Platzer M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 271: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36Aronow B. Lattier D. Silbiger R. Dusing M. Hutton J. Jones G. Stock J. McNeish J. Potter S. Witte D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1384-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and are associated with tissue-specific expression. Sequence analysis near the transcription initiation site of Cil revealed three potential binding sites for transcription factors AP-2, Sp1, and liver-specific LF-A1. The presence of the liver-specific LF-A1 transcription factor-binding site supports the liver-specific expression of Cil. Deletion of this transcription factor-binding site reduced the promoter activity in rat HTC1 cells. Since this cell line only expressed a low amount of Cil, we believe that this cell line is probably not the best host for studying the regulation of theCil promoter. Perhaps primary hepatocytes expressing a significant amount of Cil would serve as the appropriate host for studying the regulation of the Cil promoter. The Cil coding region starts at amino acid 283 of the rat Chk1 protein. This start site is located in the flexible linker between the kinase and the C-terminal domains (27Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in the Chk1 protein. Thus Cil is completely devoid of the kinase domain of Chk1 and contains only the C-terminal domain. Since the C-terminal part of Chk1 has been implicated in the negative regulation of Chk1 (27Chen P. Luo C. Deng Y. Ryan K. Register J. Margosiak S. Tempczyk-Russell A. Nguyen B. Myers P. Lundgren K. Kan C.C. O'Connor P.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we analyzed the interaction of Cil and the kinase domain using the yeast two-hybrid assay as well as an in vitro pull-down assay. These analyses indeed showed that Cil could interact with the kinase domain. Chk1 has been shown to enhance the p53 level when overexpressed by transient transfection with or without treatment of ionizing radiation (20Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, overexpression of Chk1 enhanced p53 transactivation activity, but Cil exhibited the opposite effect. These data suggested that Cil might serve as a negative regulator in the Chk1-p53 signaling pathway. The finding that a possible negative regulator of Chk1 kinase activity is present only in the liver tissue is rather intriguing. Liver differs from other tissues in having a very high proportion of polyploid cells. Rat liver is especially rich in cells with polyploidy (37Sigal S.H. Gupta S. Gebhard Jr., D.F. Holst P. Neufeld D. Reid L.M. Differentiation. 1995; 59: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 38Anatskaya O.V. Vinogradov A.E. Kudryavtsev B.N. J. Theor. Biol. 1994; 168: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with an estimation up to 85–90% (39Sanz N. Diez-Fernandez C. Cascales M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 40Seglen P.O. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1997; 13: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 41Saeter G. Lee C.Z. Schwarze P.E. Ous S. Chen D.S. Sung J.L. Seglen P.O. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 1480-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the other hand, fetal and liver tumors are composed mainly of diploid cells (37Sigal S.H. Gupta S. Gebhard Jr., D.F. Holst P. Neufeld D. Reid L.M. Differentiation. 1995; 59: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 39Sanz N. Diez-Fernandez C. Cascales M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1315: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 42Seglen P.O. Gerlyng P. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 88: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since Chk1 is involved in cell cycle regulation, liver-specific expression of Cil may be related to the unique hepatocyte polyploidization. This possibility remains to be verified in the future. We are constructing inducible plasmids for analyzing the effect of Cil on cell cycle and nuclear polyploidization with or without damage to DNA or stalling of DNA replication. We have searched a human liver cDNA library for the human counterpart of Cil with no success. Examination of the human intron sequence corresponding to the one in the rat genome containing theCil promoter showed no obvious sequence similarity between the two species in this part of the gene. RT-PCRs using several possible candidates from human intron sequences with patched homology with the rat sequence and the conserved C-terminal domain sequence as primers did not reveal any Cil-like products in a human cDNA library or in mRNA extracted from human liver. Whether Cil is unique to rat or whether a different isoform in human liver exists will be the subject of future studies. We thank Dr. Chen-Kung Chou for stimulating discussions and initial support and Dr. Fin-Fang Chen for suggestions and help in the p53 transactivation assay."
