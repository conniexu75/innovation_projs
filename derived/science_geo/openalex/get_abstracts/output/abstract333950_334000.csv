https://openalex.org/W1978852737,"Single-crystal epitaxial thin films of the isotropic metallic oxides Sr1–xCaxRuO3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were grown on miscut SrTiO3(100) substrates in situ by 90° off-axis sputtering. These thin films exhibit low isotropic resistivities, excellent chemical and thermal stability, good surface smoothness, and high crystalline quality. Furthermore, the lattice parameters and magnetic properties can be varied by simply changing the strontium/calcium ratio. These epitaxial thin films, and their multilayer structures with other oxide materials, can be used for the fabrication of superconducting, ferroelectric, magneto-optic, and electro-optic devices."

These values match, within an experimental error of +/-4 million years, the dates for zircons extracted from a tuff at the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the P-Tr extinction was caused by the Siberian basaltic flood volcanism. It is likely that the eruption of these magmas was accompanied by the injection of large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere, which may have led to global cooling and to expansion of the polar ice cap. The P-Tr extinction event may have been caused by a combination of acid rain and global cooling as well as rapid and extreme changes in sea level resulting from expansion of the polar ice cap."
https://openalex.org/W1997479250,"The currently known upper temperature limit for growth of organisms, shared by a number of archaebacteria, is 110 degrees C. However, among the sulfate-reducing bacteria, growth temperatures of greater than 100 degrees C have not been found. A search for high-temperature activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria was done in hot deep-sea sediments at the hydrothermal vents of the Guaymas Basin tectonic spreading center in the Gulf of California. Radiotracer studies revealed that sulfate reduction can occur at temperatures up to 110 degrees C, with an optimum rate at 103 degrees to 106 degrees C. This observation expands the upper temperature limit of this process in deep-ocean sediments by 20 degrees C and indicates the existence of an unknown group of hyperthermophilic bacteria with a potential importance for the biogeochemistry of sulfur above 100 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W2155060182,"There has long been debate about the relative importance of abrasion versus selective deposition of the coarsest clasts in causing downstream fining of sediment in river systems. Although high fining rates observed in many natural rivers seem to require strong selective deposition, the ability of selective deposition to produce downstream size sorting has never been measured under controlled conditions. In an experiment using a long flume and a poorly sorted, bimodal gravel feed, downstream fining was produced by a factor of 1.3 in median size and 1.8 in 90th percentile size, over a distance of 21 meters. The experimental conditions rule out abrasion effects. Selective deposition appears to be a natural consequence of the transport and deposition of sufficiently poorly sorted or bimodal gravels and appears to be capable of accounting for fining rates observed in natural gravel rivers."

Microporous frameworks that are not oxide-based are now attracting interest because of the combination of catalytic and electronic properties they may simultaneously possess. Three new compounds that may be forerunners to such materials have been discovered and are reported here. The reaction of gallium (Ga), indium (In), and thallium (TI) metal with (Ph4P)2Se5 (Ph, phenyl) and an excess of elemental selenium (Se) in a sealed, evacuated Pyrex tube at 200°C yielded small red crystals of (Ph4P)[Ga(Se6)2] (I), (Ph4P)[In(Se6)2] (II), and (Ph4P)[TI(Se6)2] (III), respectively. The [M(Se6)2]– (M = Ga, In, TI) ions form a two-dimensional, open framework filled with Ph4P+ ions. The [M(Se6)2]nn– structure consists of tetrahedral M3+ centers and bridging Se62– ligands, leading to an extended structure in two dimensions. These layers stack perfectly one on top of the other giving rise to one-dimensional channels running down the c axis that are filled with Ph4P+ cations. These cations are situated in the layers, as opposed to between the layers, and the whole structure can be viewed as a template. Compound II shows remarkable thermal stability and melts congruently at 242°C. Upon cooling to room temperature it gives a glassy phase that recrystallizes upon subsequent heating to 160°C."
https://openalex.org/W2011193292,"Modification of the reconstruction of an Au(111) surface with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is demonstrated. This modification is accomplished by transferring a number of surface atoms to the STM tip to generate a surface multivacancy (hole), which modifies the stress distribution at the surface. The structural changes that follow the tip-induced surface perturbation are imaged in a time-resolved manner. The structural modification is the result of both short-range interactions, which lead to local atomic relaxation, and long-range elastic interactions, which produce large-scale rearrangements."

These changes have occurred in the budget's fiscal policy, which has reduced national saving and private investment; in its expenditure policy, which has emphasized short-term benefits rather than public investments; and in its transfer policy, which has not adequately addressed the increasing child poverty that threatens the productivity of our future labor force."

https://openalex.org/W4246462254,"In the final preparation of the manuscript of our report ""Regulation by ATP and ADP of CFTR chloride channels that contain mutant nucleotide-binding domains"" (18 Sept., p. 1701) (1), we inadvertently plotted the data for figure 1C with an incorrect x axis: MgATP was plotted on the x axis instead of P(o). We did not immediately notice the error, which was brought to our attention by Charles Venglarik and Robert Bridges, because the shape of the two curves is similiar. The correct plot is shown in the figure below. In both plots the data do not fit a straight [See figure in the PDF file] line, which supports our interpretation that more than one site may be involved with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) regulation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). We regret any inconvenience this may have caused."
