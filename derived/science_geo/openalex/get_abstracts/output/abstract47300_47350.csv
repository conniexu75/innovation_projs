https://openalex.org/W2075788654,"Two domains of the human estrogen receptor, responsible for hormone binding (region E) and tight nuclear binding (region C), are essential for the receptor to activate efficiently the transcription of estrogen-responsive genes. Region D, which joins the DNA- and hormone-binding domains, can be altered without affecting activation. Deletion of the N-terminal domain (region A/B) has no effect on activation of a reporter gene containing a vitellogenin estrogen-responsive element (ERE) and the HSV-tk promoter, whereas it severely impairs activation of the human pS2 gene promoter. Deletion of most or all of the hormone-binding domain leads to only about 5% constitutive transcriptional activity, yet these mutants appear to bind efficiently to an ERE in vivo. Apparently, region C recognizes the ERE of target genes, and the hormone-binding domain plays an essential role for efficient activation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2091673674,The regulatory domain of protein kinase C contains an amino acid sequence between residues 19 and 36 that resembles a substrate phosphorylation site in its distribution of basic residue recognition determinants. The corresponding synthetic peptide (Arg19-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala25-Leu-Arg-Gln-Lys-Asn-Val-His -Glu-Val-Lys-Asn36) acts as a potent substrate antagonist with an inhibitory constant of 147 +/- 9 nM. It is a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C and inhibits both autophosphorylation and protein substrate phosphorylation. Substitution of Ala25 with serine transforms the pseudosubstrate into a potent substrate. These results demonstrate that the conserved region of the regulatory domain (residues 19 to 36) of protein kinase C has the secondary structural features of a pseudosubstrate and may be responsible for maintaining the enzyme in the inactive form in the absence of allosteric activators such as phospholipids.
https://openalex.org/W2068285267,"The presence or absence of the Y chromosome determines whether a mammalian embryo develops as a male or female. In humans, genetic deletion analysis of ""sex-reversed"" individuals has identified a small portion of the Y chromosome necessary and sufficient to induce testicular differentiation of the bipotential gonad. We report the cloning of a 230-kilobase segment of the human Y chromosome that contains some or all of the testis-determining factor gene (TDF), the master sex-determining locus. The cloned region spans the deletion in a female who carries all but 160 kilobases of the Y. Certain DNA sequences within this region were highly conserved during evolution; homologs occur on the Y chromosomes of all mammals examined. In particular, homologous sequences are found within the sex-determining region of the mouse Y chromosome. The nucleotide sequence of this conserved DNA on the human Y chromosome suggests that it encodes a protein with multiple ""finger"" domains, as first described in frog transcription factor IIIA. The encoded protein probably binds to nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner, and may regulate transcription. Very similar DNA sequences occur on the X chromosome of humans and other mammals. We discuss the possibility that the Y-encoded finger protein is the testis-determining factor, and propose models of sex determination accommodating the finding of a related locus on the X chromosome. The presence of similar sequences in birds suggests a possible role not only in the XX/XY sex determination system of mammals, but also in the ZZ/ZW system of birds."

https://openalex.org/W2136756942,"Structural properties of DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the single-stranded molecular terminus of telomeres from several organisms were analyzed. Based on physical studies including nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, absorbance thermal denaturation analysis, and 1H and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we conclude that these molecules can self-associate by forming non-Watson-Crick, guanine·guanine base-paired, intramolecular structures. These structures form below 40°C at moderate ionic strength and neutral pH and behave like hairpin duplexes in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Detailed analysis of the hairpin structure formed by the telomeric sequence from Tetrahymena, (T2G4)4, shows that it is a unique structure stabilized by hydrogen bonds and contains G residues in the syn conformation. We propose that this novel form of DNA is important for telomere function and sets a precedent for the biological relevance of non-Watson-Crick base-paired DNA structures."
https://openalex.org/W1997664026,The principles of pattern formation in embryogenesis can be studied in Drosophila by means of a powerful combination of genetic and transplantation experiments. The segmented pattern of the Drosophila embryo is organized by two activities localized at the anterior and posterior egg poles. Both activities exert inducing and polarizing effects on the pattern when transplanted to other egg regions. A small set of maternal genes have been identified that are required for these activities. Mutants in these genes lack either the anterior or posterior part of the segmented pattern. The unsegmented terminal embryonic regions require a third class of genes and form independently of the anterior and posterior centers.
https://openalex.org/W2010346856,"Regulated translation of messenger RNA offers an important mechanism for the control of gene expression. The biosynthesis of the intracellular iron storage protein ferritin is translationally regulated by iron. A cis-acting element that is both necessary and sufficient for this translational regulation is present within the 5′ nontranslated leader region of the human ferritin H-chain messenger RNA. In this report the iron-responsive element (IRE) was identified by deletional analysis. Moreover, a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide was shown to be able to transfer iron regulation to a construct that would otherwise not be able to respond to iron. The IRE has been highly conserved and predates the evolutionary segregation between amphibians, birds, and man. The IRE may prove to be useful for the design of translationally regulated expression systems."
https://openalex.org/W1980014349,"Drosophila heat shock activator protein, a rare transacting factor which is induced upon heat shock to bind specifically to the heat shock regulatory sequence in vivo, has been purified from shocked cells to more than 95 percent homogeneity by sequence-specific duplex oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. The purified protein has a relative molecular mass of 110 kilodaltons, binds to the regulatory sequence with great affinity and specificity, and strongly stimulates transcription of the Drosophila hsp70 gene. Studies with this regulatory protein should lead to an understanding of the biochemical pathway underlying the heat shock phenomenon."

https://openalex.org/W1989004575,"We have examined the function of inverted repeat sequences found at the 3' ends of plastid DNA transcription units in higher plants, using a homologous in vitro transcription extract. The inverted repeat sequences are ineffective as transcription terminators, but serve as efficient RNA processing elements. Synthetic RNAs are processed in a 3'-5' direction by a nuclease activity present in the transcription extract, generating nearly homogeneous 3' ends distal to the inverted repeat sequence. S1 nuclease protection experiments demonstrate that the 3' ends generated in vitro coincide with those found for plastid mRNAs in vivo. RNA molecules possessing inverted repeats near their 3' ends are substantially more stable than control RNAs in the chloroplast extract, and kinetic measurements indicate that each RNA has a unique decay rate. Coupled with previously published information suggesting that the differential accumulation of plastid RNAs during development is effectively controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms, these results raise the possibility that RNA processing and stability, specifically involving 3' end inverted repeats, are important regulatory features of plastid gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2062731377,"Peptides corresponding to the amino-terminal region of the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy were synthesized. A 34-amino acid peptide, PTHrP(1-34), was two to four times more potent than bovine or human PTH(1-34) in bioassays promoting the formation of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) and plasminogen activator activity in osteogenic sarcoma cells and adenylate cyclase activity in chick kidney membranes. Like parathyroid hormone itself, in which the activity resides in the first 34 residues, PTHrP peptides of less than 30 residues from the amino terminus showed substantially reduced activity. PTHrP(1-34) had only 6% of the potency of bovine PTH(1-34) in promoting bone resorption in vitro. PTHrP(1-34) strongly promoted the excretion of cAMP and phosphorus and reduced the excretion of calcium in the isolated, perfused rat kidney consistent with the symptoms seen in malignant hypercalcemia."
https://openalex.org/W1986065908,"One mechanism considered responsible for the hypercalcemia that frequently accompanies malignancy is secretion by the tumor of a circulating factor that alters calcium metabolism. The structure of a tumor-secreted peptide was recently determined and found to be partially homologous to parathyroid hormone (PTH). The amino-terminal 1-34 region of the factor was synthesized and evaluated biologically. In vivo it produced hypercalcemia, acted on bone and kidney, and stimulated 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 formation. In vitro it interacted with PTH receptors and, in some systems, was more potent than PTH. These studies support a long-standing hypothesis regarding pathogenesis of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia."

https://openalex.org/W157395064,"Laminin (Mr = 850,000) is a large basement membrane-specific glycoprotein composed of three chains: A, B1, and B2. Previously, we have reported the primary structure of the B1 chain of mouse laminin deduced from sequencing cDNA clones (Sasaki M., Kato, S., Kohno, K., Martin, G. R., and Yamada, Y. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 935-939). Here we report the isolation of overlapping cDNA clones spanning 7642 bases which encode the entire B2 chain. The nucleotide sequence of the clones contains an open reading frame of 4821 bases coding for a protein of 1607 amino acids including 33 amino acids of a presumptive signal peptide. The mRNA for the B2 chain contains 2.5 kilobases of 3′-untranslated region. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the B2 chain consists of six distinct domains, including two domains with alpha-helical, coiled-coil structures, two domains with cysteine-rich homologous repeats, and two globular domains. These structural features of the B2 chain are similar to those of the B1 chain. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the B2 and B1 chains demonstrate considerable homology, suggesting that the genes for these two chains arose from a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2030202169,"Several proteins of viral and cellular origin are acylated with myristic acid early during their biogenesis. To investigate the possibility that myristylation occurred cotranslationally, the BC3H1 muscle cell line, which contains a broad array of myristylated proteins, was pulse-labeled with [3H]myristic acid. Nascent polypeptide chains covalently associated with transfer RNA were isolated subsequently by ion-exchange chromatography. [3H]Myristate was attached to nascent chains through an amide linkage and was identified by thin-layer chromatography after its release from nascent chains by acid methanolysis. Inhibition of cellular protein synthesis with puromycin resulted in cessation of [3H]myristate-labeling of nascent chains, in agreement with the dependence of this modification on protein synthesis in vivo. These data represent a direct demonstration that myristylation of proteins is a cotranslational modification."
https://openalex.org/W1969748543,"The composition and function of histone storage complexes of Xenopus eggs have been investigated using monoclonal antibodies. We show that core histones are contained in two distinct complexes: H2A and H2B are associated with nucleoplasmin, and H3 and H4 are associated with nuclear protein N1. Immunodepletion analyses demonstrate that both complexes are required for nucleosome core assembly by extracts in vitro, the product being a simple sum of the histones from each complex. In addition, the majority of the stored H2A is shown to be an unusual form that migrates close to the position of H3 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and resembles a variant synthesized in a cell-cycle-independent manner in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013159980,"Mutations in the C. elegans gene ced-3 prevent almost all programmed cell deaths, so that in a ced-3 mutant there are many extra cells. We show that the pharyngeal neuron M4 is essential for feeding in wild-type worms, but in a ced-3 mutant, one of the extra cells, probably MSpaaaaap (the sister of M4), can sometimes take over M4's function. The function of MSpaaaaap, unlike that of M4, is variable and subnormal. One possible explanation is that its fate, being hidden by death and not subject to selection, has drifted randomly during evolution. We suggest that such cells may play roles in the evolution of cell lineage analogous to those played by pseudogenes in the evolution of genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2010167207,"Lineage-specific regulatory elements can be used to direct expression of a variety of genes to specific tissues in transgenic mice. If the hybrid constructs contain a gene encoding a cytotoxic gene product, then genetic ablation of a specific cell lineage can be achieved. We have generated six transgenic mice by introducing into fertilized eggs the mouse gamma 2-crystallin promoter fused to the coding region of the diphtheria toxin A-chain gene. Three of these mice and all the transgenic offspring analyzed were microphthalmic. The lenses of these mice displayed considerable heterogeneity: some were almost normal morphologically but reduced in size, whereas others were grossly aberrant and deficient in nuclear fiber cells. These studies indicate that programmed ablation of specific cell types can be stably transmitted through the germ line."
https://openalex.org/W2031435888,"The c-myc proto-oncogene is involved in chromosomal translocations that are specifically and consistently found in Burkitt lymphoma. Although these translocations are thought to lead to a deregulation of c-myc expression, the structural and functional basis of this phenomenon has not been identified. Mutations in a specific region spanning approximately 70 base pairs and located at the 3' border of the first exon of translocated c-myc alleles were consistently detected in Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying classic (8:14) as well as variant (8:22 and 2:8) translocations. These structural alterations were accompanied by an altered pattern of c-myc transcription, namely, the removal of a block to transcriptional elongation that has been mapped to the same region. Thus, specific c-myc mutations leading to the alleviation of this block to transcriptional elongation may represent a general mechanism causing c-myc activation in Burkitt lymphoma."

https://openalex.org/W1565541955,"Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing a cDNA clone of the human gene. NH2-terminal sequencing of the recombinant hormone indicates that the 27-residue leader peptide is correctly and consistently cleaved during secretion of the recombinant protein into conditioned medium, yielding the mature NH2 terminus (Ala-Pro-Pro-Arg…). Analysis of the COOH terminus of rhEPO by peptide mapping and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) demonstrates that the arginyl residue predicted to be at the COOH terminus (based on confirmation of both genomic and cDNA sequences) is completely missing from the purified protein. The truncated form of the recombinant hormone, designated des-Arg166 rhEPO, displays an in vivo specific activity of greater than 200,000 units/mg protein. Structural characterization of natural human urinary EPO (uEPO) by peptide mapping and FABMS reveals that the urinary hormone is also missing the COOH-terminal Arg166 amino acid residue, a modification that remained undetected until now. There is no evidence of further proteolytic processing at the COOH terminus beyond specific removal of the Arg166 amino acid residue in either rhEPO or uEPO. On the basis of the FABMS data, we propose that the physiologically active form of the hormone circulating in plasma and interacting with target cells in vivo is des-Arg166 EPO."
https://openalex.org/W2006607302,"Recordings have been made of changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) that can be attributed to the operation of an electrogenic, voltage-dependent sodium-calcium (Na-Ca) exchanger in mammalian heart cells. Guinea pig ventricular myocytes under voltage clamp were perfused internally with fura-2, a fluorescent Ca2+-indicator, and changes in [Ca2+]i and membrane current that resulted from Na-Ca exchange were identified through the use of various organic channel blockers and impermeant ions. Depolarization of cells elicited slow increases in [Ca2+]i, with the maximum increase depending on internal [Na+], external [Ca2+], and membrane voltage. Repolarization was associated with net Ca2+ efflux and a decline in the inward current that developed instantaneously upon repolarization. The relation between [Ca2+]i and current was linear, and the slope was made steeper by hyperpolarization."
https://openalex.org/W1486718671,"The purpose of this study was to purify and characterize the agent responsible for the antimetastatic activity of an extract of the salivary glands (SGE) of the Mexican leech Haementeria officinalis. When administered intravenously in mice on the same day as the intravenous inoculation of T241 sarcoma cells, SGE markedly reduces the number and size of lung tumor colonies. In designing a purification protocol for the antimetastatic agent, we postulated that the antimetastatic agent would also display anticoagulant activity. Thus, we discovered that heparin affinity chromatography followed by anion-exchange chromatography results in a fraction highly enriched in both potent anticoagulant activity and potent antimetastatic activity. Approximately, 200-300 micrograms of purified protein is isolated from 150 mg of SGE. As little as 15 micrograms of this material inhibits tumor cell metastasis to the same extent as 1.0 mg of the unfractionated SGE. When analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels the active fraction consists mainly of one polypeptide band having an apparent molecular weight of approximately 17,000 under either reducing or nonreducing conditions. The protein has a pI of approximately 9.5 and a molecular weight of approximately 17,000 under nondenaturing conditions. A specific antiserum prepared against the 17,000-dalton protein indicated that this protein is the major anticoagulant and antimetastatic agent of leech salivary gland extract. We have termed this anticoagulant, antimetastatic agent We hypothesize that antistatin inhibits coagulation via factor Xa, and not thrombin, since factor Xa, but not thrombin, is rapidly inactivated upon addition of antistasin. The mechanism of antistasin's antimetastatic activity is currently under investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1564902144,"Abstract Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) N-methyltransferase catalyzes the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine by the stepwise transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to the amino head group of PE. PE N-methyltransferase was solubilized from a microsomal membrane fraction of rat liver using the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and purified to apparent homogeneity. Specific activities of PE N-methyltransferase with PE, phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine (PMME), and phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine (PDME) as substrates were 0.63, 8.59, and 3.75 mumol/min/mg protein, respectively. The purified enzyme was composed of a single subunit with a molecular mass of 18.3 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Methylation activities dependent on the presence of PE, PMME, and PDME and the 18.3-kDa protein co-eluted when purified PE N-methyltransferase was subjected to gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. All three methylation activities eluted with a Stokes radius 2.1 A greater than that determined for pure Triton micelles (molecular mass difference of 27.4 kDa). Two-dimensional analysis of PE N-methyltransferase employing nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the enzyme is composed of a single isoform. Analysis of enzyme activity using PE, PMME, and PDME at various Triton X-100 concentrations indicated the enzyme follows the dilution model proposed for other enzymes that act at the surface of mixed micelle substrates. Initial velocity data for all three lipid substrates (at fixed concentrations of Triton X-100) were highly cooperative in nature. Hill numbers for PMME and PDME ranged from 3 at 0.5 mM Triton to 6 at 2.0 mM Triton. All three methylation activities had a pH optimum of 10. These results provide evidence that a single membrane-bound enzyme catalyzes all three methylation steps for the conversion of PE to phosphatidylcholine."

The staining and imaging techniques did not appear to damage the ganglion cells, or the synapses on them; these procedures could therefore be repeated after an arbitrary period. Observations of the same neurons at intervals of up to 3 weeks indicate that the pattern of preganglionic terminals on many of these nerve cells gradually changes."

https://openalex.org/W1987531495,"Foreign genes can be stably integrated into the genome of a cell by means of DNA-mediated gene transfer techniques, and large quantities of homogenous cells that continuously express these gene products can then be isolated. Such an expression system can be used to study the functional consequences of introducing specific mutations into genes and to study the expressed protein in the absence of cellular components with which it is normally in contact. All four Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunit complementary DNA's were introduced into the genome of a mouse fibroblast cell by DNA-mediated gene transfer. A clonal cell line that stably produced high concentrations of correctly assembled cell surface AChR's and formed proper ligand-gated ion channels was isolated. With this new expression system, recombinant DNA, biochemical, pharmacological, and electrophysiological techniques were combined to study Torpedo AChR's in a single intact system. The physiological and pharmacological profiles of Torpedo AChR's expressed in mouse fibroblast cells differ in some details from those described earlier, and may provide a more accurate reflection of the properties of this receptor in its natural environment."
https://openalex.org/W2026539172,"The first exon of the c-myc gene has unusual properties that suggest some further role in gene regulation. It encodes a large, evolutionarily conserved leader exon that is transcribed more frequently than the remaining exons of the c-myc gene. In what follows, we provide a possible explanation for these observations. We find that the major promoter of the c-myc gene is bifunctional; that is, it supports transcription by RNA polymerases II and III (pol II and III). Both enzymes initiate in vitro transcription from the major c-myc initiation site (P2), but pol III is completely blocked near the 3′ end of the first exon while pol II, though partially blocked, transcribes through this region. These superimposed transcriptional activities suggest a potential regulatory mechanism by which one polymerase system could influence the activity of another."
https://openalex.org/W1515962766,"Histone displaced in vitro from nuclei by protamine competition display a higher degree of hyperacetylation than the residual histones. In addition, hyperacetylated core particle pools are disassembled in vitro with a higher efficiency than control or nonacetylated core particles and when analyzed by electron microscopy display an elongated shape (length/width ratio = 1.52 +/- 0.19) instead of the round compact shape of control nucleosomes (length/width ratio = 1.06 +/- 0.06). In the absence of histone hyperacetylation, the fish protamines, salmine and iridine (32-33 residues), are relatively inefficient in disassembling nucleosomal core particles in vitro as compared to the large (65-70 residues), tyrosine-containing protamines from rooster (galline), squid, and cuttlefish which disassemble nucleosomes in a range of protamine concentrations close to physiological. The fact that an artificially cross-linked salmine dimer acquires the ability of the large protamines from rooster, squid, and cuttlefish to disassemble core particles in vitro and also binds more tightly to the DNA, suggests that the size of the sperm nuclear protamines is a critical factor in this process. Even when the core histones of spermatid chromatin are hyperacetylated in the trout testis, the replacement process by iridine or salmine is slow and time-dependent in vitro. However, since spermiogenesis in trout occurs over several weeks, the slow in vitro nucleosome disassembly process by salmine is sufficient to allow complete displacement, thus supporting the hypothesis that a protamine-mediated displacement of the histones from DNA in vivo may take place in the salmonid fishes by a mechanism similar to that in the rooster, squid, and cuttlefish."

When chromatographed further on octyl-Sepharose CL-4B, the proteoglycans of the cell layer resolved into three peaks. The unbound fraction (peak cell layer-I) contained a 40,000 species consisting of a single glycosaminoglycan chain with or without peptide. Peak cell layer-II contained three sulfated species on electrophoresis: a 600,000 species uniformly distributed across the peak, a 135,000 species enriched in the ascending limb (similar to bone PG-I as described previously), and a 270,000 species (similar to bone PG-I) enriched in the descending limb. Peak cell layer-III, eluting at 0.2% Triton X-100, was highly enriched in a 400,000 proteoglycan component. When media proteoglycans were chromatographed on octyl-Sepharose, two labeled peaks were found. Peak medium-I (unbound) contained a species exhibiting electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the 400,000 species present in peak cell layer-III. Peak II of the culture medium (medium-II) was apparently identical to that of peak cell layer-II, containing the 600,000, 270,000 and 135,000 species. No appreciable 40,000 species was observed in the medium. Treatment of the 600,000 species with either chondroitinase ABC or ACII generated a core protein preparation with bands of 390,000 and 340,000 on SDS gels. Neither the intact nor the chondroitinase ABC-treated 600,000 species was immunoprecipitated by a purified, polyclonal antiserum raised against the core protein of the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of human articular cartilage. Treatment of the 270,000 and 135,000 proteoglycans with chondroitinase ABC, but not ACII, generated a core protein preparation with bands of 52,000 and 49,000 on SDS gels, indicating that they were dermatan sulfate-containing species. The 400,000 species contained both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, in approximately a 3:1 labeling ratio. This species changed in electrophoretic mobility following treatment with chondroitinase ABC, heparatinase, or both enzymes in combination, which suggested that it may be a hybrid proteoglycan (i.e. both types of glycosaminoglycan chain on the same core protein).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The addition of E. coli lipid X to the medium of cells that had been uniformly labeled with 32Pi resulted in a 4-8-fold increase in the level of lysophosphatidylinositol. This effect was maximal at 5 microM lipid X. Lysophosphatidylinositol levels reached a maximum 45 min after stimulation, followed by a gradual decline to near normal levels within 2 h. The formation of lysophosphatidylinositol was dependent upon extracellular calcium and was almost completely inhibited when cycloheximide was added at the time of stimulation. The addition of the disaccharide lipid A precursor IVA, commercial lipopolysaccharide (1 microgram/ml), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10(-7) M), or calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-6) M) to these cells resulted in a similar increase in lysophosphatidylinositol levels, but phosphatidic acid was inactive. The stimulation by IVA and phorbol myristate acetate was blocked by cycloheximide, but the stimulation by lipopolysaccharide was only partially blocked. The stimulation by A23187 was unaffected by cycloheximide. The increase in lysophosphatidylinositol levels might be related to the stimulation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin synthesis that is also observed in cells treated with lipid A precursors. The disaccharide precursor, IVA, was at least 100 times more effective than lipid X at stimulating lysophosphatidylinositol formation and prostaglandin release. The relative ability of lipid X and IVA to stimulate these cells correlated well with their effects on other lipopolysaccharide-responsive systems. Macrophage tumor cells also had the ability to inactivate lipid X by dephosphorylating it."

These results are consistent with a Mr value for the receptor of 90,000 after accounting for contribution by the intact hormone or its alpha-subunit. Analysis of the free receptor by fast protein liquid chromatography on Superose 12 revealed a single peak of binding activity for 125I-hCG which eluted in the position of Mr = 200,000-240,000 in the presence of Triton X-100. Since a single protein species is observed under reducing or nonreducing conditions in SDS-PAGE, the receptor could exist in the membrane as a dimeric form composed of subunits Mr = 90,000 associated through noncovalent interactions. The pure receptor can be phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (approximately 0.3 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor). This phosphorylation does not affect the binding characteristics of the receptor. The method described is simple and allows rapid purification of microgram amounts of biological active Leydig cell LH/hCG receptor for structural, functional, and immunological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2003629658,"Leukemic cells cultured in the presence of various conditioned media differentiate into macrophages. This finding suggested that the maintenance of undifferentiated state and self-renewal in vivo may be related to the inability of the host to generate an appropriate level of differentiation factor (DF). Evidence for this hypothesis was derived from experiments in vitro and in vivo with myeloid leukemia of rat. The following results were obtained: (i) in vitro, the percentage of cell differentiation at a fixed concentration of DF was inversely related to the concentration of cells; (ii) leukemic cell inoculates that were lethal to 7-day-old rats were rejected by 21-day-old rats; (iii) leukemic cells in diffusion chambers underwent differentiation in 21-day-old rats but not in 7-day-old rats; (iv) organs from 21-day-old rats contained more DF activity than those of 7-day-old rats; (v) treatment of rats with DF in diffusion chambers resulted in leukemic cell differentiation inside the chamber; and (vi) the development of leukemia in 7-day-old rats was aborted by treatment with DF. These results show that the differentiation of rat leukemia cells requires the appropriate level of DF. The proliferation of transplanted leukemia cells in 7-day-old rats goes unchecked because of inadequate generation of DF. Conversely, in the 21-day-old rats, rejection is accomplished by differentiation of the transplanted cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581122272,"We have previously reported the presence of GM2 as the major ganglioside in the roe of striped mullet, Mugil cephalus, (Li, Y.-T., Hirabayashi, Y., DeGasperi, R., Yu, R. K., Ariga, T., Koerner, T. A. W., and Li, S.-C. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8980-8985). In addition to GM2, mullet roe also contain a series of gangliosides with thin-layer chromatographic mobilities slower than GM2. Besides enzymatic hydrolysis and NMR spectroscopy, we have employed the thin-layer chromatography overlay technique using a human monoclonal IgM antibody which recognizes the GM2 epitope to study the nature of these gangliosides. Using these methods we have isolated and characterized three novel mullet roe gangliosides with the following structures: (Formula: see text). These three gangliosides all contain neolacto-series sugar chains. However, the unique feature of gangliosides 5 and 10 is that the terminal portion of the sugar chain is of the ganglio-series while the internal portion is of the neolacto series structure. Due to the substitution of a GalNAc on the internal Gal in 9 and 10 in the inner core, these two gangliosides also contain the gangliotriaosyl structure. Thus, the sugar chains in these gangliosides are of novel type and can be considered a hybrid between the two series which can be defined as the neolacto-ganglio series."
https://openalex.org/W1571363624,"The formation of dehydroalanine in thyroglobulin is the result of the side chain elimination of an iodophenyl group during the thyroid hormone formation from two iodotyrosyl residues. This amino acid is easily converted to labeled alanine (upon reduction with [3H] borohydride) or changed to labeled aspartic acid (upon addition of Na14CN and subsequent acid hydrolysis). The cleavage of the protein by CNBr produced many stainable electrophoretic bands, but the autoradiography indicated the presence of a much smaller number of radioactive species. Although three major species raised attention, because they could be all jointly labeled and were present in all preparations, only a species of 15,900 Da was fully studied. It was isolated and its sequence partially determined by Edman degradation. It was established that this species corresponded to the thyroglobulin fragment between methionines 2,432 and 2,578. This peptide contains two hormonogenic sites (positions 2,555 and 2,569) which are either tyrosyl residues or hormone residues arising from them, and five additional tyrosines all potentially involved as donor sites in the hormonogenesis. Upon treatment with N-chlorosuccinimide, the fragment was split into three smaller peptides of about 2,900, 8,500, and 4,600 Da containing 1, 2, and 2 tyrosyl residues, respectively. Only the 8,500-Da subfragment contained [3H]Ala. This finding strongly suggests that at least some of the tyrosines involved as donor sites in thyroid hormonogenesis are within this peptide and possibly map at positions 2,469 and/or 2,522. Moreover, at minimum levels of iodination, when thyroglobulin contains the lowest number of hormone molecules, dehydroalanine is mostly found in the 15,900-Da peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1539490926,"Human neutrophil elastase was inactivated by methoxysuccinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Ala-chloromethane. The modified enzyme was crystallized from 40 mM ammonium phosphate, pH 7.0 in the hexagonal space group P6(3) with unit cell parameters a = 74.53 A, b = 74.53 A, c = 70.88 A, alpha = beta = 90 degrees, gamma = 120 degrees. These crystals were resistant to radiation damage and diffracted beyond 1.84-A resolution. The asymmetric unit contained one 25,000-dalton monomer of human neutrophil elastase. Crystals were also grown from the enzyme modified with the analogous iodinated inactivator, p-iodoanilinosuccinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Ala-chloromethane. These crystals proved to be isomorphous with those of methoxysuccinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Ala-chloromethane-modified human neutrophil elastase, and served as a single-site, heavy atom derivative for solving the tertiary structure of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1654770680,"Abstract A protein with an estimated subunit mass of 19 kDa was isolated and purified from perfused rat liver cytosol. This protein activates hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (NADPH) (EC 1.1.1.34), the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The activation process by this HMG-CoA reductase activating protein (RAP) is time-dependent and requires NADPH. Maximal activity of HMG-CoA reductase induced by RAP is comparable to that obtained in the presence of thiols, such as GSH, and can exceed 100-fold the activity obtained when thiols are omitted. Purified RAP lacks ability to reduce 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). RAP was purified to homogeneity utilizing DEAE- and phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography. The purified RAP migrates as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and shows multiple interconvertible aggregational forms on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A monospecific antibody against RAP was prepared by immunization of hens and extracted from either their egg yolks or serum. The catalytic activity of RAP might be responsible for the physiological activation of HMG-CoA reductase and regulation of its activity."
https://openalex.org/W1972971349,"In a vertebrate eye, the photoreceptor cells are aligned so that most of the light passes through them lengthwise. At the light-transducing outer segment region of the photoreceptor, photons are absorbed in a time-varying, spatially dependent fashion. Because the transduction event is spatially localized around the site of photon absorption, the spatiotemporal patterns of light absorption in outer segments are an important receiver input characteristic. This aspect of receptor biophysics has now been measured; the results were consistent with a theoretical model proposed for bleaching of a pigment in an unstirred layer."
