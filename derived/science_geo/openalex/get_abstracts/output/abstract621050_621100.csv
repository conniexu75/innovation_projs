https://openalex.org/W2899235059,"How intrinsic gene-regulatory networks interact with a cell's spatial environment to define its identity remains poorly understood. We developed an approach to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic effects on global gene expression by integrating analysis of sequencing-based and imaging-based single-cell transcriptomic profiles, using cross-platform cell type mapping combined with a hidden Markov random field model. We applied this approach to dissect the cell-type- and spatial-domain-associated heterogeneity in the mouse visual cortex region. Our analysis identified distinct spatially associated, cell-type-independent signatures in the glutamatergic and astrocyte cell compartments. Using these signatures to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identified previously unknown spatially associated subpopulations, which were validated by comparison with anatomical structures and Allen Brain Atlas images."

https://openalex.org/W2898585370,"The development of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) depends on their local microenvironment and the induction of neovascularization is a decisive step in tumor progression, since the growth of solid tumors is limited by nutrient and oxygen supply. Hypoxia is the critical factor that induces transcription of the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) encoding gene HIF1A and HIF-1α protein accumulation to promote angiogenesis. However, the basis for the transcriptional regulation of HIF1A expression in HCC is still unclear. Here, we show that Bclaf1 levels are highly correlated with HIF-1α levels in HCC tissues, and that knockdown of Bclaf1 in HCC cell lines significantly reduces hypoxia-induced HIF1A expression. Furthermore, we found that Bclaf1 promotes HIF1A transcription via its bZIP domain, leading subsequently to increased transcription of the HIF-1α downstream targets VEGFA, TGFB, and EPO that in turn promote HCC-associated angiogenesis and thus survival and thriving of HCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that HIF-1α levels and microvessel density decrease after the shRNA-mediated Bclaf1 knockdown in xenograft tumors. Finally, we found that Bclaf1 levels increase in hypoxia in a HIF-1α dependent manner. Therefore, our study identifies Bclaf1 as a novel positive regulator of HIF-1α in the hypoxic microenvironment, providing new incentives for promoting Bcalf1 as a potential therapeutic target for an anti-HCC strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2899255061,"Ascophyllum nodosum extract (ANE) contains bioactive compounds that improve the growth of Arabidopsis in experimentally-induced saline conditions; however, the molecular mechanisms through which ANE elicits tolerance to salinity remain largely unexplored. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression, playing crucial roles in plant growth, development, and stress tolerance. Next generation sequencing of miRNAs from leaves of control Arabidopsis and from plants subjected to three treatments (ANE, NaCl and ANE+NaCl) was used to identify ANE-responsive miRNA in the absence and presence of saline conditions. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that ANE had a strong effect on miRNAs expression in both conditions. In the presence of salinity, ANE tended to reduce the up-regulation or the down-regulation trend induced caused by NaCl in miRNAs such as ath-miR396a-5p, ath-miR399, ath-miR2111b and ath-miR827. To further uncover the effects of ANE, the expression of several target genes of a number of ANE-responsive miRNAs was analyzed by qPCR. NaCl, but not ANE, down-regulated miR396a-5p, which negatively regulated the expression of AtGRF7 leading to a higher expression of AtDREB2a and AtRD29 in the presence of ANE+NaCl, as compared to ANE alone. ANE+NaCl initially reduced and then enhanced the expression of ath-miR169g-5p, while the expression of the target genes AtNFYA1 and ATNFYA2, known to be involved in the salinity tolerance mechanism, was increased as compared to ANE or to NaCl treatments. ANE and ANE+NaCl modified the expression of ath-miR399, ath-miR827, ath-miR2111b, and their target genes AtUBC24, AtWAK2, AtSYG1 and At3g27150, suggesting a role of ANE in phosphate homeostasis. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed the improved growth of Arabidopsis in presence of ANE, in saline conditions and in phosphate-deprived medium, further substantiating the influence of ANE on a variety of essential physiological processes in Arabidopsis including salinity tolerance and phosphate uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2898612095,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes serious community-acquired and nosocomial infections worldwide. MRSA strains are resistant to a variety of antibiotics, including the classic penicillin and cephalosporin classes of β-lactams, making them intractable to treatment. Although β-lactam resistance in MRSA has been ascribed to the acquisition and activity of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a, encoded by mecA), it has recently been observed that resistance can also be mediated by penicillin-binding protein 4 (PBP4). Previously, we have shown that broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance can arise following serial passaging of a mecA-negative COL strain of S. aureus, creating the CRB strain. This strain has two missense mutations in pbp4 and a mutation in the pbp4 promoter, both of which play an instrumental role in β-lactam resistance. To better understand PBP4's role in resistance, here we have characterized its kinetics and structure with clinically relevant β-lactam antibiotics. We present the first crystallographic PBP4 structures of apo and acyl-enzyme intermediate forms complexed with three late-generation β-lactam antibiotics: ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, and nafcillin. In parallel, we characterized the structural and kinetic effects of the PBP4 mutations present in the CRB strain. Localized within the transpeptidase active-site cleft, the two substitutions appear to have different effects depending on the drug. With ceftobiprole, the missense mutations impaired the Km value 150-fold, decreasing the proportion of inhibited PBP4. However, ceftaroline resistance appeared to be mediated by other factors, possibly including mutation of the pbp4 promoter. Our findings provide evidence that S. aureus CRB has at least two PBP4-mediated resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2898103244,"Efficient adaptation to environmental changes is pivotal for all bacterial cells. Almost all bacterial species depend on the conserved stringent response system to prompt timely transcriptional and metabolic responses according to stress conditions and nutrient depletion. The stringent response relies on the stress-dependent synthesis of the second messenger nucleotides and alarmones (p)ppGpp, which pleiotropically target and reprogram processes that consume cellular resources, such as ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that (p)ppGpp acts on the ribosome biogenesis GTPase A (RbgA) of Gram-positive bacteria. Using X-ray crystallography, hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS (HDX-MS) and kinetic analysis, we demonstrate that the alarmones (p)ppGpp bind to RbgA in a manner similar to that of binding by GDP and GTP and thereby act as competitive inhibitors. Our structural analysis of Staphylococcus aureus RbgA bound to ppGpp and pppGpp at 1.8 and 1.65 Å resolution, respectively, suggested that the alarmones (p)ppGpp prevent the active GTPase conformation of RbgA by sterically blocking the association of its G2 motif via their 3′-pyrophosphate moieties. Taken together, our structural and biochemical characterization of RbgA in the context of the alarmone-mediated stringent response reveals how (p)ppGpp affects the function of RbgA and reprograms this GTPase to arrest the ribosomal large subunit.

Rapidly dividing bacterial cells depend on an effective translational machinery to maintain their fast growth rate. At the heart of this machinery, ribosomes translate mRNA into proteins. However, functional ribosomes have to be assembled in an efficient manner to meet the high demand on the translational machinery during cell proliferation. In Escherichia coli, ribosome assembly is estimated to take approximately 2 min with a corresponding assembly rate of 100,000 ribosomes/h (1Chen S.S. Sperling E. Silverman J.M. Davis J.H. Williamson J.R. Molecular biosystems measuring the dynamics of E. coli ribosome biogenesis using pulse-labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry.Mol. Biosyst. 2012; 8 (23090316): 3325-333410.1039/c2mb25310kCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bacterial ribosome biogenesis involves the initial transcription of a ∼5-kb primary rRNA transcript that is co-transcriptionally cleaved and modified to yield three mature rRNAs (23S, 16S, and 5S) that provide a platform for assembly of the large (50S) and small (30S) ribosomal subunits. Folding of the rRNA occurs co-transcriptionally and is accompanied by the hierarchically variable and block-wise incorporation of ∼50 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) (2Davis J.H. Tan Y.Z. Carragher B. Potter C.S. Lyumkis D. Williamson J.R. Modular assembly of the bacterial large ribosomal subunit.Cell. 2016; 167 (27912064): 1610-1622.e1510.1016/j.cell.2016.11.020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The assembly process involves a set of ∼100 ribosome biogenesis factors to facilitate cleavage, modification, and chaperoning of intermediates in both the 50S and 30S biogenesis pathways (3Shajani Z. Sykes M.T. Williamson J.R. Assembly of bacterial ribosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80 (21529161): 501-52610.1146/annurev-biochem-062608-160432Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, ribosome biogenesis imposes a high metabolic load on bacterial cells and has to be precisely regulated during nutrient starvation to preserve cellular resources. In many bacterial species, ribosome biogenesis is regulated by the stringent response system that senses stress stimuli and signals the stress level via the pleiotropically acting nucleotide messenger alarmones (p)ppGpp (4Hauryliuk V. Atkinson G.C. Murakami K.S. Tenson T. Gerdes K. Recent functional insights into the role of (p)ppGpp in bacterial physiology.Nat. Rev.

Microbiol. 2016; 101 (27149325): 531-54410.1111/mmi.13412Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Upon stress, such as restricted nutrient availability, RSH (RelA/SpoT homologue)-type proteins produce (p)ppGpp by transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP onto the 3′-OH moiety of GTP or GDP. Eventually, when environmental conditions ameliorate, (p)ppGpp is hydrolyzed by RSH-type hydrolases to retrieve GTP/GDP and consequently stress signaling declines. Alarmone-mediated regulation of ribosome biogenesis not only includes the repression of rRNA and r-protein gene transcription to shut down production of ribosomal components but may also involve the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis factors to block the assembly of ribosomal subunits (4Hauryliuk V. Atkinson G.C. Murakami K.S. Tenson T. Gerdes K. Recent functional insights into the role of (p)ppGpp in bacterial physiology.Nat. Rev.

In particular, the Staphylococcus aureus ribosome biogenesis associated GTPases RbgA, HflX, Era, RsgA, and ObgE have been recently shown to be directly targeted by (p)ppGpp to suppress GTPase activity (6Corrigan R.M. Bellows L.E. Wood A. Gründling A. ppGpp negatively impacts ribosome assembly affecting growth and antimicrobial tolerance in Gram-positive bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It has been hypothesized that the (p)ppGpp-mediated GTPase activity suppression prevents the final ribosome subunit maturation step and might therefore arrest subunits before they engage as matured subunits in 70S formation and translation (6Corrigan R.M. Bellows L.E. Wood A. Gründling A. ppGpp negatively impacts ribosome assembly affecting growth and antimicrobial tolerance in Gram-positive bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The 50S subunit ribosome biogenesis GTPase RbgA (Ribosome biogenesis GTPase A; also called YlqF) has been shown to be essential for growth in Bacillus subtilis (7Morimoto T. Loh P.C. Hirai T. Asai K.

Depletion of RbgA leads to a reduction of 70S ribosomes resulting from an arrest of large subunit biogenesis at premature 45S particles that lack the ribosomal proteins L16, L27, L28, L33, L36, and L37 and might be incompetent in 70S formation (8Uicker W.C.

It has been hypothesized that the cpGTPase fold might allow a nucleotide ligand-dependent movement of the C-terminal domain, which has also been suggested to be involved in rRNA contacts and might participate in rRNA remodeling (21Gulati M.

However, the molecular details of ribosome interaction and the mechanism of GTPase activation for 50S maturation have remained enigmatic. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp blocks the GTPase activation of RbgA to arrest the maturation of large ribosomal subunits is also unknown. Here we present high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of S. aureus RbgA in complex with GDP, GMPPNP, ppGpp, and pppGpp. Dynamic and kinetic analysis shows that the alarmones (p)ppGpp act as competitive GTPase inhibitors of RgbA. Comparison of ribosome-free RbgA with the ribosome-associated GTPase active state of the eukaryotic RbgA homologue Lsg1 suggests how RbgA GTPase activation is triggered at the large subunit and inhibited by (p)ppGpp. Taken together, our structural and biochemical analyses of RbgA reveal how the GTPase active conformation is suppressed by (p)ppGpp to arrest large ribosomal subunits during the stringent response. Typically, GTPases undergo conformational rearrangements upon hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and the subsequent release of Pi. To delineate nucleotide-dependent conformational changes of RbgA, we determined crystal structures of S. aureus RbgA bound to GDP and the nonhydrolysable GTP analogue GMPPNP 3The abbreviations used are: GMPPNPguanosine-5′-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphater.m.s.d.root-mean-square deviationHDXhydrogen–deuterium exchangeMSTmicroscale thermophoresisSECsize-exclusion chromatographyHDMShigh-definition MSPTCpeptidyl-transferase centerMPD2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. at 2.15 and 1.93 Å resolution, respectively (Table 1). The structures revealed the two-domain architecture of RbgA consisting of the N-terminal G domain followed by the C-terminal α-helical putative rRNA interaction domain (Fig. 1, A–C). Both GDP and GMPPNP could be unambiguously identified in the unbiased electron density map within the GTPase active site of RbgA (Fig. S1, A and B). The guanine base is accommodated by stacking interactions of lysine 88 and lysine 59 and distinguished by hydrogen-bonding interactions of aspartate 86 and 61 and asparagine 58 of the G5 and G4 GTPase motifs (Fig. 1, D and E). Amino acids 129–134 of the G1 motif contribute to coordination of the α-, β-, and γ-phosphate moieties via hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge interactions (Fig. 1, D and E). The γ-phosphate of GMPPNP is furthermore surrounded by the nonpolar side chains of proline 129 and isoleucine 175 of the G1 and G3 motifs and is less well-defined in the electron density map than the α- and β-phosphate moieties (Fig. S1B). Thus, RbgA coordinates its GDP and GTP nucleotides similar to the T. maritima (18Kim D.J. Jang J.Y. Yoon H.J. Suh S.W. Crystal structure of YlqF, a circularly permuted GTPase: Implications for its GTPase activation in 50S ribosomal subunit assembly.Proteins. 2008; 72 (18536017): 1363-137010.1002/prot.22112Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and B. subtilis (PDB code 1PUJ) RbgA homologues. Despite the different nucleotide content, no significant structural differences between the GDP and GMPPNP-bound state could be observed. The root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between both structures and the individual monomers in the unit cell was below 0.2 Å (Table S1 and Fig. S2, A–E). This observation is substantiated by the fact that both states of RbgA crystallized under different crystallization conditions but in the same space group with identical cell dimensions (Table 1).Table 1Crystallographic tableStructureSaRbgA–GDPSaRbgA–GMPPNPSaRbgA–ppGppSaRbgA–pppGppPDB code6G0Z6G126G146G15Data collectionSpace groupP 21 21 21P 21 21 21P 21 21 21P 21 21 21Cell dimensionsa (Å)71.93271.89971.78172.084b (Å)77.81277.7174.51278.467c (Å)124.667124.36125.215125.022α (°)90.0090.0090.0090.00β (°)90.0090.0090.0090.00γ (°)90.0090.0090.0090.00Energy (Å)0.976250.979030.976250.97625Resolution (Å)48.65–2.15 (2.23–2.15)62.24–1.93 (2.00–1.93)47.93–1.80 (1.864–1.80)48.89–1.65 (1.71–1.65)No. unique reflections38,760 (3822)52,769 (5238)62,299 (6048)85,889 (8495)Rmerge0.041 (0.277)0.056 (0.332)0.106 (0.555)0.035 (0.989)I/σI8.79 (2.45)6.36 (2.08)7.88 (1.74)24.70 (1.85)Completeness (%)99.9 (99.9)99.2 (99.5)99.0 (97.5)100.0 (99.9)Redundancy2.0 (2.0)2.0 (2.0)4.2 (4.2)7.4 (7.4)CC½1.00 (0.88)1.00 (0.54)1.00 (0.94)1.00 (0.81)RefinementResolution (Å)48.65–2.1562.24–1.9347.93–1.8048.89–1.65Rwork/Rfree18.222.721.721.821.725.625.624.4No. atoms4989502650205090Macromolecule4636463645414611Ligand56647280Water297326407399r.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.0110.0080.0090.007Bond angles (°)1.301.121.191.11Ramachandran (%)Preferred98989997Allowed1.651.6512.82Outliers0.350.3500.18 Open table in a new tab guanosine-5′-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate root-mean-square deviation hydrogen–deuterium exchange microscale thermophoresis size-exclusion chromatography high-definition MS peptidyl-transferase center 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol.

U.S.A. 2016; 113 (26951678): E1710-E171910.1073/pnas.1522179113Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the crystal structures of RbgA bound to ppGpp and pppGpp at 1.8 and 1.65 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1). Within the unbiased electron density maps, we could unambiguously identify either ppGpp or pppGpp (Fig. S1, C and D). The GDP and GTP moieties of ppGpp and pppGpp, respectively, associate to the active site in an identical fashion as their native nucleotide counterparts. The 3′-pyrophosphate moieties of both alarmones point away from the active site toward the solvent and seem to be stabilized only by the δ-amino group of lysine 88 of the G5 motif (Fig. 2, A and B). However, lysine 88 is not conserved among RbgA homologues arguing against a substantial role of this residue for the coordination of (p)ppGpp to RbgA (Fig. S3). This is further supported by comparable binding constants of RbgA for GDP, GTP, ppGpp, and pppGpp as determined by microscale thermophoresis (MST) (Fig. 2C and Fig. S4, A–D). Structural comparison of the alarmone-bound states of RbgA with its GDP/GMPPNP-bound states revealed no significant structural differences as indicated by the low r.m.s.d. (< 0.3 Å) (Table S1 and Fig. S2, A–E). These findings suggest that the alarmones do not alter the overall conformation of RbgA. Our inspection of the electron density maps of the presented structures did not show electron density for magnesium, although magnesium was present in the final size-exclusion buffer at a concentration of 20 mm. The absence of magnesium is also true for the crystal structures observed for the T. maritima RbgA in complex with GDP, GTP, and GMPPNP (PDB codes 3CNN, 3CNO, and 3CNL (18Kim D.J. Jang J.Y. Yoon H.J. Suh S.W. Crystal structure of YlqF, a circularly permuted GTPase: Implications for its GTPase activation in 50S ribosomal subunit assembly.Proteins. 2008; 72 (18536017): 1363-137010.1002/prot.22112Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). Because the Mg2+ ion co-factor is essential for catalysis, we reasoned that our structures and the previously reported structure of the T. maritima homologue may not represent the GTPase active conformation of RbgA. In canonical GTPases, binding of Mg2+ in a tetragonal bipyramidal coordination sphere is facilitated by the G1, G2, and G3 motifs. Serine/threonine of the G1 motif GXXXXGK(S/T) (P loop) forms a direct contact, whereas aspartate of the G3 motif DXXG forms a water-mediated contact to the Mg2+, which is required for tight binding of the co-factor (22Wittinghofer A. Vetter I.R. Structure-function relationships of the G domain, a canonical switch motif.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80 (21675921): 943-97110.1146/annurev-biochem-062708-134043Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The coordination sphere is completed by a contact via the conserved threonine of the G2 motif. However, our crystal structures revealed that although the G1 motif is in a position capable of interacting with a properly placed Mg2+ ion, the G2 (switch I) and G3 (switch II) motifs are positioned in a manner apparently not allowing interaction with the Mg2+ ion (Fig. 3A). Comparison of our structure and the T. maritima RbgA structure with the GTP-bound B. subtilis RbgA suggested that a G3 rearrangement would be required for GTP and Mg2+ co-factor binding (Fig. 3, B and C, and Fig. S5). It is noteworthy that the G3 motif is directly connected to the putative C-terminal RNA-binding domain via a linker and rearrangement of the C-terminal domain upon contact with the large subunit might allow proper positioning of the G3 motif and GTP and Mg2+ co-factor binding or vice versa. Mutation of the conserved phenylalanine at position 180 to alanine in the G3 linker region has been shown to be lethal for B. subtilis RbgA in vivo, underlining the importance of this region (21Gulati M. Jain N. Anand B. Prakash B. Britton R.A. Mutational analysis of the ribosome assembly GTPase RbgA provides insight into ribosome interaction and ribosome-stimulated GTPase activation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 (23325847): 3217-322710.1093/nar/gks1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In summary, displacement of the G2 and G3 motifs in absence of the proper RNA contact site might result in co-factor release and GTPase suppression. As suggested by our crystal structures of RbgA, the conformation of RbgA might not necessarily be dictated by the identity of the bound nucleotide. However, crystal-packing contacts might indirectly affect the configuration of the G motifs by impacting the domain orientation of the N-terminal G domain and the adjacent C-terminal RNA-binding domain (Fig. S6). To investigate the role of GDP, GMPPNP, ppGpp, and pppGpp on the conformational dynamics of RbgA in solution, we performed hydrogen–deuterium exchange MS (HDX-MS). The HDX-MS analysis revealed that GDP, GMPPNP, and (p)ppGpp bind into the canonical guanosine nucleotide-binding site of RbgA (Fig. 4A). In particular, we observed a reduction in HDX of the nucleotide-bound RbgA when compared with apo-RbgA in the regions that contain the G motifs, demonstrating that the guanosine-binding site becomes stabilized upon nucleotide binding. It is noteworthy that we identified pronounced differences in HDX for GMPPNP compared with GDP and (p)ppGpp. Four regions (R1–R4) that contain the G4, G5, G1, and G3 motifs were less protected from HDX in complex with GMPPNP (Fig. 4, A and C), suggesting that GMPPNP-bound RbgA might exist in a different conformation than observed for the GDP- or (p)ppGpp-bound states. It is important to note that HDX-MS yields a time-averaged snapshot of multiple states and hence, different rates in ligand association and dissociation might affect the observed HDX. Interestingly, we also observed a difference in HDX between the 5′-diphosphate (GDP and ppGpp) and 5′-triphosphate (GTP and pppGpp) nucleotides in region 4, which includes the G3 motif (switch II). The increased protection of region 4 observed for the 5′-diphosphate nucleotides shows that the G3 motif is less stabilized in presence of the 5′-triphosphate nucleotides and is indicative for a conformational change in this region. This observation supports the idea that the G3 motif rearranges upon association of the 5′-triphosphate nucleotides (compare with Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). It is noteworthy that the G3 motif is directly connected to the RNA-binding domain of RbgA and consequently, the identity of the nucleotide bound might change the relative domain orientation of RbgA. However, we did not observe a difference in HDX for the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of RbgA. Summed up, the analysis by HDX-MS revealed that (p)ppGpp binds to the GDP/GTP binding site of RbgA as also observed in our crystal structures. Furthermore, the analysis showed that RbgA adopts different conformations in solution depending on the identity of the nucleotide, which is in contrast to the virtually identical conformation observed in the crystal structures and suggests that crystal packing might have influenced the conformation observed in our structures. Comparison of the crystal structure of alarmone-bound S. aureus RbgA, B. subtilis RbgA (PDB code 1PUJ), and the cryo-EM structure of ribosome associated S. cerevisiae Lsg1 (17Malyutin A.G. Musalgaonkar S. Patchett S. Frank J. Johnson A.W. Nmd 3 is a structural mimic of eIF 5 A, and activates the cpGTPase Lsg 1 during 60 S ribosome biogenesis.EMBO J. 2017; 36 (28179369): 854-86810.15252/embj.201696012Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) revealed that the δ- and δ-phosphates are placed in a position that would allow proper positioning of the G3 motif and Mg2+ coordination but may also prohibit full association of the switch I region contained G2 motif and could therefore impede Mg2+ and K+ coordination for hydrolase activation (Fig. 5). Hence, RbgA should not be capable of pppGpp hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis, we assayed RbgA GTPase for its ability to hydrolyze GTP, ppGpp, and pppGpp (Fig. 6A). Here we employed the RbgA homologue from B. subtilis that shares a 55% amino acid identity with S. aureus RbgA because B. subtilis 50S ribosomal subunits were readily accessible in high quality. As expected, RbgA could hydrolyze GTP, and this activity was stimulated by the presence of 50S ribosomal subunits. By contrast, RbgA did not hydrolyze ppGpp or pppGpp, regardless of the presence or absence of 50S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 6A), showing that the additional phosphate moieties prohibit the catalytically active conformation likely by blocking association of the G2 motif. Furthermore, we observed an ∼2-fold reduction in GTP hydrolysis when we included ppGpp or pppGpp at equimolar concentrations to GTP in the reactions (Fig. 6A).Figure 6Alarmones competitively inhibit the GTPase activity of BsRbgA.

https://openalex.org/W2898328007,"Metabolic reprogramming is a typical feature of cancer cells aimed at sustaining high-energetic demand and proliferation rate. Here, we report clear-cut evidence for decreased expression of the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of triglyceride hydrolysis, in both human and mouse-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We identified metabolic rewiring as major outcome of ATGL overexpression in HCC-derived cell lines. Indeed, ATGL slackened both glucose uptake/utilization and cell proliferation in parallel with increased oxidative metabolism of fatty acids and enhanced mitochondria capacity. We ascribed these ATGL—downstream events to the activity of the tumor-suppressor p53, whose protein levels—but not transcript—were upregulated upon ATGL overexpression. The role of p53 was further assessed by abrogation of the ATGL-mediated effects upon p53 silencing or in p53-null hepatocarcinoma Hep3B cells. Furthermore, we provided insights on the molecular mechanisms governed by ATGL in HCC cells, identifying a new PPAR-α/p300 axis responsible for p53 acetylation/accumulation. Finally, we highlighted that ATGL levels confer different susceptibility of HCC cells to common therapeutic drugs, with ATGL overexpressing cells being more resistant to glycolysis inhibitors (e.g., 2-deoxyglucose and 3-bromopyruvate), compared to genotoxic compounds. Collectively, our data provide evidence for a previously uncovered tumor-suppressor function of ATGL in HCC, with the outlined molecular mechanisms shedding light on new potential targets for anticancer therapy."

The fiber diameter of the electrospun PU/grape seed oil scaffold and PU/grape seed oil/honey/propolis scaffold were observed to be reduced compared to the pristine PU control. FTIR analysis revealed the existence of grape seed oil, honey and propolis in PU identified by CH band peak shift and also hydrogen bond formation. The contact angle of PU/grape seed oil scaffold was found to increase owing to hydrophobic nature and the contact angle for the PU/grape seed/honey oil/propolis scaffold were decreased because of hydrophilic nature. Further, the prepared PU/grape seed oil and PU/grape seed oil/honey/propolis scaffold showed enhanced thermal stability and reduction in surface roughness than the control as revealed in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. Further, the developed nanocomposite scaffold displayed delayed blood clotting time than the pristine PU in the activated prothrombin time (APTT) and partial thromboplastin time (PT) assay. The hemolytic assay and cytocompatibility studies revealed that the electrospun PU/grape seed oil and PU/grape seed oil/honey/propolis scaffold possess non-toxic behaviour to red blood cells (RBC) and human fibroblast cells (HDF) cells indicating better blood compatibility and cell viability rates. Hence, the newly developed electrospun nanofibrous composite scaffold with desirable characteristics might be used as an alternative candidate for bone tissue engineering applications."

https://openalex.org/W2899384666,"Dogs diagnosed with appendicular osteosarcoma typically succumb to metastatic disease within a year of diagnosis. The current standard of care for curative intent, amputation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, increases survival time but chemoresistance is a major contributor to mortality. Unfortunately, the mechanisms driving the progression of metastatic disease and the development of chemoresistance are unknown. One theory is that autophagy may contribute to chemoresistance by providing neoplastic cells with a mechanism to survive chemotherapy treatment. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of combining an autophagy inhibitor with a standard chemotherapeutic drug on response to chemotherapy in canine appendicular osteosarcoma cells. We hypothesized that combining the autophagy inhibitor spautin-1 with doxorubicin treatment would enhance chemoresponsiveness. Using commercial (D17) and primary cell lines derived from 1° and 2° sites of osteosarcoma, we showed that this combination treatment enhances cell killing and inhibits colony formation. Our findings support the theory that autophagy contributes to chemoresistance in canine appendicular osteosarcoma and indicate that adding an autophagy inhibitor to the standard of care has the potential to improve outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2899051402,"Background The aim of this study was to examine how physical activity (PA) before and during pregnancy influences pregnancy outcomes, particularly preterm delivery and mode of delivery. Methods This study was based on the Japan Environment and Children’s Study. A total of 92,796 pregnant women who gave birth to live singleton babies were included. Information on mean PA per week during pregnancy was extracted from the responses to questionnaires completed by women during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Information on PA before pregnancy was obtained from questionnaires answered based on recall at participation. The level of PA was stratified into the following quartiles for categorical analysis: Very low, Low, Medium, and High. Pregnancy outcomes, gestational age at delivery (whether preterm delivery or not), and mode of delivery (spontaneous, instrumental, or caesarean delivery) were compared between the different groups adjusted for multiple covariates. Results With respect to PA during pregnancy, the risk of preterm delivery and instrumental delivery increased significantly in the Very low group compared to that in the Medium group (odds ratios [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05–1.29; OR 1.12, 95% CI, 1.03–1.22, respectively). Moreover, the risks of caesarean delivery in the Low group and instrumental delivery in the High group were significantly higher than the risks in the Medium group (OR 1.07, 95% CI, 1.00–1.15; OR 1.12, 95% CI, 1.02–1.22, respectively). In contrast, with respect to PA before pregnancy, there were no statistically significant differences when the other groups were compared to the Medium group. Conclusions Pre-pregnancy PA has no negative effects on preterm birth and caesarean delivery. In contrast, both may be affected by PA during pregnancy because a low level of PA appears to slightly increase the risk of preterm delivery and operative delivery (caesarean and instrumental)."
https://openalex.org/W2899183154,"Background Active and Healthy Ageing (AHA) is the process of optimizing opportunities related to health, participation, and safety in order to improve quality of life. The approach most often used to measure AHA is Rowe and Kahn’s Satisfactory Ageing model. Nonetheless, this model has limitations. One of the strategic objectives of the WHO Global Strategy and Action Plan (2016) is to improve Healthy Ageing measurement. Our objectives were to compare two models of assessing AHA and further compare the results by country and sociodemographic variables. Methods This was a cross-sectional, observational analysis of a representative sample of the general population aged 50 years and older in Europe. The data analysed were obtained by the Study of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The dependent variable was AHA and its dimensions, measured using the Rowe and Kahn AHA model (AHA-B) and the authors’ model based on the WHO definition (AHA-BPS). A descriptive analysis and multivariate models of binary logistical regression were developed. Results The sample consisted of 52,641 participants (mean age 65.24 years [SD = 10.18; Range = 50–104], 53.2% women). Healthy Ageing prevalence in the AHA-B model was 23.5% (95%CI = 23.1%-23.9%). In the AHA-BPS model, this prevalence was 38.9%. In both models, significant variations were observed between countries, and were distributed along a north-western to south-eastern gradient. The sociodemographic variables associated with the absence of AHA were advanced age, female sex, death of spouse, low educational level, lack of employment, and low financial status. Comparing the two models, the strength of association between absence of AHA and advanced age (85 years and older) was four times greater in the AHA-B model. Conclusions Our results showing differences between these two models provide evidence that the AHA-BPS model does not penalize older age and is more likely to characterize AHA from a health promotion perspective."

Health care professionals rely on subjective criteria (e.g., symptoms), as there is no objective marker for identification of athletes with SRC. Blood-based biomarkers have shown promise as diagnostic and prognostic tools following TBI and SRC. In the present study, we examined plasma tau and serum NF-L, two biomarkers for neuronal/axonal injury, concentrations at preseason and following SRC in contact sport athletes (n = 11) using ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) assays. Preseason baseline samples were collected, and post-concussion samples were obtained at 6- and 14-days following injury. We found no difference between baseline, 6-day and 14-day post-concussion concentrations of tau (p = 0.14) or NF-L (p = 0.53). Further, no difference was found between preseason baseline and all post-SRC samples for tau (p = 0.22) or NF-L (p = 0.98). The total number of symptoms reported on the Standardized Assessment of Concussion– 3rd Edition (SCAT3) and associated symptom severity scores increased from preseason to 6-days post-SRC but returned to baseline values at 14-days (p = 0.02 and p = 0.003, respectively). These results suggest that the severity of neuronal injury in this cohort of contact sport athletes with clinical uncomplicated SRC was too low to be detected by tau and NF-L measurements in blood samples obtained at 6- and 14-days post-injury."

The relationship between family structure and positive adolescent sexual behaviour, measured as delay in sexual debut, was examined using the bioecological theory framed by a risk and resilience perspective. We used nationally representative data on female and male adolescents (aged 15-17 years) from 12 countries in SSA. We modelled logistic regressions to test for associations between family structure and delayed sexual debut while controlling for other covariates in SSA. The majority (90%) of the young adults delayed sexual debut, and this delay varied by family structure. After controlling for other covariates, adolescents living with neither parent had lower odds of delaying sexual debut although results were only significant for males. Interaction terms with community socio-economic status showed an interaction between community education and males living with neither parent. Future studies must investigate the gender differentials in the relationship between family structure and delayed sexual debut among adolescents in SSA."

https://openalex.org/W2899076552,"Regulating health behavior change often occurs in a dyadic context of romantic relationships. Dyadic approaches to standard health behavior change models are, however, barely considered. We investigated volitional processes of the Health Action Process Approach model for two health behaviors within a dyadic context of romantic couples. Specifically, we tested whether day-to-day volitional self-regulation predicted one's own and one's partner's cigarettes smoked (Study 1) and physical activity (Study 2).In two dyadic intensive longitudinal studies (Study 1: 83 dual-smoker couples intending to jointly quit smoking; Study 2: 61 overweight couples intending to become physically active), heterosexual partners independently reported on intention, self-efficacy, action planning, and action control in end-of-day diaries. In Study 1, daily number of cigarettes smoked was assessed via self-report. In Study 2, daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed objectively via accelerometers. In both studies, dyadic cross-lagged intensive longitudinal analyses based on the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model were applied.Across both studies, individual's own volitional self-regulation positively predicted one's own health behavior (less cigarettes smoked and more MVPA). One's partner's action control and intention also positively predicted one's own health behavior. A marginal partner effect for self-efficacy was found in the context of smoking only.Behavioral self-regulation is not only relevant for individuals themselves, but some volitional processes may spill over to their partners.

On the basis of their richness in active principles, the previous evidence of biological activity, and the abundance of biomass in their native range and invaded areas, a question arose: can U. europaeus and C. scoparius be considered as potential sources of natural herbicides for sustainable agriculture? By means of volatile bioassays, the flowering fresh plant material of both shrub species was shown to produce and emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) able to inhibit the germination and/or early growth of two agricultural weeds: Amaranthus retroflexus and Digitaria sanguinalis. Novel complete VOCs profiles from the volatile extracts of the shrub species were obtained by GC and GC/MS. A total of 20 compounds were identified from U. europaeus flowering biomass, theaspirane and eugenol, among others, being described in gorse for the first instance. The chemical profile of C. scoparius yielded 28 compounds and was rich in oxygenated monoterpenes such as terpinen-4-ol, verbenol, α-terpineol, and verbenone, which were also identified in this species for the first time. Using dose-response bioassays with pure compounds, these VOCs were argued to be involved in the phytotoxicity observed for the plant materials, even at very low concentrations. The phytotoxic effects were predominantly irreversible, particularly for D. sanguinalis, since the seeds exposed to the VOCs produced damaged seedlings, were unable to recover germination capacity after removing the phytotoxin or, when recovered, produced unviable seedlings. Our results extend the interest of the abundant U. europaeus and C. scoparius for the obtention of natural products with bioherbicide potential, or to be used as allelopathic biomass in the development of new sustainable agricultural practices."

This study aimed to investigate the risk of liver disease leading to liver cancer using nationally representative data to establish an efficient NLCSP. Methods This study used data from the National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) from 2002 to 2013. A retrospective matched cohort design was applied to compare the development of liver cancer in patients with and without liver disease. Cox- proportional hazard regression for liver cancer with competing risk of death was performed for all subjects or each group stratified according to age or income level. Results A total of 66,192 patients with liver disease and matched subjects without liver disease were included in the study. The incidences of liver cancer among patients with and without liver disease within a median 8-year follow-up period were 2.68% (n = 1,772) and 0.34% (n = 210), respectively. Cox- regression analysis for liver cancer incidence indicated that cirrhosis had the highest risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 18.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.24–21.58), followed by hepatitis B (HR: 9.32, 95% CI: 8.00–10.85). Subgroup analysis showed that the presence of liver disease was an important risk factor in younger as well as elderly people, and a higher risk of liver disease was also observed in the patients with Medicaid. Conclusions Attention should be paid to the development of liver cancer in young people under 50 years old and preventive efforts to decrease the incidence of liver cancer among Medicaid recipients is needed."

This study evaluated subclinical sports injuries, which in turn may help prevent competition-specific injuries and improve performance levels.Between 2014 and 2016, twelve participants who had been competing in weightlifting events for at least 2 years were enrolled in this study. The mean age of the participants at the start of this study was 11.4 ± 2.0 years, and there were 6 boys and 6 girls. Annual medical questionnaire surveys and lumbar examinations using MRI were performed during the 3-year follow-up. The incidence rates and variations of LBP and abnormal MRI findings were evaluated.At the start of this study, there were no positive findings of LBP, and abnormal lumbar findings on MRI were observed in only 2 participants. At the 2-year follow-up, 1 participant had LBP, and 8 of 12 participants had abnormal lumbar findings. In the final year, only 3 participants had LBP; however, abnormal lumbar findings were observed on MRI in 11 participants. Among these, lumbar spondylolysis was observed in 4 participants, lumbar disc protrusion or extrusion in 2 participants, and lumbar disc degeneration in 9 participants.This prospective 3-year cohort study of 12 child and adolescent weightlifters revealed abnormal lumbar findings in 11 participants at a high rate on MRI examination. Children and adolescents undergoing resistance training at the competition level could potentially have irreversible changes in the lumbar vertebra without symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2899429715,"The success of osseointegrated transcutaneous prostheses depends on a soft-tissue seal forming at the skin-implant interface in order to prevent infection. Current designs include a flange with drilled holes or a subdermal barrier with a porous coating in an attempt to promote soft-tissue attachment. However, the soft-tissue seal is not reliably achieved despite these designs and infection remains a significant problem. This study investigated soft-tissue integration into fully porous titanium alloy structures with interconnected pores. The study aimed to determine the effect of altering pore and strut size combinations on soft-tissue ingrowth into porous titanium alloy structures in vivo. It was hypothesized that implants with a more open porous structure with larger pore sizes would increase soft-tissue ingrowth more than less open porous structures. Porous titanium alloy cylinders were inserted into sheep paparaspinal muscles (n = 6) and left in situ for four weeks. A histological assessment of soft-tissue ingrowth was performed. Percentage soft-tissue pore fill, cell nuclei density and blood vessel density were quantified. The results showed that larger pore sizes were supportive of soft-tissue ingrowth. A structure with a pore size of 700μm and a strut size of 300μm supported revascularisation to the greatest degree. A flange with this structure may be used in future studies of osseointegrated transcutaneous prostheses in order to enhance the soft-tissue seal."
https://openalex.org/W2899506329,"Treating proximal humerus fractures can be challenging because of large metaphyseal defects that conceal anatomical landmarks. In such cases, medial cortical support with, for example, calcar screws, is mandatory. Nevertheless, varus dislocations and implant failures in patients with impaired bone quality persist. Thus, the need for effective treatment of these patients exists. Hybrid double plate osteosynthesis was introduced as an alternative, yielding similar results as calcar screws. However, a biomechanical comparison of the stability of these two techniques is pending.Cadaveric humeral specimens were treated with plate osteosynthesis and calcar screws (group 1, n = 9) or hybrid double plate osteosynthesis (group 2, n = 9) using a proximal humerus fracture model with a two-part fracture. Displacement, stiffness, failure mode, and ultimate load were examined biomechanically in a cyclic compressive-loading scenario.Although the hybrid double plate osteosynthesis (group 2) tended to confer higher stiffnesses than the medial support screws at higher cycles (group 1), this trend was below the level of significance. The displacement revealed non-significantly lower values for group 1 as compared with group 2 for cycles 50 and 2000, but at 5000 cycles, group 2 offered non-significantly lower displacement values than group 1. The ultimate load tended to be non-significantly higher in the hybrid double plate osteosynthesis group (group 2: 1342±369 N, group 1: 855±408 N). Both groups yielded similar failure rates, with the majority of failures in group 2 being gap closures (n = 8), whereas those in group 1 being plate dislocations (n = 4).The use of an additive plate osteosynthesis in the region of the bicipital groove may be a potential alternative to the previously-established method of using calcar screws. The biomechanical data obtained in this study suggests that hybrid double plate osteosynthesis is as rigid and robust as calcar screws."
https://openalex.org/W2951649430,"Recent interest in reversal of the hypnotic effects of anesthesia has mainly focused on overcoming a surge in GABA-mediated inhibitory signaling through activation of subcortical arousal circuits or antagonizing GABA receptors. Here we examine the reversal of anesthesia produced from non-GABA agents ketamine/xylazine and the effects of antagonists of adrenoreceptors. These antagonists vary in selectivity and produce temporally unique waking behavior post-anesthesia. We compared two antagonists with differential selectivity for α1- vs. α2-receptors, yohimbine (YOH, 1:40 selectivity) and atipamezole (ATI, 1:8500). Adult mice received intraperitoneal injections of either YOH (4.3 mg/kg), ATI (0.4 mg/kg), or saline after achieving sustained loss of righting following injection of ketamine/xylazine (ketamine: 65.0 mg/kg; xylazine: 9.9 mg/kg). Behaviors indicative of the post-anesthesia, re-animation sequence were carefully monitored and the timing of each behavior relative to anesthesia induction was compared. Both YOH and ATI hastened behaviors indicative of emergence, but ATI was faster than YOH to produce certain behaviors, including whisker movement (YOH: 21.9±1.5 min, ATI: 17.5±0.5 min, p = 0.004) and return of righting reflex (RORR) (YOH: 40.6±8.8 min, ATI: 26.0±1.2 min, p<0.001). Interestingly, although YOH administration hastened early behavioral markers of emergence relative to saline (whisking), the completion of the emergence sequence (time from first marker to appearance of RORR) was delayed with YOH. We attribute this effect to antagonism of α1 receptors by yohimbine. Also notable was the failure of either antagonist to hasten the re-establishment of coordinated motor behavior (e.g., attempts to remove adhesive tape on the forepaw placed during anesthesia) relative to the end of emergence (RORR). In total, our work suggests that in addition to pharmacokinetic effects, re-establishment of normal waking behaviors after anesthesia involves neuronal circuits dependent on time and/or activity."

However, their reproducibility has not been established.To evaluate the predictive value of colony-forming units (CFU) of M. tuberculosis in cough aerosols on secondary infection and disease in household contacts in Brazil.Adult sputum smear+ and culture+ pulmonary TB cases underwent a standard evaluation and were categorized according to aerosol CFU. We evaluated household contacts for infection at baseline and at 8 weeks with TST and IGRA, and secondary disease.We enrolled 48 index TB cases; 40% had negative aerosols, 27% low aerosols (<10 CFU) and 33% high aerosols (≥10 CFU). Of their 230 contacts, the proportion with a TST ≥10 mm at 8 weeks was 59%, 65% and 75%, respectively (p = 0.34). Contacts of high aerosol cases had greater IGRA readouts (median 4.6 IU/mL, IQR 0.02-10) when compared to those with low (0.8, 0.2-10) or no aerosol (0.1, 0-3.7; p = 0.08). IGRA readouts in TST converters of high aerosol cases (median 20 IU/mL, IQR 10-24) were larger than those from aerosol-negative (0.13, 0.04-3; p = o.o2). 8/9 (89%) culture+ secondary TB cases occurred in contacts of aerosol+ cases.Aerosol CFU predicts quantitatively IGRA readouts among household contacts of smear positive TB cases. Our results strengthen the argument of using cough aerosols to guide targeted preventive treatment strategies, a necessary component of current TB elimination projections."
https://openalex.org/W2899308531,"Cellular regulatory networks are not static, but continuously reconfigure in response to stimuli via alterations in protein abundance and confirmation. However, typical computational approaches treat them as static interaction networks derived from a single time point. Here, we provide methods for learning the dynamic modulation of relationships between proteins from static single-cell data. We demonstrate our approach using TGFß induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in murine breast cancer cell line, profiled with mass cytometry. We take advantage of the asynchronous rate of transition to EMT in the data and derive a pseudotime EMT trajectory. We propose methods for visualizing and quantifying time-varying edge behavior over the trajectory, and a metric of edge dynamism to predict the effect of drug perturbations on EMT."

A questionnaire and four online-based cognitive tasks were used to gather the data, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to investigate the interrelationships between constructs. The results showed that time on task was the strongest predictor of MMR, and grit also significantly influenced performance. However, WMC did not play a substantial role in predicting performance while playing Dota 2. These results are discussed in relation to sample characteristics and the role of deliberate practice and skill acquisition within the domain of playing Dota 2. Further, we suggest that future research investigates the social aspects of attaining skill, the relationship between personality and performance, and the qualitative aspects of time spent on a task."
https://openalex.org/W2898992240,"Community structures are ubiquitous in various complex networks, implying that the networks commonly be composed of groups of nodes with more internal links and less external links. As an important topic in network theory, community detection is of importance for understanding the structure and function of the networks. Optimizing statistical measures for community structures is one of most popular strategies for community detection in complex networks. In the paper, by using a type of self-loop rescaling strategy, we introduced a set of global modularity functions and a set of local modularity functions for community detection in networks, which are optimized by a kind of the self-consistent method. We carefully compared and analyzed the behaviors of the modularity-based methods in community detection, and confirmed the superiority of the local modularity for detecting community structures on large-size and heterogeneous networks. The local modularity can more quickly eliminate the first-type limit of modularity, and can eliminate or alleviate the second-type limit of modularity in networks, because of the use of the local information in networks. Moreover, we tested the methods in real networks. Finally, we expect the research can provide useful insight into the problem of community detection in complex networks."
https://openalex.org/W2899013861,"Background The Arapaima (Arapaima gigas) is one of the world's largest freshwater bony fish, and is found in the rivers of the Amazon basin. This species is a potential aquaculture resource, although reproductive management in captivity is limited in particular due to the lack of external sexual dimorphism. In this study, using the 454 Roche platform (pyrosequencing) techniques, we evaluated a major portion of the transcriptome of this important Amazonian species. Results Four libraries obtained from the liver and skin tissue of juvenile specimens (representing males and females separately) were sequenced, yielding 5,453,919 high-quality reads. The de novo transcriptome assembly resulted in 175,792 contigs, with 51,057 significant blast hits. A total of 38,586 transcripts were mapped by Gene Ontology using Blast2GO. We identified 20,219 genes in the total transcriptome (9,551 in the liver and 16,818 in the skin). The gene expression analyses indicated 105 genes in the liver and 204 in the skin with differentiated expression profiles, with 95 being over-expressed in the females and 214 in the males. The log2 Fold Change and heatmap based on Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) revealed that the gene expression in the skin is highly differentiated between male and female arapaima, while the levels of expression in the liver are similar between the sexes. Conclusion Transcriptome analysis based on pyrosequencing proved to be a reliable tool for the identification of genes with differentiated expression profiles between male and female arapaima. These results provide useful insights into the molecular pathways of sexual dimorphism in this important Amazonian species, and for comparative analyses with other teleosts."

As sebocytes matured in wildtype C57BL/NJ mice they became pale with fine, uniformly sized clear lipid containing vacuoles that were released when sebocytes disintegrated in the duct. By contrast, the Far2-/- null mice had sebocytes that were similar within the gland but become brightly eosinophilic when the cells entered the sebaceous gland duct. As sebocytes disintegrated, their contents did not readily dissipate. Scattered throughout the dermis, and often at the dermal hypodermal fat junction, were dystrophic hair follicles or ruptured follicles with a foreign body granulomatous reaction surrounding free hair shafts (trichogranuloma). The Meibomian and clitoral glands (modified sebaceous glands) of Far2-/- mice showed ducts dilated to various degrees that were associated with mild changes in the sebocytes as seen in the truncal skin. Skin surface lipidomic analysis revealed a lower level of wax esters, cholesterol esters, ceramides, and diacylglycerols compared to wildtype control mice. Similar changes were described in a number of other mouse mutations that affected the sebaceous glands resulting in primary cicatricial alopecia."

Although recent genetic studies have uncovered various mechanisms that regulate osteoblast differentiation, the molecular basis of osteoblast proliferation remains unclear. Here, using an osteoblast-specific loss-of-function mouse model, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) regulates osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that Cdk1 is highly expressed in bone and is down-regulated upon osteoblast differentiation. We also noted that Cdk1 is dispensable for the bone-anabolic effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Cdk1 deletion in osteoblasts led to osteoporosis in adult mice due to low bone formation, but did not affect osteoclast formation in vivo. Cdk1 overexpression in osteoblasts promoted proliferation, and conversely, Cdk1 knockdown inhibited osteoblast proliferation and promoted differentiation. Of note, we provide direct evidence that PTH's bone-anabolic effects occur without enhancing osteoblast proliferation in vivo. Furthermore, we found that Cdk1 expression in osteoblasts is essential for bone fracture repair. These findings may help reduce the risk of nonunion after bone fracture and identify patients at higher risk for nonresponse to PTH treatment. Collectively, our results indicate that Cdk1 is essential for osteoblast proliferation and that it functions as a molecular switch that shifts osteoblast proliferation to maturation.

To develop a strategy to promote bone formation, investigations of the regulatory mechanisms of osteoblast proliferation are overdue. Generally, cell proliferation is promoted by the activity of cell cycle regulators (15Suryadinata R. Sadowski M. Sarcevic B. Control of cell cycle progression by phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) substrates.Biosci. Rep. 2010; 30 (20337599): 243-25510.1042/BSR20090171Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The cell cycle is regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) (16Lim S. Kaldis P. Cdks, cyclins, and CKIs: roles beyond cell cycle regulation.Development. 2013; 140 (23861057): 3079-309310.1242/dev.091744Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Cdks are a group of kinases consisting of 20 members in mammals, which play critical roles in cell cycle control, transcription, and development (15Suryadinata R. Sadowski M. Sarcevic B. Control of cell cycle progression by phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) substrates.Biosci.

However, despite the theoretical importance of Cdks, the physiological roles of Cdks in bone metabolism have not been defined. Moreover, no Cdks have thus far been found to regulate bone mass through in vivo cell-specific loss-of-function experiments. In this study, we generated osteoblast-specific Cdk1-knockout mice to investigate the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) in regulating bone formation. To investigate the functions of Cdks in bone, we first examined the expression of Cdks in the femurs of 3-month-old mice using quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. Cdk1 was expressed at higher levels than other Cdks in the bone (Fig. 1A). Cdk1, the first Cdk to be identified, is conserved in all organisms and has been the most extensively studied cell cycle regulator to date (17Diril M.K. Ratnacaram C.K. Padmakumar V.C. Du T.

Interestingly, Cdk1 expression gradually decreased during osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 1C). To study the importance of Cdk1 kinase activity, we tested whether inhibiting Cdk1 would affect osteoblast proliferation. To this end, we treated MC3T3-E1 cells with RO-3306, a specific inhibitor of Cdk1 (19Vassilev L.T. Cell cycle synchronization at the G2/M phase border by reversible inhibition of CDK1.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5 (17172841): 2555-255610.4161/cc.5.22.3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As expected, compared with the proliferation of vehicle-treated cells, the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells was significantly impaired by RO-3306 treatment (Fig. 1D), which agrees with the results in other types of cells (17Diril M.K.

Taken together, these results indicate that Cdk1 plays an important role in osteoblast proliferation in vitro. Because Cdk1-null mice exhibit early embryonic lethality (17Diril M.K. Ratnacaram C.K. Padmakumar V.C. Du T. Wasser M. Coppola V. Tessarollo L. Kaldis P. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) is essential for cell division and suppression of DNA re-replication but not for liver regeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To achieve this, we crossed Cdk1f/f (hereafter, “control”) mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Osterix promoter (hereafter, “Osx–Cre mice”) to generate Osx–Cretg/Cdk1f/f mice (hereafter, “Cdk1osb−/− mice”) (21Rodda S.J. McMahon A.P. Distinct roles for Hedgehog and canonical Wnt signaling in specification, differentiation and maintenance of osteoblast progenitors.Development. 2006; 133 (16854976): 3231-324410.1242/dev.02480Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). These mutant mice were recovered in the expected Mendelian ratio, indicating that embryonic development can proceed without Cdk1 expression in osteoblasts. Although the deletion of Cdk1 was confirmed in the calvaria of 3-month-old mice by qPCR and Western blotting, no significant differences in the expression of other Cdks were detected (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1). Osx–Cre expression alone has been shown to negatively affect skeletal growth in young mice, but the effect of Cre is diminished by 12 weeks of age (22Davey R.A. Clarke M.V. Sastra S. Skinner J.P. Chiang C. Anderson P.H. Zajac J.D. Decreased body weight in young Osterix-Cre transgenic mice results in delayed cortical bone expansion and accrual.Transgenic Res. 2012; 21 (22160436): 885-89310.1007/s11248-011-9581-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Karuppaiah K.

Thus, we decided to use 3-month-old mice for analysis. To confirm any potential effect of Osx–Cre on bone morphology in our studies, control mice were compared with Osx–Cre mice via microcomputer tomography (μCT) and histological analysis. Indeed, bone histomorphometric analysis of the vertebrae and μCT analysis of the distal femur in 3-month-old mice showed no significant differences in bone volume between control and Osx–Cre mice, in line with previous reports (Fig. S2). These results show that the Osx–Cre allele per se had a minimal effect on the bone histomorphometric and μCT analyses in our study. A bone histomorphometric analysis of the vertebrae of 3-month-old Cdk1osb−/− mice demonstrated a significant decrease in bone mass compared with that of control mice as measured by BV/TV (Fig. 2B). This effect was likely caused by a significant decrease in the number of osteoblasts, which may result in a decrease in the bone formation rate, whereas the osteoclast surface was not affected (Fig. 2C). μCT analysis indicated that bone volume/total volume, bone mineral density, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, and cortical thickness were also decreased in the long bones of Cdk1osb−/− mice compared with control mice (Fig. 2D). Accordingly, serum levels of procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), a biomarker correlated with bone formation, was decreased in Cdk1osb−/− mice (Fig. 2E). However, serum C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX-I), a biomarker for bone resorption, showed no difference between Cdk1osb−/− mice and control mice (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these results indicate that Cdk1 is important for bone formation. We aimed to examine the molecular mechanism behind the decrease in osteoblast numbers observed in Cdk1osb−/− mice. To test whether decreased bone formation was caused by altered osteoblast survival and/or proliferation, we performed TUNEL and BrdU assays and examined proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki67 expression. TUNEL assays performed in femoral sections from 3-month-old female mice failed to reveal any difference in apoptotic cells between Cdk1osb−/− mice and control mice (Fig. 3A). However, BrdU assays performed in femoral sections from 3-month-old female mice suggested a 55% decrease in the number of proliferating osteoblasts in Cdk1osb−/− mice compared with control mice (Fig. 3B). Moreover, there were fewer PCNA- and Ki67-positive osteoblasts in the Cdk1osb−/− sections than in the control sections (Fig. 3C). To further test whether the decrease in bone formation was caused by decreased proliferative activity of osteoblastic progenitors and/or a decreased pool of osteoblast progenitors, we analyzed the expression of Osx and Runx2. Although Runx2 expression was similar in control and Cdk1osb−/− mice, Osx expression levels were lower in Cdk1osb−/− mice than in control mice (Fig. 3D). Thus, the decrease in bone formation is likely caused by decreased proliferative activity of osteoblastic progenitors rather than by a decreased progenitor pool. Collectively, these results indicate that Cdk1 plays an important role in osteoblast proliferation in vivo. Because Cdk1 regulates osteoblast proliferation, we wondered whether Cdk1 also affects osteoblast differentiation. To address this question in vitro, we isolated calvarial osteoblasts from WT mice, treated them with RO-3306 or vehicle, and then compared their behavior during differentiation. Cdk1-inhibited osteoblasts formed more mineralized nodules than vehicle-treated osteoblasts (Fig. 4A). To test whether osteogenic differentiation is affected by the Cdk1 status when progenitors are stimulated with osteogenic BMP2, we treated ST2 mesenchymal progenitor cells with RO-3306 followed by BMP2. As expected, inhibiting Cdk1 promoted osteoblastic differentiation of ST2 cells (Fig. 4B), as evidenced by alkaline phosphatase (Alp) and osteocalcin (Ocn) expression. Furthermore, knocking down Cdk1 with shRNA promoted osteoblast differentiation, as confirmed by the elevated expression of the osteoblast differentiation markers Col1a1 and Ocn (Fig. 4C). To address this question in vivo, we performed in situ hybridization analysis for osteoblast differentiation markers. Consistent with our observations in vitro, Cdk1 deletion resulted in accelerated osteoblast differentiation, which was confirmed by the elevated expression of the osteoblast differentiation markers Col1a1 and Ocn (Fig. 4D). In addition, qPCR analysis revealed increased expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes (Alp, Col1a1, and Ocn) in the calvaria of 3-month-old Cdk1osb−/− mice (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that the biological function of Cdk1 in osteoblasts correlates with their ability to differentiate. Overall, Cdk1 is important for not only the proliferation but also the proper differentiation of osteoblasts. Intermittent PTH treatment enhances bone formation and increases osteoblast number by a variety of mechanisms, including stimulation of osteoblast proliferation (24Pettway G.J. Meganck J.A. Koh A.J. Keller E.T. Goldstein S.A. McCauley L.K. Parathyroid hormone mediates bone growth through the regulation of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation.Bone. 2008; 42 (18234576): 806-81810.1016/j.bone.2007.11.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because Cdk1 is important for osteoblast proliferation, we hypothesized that Cdk1 may be involved in the bone-anabolic response to intermittent PTH treatment in vivo. To test this hypothesis, Cdk1osb−/− mice and control mice were treated with either PTH or vehicle for 4 weeks (Fig. 5A). These mice were then analyzed by bone histomorphometry and μCT for bone parameters. As expected, PTH increased bone mass by 30% in control mice (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, PTH also successfully increased BV/TV by 60% in Cdk1osb−/− mice (Fig. 5B) in the presence of low osteoblast proliferation. Bone histomorphometric analysis revealed that although the number of osteoblasts and the bone formation rate were substantially lower in Cdk1osb−/− mice than in control mice, they were both increased to approximately the same levels by PTH (Fig. 5C). With regard to bone resorption, although there was a trend toward higher bone resorption induced by PTH administration in control and Cdk1osb−/− mice, there was no significant difference between control and Cdk1osb−/− mice (Fig. 5C). We then examined Ki67 expression to test whether the bone-anabolic effect of PTH in Cdk1osb−/− mice was caused by altered osteoblast proliferation. PTH treatment induced osteoblast proliferation, as shown by the markedly increased number of Ki67-positive cells in the control femoral sections; however, the effect of PTH on osteoblast proliferation was blunted in Cdk1osb−/− sections (Fig. 5D). Collectively, these results indicate that Cdk1 in osteoblasts may be dispensable for the bone-anabolic effect of intermittent PTH treatment, suggesting that the bone-anabolic effect of PTH is independent of osteoblast proliferative ability. The bone fracture healing process consists of intramembranous and endochondral bone formation (25Marsell R. Einhorn T.A. The biology of fracture healing.Injury. 2011; 42 (21489527): 551-55510.1016/j.injury.2011.03.031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Cdk1 during bone fracture repair, we performed femoral fractures on Cdk1osb−/− mice and control mice at 3 months of age. X-ray analysis revealed no significant differences between control and Cdk1osb−/− mice in callus formation at 6 weeks after surgery (Fig. 6A), indicating that the bone repair process was activated normally. μCT analysis demonstrated bony bridging across the fracture site at 6 weeks after surgery in control mice, suggesting bony union. However, no bony bridging was observed in Cdk1osb−/− mice, suggesting failed union (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that Cdk1 in osteoblasts is not essential for callus formation in bone fracture repair but is required for bony union. Finally, we tested whether the administration of PTH prevented nonunion after bone fracture in the Cdk1osb−/− mice. Indeed, the Cdk1osb−/− mice treated with PTH showed a trend toward a higher bony union rate (50%) than non-PTH–treated Cdk1osb−/− mice (0%) (Fig. 6C). In addition, the mean gap size was significantly lower in the PTH group than in the non-PTH group (41.5 versus 172.2 μm in the non-PTH–treated Cdk1osb−/− mice; p < 0.05) (Fig. 6D). In this study, we investigated the roles of Cdks in bone formation. First, we showed that Cdk1 is expressed in bone and that its protein levels are down-regulated upon osteoblast differentiation. Then, we demonstrated that deletion of Cdk1 in osteoblasts leads to osteoporosis due to a reduced number of osteoblasts and low bone formation. Finally, we found that the bone-anabolic effect of PTH is achieved without promoting osteoblast proliferation in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Cdk1 in osteoblasts plays an important role in bone fracture repair. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate through in vivo osteoblast-specific loss-of-function experiments that Cdk1 has an important role in bone remodeling. Ovariectomized mice (hereafter, “ovx mice”) have been widely used as a mouse model of osteoporosis (13Takeda S. Elefteriou F. Levasseur R. Liu X. Zhao L. Parker K.L. Armstrong D. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Leptin regulates bone formation via the sympathetic nervous system.Cell. 2002; 111 (12419242): 305-31710.1016/S0092-8674(02)01049-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). In fact, ovx mice display low bone mass due to increased osteoclastogenesis, which reflects the characteristics of postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, this mouse model does not reflect the phenotype of age-related osteoporosis because in age-related osteoporosis, bone formation is reduced due to low osteoblast numbers (26Almeida M. Aging mechanisms in bone.Bonekey Rep. 2012; 1 (23705067): 102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that Cdk1 regulates osteoblast proliferation and that Cdk1 deletion results in osteoporosis that resembles the phenotype of age-related osteoporosis. Thus, the use of this mouse model may be beneficial for the establishment of new treatment strategies for age-related osteoporosis. Furthermore, deleting Cdk1 in osteoblasts impairs osteoblast proliferation without altering the number of osteoclasts or bone resorption (Fig. 2C). Thus, increasing Cdk1 activity in osteoblasts to promote their proliferation may enhance bone formation without affecting osteoclast parameters. Interestingly, Cdk1 expression is high in undifferentiated osteoblasts but low in mature osteoblasts. Inhibition of Cdk1 expression and/or activity promoted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited proliferation. These results suggest that Cdk1 functions to maintain osteoblasts in a proliferating state and to delay terminal differentiation, analogous to the function of Cdk1 in maintaining proliferation and self-renewal in mouse embryonic stem cells (27Zhang W.W. Zhang X.J. Liu H.X. Chen J. Ren Y.H. Huang D.G. Zou X.H. Xiao W. Cdk1 is required for the self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell. Biochem. 2011; 112 (21328468): 942-94810.1002/jcb.23010Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, down-regulation of Cdk1 expression in osteoblasts would be important for terminal osteoblast differentiation. However, the specific molecular mechanism responsible for down-regulating Cdk1 during osteoblast differentiation remains to be elucidated. Because Cdk1 is an E2F target gene (17Diril M.K. Ratnacaram C.K. Padmakumar V.C. Du T. Wasser M. Coppola V. Tessarollo L. Kaldis P. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) is essential for cell division and suppression of DNA re-replication but not for liver regeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Probe selection is vital to multicolor SMLM, as the fluorophores must not only exhibit minimal spectral crosstalk, but also be compatible with the same photochemical conditions that promote fluorophore photoswitching. While there are numerous commercially available photoswitchable fluorophores that are optimally excited in the standard Cy3 channel, they are restricted to short Stokes shifts (<30 nm), limiting the number of colors that can be resolved in a single sample. Furthermore, while imaging buffers have been thoroughly examined for commonly used fluorophore scaffolds including cyanine, rhodamine, and oxazine, optimal conditions have not been found for the BODIPY scaffold, precluding its routine use for multicolor SMLM. Herein, we screened common imaging buffer conditions including seven redox reagents with five additives, resulting in 35 overall imaging buffer conditions to identify compatible combinations for BODIPY-based fluorophores. We then demonstrated that novel, photoswitchable BODIPY-based fluorophores with varied length Stokes shifts provide additional color options for SMLM using a combination of BODIPY-based and commercially available photoswitchable fluorophores."

At 12 months after T-CNT exposure, alveolar inflammation with macrophage accumulation and hypertrophy of the alveolar walls were observed. In addition, fibrotic lesions were enhanced by T-CNT exposure.

We created eight hypothetical test profiles varying across six dichotomous attributes: cost (free vs. $4), potential for false positive syphilis result (no false positive vs. some risk of false positive), time-to-result (20 minutes vs. 1 week), blood draw method (finger prick vs. venipuncture), test type (rapid vs. laboratory), and number of draws (1 vs. 2). We fit a conjoint analysis model for each participant using a simple main effects ANOVA. Attribute importance values were calculated using percentages from relative ranges in the attribute's utility values. Results were summarized across participants and averages were reported.We recruited 415 MSM/transgender women over 18 years of age from two STD clinics in Lima, Peru. No potential for syphilis false positive result (no false positive vs. some potential for false positive) had the largest average impact on willingness to use the test and on average accounted for 23.8% of test type preference, followed by cost (free vs. ~USD$4; 21.6%), time to results (20 minutes vs. 1 week; 17.4%), number of blood draws (1 draw vs. 2 draws; 13.8%), method of blood draw (fingerprick vs. venipuncture; 13.7%), and test type (rapid POC vs. laboratory; 9.7%).MSM/transgender women in Peru prioritized accuracy, cost, timeliness and number of blood draws for HIV and syphilis testing. Implementing a low cost, accurate, rapid and dual testing strategy for HIV and syphilis could improve screening uptake and accessibility of testing to accelerate time to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2898939782,"There is a growing interest in the behavioural and life history mechanisms that allow animal species to cope with rapidly expanding urban habitats, which impose frequent proximity to humans. A particular case of behavioral bottleneck (i.e. conflicting interests) faced by animals in urban environments is how they will modulate the defence of their offspring against the potential danger represented by humans, an aspect that has received scarce research attention. We examined the nest defense against humans by a dense breeding population of a raptor, the Black Kite Milvus migrans, within the megacity of Delhi (India). Here, kites live on a diet dominated by human waste and meat offered through religiously motivated bird feeding practices. Nest defense levels increased with the number of offspring, and with the progression of the breeding season. Defense also intensified close to ritual-feeding areas and with increasing human waste in the streets, suggesting synergistic effects of food availability, parental investment, personality-boldness and habituation to humans, with consequent attenuation of fear. Thus, the behavioural response to a perceived threat reflected the spatial mosaic of activity of humans in the city streets, their cultural practices of ritual-feeding, and their waste-management. For synurbic species, at the higher-end spectrum of adaptation to an urban life, human cultural practices and attitudes may well be the most defining dimensions of their urban niche. Our results suggest that, after initial urban colonization, animals may continue to adapt to the typically complex, heterogeneous environments of cities through fine-grained behavioural adjustments to human practices and activities."

Animals were exposed for 12h to AgNP (< 50 nm) in the presence and absence of amantadine. Labeling of oxidative protein modifications, either thiol oxidation, carbonyl formation or both in two-dimensional electrophoresis separations revealed 16 differentially affected abundance spots. Amongst these, twelve hypothetical proteins were successfully identified by peptide mass fingerprinting (MALDI TOF-MS/MS). The proteins identified are involved in buffering redox status or in cytoprotection.

Lysosomal degradation and autophagy are major mechanisms that might be induced to mitigate NP toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2899207596,"Motivation Modern analytical techniques such as LC-MS, GC-MS and NMR are increasingly being used to study the underlying dynamics of biological systems by tracking changes in metabolite levels over time. Such techniques are capable of providing information on large numbers of metabolites simultaneously, a feature that is exploited in non-targeted studies. However, since the dynamics of specific metabolites are unlikely to be known a priori this presents an initial subjective challenge as to where the focus of the investigation should be. Whilst a number of feed-forward software tools are available for manipulation of metabolomic data, no tool centralizes on clustering and focus is typically directed by a workflow that is chosen in advance. Results We present an interactive approach to time-course analyses and a complementary implementation in a software package, MetaboClust. This is presented through the analysis of two LC-MS time-course case studies on plants (Medicago truncatula and Alopecurus myosuroides). We demonstrate a dynamic, user-centric workflow to clustering with intrinsic visual feedback at all stages of analysis. The software is used to apply data correction, generate the time-profiles, perform exploratory statistical analysis and assign tentative metabolite identifications. Clustering is used to group metabolites in an unbiased manner, allowing pathway analysis to score metabolic pathways, based on their overlap with clusters showing interesting trends."
https://openalex.org/W2899237282,"For over a century, it has been speculated that the vestibular system transmits information about self-motion to the striatum. There have been inconsistent reports of such a connection, and interest in the subject has been increased by the experimental use of galvanic vestibular stimulation in the treatment of Parkinson's Disease patients. Nonetheless, there are few data available on the effects of vestibular stimulation on neurochemical changes in the striatum. We used in vivo microdialysis to analyse changes in the extracellular levels of amino acids and monoamines in the rat striatum, following electrical vestibular stimulation. Stimulation caused a significant decrease in serine and threonine, compared to the no-stimulation controls (P ≤ 0.005 and P ≤ 0.01, respectively). The ratio of DOPAC:dopamine, decreased on the ipsilateral side following stimulation (P ≤ 0.005). There was a significant treatment x side x intensity interaction for taurine levels (P ≤ 0.002), due to a decrease on the contralateral side in stimulated animals, which varied as a function of current. These results show that peripheral vestibular stimulation causes some neurochemical changes in the striatum and support the view that activaton of the vestibular system exerts effects on the function of the striatum."
https://openalex.org/W2898712867,"Low levels of physical activity are associated with increased mortality risk, especially in cardiac patients, but most studies are based on self-report. Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) offer an opportunity to collect data for longer periods of time. However, there is limited agreement on the best approaches for quantification of activity measures due to the time series nature of the data. We examined physical activity time series data from 235 subjects with CIEDs and at least 365 days of uninterrupted measures. Summary statistics for raw daily physical activity (minutes/day), including statistical moments (e.g., mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis), time series regression coefficients, frequency domain components, and forecasted predicted values, were calculated for each individual, and used to predict occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) events as recorded by the device. In unsupervised analyses using principal component analysis, we found that while certain features tended to cluster near each other, most provided a reasonable spread across activity space without a large degree of redundancy. In supervised analyses, we found several features that were associated with the outcome (P < 0.05) in univariable and multivariable approaches, but few were consistent across models. Using a machine-learning approach in which the data was split into training and testing sets, and models ranging in complexity from simple univariable logistic regression to ensemble decision trees were fit, there was no improvement in classification of risk over naive methods for any approach. Although standard approaches identified summary features of physical activity data that were correlated with risk of VT, machine-learning approaches found that none of these features provided an improvement in classification. Future studies are needed to explore and validate methods for feature extraction and machine learning in classification of VT risk based on device-measured activity."
https://openalex.org/W2899127692,"ISO 14243 is the governing standard for wear testing of knee prostheses, but there is controversy over the correct direction of anterior-posterior (AP) displacement and loading and the correct direction of tibial rotation (TR) angles and torque. This study aimed to analyze how altering the direction of AP and TR affected wear on the tibial insert. Modifications to the conditions specified in ISO 14243–1 and ISO 14243–3 were also proposed. As such, five loading conditions were applied to FEA models of a knee prosthesis: (1) Modified ISO 14243–3 with positive AP displacement and TR angle, (2) ISO 14243–3:2004 with negative AP displacement and positive TR angle, (3) ISO 14243–3:2014 with positive AP displacement and negative TR angle, (4) Modified ISO 14243–1 with positive AP load and TR torque, and (5) ISO 14243–1:2009 with negative AP load and positive TR torque. This study found that changing the input directions for AP and TR according to ISO 14243–1 and 14243–3 had an influence on the wear rate and wear contours on the tibial insert model. However, the extent of wear varies depending on the design features of the tibial insert and shape of the input curves. For displacement control according to ISO 14243–3, changing the direction of AP displacement had a marked influence on the wear rate (272.77%), but changing the direction of TR angle had a much lower impact (2.17%). For load control according to ISO 14243–1, reversing the AP load (ISO 14243–1:2009) only increased the wear rate by 6.73% in comparison to the modified ISO 14243–1 conditions. The clinical relevance of this study is that the results demonstrate that tibial wear is affected by the direction of application of AP and TR. Incorrect application of the loading conditions during the design stage may lead to an ineffective preclinical evaluation and could subsequently influence implant longevity in clinical use."

Based on transcriptional data of different infection time points, we found 23, 782 and 23, 718 differentially expressed genes (fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million, FPKM >1) in Jiangcheng 3A (resistant to T. horrida) and 9311A (susceptible to T. horrida), respectively. In order to illuminate the differential responses of the two rice male sterile lines to T. horrida, we identified gene co-expression modules using the method of weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and compared the different biological functions of gene co-expression networks in key modules at different infection time points. The results indicated that gene co-expression networks in the two rice genotypes were different and that genes contained in some modules of the two groups may play important roles in resistance to T. horrida, such as DTH8 and OsHop/Sti1a. Furthermore, these results provide a global view of the responses of two different phenotypes to T. horrida, and assist our understanding of the regulation of expression changes after T. horrida infection."
https://openalex.org/W2899049596,"Recent studies on murine models have demonstrated the potential of dark field (DF) x-ray imaging for lung diseases. The alveolar microstructure causes small angle scattering, which is visualised in DF images. Whether DF imaging works for human lungs is not a priori guaranteed as human alveoli are larger and system settings for murine imaging will probably have to be adapted. This work examines the potential of translating DF imaging to human lungs. The DF contrast due to murine and human lung models was studied using numerical wave propagation simulations, where the lungs were modelled as a volume filled with spheres. Three sphere diameters were used: 39, 60 and 80 μm for the murine model and 200, 300 and 400 μm spheres for the human model. System settings applied for murine lung response modelling were taken from a prototype grating interferometry scanner used in murine lung experiments. The settings simulated for human lung imaging simulations combine the requirements for grating interferometry and conventional chest RX in terms of x-ray energy and pixel size. The DF signal in the simulated murine model was consistent with results from experimental DF data. The simulated linear diffusion coefficient for medium alveoli diameters was found to be (1.31±0.01)⋅10-11 mm-1, 120 times larger than those of human lung tissue ((1.09±0.01)⋅10-13 mm-1). However, as the human thorax is typically a factor 15 times larger than that of murine animals, the overall DF effect in human lungs remains substantial. At the largest lung thickness and for the DF setup simulated, human lungs have an estimated DF response of around 0.31 and murine lungs of 0.23. Dark field imaging can therefore be considered a promising modality for use in human lung imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2899180864,"Regulation of developmental gene expression in eukaryotes involves several levels. One of them is the maintenance of gene expression along the life of the animal once it is started by different triggers early in development. One of the questions in the field is when in developmental time, the animal start to use the different maintenance mechanisms. The trithorax group (TrxG) of genes was first characterized as essential for maintaining homeotic gene expression. The TrxG gene tonalli interacts genetically and physically with genes and subunits of the BRAHMA BAP chromatin remodeling complex and encodes TnaA proteins with putative E3 SUMO-ligase activity. In contrast to the phenocritic lethal phase of animals with mutations in other TrxG genes, tna mutant individuals die late in development. In this study we determined the requirements of TnaA for survival at pupal and adult stages, in different tna mutant genotypes where we corroborate the lack of TnaA proteins, and the presence of adult homeotic loss-of-function phenotypes. We also investigated whether the absence of TnaA in haltere and leg larval imaginal discs affects the presence of the homeotic proteins Ultrabithorax and Sex combs reduced respectively by using some of the characterized genotypes and more finely by generating TnaA defective clones induced at different stages of development. We found that, tna is not required for growth or survival of imaginal disc cells and that it is a fine modulator of homeotic gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2949573220,"Approximately one-third of U.S. life sciences faculty engage in industry consulting. Despite reports that consulting contracts often impinge on faculty and university interests, institutional approaches to regulating consulting agreements are largely unknown.To investigate the nature of institutional oversight of faculty consulting contracts at U.S. schools of medicine and public health.Structured telephone interviews with institutional administrators. Questions included the nature of oversight for faculty consulting agreements, if any, and views about consulting as a private versus institutional matter. Interviews were analyzed using a structured coding scheme.All accredited schools of medicine and public health in the U.S.Administrators responsible for faculty affairs were identified via internet searches and telephone and email follow-up. The 118 administrators interviewed represented 73% of U.S. schools of medicine and public health, and 75% of those invited to participate.Structured, 15-30 minute telephone interviews.Prevalence and type of institutional oversight; responses to concerning provisions in consulting agreements; perceptions of institutional oversight.One third of institutions (36%) required faculty to submit at least some agreements for institutional review and 36% reviewed contracts upon request, while 35% refused to review contracts. Among institutions with review, there was wide variation the issues covered. The most common topic was intellectual property rights (64%), while only 23% looked at publication rights and 19% for inappropriately broad confidentiality provisions. Six in ten administrators reported they had no power to prevent faculty from signing consulting agreements. Although most respondents identified institutional risks from consulting relationships, many maintained that consulting agreements are ""private.""Oversight of faculty consulting agreements at U.S. schools of medicine and public health is inconsistent across institutions and usually not robust. The interests at stake suggest the need for stronger oversight."

During nutrient shortage, autophagy enables the recycling of major cellular components to prevent cell death. Understanding the mechanisms that trigger and control autophagy is of fundamental importance, as this degradative pathway plays a pivotal role in many diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2898719818,"Background UNAIDS estimates global HIV investment needs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) at $26 billion per year in 2020. Yet international financing for HIV programs has stagnated amidst despite the increasing number of people requiring and accessing treatment. Despite increased efficiencies in HIV service delivery, evaluating programs for greater efficiencies remains necessary. While HIV budgets have been under scrutiny in recent years, indirect costs have not been quantified for any major global HIV program, but may constitute an additional avenue to identify program efficiencies. This analysis presents a method for estimating indirect costs in the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Methods Utilizing PEPFAR country operational plan (COP) funding data from 2007 to 2016 for international organizations (IOs) and universities and standard regulatory cost bases, we calculated modified total direct costs on which indirect cost rates may be applied by partner and funding agency. We then apply a series of plausible indirect cost rates (10%–36.28%) to develop a range for total indirect costs that have accrued over the period. Findings Of $37.01 billion in total COP funding between 2007 and 2016, $22.24 billion (60.08%) was identifiably allocated to IOs ($17.95B) and universities ($4.29B). After excluding funding for sub-awards ($1.92B) and other expenses ($3.89B) to which indirect rates cannot be applied, $16.44B remained in combined direct and indirect costs. From this, we estimate that between $1.85B (8.30% of total international partner funding) and $4.34B (19.51%) has been spent on indirect costs from 2007–2016, including $157-$369 million in 2016. Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first analysis to quantify the indirect costs of major implementing partners of a global HIV funder. However, lack of transparency in the indirect cost rates of non-University international partners creates an opaque layer of programmatic costs. Given the current funding environment and evolution of HIV programming in PEPFAR countries, the findings motivate a re-examination of the current policies and the return on investment in indirect cost recovery across the PEPFAR program."
https://openalex.org/W2899251453,"The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend intra-access flow (Qa) measurement as the preferred vascular access surveillance method over static intra-access pressure ratio (SIAPR). Recently, it has become possible to perform Qa measurement during hemodialysis using thermodilution method called blood temperature monitoring (BTM) with the Twister device. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between Qa by BTM and SIAPR and to compare the performance of two tests in prediction of vascular access stenosis.The study was performed from January 2016 to November 2017 and included 97 patients with arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). Qa by BTM and SIAPR were simultaneously measured every 1~3 months with a total of 449 measurements during study period.In our study population, mean age was 59.9±10.0 years and 61.9% were diabetes. The mean Qa obtained by BTM was 1186±588 mL/min. There was no correlation between Qa by BTM and venous SIAPR (r = 0.061, P = 0.196). Angiography identified 36 stenotic AVFs (37.1%) among the study subjects. They included 13 cases with only inflow stenosis, 6 with only outflow stenosis, and 17 with stenosis on both sides. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that Qa by BTM had higher discriminative ability to diagnose vascular access stenosis compared to SIAPR (P <0.001). The Qa less than 583 mL/min showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in vascular stenosis prediction.Intradialytic measurement of Qa by BTM showed better diagnostic power over venous SIAPR in prediction of vascular access stenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2899183889,"We herein examined the importance of H2-Eb1 and H2-Ab1 in the susceptibility of mice to allergic rhinitis (AR) by developing double-gene (H2-Eb1+H2-Ab1) knockout mice. The mice were randomly grouped into different sensitization and excitation treatments, then their behavioral scores; nasal mucosa HE staining; thymus tissue toluidine blue staining; levels of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific IgE, IL-2 and IL-13 in the serum; and expression of IL-2 and IL-13 in the nasal mucosa were observed. H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 were both successfully knocked out in the study group (KO-OVA). Compared with the control group (WT-OVA), the nasal mucosal tissue in the KO-OVA mice showed fewer histological changes, reduced numbers of eosinophilic granulocytes, fewer mast cells in the thymus tissue, reduced concentrations of OVA-specific IgE and IL-13 in the serum, and reduced expression of IL-13 in the nasal mucosa. The behavior of the mice was also improved. In addition, the IL-2 concentration in the serum and IL-2 expression in the nasal mucosa were increased. There were two important findings of this study: (1) The H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 double knockout model of allergic rhinitis was successfully constructed, and the Th1/Th2 cell factors were in imbalance in these mice compared to WT mice; (2) the AR susceptibility of the dual knockout mice was reduced, confirming that H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 contribute to allergic rhinitis, at least in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2898895831,"Population size estimation is relevant to social and ecological sciences. Exhaustive manual counting, the density method and automated computer vision are some of the estimation methods that are currently used. Some of these methods may work in concrete cases but they do not provide a fast, efficient and unbiased estimation in general. Recently, the CountEm method, based on systematic sampling with a grid of quadrats, was proposed. It offers an unbiased estimation that can be applied to any population. However, choosing suitable grid parameters is sometimes cumbersome. Here we define a more intuitive grid parametrization, using initial number of quadrats and sampling fraction. A crowd counting dataset with 51 images and their corresponding, manually annotated position point patterns, are used to analyze the variation of the coefficient of error with respect to different parameter choices. Our Monte Carlo resampling results show that the error depends on the sample size and the number of nonempty quadrats, but not on the size of the target population. A procedure to choose suitable parameter values is described, and the expected coefficients of error are given. Counting about 100 particles in 30 nonempty quadrats usually yields coefficients of error below 10%."
https://openalex.org/W2899382890,"The aim of this study was to validate the possibility of using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in cerebral blood flow in response to a hand being placed on a participant's back, and to identify the areas of enhanced activity in the brain. Nineteen female adult volunteers participated in the study. An experienced school nurse touched the center of the participant's back between the shoulder blades with the palm of her hand. Cerebral blood volume dynamics were measured with a 52-channel fNIRS system. Significantly higher oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration levels were recorded by channels 11, 14, 21, 22, 24, 32, 35, 45, 46, and 49 during the touching period than during the resting period. These channels indicated enhanced activity in the supramarginal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus, and the inferior frontal gyrus. The ability to detect changes in cerebral blood flow using this method indicates the possibility of measuring changes in cerebral blood flow using fNIRS when a person is touched on the back. fNIRS has been shown to be useful for studying the effects of touch."
https://openalex.org/W2899489094,"Society is aging worldwide. To promote the health and quality of life in elderly people, we must find a way to enhance and improve cognitive function, especially inhibitory function that suppresses inappropriate behaviors. Previous studies have indicated that warm-up cognitive activities enhanced the activation of appropriate behavior. As with the activation of appropriate behavior, inhibitory function is expected to be enhanced by a warm-up activity, although this theory has not yet been directly tested. Here, we investigated whether inhibitory function in a task was enhanced by a warm-up activity. We used a Navon task as a warm-up activity, in which reading small letters (local Navon task) required inhibitory function more than reading a large letter (global Navon task). The Stroop task was used as the subsequent task. Our results showed that the accuracy of the Stroop task after the local Navon task was higher than after the global Navon task. This outcome suggests that inhibitory function in the Stroop task was enhanced by the local Navon task, which was an inhibitory warm-up cognitive activity. Moreover, this study contributes to the development of new techniques of cognitive training to prevent the decline in inhibitory function during aging or other clinical scenarios, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)."
