https://openalex.org/W2949693884,"The mammalian nervous system executes complex behaviors controlled by specialized, precisely positioned, and interacting cell types. Here, we used RNA sequencing of half a million single cells to create a detailed census of cell types in the mouse nervous system. We mapped cell types spatially and derived a hierarchical, data-driven taxonomy. Neurons were the most diverse and were grouped by developmental anatomical units and by the expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Neuronal diversity was driven by genes encoding cell identity, synaptic connectivity, neurotransmission, and membrane conductance. We discovered seven distinct, regionally restricted astrocyte types that obeyed developmental boundaries and correlated with the spatial distribution of key glutamate and glycine neurotransmitters. In contrast, oligodendrocytes showed a loss of regional identity followed by a secondary diversification. The resource presented here lays a solid foundation for understanding the molecular architecture of the mammalian nervous system and enables genetic manipulation of specific cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2885927965,"The mammalian brain is composed of diverse, specialized cell populations. To systematically ascertain and learn from these cellular specializations, we used Drop-seq to profile RNA expression in 690,000 individual cells sampled from 9 regions of the adult mouse brain. We identified 565 transcriptionally distinct groups of cells using computational approaches developed to distinguish biological from technical signals. Cross-region analysis of these 565 cell populations revealed features of brain organization, including a gene-expression module for synthesizing axonal and presynaptic components, patterns in the co-deployment of voltage-gated ion channels, functional distinctions among the cells of the vasculature and specialization of glutamatergic neurons across cortical regions. Systematic neuronal classifications for two complex basal ganglia nuclei and the striatum revealed a rare population of spiny projection neurons. This adult mouse brain cell atlas, accessible through interactive online software (DropViz), serves as a reference for development, disease, and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2885650843,"Cancer immunotherapies have shown substantial clinical activity for a subset of patients with epithelial cancers. Still, technological platforms to study cancer T-cell interactions for individual patients and understand determinants of responsiveness are presently lacking. Here, we establish and validate a platform to induce and analyze tumor-specific T cell responses to epithelial cancers in a personalized manner. We demonstrate that co-cultures of autologous tumor organoids and peripheral blood lymphocytes can be used to enrich tumor-reactive T cells from peripheral blood of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these T cells can be used to assess the efficiency of killing of matched tumor organoids. This platform provides an unbiased strategy for the isolation of tumor-reactive T cells and provides a means by which to assess the sensitivity of tumor cells to T cell-mediated attack at the level of the individual patient."
https://openalex.org/W2886131798,"The efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy against poorly responding tumors can be enhanced by administering the cells in combination with immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors. Alternatively, the CAR construct has been engineered to coexpress factors that boost CAR-T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. We modified CAR-T cells to secrete PD-1-blocking single-chain variable fragments (scFv). These scFv-secreting CAR-T cells acted in both a paracrine and autocrine manner to improve the anti-tumor activity of CAR-T cells and bystander tumor-specific T cells in clinically relevant syngeneic and xenogeneic mouse models of PD-L1+ hematologic and solid tumors. The efficacy was similar to or better than that achieved by combination therapy with CAR-T cells and a checkpoint inhibitor. This approach may improve safety, as the secreted scFvs remained localized to the tumor, protecting CAR-T cells from PD-1 inhibition, which could potentially avoid toxicities associated with systemic checkpoint inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2887506329,"Recent sequencing analyses have shed light on heterogeneous patterns of genomic aberrations in human gastric cancers (GCs). To explore how individual genetic events translate into cancer phenotypes, we established a biological library consisting of genetically engineered gastric organoids carrying various GC mutations and 37 patient-derived organoid lines, including rare genomically stable GCs. Phenotype analyses of GC organoids revealed divergent genetic and epigenetic routes to gain Wnt and R-spondin niche independency. An unbiased phenotype-based genetic screening identified a significant association between CDH1/TP53 compound mutations and the R-spondin independency that was functionally validated by CRISPR-based knockout. Xenografting of GC organoids further established the feasibility of Wnt-targeting therapy for Wnt-dependent GCs. Our results collectively demonstrate that multifaceted genetic abnormalities render human GCs independent of the stem cell niche and highlight the validity of the genotype-phenotype screening strategy in gaining deeper understanding of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2886850841,"Engineering microorganisms for production of fuels and chemicals often requires major re-programming of metabolism to ensure high flux toward the product of interest. This is challenging, as millions of years of evolution have resulted in establishment of tight regulation of metabolism for optimal growth in the organism's natural habitat. Here, we show through metabolic engineering that it is possible to alter the metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from traditional ethanol fermentation to a pure lipogenesis metabolism, resulting in high-level production of free fatty acids. Through metabolic engineering and process design, we altered subcellular metabolic trafficking, fine-tuned NADPH and ATP supply, and decreased carbon flux to biomass, enabling production of 33.4 g/L extracellular free fatty acids. We further demonstrate that lipogenesis metabolism can replace ethanol fermentation by deletion of pyruvate decarboxylase enzymes followed by adaptive laboratory evolution. Genome sequencing of evolved strains showed that pyruvate kinase mutations were essential for this phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2887301398,"The urea cycle (UC) is the main pathway by which mammals dispose of waste nitrogen. We find that specific alterations in the expression of most UC enzymes occur in many tumors, leading to a general metabolic hallmark termed ""UC dysregulation"" (UCD). UCD elicits nitrogen diversion toward carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydrooratase (CAD) activation and enhances pyrimidine synthesis, resulting in detectable changes in nitrogen metabolites in both patient tumors and their bio-fluids. The accompanying excess of pyrimidine versus purine nucleotides results in a genomic signature consisting of transversion mutations at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. This mutational bias is associated with increased numbers of hydrophobic tumor antigens and a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors independent of mutational load. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that UCD is a common feature of tumors that profoundly affects carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and immunotherapy response."

Our international consortium systematically evaluated antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) using multidisciplinary assays. For each antibody, we evaluated epitopes recognized on the viral surface glycoprotein (GP) and secreted glycoprotein (sGP), readouts of multiple neutralization assays, fraction of virions left un-neutralized, glycan structures, phagocytic and natural killer cell functions elicited, and in vivo protection in a mouse challenge model. Neutralization and induction of multiple immune effector functions (IEFs) correlated most strongly with protection. Neutralization predominantly occurred via epitopes maintained on endosomally cleaved GP, whereas maximal IEF mapped to epitopes farthest from the viral membrane. Unexpectedly, sGP cross-reactivity did not significantly influence in vivo protection. This comprehensive dataset provides a rubric to evaluate novel antibodies and vaccine responses and a roadmap for therapeutic development for EBOV and related viruses.

This comprehensive dataset provides a rubric to evaluate novel antibodies and vaccine responses and a roadmap for therapeutic development for EBOV and related viruses. Unexpected viral disease outbreaks, such as Ebola virus disease, underscore the need for effective vaccines and therapies. Antibodies are a primary correlate of protection of most approved vaccines and can serve as pre- or post-exposure treatment strategies. Although antibody-mediated neutralization of virus in cell culture is commonly used to predict in vivo antiviral protection, non-neutralizing, but cell-targeting antibodies also confer in vivo protection (Henry Dunand et al., 2016Henry Dunand C.J.

Understanding which antibody features correlate with protection in vivo could accelerate discovery and provision of protective therapeutics. The surface glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus (EBOV) is the key component of vaccines and target of neutralizing antibodies. In producer cells, furin cleaves GP to yield GP1 and GP2 (Sanchez et al., 1998Sanchez A. Yang Z.Y. Xu L. Nabel G.J. Crews T. Peters C.J. Biochemical analysis of the secreted and virion glycoproteins of Ebola virus.J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6442-6447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which form a trimer of GP1-GP2 heterodimers on the viral surface (Lee et al., 2008Lee J.E. Fusco M.L. Hessell A.J. Oswald W.B. Burton D.R. Saphire E.O. Structure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein bound to an antibody from a human survivor.Nature. 2008; 454: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). GP1 bears the receptor-binding site, glycan cap, and mucin-like domain. GP2 bears an N-terminal peptide, internal fusion loop, stalk, and transmembrane domain (Lee et al., 2008Lee J.E. Fusco M.L. Hessell A.J. Oswald W.B. Burton D.R. Saphire E.O. Structure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein bound to an antibody from a human survivor.Nature. 2008; 454: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). After internalization of virions into target cells, host cathepsins (Chandran et al., 2005Chandran K. Sullivan N.J. Felbor U. Whelan S.P. Cunningham J.M.

Virol. 2009; 83: 2883-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). After receptor binding, GP2 rearranges to form a six-helix bundle that promotes membrane fusion. During Ebola virus infection the primary product of the GP gene is secreted GP (sGP), a soluble dimer that lacks GP2 and the mucin-like domain but shares 295 amino acids of GP1 (Sanchez et al., 1996Sanchez A. Trappier S.G. Mahy B.W. Peters C.J. Nichol S.T. The virion glycoproteins of Ebola viruses are encoded in two reading frames and are expressed through transcriptional editing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Previous studies described monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target various sites on GP and sGP, including the “base,” comprising both GP1 and GP2, the GP2 fusion loop and stalk (HR2), and the GP1 receptor-binding head, glycan cap and mucin-like domain (Audet et al., 2014Audet J.

Antibodies recognizing the GP1 head and glycan cap also bind sGP. The mechanistic basis for differences in neutralization and in vivo protection among mAbs is unclear.

KZ52 monotherapy failed to protect non-human primates (NHPs) (Oswald et al., 2007Oswald W.B. Geisbert T.W. Davis K.J. Geisbert J.B. Sullivan N.J. Jahrling P.B. Parren P.W.H.I. Burton D.R. Neutralizing antibody fails to impact the course of Ebola virus infection in monkeys.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e9Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), but a cocktail of 2G4 and 4G7 and the weakly neutralizing, partially protective, GP/sGP cross-reactive mAb 13C6 protected NHPs (Qiu et al., 2014Qiu X. Wong G. Audet J. Bello A. Fernando L. Alimonti J.B. Fausther-Bovendo H. Wei H. Aviles J. Hiatt E. et al.Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp.Nature. 2014; 514: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The cocktail MB-003 has only non- and weakly neutralizing antibodies that target glycan cap or mucin epitopes, but it provided protection to NHPs (Olinger et al., 2012Olinger Jr., G.G. Pettitt J.

USA. 2012; 109: 18030-18035Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Further, mAb 114, recognizing both GP and sGP, protected NHPs as a monotherapy (Corti et al., 2016Corti D. Misasi J. Mulangu S. Stanley D.A. Kanekiyo M. Wollen S. Ploquin A. Doria-Rose N.A. Staupe R.P. Bailey M. et al.Protective monotherapy against lethal Ebola virus infection by a potently neutralizing antibody.Science. 2016; 351: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). What features beyond epitope recognition and neutralization associate with protection remain unclear, as is whether single mAbs or cocktails provide optimal therapeutic benefit and the extent to which cross-reactive protection is possible. Further, neutralization capacity differs among assays. Better understanding of features that confer protection, what assays best predict survival, and what combinations of antibody features provide optimal protection could streamline selection of effective treatments. In 2013 the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Immunotherapeutic Consortium (VIC) began gathering antibodies to EBOV and other viruses and analyzing them under identical assay conditions to understand, from a more statistically well-powered pool, which antibodies are best and why (Saphire et al., 2017Saphire E.O. Dye J.M. Kobinger G.P. Zeitlin L. Chandran K. Garry R.F. How to turn competitors into collaborators.Nature. 2017; 541: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A parallel goal was to evaluate the assays themselves to determine which in vitro tests and measurable antibody features best predict in vivo efficacy. The 171 mAbs analyzed included murine mAbs raised by immunization, chimeric mAbs, and human survivor mAbs from the 1995 EBOV, 2007 Bundibugyo (BDBV), and 2013-2016 EBOV outbreaks.

The study results describe relationships between epitopes recognized on EBOV GP and antibody functions and inform strategies for recognition and development of effective antibody-based therapeutics to treat infection. We analyzed 171 mAbs donated by 16 investigators for isotype, species, and EBOV GP reactivity. A total of 168 mAbs were analyzed after elimination of 3 mAbs that had low sample quality or GP purification tag reactivity. The sample pool included 102 human mAbs (94 IgG1, 1 IgG3, 5 chimerized to IgG1, 2 undetermined) and 66 murine mAbs (20 IgG1, 37 IgG2a, 8 IgG2b, 1 IgG3) (Figure S1). We first assessed ELISA reactivity of the mAbs to different forms of recombinant EBOV GP and sGP (Mayinga), including: (1) GP ectodomain (GPΔTM, referred to below as GP), (2) mucin-deleted ectodomain (GPΔmuc), (3) thermolysin-cleaved GP (GPCL, mimicking cathepsin-primed GP), (4) GP bearing a Q508R escape mutation (Audet et al., 2014Audet J. Wong G. Wang H. Lu G. Gao G.F. Kobinger G. Qiu X. Molecular characterization of the monoclonal antibodies composing ZMAb: a protective cocktail against Ebola virus.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and (5) sGP (Figure 1A). A total of 79 mAbs had sGP cross-reactivity, of which 39 bind the glycan cap and 40 the GP1 core. The other 89 had epitopes distributed across the mucin-like domain, the “base” and GPCL core regions. ELISA reactivity was insufficient to map epitopes for 30 mAbs, but 8 (1 base, 2 glycan cap, 2 HR2, and 3 fusion loop binding mAbs) were resolved using single particle electron microscopy and alanine scanning (Figures 1, S1, and Table S1). After refinement, nine epitope classes were defined: mucin-like domain, glycan cap, GP1 head, GP1/GP2 trimer base, GP1 Core, GP1/2, fusion loop, HR2 stalk, and unknown binding sites (Figures 1E and 1F). Disparities in previous antibody-mediated neutralization results could be due to differing experimental conditions and model systems (Davidson et al., 2015Davidson E. Bryan C. Fong R.H. Barnes T.

USA. 2008; 105: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); and (3) authentic EBOV (Figure 2) performed under BSL-2+, BSL-3, and BSL-4 containment, respectively, as previously described, to ensure consistency with previous studies. Of the 168 mAbs, 96 registered as consistent non-neutralizers (no neutralization e.g., VIC 1, Figure 2A), 45 as consistent neutralizers (neutralize in every assay to some degree, e.g., VIC 8), and 27 as inconsistent neutralizers (neutralize in only some assays, e.g., VIC 12). Of the 27 inconsistent neutralizers, 12 varied by a smaller degree (moderate to non-neutralizing, e.g., VIC 104 in HR2), while 15 varied by a larger degree (potent to non- neutralizing, e.g., VIC 5 in glycan cap). Inconsistent neutralizers varied among the experimental systems in both degree of neutralization and which model system was neutralized. Thus, mAb selection using a single neutralization assay is a functional but imperfect funnel. Several trends emerged. The authentic EBOV assay was more forgiving: 15 mAbs neutralized only EBOV. ΔVP30 was more stringent: 11 mAbs neutralized EBOV and rVSV, but not ΔVP30 (Figure 2A). Interestingly, these 11 left a larger (2%–40%; median 20%) un-neutralized viral fraction in rVSV (Figure 2A), which could indicate low binding affinity or an epitope heterogeneous in conformation or glycosylation state. This heterogeneity in antigenic presentation may underlie previously observed differences among neutralization assay results for the same mAb and could be an important component in selecting therapeutic mAbs. Neutralization by glycan cap mAbs in particular differed between authentic EBOV and the two model systems. Among mAbs that only neutralize authentic EBOV, 9/15 recognize the glycan cap (Figure 2A). Further, for authentic EBOV, the mean neutralization value for glycan cap mAbs was significantly higher than that of mucin, GP1/2, and unknown epitopes (Figures 2B–2E). An important difference among the three neutralization assays was the presence of sGP. The rVSV system is engineered to prevent sGP expression, but ΔVP30 and authentic EBOV assays express wild-type sGP levels (Volchkov et al., 1995Volchkov V.E. Becker S. Volchkova V.A. Ternovoj V.A. Kotov A.N. Netesov S.V. Klenk H.D. GP mRNA of Ebola virus is edited by the Ebola virus polymerase and by T7 and vaccinia virus polymerases.Virology. 1995; 214: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). As such, we expected sGP-reactive mAbs (e.g., glycan cap) to exhibit stronger neutralization in the rVSV assay. Paradoxically, only 2/43 glycan cap antibodies (VIC 5 and 81) had stronger neutralization in rVSV, whereas 11/43 had weaker rVSV neutralization than in sGP-containing assays. For mAbs against GP1, neutralization potency varied by the GP1 region recognized. Only 1/20 mucin mAbs neutralized in any assay. In contrast, 5/6 mAbs against the GP1 head, near the receptor-binding site, neutralized. Glycan cap mAbs were more variable: 21/43 were non-neutralizing and 9/43 had strong or moderate activity in all assays (Figure 2). mAbs against GP2-containing epitopes typically had high neutralizing activity: 26/30 showed strong neutralizing activity in at least two assays. Overall, mAbs recognizing the GP1 head, fusion loop, base, and HR2 present in GPCL were more likely to neutralize than mAbs targeting GP regions removed by enzymatic cleavage (Figure 2). mAbs having undefined epitopes did not neutralize well: 19/22 of unknown epitope and 12/15 mAbs in the GP1/2 class (bind GPCL, but could not be assigned as base, fusion, or stalk), did not neutralize at all. In natural infection, abundant sGP could limit effective neutralization of circulating virus by sGP-cross-reactive antibodies (Ilinykh et al., 2016Ilinykh P.A. Shen X. Flyak A.I. Kuzmina N. Ksiazek T.G. Crowe Jr., J.E. Bukreyev A. Chimeric Filoviruses for Identification and Characterization of Monoclonal Antibodies.J.

Antigenic subversion: a novel mechanism of host immune evasion by Ebola virus.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1003065Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (Figure 2). However, as mentioned above, we typically saw equivalent or weaker relative neutralization in rVSV relative to the sGP-containing ΔVP30 and EBOV assays. Further, the sGP-cross reactive glycan cap group constitutes the majority of the discordant antibodies that did not neutralize rVSV at all, but did neutralize in the sGP-containing authentic EBOV assay. Thus, the presence of sGP does not itself appear to be detrimental to neutralization of sGP-reactive mAbs. We next assessed whether each of the 168 mAbs could confer protection to BALB/c mice inoculated with mouse-adapted Ebola virus (ma-EBOV; Mayinga variant) (Bray et al., 1998Bray M. Davis K. Geisbert T. Schmaljohn C. Huggins J. A mouse model for evaluation of prophylaxis and therapy of Ebola hemorrhagic fever.J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Groups of 10 mice each received one 100 μg mAb dose two days after challenge with ma-EBOV. Protection levels of 60%–100%, 40%–50%, and <40% were seen for 49, 16, and 103 mAbs, respectively (Figure 3, S3, Table S2).Figure S2Neutralization of rVSV-EBOV by Epitope Class, Related to Figure 2Show full captionMean ± SD for three replicates are shown.

Among mAbs with assigned epitopes, 16/69 GP1-reactive and 21/30 GP2-reactive mAbs protected to ≥ 60%. Among GP1-containing epitopes, 5/6 GP1/Head, 9/32 GP1/core, 10/43 glycan cap, and 1/20 mucin-like domain mAbs conferred ≥ 60% protection (Figures 3A and S3). Of GP2-containing epitopes, 6/8 fusion loop, 10/14 base, and 6/8 HR2 conferred ≥ 60% protection.

We took advantage of the concept of lethal dose 50 (LD50) to ask which component of individual non-genetic variation between hosts defines whether they survive or succumb to infection. Using the enteric pathogen Citrobacter, we found no difference in pathogen burdens between healthy and symptomatic populations. Iron metabolism-related genes were induced in asymptomatic hosts compared to symptomatic or naive mice. Dietary iron conferred complete protection without influencing pathogen burdens, even at 1000× the lethal dose of Citrobacter. Dietary iron induced insulin resistance, increasing glucose levels in the intestine that were necessary and sufficient to suppress pathogen virulence. A short course of dietary iron drove the selection of attenuated Citrobacter strains that can transmit and asymptomatically colonize naive hosts, demonstrating that environmental factors and cooperative metabolic strategies can drive conversion of pathogens toward commensalism."

Synaptic junctions as modifiable functional units play an essential role in information processing in the brain. Neurexin (Nrx) synaptic organizing proteins are thought to be central effectors of synaptic properties that shape the activity of neural circuits (Südhof, 2017Südhof T.C. Synaptic Neurexin Complexes: A Molecular Code for the Logic of Neural Circuits.Cell. 2017; 171: 745-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The most well-known ligand for Nrx is neuroligin (NL). Together, Nrx and NL recruit proteins to developing synapses and promote multiple aspects of synapse assembly, maturation, and plasticity (Krueger et al., 2012Krueger D.D. Tuffy L.P. Papadopoulos T.

Nrxn and Nlgn genes function in overlapping patterns in essentially all brain circuits and are necessary for mouse survival (Missler et al., 2003Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G.

Considerable heterogeneity contributes to functional selectivity of different Nrx-NL complexes. Mammals have 3 Nrx genes, each of which uses two promoters to generate longer α and shorter β forms, and 6 sites of alternative splicing to generate altogether >1,500 forms (Südhof, 2017Südhof T.C.

Targeted combinatorial alternative splicing generates brain region-specific repertoires of neurexins.Neuron. 2014; 84: 386-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). There are 4 NL genes in mice and 5 in humans, also regulated by alternative splicing, with NL1 selective for excitatory glutamatergic and NL2 selective for inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic synapses (Krueger et al., 2012Krueger D.D. Tuffy L.P. Papadopoulos T. Brose N. The role of neurexins and neuroligins in the formation, maturation, and function of vertebrate synapses.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 412-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nrx also acts through postsynaptic partners other than NLs, primarily LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 (Roppongi et al., 2017Roppongi R.T. Karimi B. Siddiqui T.J. Role of LRRTMs in synapse development and plasticity.Neurosci. Res. 2017; 116: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as well as Cbln1-Gluδ2 in cerebellum (Uemura et al., 2010Uemura T. Lee S.J. Yasumura M. Takeuchi T. Yoshida T. Ra M. Taguchi R.

These interactions of Nrx with postsynaptic ligands are thought to be mediated purely by protein domains. The peptide interaction mode between Nrx and NL is well accepted based on crystal structures and mutagenesis studies from multiple labs (Bourne and Marchot, 2014Bourne Y. Marchot P. The neuroligins and their ligands: from structure to function at the synapse.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2014; 53: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The acetylcholinesterase-homology domain of each NL in a dimer binds the laminin neurexin sex hormone binding (LNS) domain common to α and β Nrx with KD values in the 10−8–10−5 M range. There is strong evidence implicating altered Nrx and NL function in human psychiatric disorders. Autism-associated mutations in multiple human NRXNs and NLGNs are consistently found, including copy number variations, microdeletions, and truncating nonsense and function-altering missense mutations (Huguet et al., 2013Huguet G.

Although rare (in <1% of patients), NRXN1 mutations are also among the most frequent single-gene mutations in both schizophrenia (Rees et al., 2014Rees E. Walters J.T. Georgieva L. Isles A.R.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are also implicated in synaptic function and autism, yet the molecular mechanisms remain uncertain. In addition to well-studied roles in brain development, HSPGs are implicated in activity-induced synaptic plasticity and regulation of oscillatory activity in mature brain networks (Farhy Tselnicker et al., 2014Farhy Tselnicker I.

EXT1 and HS3ST5, which encode an essential HS biosynthetic enzyme and an HS sulfotransferase, respectively, have both been associated with autism susceptibility (Li et al., 2002Li H. Yamagata T. Mori M. Momoi M.Y. Association of autism in two patients with hereditary multiple exostoses caused by novel deletion mutations of EXT1.J. Hum.

Sleiman P.M. et al.Common genetic variants on 5p14.1 associate with autism spectrum disorders.Nature. 2009; 459: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Late postnatal deletion of Ext1 in a subset of neurons leads to deficits in synaptic function and autism-like social, communication, and stereotypy behaviors in mice (Irie et al., 2012Irie F. Badie-Mahdavi H. Yamaguchi Y. Autism-like socio-communicative deficits and stereotypies in mice lacking heparan sulfate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 5052-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) through unknown mechanisms. Here, we shed light on the links between HSPG and Nrx pathways by establishing that Nrxs are themselves HSPGs. HS glycan modification of Nrx is critical for high-affinity interactions with NLs and LRRTMs, mediates interaction with additional ligands, and is essential for normal synapse development at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions and at mouse hippocampal mossy fiber CA3 synapses. Thus, HS is a critical component of Nrx, a component that further expands the diversity of Nrx structure and molecular interactions, providing a molecular basis for fine-tuning Nrx function. We demonstrate by multiple lines of evidence that Nrxs are HSPGs (Figure 1A), joining a superfamily of 17 known HSPGs (Sarrazin et al., 2011Sarrazin S. Lamanna W.C. Esko J.D. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a004952Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, Xu and Esko, 2014Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate-protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). First, brain immunoblots for Nrx show molecular weight shifts upon cleavage of HS chains with heparinases I, II, and III (Figure 1B). HS chains contribute 20–100 kDa, with a heterogeneous chain length and structure even for a single-protein backbone. We estimate that approximately 80% of α Nrxs and 66% of β Nrxs are HS modified in adult mouse brain, and this fraction changes little throughout development (Figure S1A). Second, native brain Nrx and recombinant Nrx-1,2,3 α and β are all recognized by the anti-HS antibody 3G10, which recognizes the HS stub remaining after heparinase treatment (David et al., 1992David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. Developmental changes in heparan sulfate expression: in situ detection with mAbs.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and recognized all heparinase-treated immunoprecipitated Nrx (Figures 1C–1E). Using this assay on Nrx1β deletion and point mutants lacking splice inserts, we mapped the HS modification site (Figure S1C; confirmed in Nrx-1,2,3 β in cultured neurons, Figure 1E). Third, purified recombinant Nrx1α ectodomain analyzed by strong anion exchange HPLC following heparinase treatment confirmed multiple HS disaccharides, which were not present for the Ser→Ala point mutant of the HS modified residue, Nrx1αΔHS (Figure 1F). Further, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) following protease and heparinase digestion revealed a molecular ion mass corresponding to the Nrx1α modified peptide bearing the HS stub (Figure 1G). This signal was detected only in Nrx1α, and not in Nrx1αΔHS. Conversely, unmodified peptide lacking glycosylation at this position was detected only in Nrx1αΔHS, and not Nrx1α (Figure S1D). Thus, four independent methods support the conclusion that all Nrxs are HSPGs (Figure 1A).Figure S1Nrxs Are HSPGs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Nrx HS modification throughout development. Crude synaptosome fraction was prepared from mouse brain at the postnatal ages indicated (in days, e.g., P1 is postnatal day 1) and treated or not with heparinase. The extent of Nrx HS modification at each age was estimated from the Nrx immunoblot. For example for P400, the fraction of α-Nrx lacking HS modification was estimated as the integrated signal of unmodified α-Nrx in the untreated sample (blue box) divided by total α-Nrx (red box, condensed band for unmodified α-Nrx after heparinase). Similarly, for P400 the fraction of β-Nrx lacking HS modification was estimated as the integrated signal in the purple box divided by the integrated signal in the green box. In the graph shown, values are reported as fraction of α-Nrx or β-Nrx bearing HS modification.

Error bars represent SEM.(B) Nrx is poorly HS modified in HEK293 cells in comparison with neurons. All recombinant Nrx fused with GFP or CFP expressed in HEK293 cells are recognized by an HS antibody, indicating some degree of HS modification; 3G10 recognizes the HS stub remaining after heparinase cleavage. However, heparinase treatment resulted in little or no shift in molecular weight, in contrast with the apparent molecular weight shifts of Nrx from the brain or primary neurons (Figures 1A–1C), indicating a deficient modification level in HEK293 cells.(C) Mapping the HS modification site.

The Nrx1β lacked splice inserts. The constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells and lysate immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, treated or not with heparinase, then immunoblotted. 3G10 recognizes the HS stub remaining after heparinase treatment. Deletion of the glycosylated region or its C-terminal half or point mutation of serine 316 within this region to alanine (SA(316)) abolished HS modification, while deletion of the N-terminal half of the glycosylated region reduced but did not abolish HS modification.(D) Identification of unmodified peptide from Nrx1αΔHS recombinant protein.

Fragmentation was produced by Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), resulting in y (red), b (light blue) ions, as well as a ions and internal ions (dark blue) necessary for confirmation of peptide sequence. Lower case ‘c’ refers to carbamidomethylated cysteine. This peptide was only found in its non-glycosylated form and only in the sample NRx1αΔHS.

All recombinant Nrx fused with GFP or CFP expressed in HEK293 cells are recognized by an HS antibody, indicating some degree of HS modification; 3G10 recognizes the HS stub remaining after heparinase cleavage. However, heparinase treatment resulted in little or no shift in molecular weight, in contrast with the apparent molecular weight shifts of Nrx from the brain or primary neurons (Figures 1A–1C), indicating a deficient modification level in HEK293 cells. (C) Mapping the HS modification site. SP, signal peptide; LNS, laminin neurexin sex hormone binding protein domain; CHO, glycosylated region as previously reported (Reissner et al., 2013Reissner C. Runkel F. Missler M. Neurexins.Genome Biol. 2013; 14: 213Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); CHO-beg, N-terminal half of the glycosylated region; CHO-end, C-terminal half of the glycosylated region; TM, transmembrane domain; C-tail, cytoplasmic domain; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; ∗, serine to alanine point mutation. The Nrx1β lacked splice inserts. The constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells and lysate immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, treated or not with heparinase, then immunoblotted. 3G10 recognizes the HS stub remaining after heparinase treatment. Deletion of the glycosylated region or its C-terminal half or point mutation of serine 316 within this region to alanine (SA(316)) abolished HS modification, while deletion of the N-terminal half of the glycosylated region reduced but did not abolish HS modification. (D) Identification of unmodified peptide from Nrx1αΔHS recombinant protein. MS/MS of peptide ‘ILVAAAEcPSDD’ detected in Nrx1αΔHS. A Selected Ion Monitoring Chromatograph (SIM) of the whole mass at m/z MH+2(mono) 630.7925 with 10ppm mass tolerance is seen in the insert. Fragmentation was produced by Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), resulting in y (red), b (light blue) ions, as well as a ions and internal ions (dark blue) necessary for confirmation of peptide sequence. Lower case ‘c’ refers to carbamidomethylated cysteine. This peptide was only found in its non-glycosylated form and only in the sample NRx1αΔHS. Results from the LC-MS/MS following the Glu-C and Heparinase I-III digestion showed 78% and 58% coverage of Nrx1α and Nrx1αΔHS, respectively. (E) Drosophila neurexin Dnrx is HS modified. Myc-tagged Dnrx and ΔHS mutant (LIFSGAGSGCRGDDEDECTPPFESGSGDD to LIFAGAGAGCRGDDEDECTPPFEAGAGDD) along with CD4 negative control and glypican-5 positive control were expressed in HEK293 cells. Lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, treated or not with heparinase, then immunoblotted. 3G10 recognizes the HS stub remaining after heparinase treatment. The HS modification site is conserved in all vertebrate Nrx genes from zebrafish to human (Figures 1H and 1I and Table S1). Although the primary sequence is more divergent in invertebrates, the single Drosophila neurexin (Dnrx) is HS modified in the same region between the last LNS and transmembrane domains (Figures 1H, 1I, and S1E). Caenorhabditis elegans neurexin also has a consensus potential HS modification site in this region (Table S1). Polylysine-coated beads, long thought to non-specifically induce presynaptic differentiation (Burry, 1980Burry R.W. Formation of apparent presynaptic elements in response to poly-basic compounds.Brain Res. 1980; 184: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), were recently found to do so by aggregating axonal HSPGs (Lucido et al., 2009Lucido A.L. Suarez Sanchez F. Thostrup P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Leal-Ortiz S. Gopalakrishnan G. Liazoghli D. Belkaid W. Lennox R.B. Grutter P. et al.Rapid assembly of functional presynaptic boutons triggered by adhesive contacts.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12449-12466Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Syndecan-2 was aggregated and was suggested to be the HSPG responsible for polylysine-bead-induced presynaptic differentiation, but functional evidence was lacking. We find that polylysine beads aggregate axonal Nrxs (Figures 1J–1L and S2A). Furthermore, efficient knockdown of all Nrxs with an adeno-associated viral vector expressing multiple short hairpin RNAs (Figures S2B and S2C) revealed that Nrxs are required for polylysine-bead-induced presynaptic differentiation (Figures 1J–1M). Thus, these results suggest that polylysine-coated beads directly bind the HS chain of Nrx, and the recruited Nrx triggers local presynaptic assembly. HS modification of Nrxs may also mediate interaction with native HS-binding proteins. Indeed, the HS-binding extracellular matrix proteins F-spondin and thrombospondin, a glial-derived factor that promotes synaptic differentiation (Christopherson et al., 2005Christopherson K.S. Ullian E.M. Stokes C.C. Mullowney C.E. Hell J.W. Agah A. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Bornstein P. Barres B.A. Thrombospondins are astrocyte-secreted proteins that promote CNS synaptogenesis.Cell. 2005; 120: 421-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), were recently found to bind Nrx (Traunmüller et al., 2016Traunmüller L. Gomez A.M. Nguyen T.M. Scheiffele P. Control of neuronal synapse specification by a highly dedicated alternative splicing program.Science. 2016; 352: 982-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We chose the HS-binding growth factor pleiotrophin (also known as heparin-binding growth-associated molecule), which shows activity-regulated expression in hippocampus (Lauri et al., 1996Lauri S.E. Taira T. Kaila K. Rauvala H. Activity-induced enhancement of HB-GAM expression in rat hippocampal slices.Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), to test as a novel candidate for Nrx interaction and synaptic function. Recombinant pleiotrophin bound to cell-expressed Nrx1β, but not Nrx1βΔHS (Figures 1N and S2D). Furthermore, pleiotrophin conjugated to inert beads aggregated axonal Nrxs and induced excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic differentiation (Figures 1O–1Q). Pleiotrophin, as a factor that interacts solely with HS chains of Nrx independent of its protein domains, may exemplify a new category of synapse regulatory factors. This new mode of interaction via HS chains increases the number of potential ligands for Nrx to several hundred (Table S2; Ori et al., 2011Ori A. Wilkinson M.C. Fernig D.G.

Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate-protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), complementing the roughly two dozen ligands for Nrx protein domains (Südhof, 2017Südhof T.C. Synaptic Neurexin Complexes: A Molecular Code for the Logic of Neural Circuits.Cell. 2017; 171: 745-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). To test the role of Nrx HS modification in native synaptic development and function, we used a molecular replacement strategy in cultured hippocampal neurons, knocking down all Nrx and rescuing with a mixture of RNAi-resistant Nrx 1α and 1β wild-type (Nrx∗) or point-mutant-abolishing HS modification (Nrx∗ΔHS; Figure 2; confirmed to reach the axon surface, Figures S3A and S3B). Excitatory synapse density, assessed as clusters of postsynaptic scaffold apposed to presynaptic vesicles, was not significantly altered (Figure 2A), but inhibitory synapse density was reduced by Nrx knockdown (Figure 2B), consistent with the phenotype of α-Nrx or global Nrx mutant neurons (Chen et al., 2017Chen L.Y.

Alpha-neurexins couple Ca2+ channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis.Nature. 2003; 423: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Inhibitory synapse density was fully rescued by expression of Nrx∗, whereas Nrx∗ΔHS showed no rescue. While loss of α-Nrx does not affect excitatory synapse density, it dramatically reduces vesicle fusion and excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (Missler et al., 2003Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G. Hammer R.E. Gottmann K. Südhof T.C. Alpha-neurexins couple Ca2+ channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis.Nature. 2003; 423: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar); thus, we assessed synapse function. Nrx knockdown resulted in markedly reduced frequency of miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs; Figures 2C and 2D). Furthermore, the reduction in both mEPSC and mIPSC frequency was restored in Nrx-knockdown cultures by expression of Nrx∗, whereas Nrx∗ΔHS mediated no functional rescue. Neuron density did not differ among groups (Figures S3D and S3E). Thus, HS modification of Nrx is essential for its functions in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and morphological inhibitory synapse development in cultured hippocampal neurons.Figure S3Nrx HS Modification Does Not Affect Nrx Surface Trafficking or Neuron Survival, and Heparinase Reduces Presynaptic Differentiation, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) Nrx1β∗ΔHS reaches the axon surface, like Nrx1β∗, as shown by surface labeling of the V5 tagged Nrx constructs co-expressed with YFP through a 2A peptide. Note that both Nrx1β∗ and the ΔHS mutant are primarily axonal as MAP2 positive dendrites show little V5 fluorescence.(B) The axon surface level of Nrx1β∗ΔHS was indistinguishable from that of Nrx1β∗. Ratios of surface V5 to total YFP were assessed along axons of 13 DIV neurons co-expressing the V5 tagged Nrx constructs with YFP linked through the 2A peptide. A Mann-Whitney test showed no significant difference, n = 21-22 cells from 2 independent experiments.(C) mEPSC amplitude was not significantly different among groups (p = 0.0591). The numbers of cells were: CFP+shCon (n = 21); CFP+shNrx (n = 32); Nrx∗+shNrx (n = 29); Nrx∗ΔHS+shNrx (n = 32) from 4 independent experiments. mIPSC amplitude was reduced by Nrx knockdown and partially rescued by RNAi-resistant Nrx∗ but not Nrx∗ΔHS. The numbers of cells were: CFP+shCon (n = 20); CFP+shNrx (n = 18); Nrx∗+shNrx (n = 18); Nrx∗ΔHS+shNrx (n = 18) from 3 independent experiments. ∗∗p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001 by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s tests compared to shCon+CFP.

Neuron density assessed as number of MAP2-positive neurons per coverslip area normalized to the shCon+CFP group did not differ among groups by Kruskal-Wallis, n = 30 from 3 independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2885955370,"The location of short-term memory in mammalian neocortex remains elusive. Here we show that distinct neocortical areas maintain short-term memory depending on behavioral strategy. Using wide-field and single-cell calcium imaging, we measured layer 2/3 neuronal activity in mice performing a whisker-based texture discrimination task with delayed response. Mice either deployed an active strategy—engaging their body toward the approaching texture—or passively awaited the touch. Independent of strategy, whisker-related posterior areas encoded choice early after touch. During the delay, in contrast, persistent cortical activity was located medio-frontally in active trials but in a lateral posterior area in passive trials. Perturbing these areas impaired performance for the associated strategy and also provoked strategy switches. Frontally maintained information related to future action, whereas activity in the posterior cortex reflected past stimulus identity. Thus, depending on behavioral strategy, cortical activity is routed differentially to hold information either frontally or posteriorly before converging to similar action."
https://openalex.org/W2886858101,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) regulate nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, transcription, and genome integrity in eukaryotic cells. However, their functional roles in cancer remain poorly understood. We interrogated the evolutionary transcriptomic landscape of NPC components, nucleoporins (Nups), from primary to advanced metastatic human prostate cancer (PC). Focused loss-of-function genetic screen of top-upregulated Nups in aggressive PC models identified POM121 as a key contributor to PC aggressiveness. Mechanistically, POM121 promoted PC progression by enhancing importin-dependent nuclear transport of key oncogenic (E2F1, MYC) and PC-specific (AR-GATA2) transcription factors, uncovering a pharmacologically targetable axis that, when inhibited, decreased tumor growth, restored standard therapy efficacy, and improved survival in patient-derived pre-clinical models. Our studies molecularly establish a role of NPCs in PC progression and give a rationale for NPC-regulated nuclear import targeting as a therapeutic strategy for lethal PC. These findings may have implications for understanding how NPC deregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of other tumor types."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in vascular niches in which perivascular stromal cells and endothelial cells (ECs) secrete growth factors, including stem cell factor (SCF) and CXCL12, which are essential for maintenance of the HSC pool (Ding et al., 2012Ding L.

Bone marrow (BM) ECs also secrete Jagged-1, which is important for homeostatic hematopoiesis (Poulos et al., 2013Poulos M.G. Guo P. Kofler N.M. Pinho S. Gutkin M.C. Tikhonova A. Aifantis I.

Recent studies suggest that BM arterial blood vessels maintain HSCs in a low reactive oxygen species state, whereas permeable sinusoidal vessels promote HSC activation (Itkin et al., 2016Itkin T. Gur-Cohen S. Spencer J.A. Schajnovitz A. Ramasamy S.K. Kusumbe A.P. Ledergor G. Jung Y. Milo I. Poulos M.G. et al.Distinct bone marrow blood vessels differentially regulate hematopoiesis.Nature. 2016; 532: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of Notch signaling in ECs increases the number of HSC niches via amplification of CD31+ capillaries and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-β+ perivascular cells (Kusumbe et al., 2016Kusumbe A.P. Ramasamy S.K. Itkin T. Mäe M.A. Langen U.H. Betsholtz C. Lapidot T. Adams R.H. Age-dependent modulation of vascular niches for haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2016; 532: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Differential cytokine contributions from perivascular cells have also been demonstrated (Asada et al., 2017Asada N. Kunisaki Y. Pierce H. Wang Z. Fernandez N.F. Birbrair A. Ma’ayan A. Frenette P.S. Differential cytokine contributions of perivascular haematopoietic stem cell niches.Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Deletion of Scf in LepR+ peri-sinusoidal cells reduced HSC numbers whereas Scf deletion in NG2+ arteriolar perivascular cells did not (Asada et al., 2017Asada N. Kunisaki Y. Pierce H. Wang Z.

Conversely, deletion of Cxcl12 from arteriolar NG2+ perivascular cells decreased HSC numbers, whereas deletion of Cxcl12 from LepR+ cells had no effect (Asada et al., 2017Asada N. Kunisaki Y.

Taken together, these studies have characterized the paracrine function of perivascular stromal cells and bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) in maintaining HSCs during homeostasis. However, the effects of myeloablation or injury on niche cell regulation of hematopoiesis and the precise mechanisms through which niche cells regulate HSC regeneration after injury remain incompletely understood (Hooper et al., 2009Hooper A.

Here we show that deletion of Ptn from LepR+ stromal cells impaired HSC maintenance during homeostasis, whereas deletion of Ptn from BMECs, osteoblasts, or hematopoietic cells had no effect. Total body irradiation (TBI) enriched for PTN- expressing BMECs in the niche and deletion of Ptn from vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin+ (VE-cad+) ECs markedly impaired HSC regeneration following TBI. Conversely, PTN from LepR+ stromal cells was not required for HSC regeneration to occur. These results demonstrate unpredicted, dichotomous control of HSC maintenance and HSC regeneration by BM stromal cells and ECs via secretion of PTN. We utilized Ptn-EGFP mice to identify cells that express PTN in the adult BM (Michelotti et al., 2016Michelotti G.A. Tucker A. Swiderska-Syn M. Machado M.V. Choi S.S. Kruger L. Soderblom E. Thompson J.W. Mayer-Salman M. Himburg H.A. et al.Pleiotrophin regulates the ductular reaction by controlling the migration of cells in liver progenitor niches.Gut. 2016; 65: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We observed no expression of PTN by BM CD45+ hematopoietic cells and minimal co-localization of PTN with BM osteopontin+ osteolineage cells (Figures S1A and S1B). Conversely, PTN expression co-localized with BM VE-cad+ ECs and LepR+ stromal cells, which surround BM vessels (Figures 1A–1J). By flow cytometry, a mean of 50% of BM VE-cad+ ECs and 93% of LepR+ stromal cells expressed PTN at baseline (Figures 1K and 1M). Further analysis revealed that 64% of BM CD31+Sca-1− sinusoidal BMECs (sBMECs) expressed PTN, whereas 29% of CD31+Sca-1+ arteriolar BMECs (aBMECs) expressed PTN (Figures 1L and 1O). A small population of CD31+Endomucin+ ECs also expressed PTN (Figure S1C). Analysis of BM LepR+ stromal cell subsets revealed that 99% of LepR+CXCL12+ stromal cells and 98% of LepR+CXCL12− stromal cells expressed PTN (Figures 1N and 1O). BM LepR+PDGFRα+ stromal cells also highly expressed PTN, whereas less than 5% of BM LepR−NG2+ cells expressed PTN (Figures S1D–S1F). Gene expression analysis demonstrated the highest level of Ptn expression in BM LepR+ stromal cells and CD31+Sca-1− sBMECs and no significant evidence of Ptn expression in BM CD45+ hematopoietic cells or BM osteoblasts (Figure 1P). Taken together, these analyses demonstrated that PTN is highly expressed by BM LepR+ stromal cell subsets and predominantly expressed by sBMECs. To determine the effects of Ptn deletion in cells within the hematopoietic system, we generated Ptn floxed/floxed mice (Ptnfl/fl mice). Of note, adult Ptnfl/fl mice were viable and had no evident phenotype at baseline. We crossed Ptnfl/fl mice with Vav1-Cre mice to delete Ptn in all Vav1+ hematopoietic cells (Figure S2A; Ruiz-Herguido et al., 2012Ruiz-Herguido C. Guiu J. D’Altri T. Inglés-Esteve J. Dzierzak E. Espinosa L. Bigas A. Hematopoietic stem cell development requires transient Wnt/β-catenin activity.J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209: 1457-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Adult Vav1-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice had normal BM cell counts, colony-forming cell (CFC) content, and percentages of ckit+sca-1+lin− (KSL) stem/progenitor cells and signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)+KSL HSCs (Figures S2B–S2E). Competitive repopulation assays revealed no deficit in HSC function in Vav1-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice compared with control mice (Figure S2F). Vav1-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice also had normal complete blood counts (Figure S2G), spleen weights, and BM differential compared with controls (data not shown). Vav1+ hematopoietic cells are therefore not a required source of PTN for the maintenance of BM HSCs or progenitors. We next interrogated Osteocalcin-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice (Ocn-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice) to assess the effects of Ptn deletion in BM osteocalcin+ osteoblasts (Figure S2A; Raaijmakers et al., 2010Raaijmakers M.H. Mukherjee S. Guo S. Zhang S. Kobayashi T. Schoonmaker J.A. Ebert B.L. Al-Shahrour F. Hasserjian R.P. Scadden E.O. et al.Bone progenitor dysfunction induces myelodysplasia and secondary leukaemia.Nature. 2010; 464: 852-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Adult Ocn-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice displayed a normal hematopoietic profile, normal percentages of BM KSL and SLAM+KSL cells, and no HSC functional deficit in competitive repopulation assays (Figures S2B–S2G). These results suggest that BM osteoblasts are not an important source of PTN for maintenance of the HSC or progenitor cell pool. We crossed VE-cadherin-Cre mice (Ve-cad-Cre) with Ptnfl/fl mice to delete Ptn in VE-cad+ ECs (Figure S2A; Alva et al., 2006Alva J.A. Zovein A.C. Monvoisin A. Murphy T. Salazar A. Harvey N.L. Carmeliet P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. VE-Cadherin-Cre-recombinase transgenic mouse: a tool for lineage analysis and gene deletion in endothelial cells.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice also displayed no baseline deficit in BM cell counts, complete blood counts, KSL cells or SLAM+KSL cells and no HSC functional deficit in competitive repopulation assays compared with controls (Figures S2B–S2G). These data suggest that VE-cad+ BMECs are not a required source of PTN for the maintenance of HSCs or progenitor cells during homeostasis. We crossed LepR-Cre mice with Ptnfl/fl mice to evaluate the effect of Ptn deletion in BM stromal cells on hematopoiesis (Figure 2A; Zhou et al., 2017Zhou B.O. Yu H. Yue R. Zhao Z. Rios J.J. Naveiras O. Morrison S.J. Bone marrow adipocytes promote the regeneration of stem cells and haematopoiesis by secreting SCF.Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Adult LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice displayed no significant differences in complete blood counts or spleen weights compared with controls (Figures S3A and S3B). However, LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice contained decreased BM cell counts and decreased BM Mac1+Gr1+ myeloid cells, B220+ B cells, and CD3+ T cells compared with controls (Figure 2B; Figure S3C). Although LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice displayed moderate BM hypocellularity, we noted no differences in BM perilipin+ adipocyte content between LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice and controls (Figure S3D). LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice contained decreased BM CFCs and decreased percentages and numbers of BM KSL cells and SLAM+KSL HSCs compared with controls (Figures 2C–2E; Figure S3E). These results suggested that deletion of Ptn from LepR+ stromal cells caused a significant loss of phenotypic HSCs and progenitor cells in homeostasis. To confirm whether PTN from LepR+ stromal cells was necessary for the maintenance of functional HSCs, we performed competitive repopulation assays using BM cells from LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice and control donor mice. Syngeneic CD45.1+ mice that were competitively transplanted with 2 × 105 CD45.2+ BM cells from LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice, along with 2 × 105 competitor CD45.1+ BM cells, displayed a significant decrease in donor CD45.2+ cell engraftment through 20 weeks post-transplant compared with mice transplanted with the identical dose of BM cells from control mice (Figure 2F). Donor CD45.2+ cell contribution to BM CD34−Flt-3−KSL cells, representative of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), CD34+Flt-3−KSL short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), and CD34+Flt-3+KSL multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells was also significantly decreased at 20 weeks in recipients of BM from LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice compared with control mice (Figure 2G; Figure S3F). Secondary competitive transplants confirmed a substantial deficit in LT-HSCs in LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice compared with controls (Figure 2H). Multilineage engraftment of donor myeloid, B cells, and T cells was also decreased in secondary recipients of BM cells from LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice (Figure 2I). Taken together, these results suggested that PTN from BM LepR+ stromal cells was necessary for the maintenance of LT-HSCs. Of note, PTN has been shown to promote angiogenesis in tumor models and at sites of ischemia and inflammation (Christman et al., 2005Christman K.L. Fang Q. Yee M.S. Johnson K.R. Sievers R.E. Lee R.J.

Therefore, we evaluated the BM vasculature of mice bearing deletion of Ptn in LepR+ and VE-cad+ cells compared with control mice. We observed no substantial differences in BM vascular density or BM vessel length between adult LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice, VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice, and control mice in a steady state (Figures S3G and S3H). These results suggested that deletion of PTN from LepR+ stromal cells or VE-cad+ ECs did not alter the BM vasculature in a steady state. Myelosuppressive insults such as chemotherapy or irradiation damage BM niche cell integrity, and niche cell-mediated regulation of hematopoiesis may change following stress (Zhou et al., 2015Zhou B.O.

Med. 2013; 19: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because PTN is produced primarily by BMECs and stromal cells, we examined the effect of 500 cGy TBI on BM VE-cad+ EC and LepR+ stromal cell composition and on the expression of PTN in these niche cells over time. Fluorescence microscopic analysis on day +3 following 500 cGy TBI revealed marked disruption of the normal BM vascular architecture coupled with increased PTN co-localization with VE-cad+ BMECs and decreased co-localization with LepR+ stromal cells (Figures 3A and 3B ). On day +10, PTN co-localization with VE-cad+ ECs increased further, whereas PTN localization with LepR+ stromal cells returned to baseline (Figures 3A and 3B). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the percentages of both BM VE-cad+ ECs and LepR+ stromal cells increased, as a fraction of total BM lin− cells, on day +3 following 500 cGy TBI because of the loss of radiosensitive hematopoietic cells (Figures 3C and 3D; Figure S4A). Interestingly, the percentages of BM VE-cad+PTN+ ECs increased significantly on day +3 and day +10 following 500 cGy TBI, whereas the percentages of LepR+PTN+ stromal cells remained high and unchanged from baseline (Figures 3C and 3D). PTN mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) more than doubled in VE-cad+ ECs on day +10 following 500 cGy TBI compared with non-irradiated controls, whereas PTN MFI in LepR+ stromal cells decreased in irradiated mice compared with non-irradiated controls (Figure 3E). Subset analysis revealed that PTN expression also increased in both CD31+Sca-1− sBMECs and CD31+Sca-1+ aBMECs on day +3 following TBI (Figure 3F; Figure S4B), whereas PTN expression in LepR+ stromal cell subsets remained unchanged (Figure S4C). Ptn gene expression increased 4.2-fold in VE-cad+ ECs and 7.4-fold in CD31+Sca-1− sBMECs 72 hr following 500 cGy TBI, whereas Ptn expression decreased 2.3-fold in BM LepR+ stromal cells compared with non-irradiated mice (Figure 3G). Taken together, these results suggested that TBI induced PTN expression in BMECs and enriched for PTN+ ECs, particularly in BM sinusoidal vessels. Of note, we observed no change in VE-cad expression in BM VE-cad+ ECs and a minimal decrease in LepR expression in BM LepR+ cells following 500 cGy TBI (Figure S4D). To determine the cell-specific requirements for PTN during hematopoietic regeneration, we irradiated LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice and VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice with 500 cGy TBI and compared the hematopoietic content of these mice over time with control mice. In non-irradiated mice, PTN levels in the BM of VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice and LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice were significantly lower than in control mice, and PTN levels in LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice were also significantly lower than in VE-cad-Cre; Ptnfl/fl mice (Figure 4A). On day +1 and day +4 following 500 cGy TBI, BM PTN levels in LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice and VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice remained significantly decreased compared with irradiated control mice. However, PTN levels in the BM of VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice became significantly lower than in LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice on day +1 and day +4 (Figure 4A). VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice displayed significantly decreased peripheral blood (PB) white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts on day +10 and day +14 following 500 cGy TBI as well as decreased PB lymphocytes on day +14 compared with irradiated control mice (Figure 4B; Figure S4E). VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice also displayed a significant decrease in BM cell counts, KSL cells, ckit+sca-1−lin− myeloid progenitor cells and CFCs compared with controls (Figures 4C–4E). Similarly, LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice demonstrated decreased numbers of PB WBCs and neutrophils on day +10 and +14 following 500 cGy TBI and decreased PB lymphocytes on day +14 compared with irradiated control mice (Figure 4B). LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice also contained decreased BM cell counts, KSL cells, and myeloid progenitors on day +10 compared with irradiated controls (Figures 4C–4E). Of note, surface expression of the PTN receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta (PTPζ) concordantly increased on BM KSL cells, myeloid progenitors, and CD11b+ myeloid cells after irradiation, consistent with a facultative role for PTN signaling in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and myeloid cells following irradiation (Figure S4F). Because deletion of Ptn from either VE-cad+ ECs or LepR+ stromal cells was associated with a deficit in BM KSLs and myeloid progenitors within 10 days following TBI, we tested whether this could alter the survival of irradiated mice. Following 700 cGy TBI, 78% of control mice (7 of 9) remained alive on day +60. In contrast, 22% of LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice (2 of 9) and 22% of VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice (2 of 9) remained alive on day +60 (p = 0.01 and p = 0.01; Figure 4F). Taken together, these results suggested that acute hematologic recovery and survival following irradiation required PTN from BM LepR+ stromal cells and VE-cad+ ECs. To determine whether LT-HSC regeneration following TBI required PTN from BM LepR+ stromal cells or VE-cad+ ECs, we performed primary and secondary competitive repopulation assays using BM cells collected on day +10 from irradiated LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice, VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice, and controls. Primary recipient mice transplanted with BM cells from LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice on day +10 following 500 cGy TBI displayed comparable donor multilineage hematopoietic cell engraftment at 12 weeks as recipient mice transplanted with BM cells from irradiated control mice (Figures 5A and 5B ). In contrast, recipient mice transplanted with the identical dose of BM cells from VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice displayed significantly decreased total CD45.2+ cell engraftment and decreased donor myeloid cells, B cells, and T cells compared with mice transplanted with BM cells from control mice or LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice (Figures 5A and 5B). Donor CD45.2+ cell engraftment within BM LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, and MPP cells was also significantly decreased in recipient mice transplanted with BM cells from VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice (Figure 5C; Figures S5A and S5B). Secondary competitive transplantation assays demonstrated that irradiated LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice displayed no deficit in LT-HSC repopulating capacity compared with irradiated control mice (Figures 5D and 5E). However, irradiated VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice demonstrated significantly decreased LT-HSC repopulating capacity, as measured by decreased total donor and multilineage engraftment in secondary recipient mice (Figures 5D and 5E). These results suggested that LT-HSC regeneration after TBI required PTN from BM VE-cad+ ECs. Our results suggest that HSC maintenance in steady state is dependent on the secretion of PTN by BM LepR+ stromal cells. Indeed, in steady state, BM LepR+ cells express higher levels of PTN compared with VE-cad+ ECs. Consistent with this, LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice displayed significantly lower PTN levels in the BM during homeostasis compared with control mice and VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice. These results suggest that HSC maintenance requires a threshold level of PTN that is sustained by BM LepR+ stromal cells. Following TBI, hematologic recovery and survival were both impaired significantly in LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice and VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice. These findings corresponded with significantly decreased levels of PTN protein in the BM of LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice and VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice compared with irradiated, control mice.

Both VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice and LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice contained significantly decreased numbers of BM KSL cells and ckit+sca-1−lin− myeloid progenitor cells on day +10 following 500 cGy TBI. These deficits likely contributed to the decreased survival of VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice and LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice following irradiation. These data suggest that both VE-cad+ ECs and LepR+ stromal cells are essential sources of PTN to support the recovery of radioprotective HSPCs and survival following irradiation. Following TBI, VE-cad-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice displayed a significant deficit in LT-HSC regeneration, whereas LepR-Cre;Ptnfl/fl mice maintained LT-HSC content equivalent to that of irradiated control mice. These results suggest that BM VE-cad+ ECs have a facul"

Here, we employed single-particle cryo-EM, complemented by X-ray crystallography and functional assays, to obtain a detailed structural model for the yeast S. cerevisiae COMPASS complex including Set1(726-1080 aa), Cps30, Cps50, Cps60, Cps25, and Cps40. The results highlight the essential scaffolding role of Cps50 for COMPASS assembly, the conformationally dynamic character of the complex, and the essential role of Cps30 on inducing higher methylation states of H3K4. For structural studies, we co-expressed full-length S. cerevisiae Cps60, Cps50, Cps40, Cps30, Cps25, and a truncated active Set1 protein (762–1080 aa, hereafter, SET762) in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells, aiming to purify the intact six-subunit catalytic core complex with a total molecular weight of ∼220 kD (Figure S1A). A fine-tuned baculovirus infection and purification strategy enabled us to reconstitute and isolate highly homogeneous preparations of the complex with optimal methyltransferase activity (Thornton et al., 2014Thornton J.L.

After consecutive rounds of 3D classification, we isolated a particle subset that enabled 3D reconstruction of a global map with overall 4.0-Å resolution and maps of subregions with further improved features after focused refinement (Figures 1A, S2, S3, and S4). In addition, a second independent particle subset led to a 4.4-Å map of COMPASS adopting a more compact configuration (Figures 1B and S2).Figure 1Architecture of Core COMPASSShow full caption(A) Views of the overall 4.0-Å cryo-EM density map of COMPASS with subunits rendered in different colors (Cps40 in pink, Cps50 in blue, Cps30 in green, SET762 in orange, Cps60 in purple, and Cps25 in dark red).(B) Superimposition of 4.0-Å and 4.4-Å cryo-EM maps shown in orange and purple, respectively.(C) Structural model of the COMPASS in the same orientations and colors as shown in (A).(D) A schematic model of COMPASS structural dynamics adapts to the chromatin environment.See also Figures S1, S2, S4, S4, and S7 and Tables S1 and S2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S2Cryo-EM Data Processing, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Data processing for the final 3D reconstruction of COMPASS core complex.

To model the structure of the COMPASS subunits in the cryo-EM map, we employed a combination of homology modeling, secondary and tertiary structure prediction, and de novo chain building (STAR Methods). Our modeling was also aided by the structure of the WD40 domain of Cps50 from Myceliophthola thermophila, which we obtained by X-ray crystallography (Figure S3A). The structural model was first built against the locally refined maps of the top half (SET/Cps30/Cps40/Cps50) and bottom half (SET/Cps60/Cps25) COMPASS subregions that yielded higher-quality density features (Figures S3C and S4) and subsequently refined against the overall 4.0-Å resolution map (Figure S3D). Any protein regions we could not confidently assign due to their flexible disposition—e.g., the highly mobile N-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) domain of Cps40 or segments of the Cps60-25 module—were omitted from the final model. The structure, complemented by an array of mutagenesis and functional assays (discussed below), highlights the intricate organization and functional modulation of the six-subunit COMPASS core complex (Figure 1C).Figure S4Representative Regions of Cryo-EM Density Map and Corresponding Model for COMPASS, Related to Figures 1, 2, and 3Show full captionEM density map and model are shown for Cps40 elongated helices (pink), the Cps60 C-terminal helix (shown in blue) interacting with Cps25 dimeric helical stacks (orange and red), Cps30 β sheet (green), Cps50 β sheet (blue) and Cps50 C-terminal region (blue).

Bulky side chains are indicated for each segment. Consistent with its localization in our earlier studies, the catalytic SET domain is positioned at the junction of the Y-shaped complex (Figure 1) (Takahashi et al., 2011Takahashi Y.H. Westfield G.H. Oleskie A.N. Trievel R.C. Shilatifard A. Skiniotis G. Structural analysis of the core COMPASS family of histone H3K4 methylases from yeast to human.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 20526-20531Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The perpendicularly aligned Cps30 and Cps50 β propeller domains form the upper tips of the “Y,” wherein Cps30 directly contacts the SET domain. In contrast, Cps50 employs its C-terminal extension, but not the WD40 domain, to interact with the catalytic SET domain. The Cps40 subunit sits atop the Y to staple the two β propeller domains via a pair of intertwined long α helices. On the opposite end of the complex, the SPRY domain of Cps60 directly interacts with the SET domain of Set1, as well as a segment succeeding the Cps50 β propeller domain. The last 20 residues of Cps60 fold into an α helix that crosses orthogonally the two β sheets of its SPRY domain. This α-helical segment is embraced by a bundle of α helices formed by a dimer of Cps25 (Figure S4). In this configuration, Cps60 and Cps25 form the lengthened tandem base of the COMPASS Y-shaped architecture. The two COMPASS conformers allow for an indirect visualization of the structural dynamics underlying the complex in the absence of nucleosomal substrate. Comparisons of the two models reveal that there are no significant changes in the overall structure of each subunit and its interactions with other subunits (Figures 1B and S2E). Instead, the two conformers primarily differ in the positioning of two independent mobile components in the complex. One mobile element is the bottom base module (Cps60/Cps25), which maintains a main connection to the Cps50 C-terminal extension and is not stabilized by additional peripheral interactions with other COMPASS subunits; this characteristic allows for its relative variable disposition in respect to the larger upper module (SET/Cps30/Cps40/Cps50), as also evident by the lower resolution of its EM density. The second mobile element is the N-terminal region of Cps40, which is observed to reposition around a hinge region in the protein. As a result of both elements moving inward toward each other, the second COMPASS conformer displays a more compact configuration on one side of the complex. Interestingly, this side forms an arc with dimensions that are compatible with those of a nucleosome. The center of the arc is occupied by the catalytic SET domain, while its periphery presents structural elements that are involved in chromatin binding, such as the PHD domain of Cps40, which is disordered in our maps. PHD domains have been shown to recognize histone tails (Iwase et al., 2007Iwase S. Lan F. Bayliss P. de la Torre-Ubieta L. Huarte M. Qi H.H. Whetstine J.R. Bonni A. Roberts T.M. Shi Y.

It is thus tempting to speculate that this in-built conformational variability of the Cps60-25 module and the Cps40 N-terminal region may be important for capturing nucleosomes in order to methylate H3K4 (Figure 1D).

To start delineating the function of Cps50, we obtained a 1.8-Å resolution crystal structure of the M. thermophila Cps50 protein WD40 domain, which displays a similar structural fold to the canonical WD40 domain (Figure S3A). The cryo-EM map shows that in addition to this WD40 β propeller domain, Cps50 possesses a C-terminal wire-like density of approximately 80 amino acids (Figures 2B and S4). This density emanates from the Cps50 WD40 domain and knits along the Cps30 WD40 domain, the catalytic SET domain, and the Cps60 SPRY domain and curls back toward the bottom cavity of Cps30 to finally exit through a slit between the two WD40 domains. The U-shaped wire establishes extensive contacts with most COMPASS subunits, including Cps50 itself (Figures 2 and 3). Although intensive attempts to recombinantly express individual S. cerevisiae proteins for in vitro assays were not successful, the homologous M. thermophila Cps50 binds to and co-elutes with Chaetomium thermophilum Cps30, Cps40, or Cps60 (Figure S5), further suggesting the high conservation of these COMPASS core interactions among eukaryotes.Figure 3Interface Details between Cps50 and Its Neighboring SubunitsShow full caption(A) The Cps50 protein (shown as blue ribbon) connects COMPASS subunits (surface rendering).(B–D) Zoom-in views of boxed areas 1–3.(B) The conserved Cps50 N terminus interacts with Cps30 mainly through the outer sides of fourth and fifth β sheets and also associates with the stretched region (342–347 aa) emanating from the Cps50 WD40 domain.(C) A short conserved motif in the Cps50 C terminus is engulfed in the groove formed between the Cps30 fifth and sixth β sheets.(D) The extended Cps50 C terminus is embraced by the Cps30 and Cps50 WD40 domains and the Cps40 elongated helix.See also Figures S4, S5, and S6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S5Interaction of Cps50 with Cps30, Cps40, and Cps60, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A, C, and E) Co-elution upon size exclusion chromatography of Cps50 with Cps30 (A), Cps40 (C) and Cps60 (E).(B, D, and F) Cps50 regions important for interactions are characterized by purified Cps50 fragments pulled down by GST-Cps30 (B), GST-Cps40 (D) and GST-Cps60 (F).

https://openalex.org/W2886836393,"The SET1/MLL family of histone methyltransferases is conserved in eukaryotes and regulates transcription by catalyzing histone H3K4 mono-, di-, and tri-methylation. These enzymes form a common five-subunit catalytic core whose assembly is critical for their basal and regulated enzymatic activities through unknown mechanisms. Here, we present the crystal structure of the intact yeast COMPASS histone methyltransferase catalytic module consisting of Swd1, Swd3, Bre2, Sdc1, and Set1. The complex is organized by Swd1, whose conserved C-terminal tail not only nucleates Swd3 and a Bre2-Sdc1 subcomplex, but also joins Set1 to construct a regulatory pocket next to the catalytic site. This inter-subunit pocket is targeted by a previously unrecognized enzyme-modulating motif in Swd3 and features a doorstop-style mechanism dictating substrate selectivity among SET1/MLL family members. By spatially mapping the functional components of COMPASS, our results provide a structural framework for understanding the multifaceted functions and regulation of the H3K4 methyltransferase family."
https://openalex.org/W2793483580,"The intestinal epithelium is largely maintained by self-renewing stem cells but with apparently committed progenitors also contributing, particularly following tissue damage. However, the mechanism of, and requirement for, progenitor plasticity in mediating pathological response remain unknown. Here we show that phosphorylation of the transcription factor Atoh1 is required for both the contribution of secretory progenitors to the stem cell pool and for a robust regenerative response. As confirmed by lineage tracing, Atoh1+ cells (Atoh1(WT)CreERT2 mice) give rise to multilineage intestinal clones both in the steady state and after tissue damage. In a phosphomutant Atoh1(9S/T-A)CreERT2 line, preventing phosphorylation of ATOH1 protein acts to promote secretory differentiation and inhibit the contribution of progenitors to self-renewal. Following chemical colitis, Atoh1+ cells of Atoh1(9S/T-A)CreERT2 mice have reduced clonogenicity that affects overall regeneration. Progenitor plasticity maintains robust self-renewal in the intestinal epithelium, and the balance between stem and progenitor fate is directly coordinated by ATOH1 multisite phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2887692611,"The hetero-oligomeric chaperonin of eukarya, TRiC, is required to fold the cytoskeletal protein actin. The simpler bacterial chaperonin system, GroEL/GroES, is unable to mediate actin folding. Here, we use spectroscopic and structural techniques to determine how TRiC promotes the conformational progression of actin to the native state. We find that actin fails to fold spontaneously even in the absence of aggregation but populates a kinetically trapped, conformationally dynamic state. Binding of this frustrated intermediate to TRiC specifies an extended topology of actin with native-like secondary structure. In contrast, GroEL stabilizes bound actin in an unfolded state. ATP binding to TRiC effects an asymmetric conformational change in the chaperonin ring. This step induces the partial release of actin, priming it for folding upon complete release into the chaperonin cavity, mediated by ATP hydrolysis. Our results reveal how the unique features of TRiC direct the folding pathway of an obligate eukaryotic substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2886914338,"Summary Persistent thoughts inducing irrationally pessimistic and repetitive decisions are often symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders. Regional neural hyperactivities have been associated with these disorders, but it remains unclear whether there is a specific brain region causally involved in these persistent valuations. Here, we identified potential sources of such persistent states by microstimulating the striatum of macaques performing a task by which we could quantitatively estimate their subjective pessimistic states using their choices to accept or reject conflicting offers. We found that this microstimulation induced irrationally repetitive choices with negative evaluations. Local field potentials recorded in the same microstimulation sessions exhibited modulations of beta-band oscillatory activity that paralleled the persistent negative states influencing repetitive decisions. These findings demonstrate that local striatal zones can causally affect subjective states influencing persistent negative valuation and that abnormal beta-band oscillations can be associated with persistency in valuation accompanied by an anxiety-like state."

Tbx6 is enriched in the paraxial mesoderm and is implicated in somite formation, but its function in other mesoderms remains elusive. Here, using direct reprogramming-based screening, single-cell RNA-seq in mouse embryos, and directed cardiac differentiation in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), we demonstrated that Tbx6 induces nascent mesoderm from PSCs and determines cardiovascular and somite lineage specification via its temporal expression. Tbx6 knockout in mouse PSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology inhibited mesoderm and cardiovascular differentiation, whereas transient Tbx6 expression induced mesoderm and cardiovascular specification from mouse and human PSCs via direct upregulation of Mesp1, repression of Sox2, and activation of BMP/Nodal/Wnt signaling. Notably, prolonged Tbx6 expression suppressed cardiac differentiation and induced somite lineages, including skeletal muscle and chondrocytes. Thus, Tbx6 is critical for mesoderm induction and subsequent lineage diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2887050063,"Tumor vasculature is known to be more permeable than the vasculature found in healthy tissue, which in turn can lead to a more aggressive tumor phenotype and impair drug delivery into tumors. While the stiffening of the stroma surrounding solid tumors has been reported to increase vascular permeability, the mechanism of this process remains unclear. Here, we utilize an in vitro model of tumor stiffening, ex ovo culture, and a mouse model to investigate the molecular mechanism by which matrix stiffening alters endothelial barrier function. Our data indicate that the increased endothelial permeability caused by heightened matrix stiffness can be prevented by pharmaceutical inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) both in vitro and ex ovo. Matrix stiffness-mediated FAK activation determines Src localization to cell-cell junctions, which then induces increased vascular endothelial cadherin phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. Endothelial cells in stiff tumors have more activated Src and higher levels of phosphorylated vascular endothelial cadherin at adherens junctions compared to endothelial cells in more compliant tumors. Altogether, our data indicate that matrix stiffness regulates endothelial barrier integrity through FAK activity, providing one mechanism by which extracellular matrix stiffness regulates endothelial barrier function. Additionally, our work also provides further evidence that FAK is a promising potential target for cancer therapy because FAK plays a critical role in the regulation of endothelial barrier integrity.-Wang, W., Lollis, E.

https://openalex.org/W2887587927,"Atherosclerosis is a complex disease that involves alterations in lipoprotein metabolism and inflammation. Protein and lipid glycosylation events, such as sialylation, contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and are regulated by specific glycosidases, including sialidases. To evaluate the effect of the sialidase neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) on atherogenesis, here we generated apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice that express hypomorphic levels of NEU1 (Neu1hypoApoe−/−). We found that the hypomorphic NEU1 expression in male Apoe−/− mice reduces serum levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL cholesterol, diminishes infiltration of inflammatory cells into lesions, and decreases aortic sinus atherosclerosis. Transplantation of Apoe−/− bone marrow (BM) into Neu1hypoApoe−/− mice significantly increased atherosclerotic lesion development and had no effect on serum lipoprotein levels. Moreover, Neu1hypoApoe−/− mice exhibited a reduction in circulating monocyte and neutrophil levels and had reduced hyaluronic acid and P-selectin adhesion capability on monocytes/neutrophils and T cells. Consistent with these findings, administration of a sialidase inhibitor, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid, had a significant anti-atherogenic effect in the Apoe−/− mice. In summary, the reduction in NEU1 expression or function decreases atherosclerosis in mice via its significant effects on lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes. We conclude that NEU1 may represent a promising target for managing atherosclerosis."

The microbial profiles of Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients were compared with HC and linked to therapeutic response. Microbiota composition was analysed by IS-pro technology.Microbial profiles of 104 new IBD-patients (63 CD, 41 UC, median age 14.0 years) were compared to 61 HC (median 7.8 years). IBD was mainly characterised by decreased abundance of Alistipes finegoldii and Alistipes putredinis, which characterize a healthy state microbial core. The classifier including these core species as predictors achieved an AUC of the ROC curve of .87. Core bacteria tended to regain abundance during treatment, but did not reach healthy levels.Faecal microbiota profiles of children with de novo CD and UC can be discriminated from HC with high accuracy, mainly driven by a decreased abundance of species shaping the microbial core in the healthy state. Paediatric IBD can therefore be characterized by decreased abundance of certain bacterial species reflecting the healthy state rather than by the introduction of pathogens."

We crossed wild-type and HDAC6-deficient mice and subjected the offspring to perinatal penicillin, inducing weight gain via microbiota disturbance. We observed that male HDAC6-deficient mice were not protected and developed profoundly accelerated weight gain. The antibiotic-exposed HDAC6-deficient mice showed a mixed immune phenotype with increased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation yet maintained the enhanced Treg cell-suppressive function phenotype characteristic of HDAC6-deficient mice. 16S rRNA sequencing of mouse fecal samples reveals that their microbiota diverged with time, with HDAC6 deletion altering microbiome composition. On a high-fat diet, HDAC6-deficient mice were depleted in representatives of the S24-7 family and Lactobacillus but enriched with Bacteroides and Parabacteroides; these changes are associated with obesity. Our findings further our understanding of the influence of HDACs on microbiome composition and are important for the development of HDAC6 inhibitors in the treatment of human diseases.-Lieber, A.

This approach recombines non-mutated genetic information present in two heterozygous alleles into one functional allele without using donor DNA templates."
https://openalex.org/W2886307876,"Delhi has had the distinction of being one of the most polluted cities in the world, especially in the winter months from October—January. These months coincide with the religious festival of Diwali. It is argued that air quality gets worse in the aftermath of Diwali on account of firecrackers that get burned during the festival. We use hourly data on PM 2.5 particulate concentration from 2013 to 2017 to estimate the Diwali effect on air quality in Delhi. We improve on existing work by using the event study technique as well as a difference-in-difference regression framework to estimate the Diwali effect on air quality. The results suggest that Diwali leads to a small, but statistically significant increase in air pollution. The effect is different across locations within Delhi. To our knowledge, this is the first causal estimate of the contribution of Diwali firecracker burning to air pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2885873732,The World Health Organization suggests that approximately 10% of medicines worldwide are either falsified or substandard with higher figures in low and middle income countries. Such poor quality medicines can seriously harm patients and pose a threat to the economy worldwide. This study investigates attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy as a simple and rapid method for determination of drug content in tablet dosage forms. Paracetamol was used as the model pharmaceutical ingredient. Spectra of standard mixtures of paracetamol with different excipients formed the basis for multivariate PLS based quantitative analysis of simulated tablet content using different selected infrared absorbance bands. Calibration methods using ATR-FTIR were compared with the ATR-FTIR and conventional ultraviolet spectroscopic analyses of real tablet samples and showed that the paracetamol/microcrystalline cellulose mixtures gave optimum results for all spectral bands tested. The quantitative data for band 1524–1493cm-1 was linear (R2 ˃ 0.98; LOQ ≥ 10%w/w tablet). Global examples of paracetamol tablets were tested using this protocol and 12% of the tablet samples examined was identified as substandard. Each sample analysis was completed in just a few minutes. ATR-FTIR can therefore be used in the rapid screening of tablet formulations. The simplicity of the proposed method makes it appropriate for use in low and middle income countries where analytical facilities are not available.

This study set out to analyze differences in the perception of smile esthetics among patients before and after receiving orthodontic treatment. 250 Spanish patients analyzed a single photograph in which, by means of computer software, midline diastema, black triangle, gingival margin of the left central incisor, and gingival (""gummy"") smile were altered. Each patient analyzed these images before and after undergoing orthodontic treatment. Patients scored the photographs on a scale from 1 to 10. Statistical analyses of each group's level of perception were carried out, identifying significant differences in evaluations before and after treatment, and in relation to subjects' gender and age. Patients presented significant differences in the esthetic perception of midline diastema and gummy smile anomalies after they had completed orthodontic treatment. Gender influenced the perception of smile esthetics, whereby women were significantly more critical of midline diastema, black triangle and gingival margin of the upper central incisor than men. The age variable also showed significant differences in the perception of midline diastema and black triangle anomalies. The perception of smile esthetics of some dental anomalies changes as a result of orthodontic treatment. Gender influences the perception of some of the dental anomalies studied."
https://openalex.org/W2887214571,"Background The isolation of Extended spectrum βlactamase (ESBLs) producing Enterobacteriaceae among food handlers and their implication as sources of food borne outbreaks are a public health concern. This study seeks to investigate the prevalence of faecal carriage of these bacteria among food handlers in the West Coast Region of The Gambia. Method This study enrolled 600 participants from 60 Lower Basic Schools in West Coast Region of the country. Stool samples collected from the participants were presumptively screened for the ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae, using Drigalski agar, supplemented with 2mg/L cefotaxime. The bacterial colonies that grew on each Drigalski agar were tested for ESBL production by the double disk synergy test as recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI-2015). The confirmatory analysis for ESBL was determined as the zone of inhibition of cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime to ≥5mm from that of cefotaxime /clavulanicacid and/or ceftazidime/clavulanic acid. The presumptive screening of isolates for AmpC phenotypes was done by testing the organism against cefoxitin. The prevalence of the ESBL carriage was presented in percentages. The association of risk factors to the faecal carriage of ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae was performed by Pearson Chi-squared and Fishers Exact at (p ≤ 0.05). Result The prevalence of faecal carriage ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae among food handlers was 5.0% (28/565). We found50% (14/28) and3.57% (1/28) ESBL producing bacteria were presumptive AmpC and carbapenemase resistance phenotype. Themost abundant ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae were Klebsiella spp 32.1% (9/28) and Escherichia spp 28.6% (8/28). The use of antibiotics in the last 3 months was found to be significantly associated (P = 0.012) with the faecal carriage of ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae. Conclusion The prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBLs producing Enterobacteriaceae among food handlers in the Gambia is low. The history to use of the antibiotics in the last three months was found to be significantly associated with this prevalence. Therefore, the institution of a robust antimicrobial surveillance and treatment of patients with such infections are necessary to curb the spread of these multidrug resistant bacteria in the country. Rational prescription and usage of the antibiotics especially cephalosporin should be advocated both in public and private health facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2887453450,"Culture is considered the gold standard for definitive diagnosis of mycobacterial infections. However, consensus about the most suitable culture procedure for isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria is lacking. The study compared the recoveries of mycobacteria after decontamination of spiked and fresh avian feces with 4% sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 12% sulfuric acid (H2SO4), or 1% cetylperidinium chloride (CPC), with and without mixture of three antibiotics, namely vancomycin (VAN, 100 μg/ml), nalidixic acid (NAL, 100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (AMB, 100 μg/ml). The antibiotic mixture was referred to as VNA. Decontamination procedures were evaluated using two (n = 2) avian fecal samples spiked with 106, 104, and 102 CFU/ml of Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (ATCC 15769) and fresh avian feces (n = 42). M. avium subsp. avium was detected on the culture media from spiked samples (106 and 104 CFU/ml) decontaminated with NaOH, NaOH-VNA, H2SO4, and H2SO4 -VNA for 2-6 weeks. These bacteria were detected in 2-4 weeks when using CPC and CPC-VNA. M. avium subsp. avium cannot be isolated on culture media from spiked samples (102 CFU/ml) decontaminated with any decontaminating agent. Two mycobacterial isolates, namely, Mycobacterium terrae and M. engbaekii, were isolated from field samples decontaminated with NaOH and CPC-VNA. With regard to the contamination rate, the use of CPC-VNA showed lower contamination rates (5.5% and 19.0%) from spiked and field samples than those of the other methods (NaOH: 22.2% and 59.5%, NaOH-VNA: 16.7% and 21.4%, H2SO4: 11.1% and 40.5%, H2SO4-VNA: 5.5% and 21.4%, and CPC: 66.7% and 50%). In conclusion, the decontamination of fecal samples following a two-step procedure with 1% CPC and VNA can ensure high recovery rate of many mycobacteria with the lowest contamination in cultures."

https://openalex.org/W2886805569,"Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin junctional localization is known to play a central role in vascular development, endothelial barrier integrity, and homeostasis. The sarcoma homology domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)2 has been shown to be involved in regulating endothelial barrier function; however, the mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this work SHP2 knockdown in an HUVEC monolayer increased VE-cadherin internalization and endothelial barrier permeability. Loss of SHP2 specifically augmented the GTPase activity of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-1. ARF1 knockdown or inhibition of its guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) markedly attenuated VE-cadherin internalization and barrier hyperpermeability induced by SHP2 deficiency. SHP2 knockdown increased the total and phosphorylated levels of MET, whose activity was necessary for ARF1 activation and VE-cadherin internalization. Furthermore, constitutive endothelium-specific deletion of Shp2 in mice led to disrupted endothelial cell junctions, massive hemorrhage, and lethality in embryos. Induced and endothelium-specific deletion of Shp2 in adult mice resulted in lung hyperpermeability. Inhibitors for ARF1-GEF or MET used in pregnant mice prevented the vascular leakage in endothelial Shp2-deleted embryos. Together, our findings define a novel role of SHP2 in stabilizing junctional VE-cadherin in the resting endothelial barrier through suppressing MET and ARF1 activation.-Zhang, J., Huang, J., Qi, T., Huang, Y., Lu, Y., Zhan, T., Gong, H., Zhu, Z., Shi, Y., Zhou, J., Yu, L., Zhang, X., Cheng, H., Ke, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2887946105,"Safflower is an important industrial oil seed and bioenergy crop in semi-arid subtropical regions due to its potential to grow on marginal land and having good percentage of seed oil contents which is an important parameter for biofuel production. However, it is an ignored crop in Pakistan. In order to improve the crop productivity and reduce the use of agrochemicals for sustainable biodiesel feedstock production, an experiment was conducted for two years to improve the fatty acid composition and oil quality of Carthamus tinctorius L. (safflower) by the inoculation of Azospirillum and Azotobacter alone as well as in combined application with nitrogen and phosphate (NP) fertilizers on cultivars Thori and Saif-32 under field conditions. Separation and quantification of fatty acids were done on precise comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC). The results showed that fatty acid profile specifically monounsaturated fatty acids i-e oleic acid (C18:1) was significantly improved by Azospirillum supplemented with the quarter dose of NP fertilizers (SPQ) with concomitant decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids by the respective treatment. Oil quality attributes such as acid value, saponification number, iodine value, refractive index and free fatty acid contents were reduced by the application of Azotobacter and Azospirillum in combination with half and quarter doses of NP fertilizers treatments (BTH, SPH, BTQ and SPQ). The reduction in these variables is positively linked with improved biodiesel yield and quality. It can be concluded that application of Azospirillum and Azotobacter not only reduced the use of NP fertilizers up to 50%–75% but also improved the oil quality in order to obtain environment friendly, sustainable and green fuel."
https://openalex.org/W2885517179,"Introduction Chemical disinfection is state of the art in preventing spread of infectious agents in the healthcare setting. Additionally, the antimicrobial properties of solid copper alloy surfaces against various microorganisms have recently been substantiated. Thus, antimicrobially active copper surfaces may serve as an additional barrier against distribution of pathogenic microorganisms and be combined with chemical disinfection measures in the hospital. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate on a quantitative basis whether the combination of chemical disinfectants with copper alloy surfaces results in an overall compromised, combined or even synergistic antimicrobial efficacy. Methods Experiments were carried out using the quantitative carrier test devised by the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (DGHM) to study antimicrobial efficacy of chemical disinfectants. Requirements for microbicidal efficacy as defined by prEN 14885 were applied. The chemical disinfectants tested in our study contained alcohols (ethanol, 1-propanol), quaternary ammonium compounds (benzalkonium chloride) and glutaraldehyde as actives. Quantitative carrier tests were carried out on different carriers (tiles, copper alloy discs, stainless steel discs) using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Kocuria rhizophila and Candida albicans as test organisms. Results For the alcohol-based disinfectant no difference in antimicrobial efficacy was observed when applied to antimicrobial active copper alloy carriers, tiles or stainless steel discs. For all test organisms microbial contamination was reduced to the detection limit of < 1 log (CFU/ml) within a contact time of 2 min indicating a ≥ 5 log reduction for the tested bacteria and a ≥ 4 log reduction for the yeast, as being requested for chemical disinfectants by prEN 14885. In order to elucidate a potential synergism the chemical disinfectant based on quaternary ammonium compounds (benzalkonium chloride) and glutaraldehyde was used at a sub-effective concentration. Hence, no complete reduction of microbial contamination was achieved on stainless steel or tile carriers for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Interestingly, when using copper alloy carriers complete reduction indicating a ≥ 5 log reduction for P. aeruginosa and a ≥ 4 log reduction for C. albicans was detected. Thus, data of this study indicates that solid copper alloy surfaces and disinfectants synergize. Conclusions According to this data, commercially available disinfectants based on alcohol, quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde can effectively be combined in a dual strategy with solid copper alloy surfaces to reduce microbial contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2887798233,"Background With widespread use of the internet, lifestyle and dietary data collection can now be facilitated using online questionnaires as opposed to paper versions. We have developed a graphical food frequency assessment app (eNutri), which is able to assess dietary intake using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and provide personalised nutrition advice. FFQ user acceptance and evaluation have not been investigated extensively and only a few studies involving user acceptance of nutrition assessment and advice apps by older adults are published. Methods A formative study with 20 participants (including n = 10 ≥60 years) assessed the suitability of this app for adults and investigated improvements to its usability. The outcomes of this formative study were applied to the final version of the application, which was deployed in an online study (EatWellUK) with 324 participants (including n = 53 ≥60 years) in the UK, using different devices (smartphones, tablets and laptops/desktops). Completion times were based on browser timestamps and usability was measured using the System Usability Scale (SUS), scoring between 0 and 100. Products with a SUS score higher than 70 are considered to be good. Results In the EatWellUK study, SUS score median (n = 322) was 77.5 (IQR 15.0). Out of the 322 SUS questionnaire completions, 321 device screen sizes were detected by the app. Grouped by device screen size, small (n = 92), medium (n = 38) and large (n = 191) screens received median SUS scores of 77.5 (IQR 15.0), 75.0 (IQR 19.4) and 77.5 (IQR 16.25), respectively. The median SUS scores from younger (n = 268) and older participants (n = 53) were the same. The FFQ contained 157 food items, and the mean completion time was 13.1 minutes (95% CI 12.6–13.7 minutes). Small, medium and large screen devices resulted in completion times of 11.7 minutes (95% CI 10.9–12.6 minutes), 14.4 minutes (95% CI 12.9–15.9 minutes) and 13.6 minutes (95% CI 12.8–14.3 minutes), respectively. Conclusions The overall median SUS score of 77.5 and overall mean completion time of 13.3 minutes indicate good overall usability, and equally, comparable SUS scores and completion times across small, medium and large screen sizes indicates good usability across devices. This work is a step toward the promotion of wider uptake of online apps that can provide online dietary intake assessment at-scale, with the aim of addressing pressing epidemiological challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2885360910,"The receptor cycle of type I peroxisomal matrix protein import is completed by ubiquitination of the membrane-bound peroxisome biogenesis factor 5 (Pex5p) and its subsequent export back to the cytosol. The receptor export is the only ATP-dependent step of the whole process and is facilitated by two members of the AAA family of proteins (ATPases associated with various cellular activities), namely Pex1p and Pex6p. To gain further insight into substrate recognition by the AAA complex, we generated an N-terminally linked ubiquitin-Pex5p fusion protein. This fusion protein displayed biological activity because it is able to functionally complement a PEX5-deletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro assays revealed its interaction at WT level with the native cargo protein Pcs60p and Pex14p, a constituent of the receptor docking complex. We also demonstrate in vitro deubiquitination by the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp15p. In vitro pulldown assays and cross-linking studies demonstrate that Pex5p recognition by the AAA complex depends on the presence of the ubiquitin moiety and is mediated by Pex1p."
https://openalex.org/W2887060493,"Individuals’ attitudes toward evidence-based practices (EBP) are critical in adopting, implementing and maintaining the EBP in clinical settings. Multiple empirical studies have examined how work context may shape perceptions and attitudes towards EBP. The current study aims to further explore how both work and family contexts, as assessed by three psychosocial indicators (i.e., occupational stress, work-related social support from coworkers, and work-related social support from family), may affect attitudes toward EBP among health care providers in HIV clinics in China. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from 357 health care providers recruited from 40 HIV clinics across 16 cities/counties in Guangxi China. Structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to test the hypothesized relationships among key study variables. Occupational stress was negatively associated with work-related social support from coworkers (β = -.19, 95%CI = [-.31,-.12]), which in turn was positively associated with attitudes toward EBP (β = .17, 95%CI = [.04, .30]). Similarly, occupational stress was negatively related to work-related social support from family (β = -.34, 95%CI = [-.42,-.25]), which in turn was positively related to attitudes toward EBP (β = .23, 95%CI = [.12, .35]). Occupational stress was negatively associated with attitudes toward EBP, but the magnitude of association did not reach statistical significance at α = .05. Work-related social support from family partially mediated the association between occupational stress and attitudes toward EBP (Sobel’s z = 3.27, p < .05). Our findings suggest the importance of integrating work and family contexts, especially family support into the strategies of facilitating the adoption and implementation of EBP. The current study also underscores the needs to reduce occupational stress and enhance work-related social support among health care providers who are in frequent contact with HIV patients. In addition, lack of work-related family support may be a main barrier preventing health care providers from developing a positive attitude toward EBP. Therefore, the interventions aiming for promoting adoption and utilization of EBP need to involve specific strategies to resolve work-family conflicts and improve family members’ understanding and support for health care providers in China, especially those who work in a stressful work context such as HIV care."
https://openalex.org/W2887848649,"Background Though many overweight and obese adults attempt to lose weight without formal support, little is known about the strategies used in self-directed weight loss attempts. We set out to assess cognitive and behavioural strategies for weight loss and their associations with weight change. Methods Prospective, web-based cohort study of overweight UK adults (BMI≥25kg/m2) trying to lose weight through behaviour change. Strategy use was assessed using the OxFAB questionnaire and evaluated (1) at the domain level, (2) through exploratory factor analysis, and (3) in a model of strategies deemed a priori to be “essential” to weight management. Associations with weight change at 3 months were tested using linear regression. Results 486 participants answered all questions; 194 reported weight at baseline and at 3 months (mean weight change -3.3kg (SD 4.1)). Greater weight loss was significantly associated with the motivational support domain (-2.4kg, 95% CI -4.4 to -0.4), dietary impulse control (from factor analysis) (-0.6kg, 95% CI -1.1 to -0.03), and weight loss planning and monitoring (from factor analysis) (-1.3kg, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.5). Higher scores in the model of essential behavioural strategies were significantly associated with greater weight loss (compared to participants using 6 or fewer of the 9 strategies, using 7 or more of the 9 strategies was associated with a 2.13kg greater weight loss (SE 0.58, p<0.001)). Conclusions Despite heterogeneity in the strategies employed for weight loss, coherent patterns of behaviours emerged for individual participants, some of which were associated with greater weight loss, including strategies relating to dietary impulse control, weight loss planning and monitoring, motivational support, information seeking and self-monitoring. Trials could test the effect of promoting use of these patterns on weight loss."
https://openalex.org/W2885976333,"The critically endangered spotted handfish (Brachionichthys hirsutus) is restricted to a limited number of locations in south-eastern Tasmania, Australia. As is often the case for rare species, conducting statistically adequate surveys for B. hirsutus can be costly and time consuming due to the low probability of encountering individuals. For the first time we used a highly efficient and rigorous Global Positioning System (GPS) parameterised underwater visual census (GUVC) to survey B. hirsutus abundance within all nine known local populations in the Derwent Estuary within one season. In addition, a benthic microhabitat assessment was conducted simultaneously using a GoPro® camera attached to diver to determine B. hirsutus microhabitat preferences. B. hirsutus local populations varied between sites, with densities ranging from 1.58 to 43.0 fishes per hectare. B. hirsutus demonstrates a strong preference for complex microhabitat features, such as depressions and ripple formations filled with biogenic substrates (e.g. shells) but avoids simple, low relief microhabitats (e.g. sand flats) and areas dominated by ephemeral, filamentous algae. Complex microhabitats may enable B. hirsutus to avoid predators, increase forage opportunities or provide higher quality spawning sites. This first wide-scale application of GUVC for B. hirsutus allowed us to survey a larger number of sites than previously possible to provide a robust reference point for future long-term monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2887099790,"Background Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) is used to treat children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Standard RUTF uses milk as the primary protein source, which makes the product expensive, and given the high worldwide SAM burden, having a less expensive effective alternative is a public health priority. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate whether newly developed amino acid-enriched milk-free RUTF (FSMS-RUTF) or amino acid-enriched low-milk RUTF (MSMS-RUTF) treatment could replenish plasma amino acids to levels comparable to those following standard peanut-milk RUTF (PM-RUTF) treatment and to improve understanding of the effects of treatment on anthropometric measurements. A secondary analysis was performed to test the noninferiority hypothesis of plasma essential amino acid (EAA) levels. Methods Plasma EAA levels were measured in a nonblinded, 3-arm, parallel-group simple randomized controlled trial conducted in Malawi to examine the efficacy of FSMS-RUTF, MSMS-RUTF and PM-RUTF in the treatment of SAM in 2 groups of children aged 6–23 and 24–59 months (mo). Sample size calculations were performed based on the previous our study. A noninferiority margin was set at -25% of the PM-RUTF arm at discharge. Results The relative values of the differences (95% CI) in plasma EAA levels between PM-RUTF treatment and FSMS-RUTF and MSMS-RUTF treatments at discharge were -7.9% (-18.6, 2.8) and 9.8% (0.2, 19.5), respectively, in children aged 6–23 mo, while in those aged 24–59 mo, the difference values were 17.8% (1.6, 34.1) and 13.6% (-2.8, 29.9), respectively. Conclusion At discharge, the plasma EAA concentrations in 6-59-mo-old SAM children treated with FSMS-RUTF and MSMS-RUTF were not less than those of children treated with PM-RUTF. These findings indicate that treatment with either of the 3 RUTFs was associated with adequate protein synthesis and that all the formulations provided sufficient functional metabolites of plasma amino acids to support nutritional recovery from SAM."
https://openalex.org/W2886146269,"In this study, 285 lentil genotypes were phenotyped under hydroponic and alkaline field conditions. Significant genotypic variation for alkalinity stress was observed among the six Lens species screened hydroponically and in the field having pH up to 9.1. The crucial parameters, like whole Na+ and K+ contents and the Na+/K+ ratio at 40 mM NaHCO3 were found significantly correlated with seedling survivability under hydroponics (r = -0.95, r = 0.93 and -0.97). Genotypes, ranked on the bases of seed yield, restricted uptake of Na+ with thick pith area, increased vascular bundles, less H2O2 production and low Na+/K+ ratio, were found important physio-anatomical traits for alkalinity stress tolerance. The proper regulation of Na+ uptake was found for maintaining higher K+. This relationship is probably the main factor responsible for a better mechanism for tolerance to high pH up to 9.1 in tolerant breeding lines PDL-1 and PSL-9 (cultivars) and ILWL-15, ILWL-192 and ILWL-20 (wild accessions). Based on UPGMA dendrogram, all the genotypes were clustered into four diverse groups. DMRT was implied within the group to differentiate genotypes based on phenotypic response under alkalinity stress. These results can be utilized for selecting diverse parents for developing alkalinity tolerant genotypes."

The aim of this study is to analyze the metastasis patterns and prognosis differences for patients with stage IV liver cancers. Methods A SEER analysis was performed. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to further analyze survival outcome and other prognostic factors. Results A total of 37526 eligible cases were retrieved in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Among these patients, stage of IV liver cancer accounted for 14.80% (5555/37526) at initial diagnosis. Patients who suffered bone, brain or lung metastasis occupied 55.61% (3089/5555). Comparing with other two single metastases, the patients with brain metastasis exhibited worst overall survival whose mean of survival was 4.758 months. Multivariate analysis with Cox hazard regression model showed that metastatic site was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival and cancer-specific survival in patients with single metastasis (P<0.05). The results of univariate analysis showed that metastatic pattern was significantly correlated with overall survival (P = 0.038) and cancer-specific survival (P = 0.035) of patients with two sites. Conclusions Lung was the most common site of single metastasis for liver cancers. Patients with bone metastasis had best survival outcome comparing with other two distant metastases. Patients with two metastatic sites, where one of them is the lung tends to have a slight trend to a worse outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2886399070,"Obesity is a low-grade inflammatory disease that increases the risk for metabolic disorders. CD40-CD40L signaling plays a central role in obesity-induced inflammation. Genetic deficiency of CD40L in diet-induced obesity (DIO) ameliorates adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic steatosis and increases insulin sensitivity. Unexpectedly, absence of CD40 worsened insulin resistance and caused excessive adipose tissue inflammation and hepatosteatosis. To investigate whether deficiency of macrophage CD40 is responsible for the phenotype observed in the CD40-/- mice, we generated CD40flflLysMcre and fed them a standard (SFD) and 54% high fat obesogenic diet (HFD) for 13 weeks. No differences in body weight, adipose tissue weight, adipocyte size, plasma cholesterol or triglyceride levels could be observed between CD40flflLysMcre and wild type (WT) mice. CD40flflLysMcre displayed no changes in glucose tolerance or insulin resistance, but had higher plasma adiponectin levels when fed a SFD. Liver weights, liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as the degree of hepatosteatosis were not affected by absence of macrophage CD40. CD40flflLysMcre mice displayed a minor increase in adipose tissue leukocyte infiltration on SFD and HFD, which did not result in differences in adipose tissue cytokine levels. We here show that loss of macrophage CD40 signaling does not affect obesity induced metabolic dysregulation and indicates that CD40-deficiency on other cell-types than the macrophage is responsible for the metabolic dysregulation, adipose tissue inflammation and hepatosteatosis that are observed in CD40-/- mice."
https://openalex.org/W2885031368,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) induce mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) and enhance the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, BMPs are also signaling molecules critical for arresting reprogramming in the pre-iPSC state. In this study, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that the time- and concentration-dependent effects of BMPs on reprogramming are mediated by Msh homeobox 2 (MSX2), a homeobox-containing transcription factor. BMPs up-regulated Msx2 by activating SMAD1/5, and MSX2 then directly bound to the promoters and up-regulated the expression of the cadherin 1 (Cdh1, also known as E-cadherin), GATA-binding protein 3 (Gata3), and Nanog genes. Cdh1 contributed to BMP4- and MSX2-induced MET and subsequently promoted reprogramming. On the other hand, GATA3 promoted reprogramming, possibly by up-regulating Spalt-like transcription factor 4 (SALL4) expression. As key transcriptional factors in maintaining pluripotency, up-regulation of SALL4 and NANOG enhanced reprogramming. Moreover, the ability of MSX2 to up-regulate Cdh1, Gata3, Nanog, and Sall4 was further potentiated in the presence of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). However, MSX2 did not mediate the effects of BMP4 signaling on activation of the microRNAs miR-205 and miR-200 or the inhibitory effects that arrested reprogramming in the pre-iPSC state. In conclusion, MSX2 partially mediates the effects of BMP4 signaling during reprogramming, improving our understanding of the role of BMP signaling in MET and of the connection between cell lineage specifiers such as MSX2 and GATA3 and pluripotency. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) induce mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) and enhance the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, BMPs are also signaling molecules critical for arresting reprogramming in the pre-iPSC state. In this study, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that the time- and concentration-dependent effects of BMPs on reprogramming are mediated by Msh homeobox 2 (MSX2), a homeobox-containing transcription factor. BMPs up-regulated Msx2 by activating SMAD1/5, and MSX2 then directly bound to the promoters and up-regulated the expression of the cadherin 1 (Cdh1, also known as E-cadherin), GATA-binding protein 3 (Gata3), and Nanog genes. Cdh1 contributed to BMP4- and MSX2-induced MET and subsequently promoted reprogramming. On the other hand, GATA3 promoted reprogramming, possibly by up-regulating Spalt-like transcription factor 4 (SALL4) expression. As key transcriptional factors in maintaining pluripotency, up-regulation of SALL4 and NANOG enhanced reprogramming. Moreover, the ability of MSX2 to up-regulate Cdh1, Gata3, Nanog, and Sall4 was further potentiated in the presence of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). However, MSX2 did not mediate the effects of BMP4 signaling on activation of the microRNAs miR-205 and miR-200 or the inhibitory effects that arrested reprogramming in the pre-iPSC state. In conclusion, MSX2 partially mediates the effects of BMP4 signaling during reprogramming, improving our understanding of the role of BMP signaling in MET and of the connection between cell lineage specifiers such as MSX2 and GATA3 and pluripotency.

However, BMPs have complex and sometimes controversial functions during reprogramming, from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to iPSCs (22Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Golipour A. David L. Sung H.K.

BMP-dependent induction of miR-205 and miR-200a/b/c leads to mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET), which has been suggested to be a critical step during the initial phase of reprogramming (23Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F. Zhuang Q. Qin B. Xu J. Li W. Yang J.

In addition to MET, BMP-dependent signaling also enhances the expression of Nanog and Sall4, which are required for the establishment of pluripotency in MEFs (24Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G.

Sequential expression of pluripotency markers during direct reprogramming of mouse somatic cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2 (10.1016/j.stem.2008.01.004 18371436): 151-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 25Tsubooka N.

BMPs have been identified as critical signaling molecules in arresting reprogramming in the pre-iPSC state (28Chen J. Liu H. Liu J. Qi J. Wei B. Yang J. Liang H. Chen Y. Chen J. Wu Y. Guo L. Zhu J. Zhao X. Peng T. Zhang Y. et al.H3K9 methylation is a barrier during somatic cell reprogramming into iPSCs.Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 (23202127): 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Thus, not all BMP-dependent signaling is beneficial for reprogramming. In addition, the BMP4–MSX2 axis promotes mesodermal commitment by inducing epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is not consistent with BMP's functions during reprogramming. The ability of Msx2 to induce both MET and EMT has been observed in different experimental systems (29Cheng S.L. Shao J.S. Behrmann A. Krchma K. Towler D.A. Dkk1 and MSX2-Wnt7b signaling reciprocally regulate the endothelial-mesenchymal transition in aortic endothelial cells.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Physiol. 2009; 219 (10.1002/jcp.21712 19170109): 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), possibly because of the different partners with which MSX2 associates. Therefore, in this study, by using reprogramming from MEFs to iPSCs as a major experimental model, we elucidated the mechanisms underlying modulation of the BMP4–MSX2 axis during reprogramming and how Msx2 mediates the beneficial or inhibitory roles of BMPs. Different concentrations of BMP4 and LDN-193189, an inhibitor of the BMP signaling pathway, were used at different periods during reprogramming from MEFs to iPSCs. A low concentration of BMP4 (2.5 ng/ml) promoted reprogramming at the early stage (days 0–5) but had little effect at the middle (days 5–10) or late (days 10–15) stages (Fig. 1A). A high concentration of BMP4 (10 ng/ml) inhibited reprogramming constantly (Fig. 1A). However, LDN-193189 impaired reprogramming at all tested concentrations and mainly at the early stage during reprogramming (Fig. 1B), which suggested that a low to medium level of activation of BMP signaling was required for reprogramming. In summary, the beneficial roles of BMP signaling could be observed only at relatively low concentrations and at an early stage during reprogramming. We then checked the expression of various factors in the BMP pathway (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 04350) based on a previously reported microarray dataset (GSE21757) (22Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Golipour A. David L. Sung H.K. Beyer T.A. Datti A. Woltjen K. Nagy A. Wrana J.L. Functional genomics reveals a BMP-driven mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the initiation of somatic cell reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7 (10.1016/j.stem.2010.04.015 20621051): 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Of the 36 genes analyzed, only four genes were up-regulated to more than 2-fold or down-regulated to below 50% of basal levels (Fig. S1A). This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that low to medium levels of activation of the BMP pathway are required for reprogramming. We then determined the ability of BMP4 to up-regulate downstream effectors such as Msx1/2/3 (16Xu R.H. Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. BMP4 initiates human embryonic stem cell differentiation to trophoblast.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20 (10.1038/nbt761 12426580): 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 17Zhou J. Su P. Li D. Tsang S. Duan E. Wang F. High-efficiency induction of neural conversion in human ESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells with a single chemical inhibitor of transforming growth factor β superfamily receptors.Stem Cells. 2010; 28 (10.1002/stem.504 20734356): 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 1C and Fig. S1, B and C, BMP4 up-regulated Msx1/2/3 in concentration-dependent manner and up-regulated Msx2 more than Msx1 and Msx3. Retroviruses encoding Msx genes and shRNAs against them were delivered into MEFs. Msx2 had a higher ability to promote reprogramming than Msx1 and Msx3 (Fig. 1D). In addition, only shRNA against Msx2, but not against Msx1 or Msx3, significantly attenuated the ability of 2.5 ng/ml BMP4 to promote reprogramming (Fig. 1E). The GFP+ colonies generated with Msx2 overexpression had typical characteristics of iPSCs, including suppressed expression of exogenous Yamanaka factors, high expression of endogenous pluripotent factors, normal karyotypes, low DNA methylation of Nanog and Oct4 promoters, and the ability to generate chimera mice (Fig. S2). When retroviruses encoding Msx2 and the corresponding shRNA were delivered into MEFs at different time points during reprogramming, larger modulations on reprogramming were observed when infections were performed at the beginning of reprogramming (Fig. 1F). Therefore, Msx2 also regulates reprogramming at the early stage, which is consistent with the functions of BMP4. Retroviruses encoding different truncations of MSX2 were prepared and tested (Fig. 1G). Both the C terminus and homeobox domain, a DNA binding domain, were required for MSX2 to promote reprogramming (Fig. 1H) (15Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Battaile J.T. Towler D.A. Structure-function analysis of Msx2-mediated transcriptional suppression.Biochemistry. 1997; 36 (10.1021/bi971008x 9265625): 10451-10462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, mutating the DNA binding site of MSX2 (N192A and T194K) totally destroyed its ability to promote reprogramming, and the homeobox domain functioned as a dominant-negative factor when used alone. Therefore, Msx2 mediates the beneficial roles of BMP signaling during reprogramming by functioning as a transcriptional factor. Phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 are conventional downstream cascades of the BMP pathway. It was reasonable to suggest a direct pathway from BMP4 to Msx2 via phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8. To confirm this, shRNAs against Smad1 and Smad5 were used. On one hand, either shRNA against Smad1 or against Smad5 inhibited the ability of 2.5 ng/ml BMP4 to promote reprogramming, possibly because of the ability of these shRNAs to block BMP4-induced up-regulation of Msx2 both in MEFs and during reprogramming (Fig. 2, A and B). On the other hand, overexpression of Smad1 or Smad5 promoted the generation of iPSCs, which could be attenuated by suppressing Msx2 (Fig. 2C). This phenomenon was consistent with the ability of Smad1 and Smad5 to increase the expression of Msx2 both in MEFs and during reprogramming (Fig. 2D). A luciferase assay with the Msx2 promoter further supported targeting of SMAD1/5 to Msx2. Overexpression of Smad1 or Smad5 increased the activity of the WT Msx promoter but not that of the mutated promoter (deletion in −773 to −768 relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS)) (Fig. 2E). Therefore, Msx2 is a direct downstream target of BMP4 and SMAD1/5 not only in MEFs but also during reprogramming. Retroviruses encoding Msx2 and the corresponding shRNAs were used during reprogramming, and gene expression profiles were analyzed on day 4 and day 8 (GSE114120) (Table S1). MEFs and R1 ES cells were used as controls. We focused on genes whose expression in R1 ES cells was more than 2-fold or less than 50% of that in MEFs (Fig. 3A). Introducing Msx2 and the corresponding shRNA did not change the overall progress of reprogramming but did induce some expression changes (Fig. 3A). Genes that were significantly regulated by Msx2 (expression in the Msx2 group was more than 2-fold or less than 50% of that in the control group) were subjected to gene ontology (GO) analysis. Genes up-regulated by Msx2 on day 4 were enriched for GO terms linked to the extracellular matrix, lung development, ion binding, and regulation of the biosynthetic process, whereas down-regulated genes were enriched for tube development and regulation of transcription (Fig. 3B). Of the 593 up-regulated genes, 425 genes (71.7%) had higher or equal expression in R1 ES cells compared with MEFs. Of the 579 down-regulated genes, 419 genes (72.4%) had lower or equal expression in R1 ES cells compared with MEFs (Fig. 3C). Thus, the changes in gene expression profiles were consistent with the ability of Msx2 to promote reprogramming. Among the genes regulated by Msx2, we identified multiple genes, like Cdh1, Gata3, Nanog, and Sall4 (Fig. 3D), that are beneficial for reprogramming (3Yu J. Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K.

Cell Biol. 2013; 15 (10.1038/ncb2765 23708003): 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, BMP signaling promotes reprogramming by facilitating MET at least partially (22Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Golipour A. David L. Sung H.K. Beyer T.A. Datti A. Woltjen K. Nagy A. Wrana J.L.

Thus, it was reasonable for us to suggest that Msx2 mediates the ability of BMP signaling to facilitate MET. Three epithelial markers and eight mesenchymal markers were monitored after Msx2 overexpression with qPCR. Seven markers were significantly regulated by Msx2, and all detected modulations on these markers suggested promoted MET (Fig. 3E). Another method that calculates the changes of epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics of cells using the expression of selected markers was also used (33Liang L. Sun H. Zhang W. Zhang M. Yang X.

Based on current RNA-seq results, an increase in the epithelial score and decrease in the mesenchymal score were observed after Msx2 overexpression (Fig. 3F). The migration ability of cells was determined with a transwell assay and live imaging system. Overexpression of Msx2 decreased the migration ability of cells, and shRNA against Msx2 attenuated the ability of BMP4 to modulate cell migration (Fig. 3, G–J). Therefore, Msx2 mediates the ability of BMP signaling to facilitate partial MET. Because shRNA against Msx2 did not fully attenuate the abilities of BMP4 to promote reprogramming and to modulate cell migration (Figs. 1E and 3, I and J), BMP signaling might facilitate MET via additional pathways, such as the miR-205 and miR-200 families, as suggested in a previous report (22Samavarchi-Tehrani P. Golipour A. David L. Sung H.K. Beyer T.A. Datti A. Woltjen K. Nagy A. Wrana J.L. Functional genomics reveals a BMP-driven mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the initiation of somatic cell reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7 (10.1016/j.stem.2010.04.015 20621051): 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. S3, 2.5 ng/ml BMP4, but not Msx2, increased the expression of miR-205 and miR-200a/b/c. In addition, shRNA against Msx2 did not affect the ability of BMP signaling to affect miRNAs. Therefore, Msx2 partially mediates the ability of BMP signaling to facilitate MET, possibility by up-regulating Cdh1. Overexpression of Msx2 up-regulates Cdh1, Gata3, Nanog, and Sall4 and subsequently promotes reprogramming. However, whether BMP signaling promotes reprogramming similarly requires further investigation. BMP4 at a 2.5 ng/ml concentration and a retrovirus encoding Smad1 up-regulated the expression of Cdh1, Gata3, and Nanog both in MEFs and during reprogramming (Fig. 4, A–C). shRNA against Msx2 attenuated this up-regulation, which confirmed that both BMP signaling and Msx2 promoted reprogramming by activating Cdh1, Gata3, and Nanog. However, significant up-regulation of Sall4 was only observed during reprogramming, but not in MEFs (Fig. 4D), possibly because Gata3, but not Msx2, was the direct upstream regulator of Sall4 (31Shu J. Zhang K. Zhang M. Yao A. Shao S. Du F. Yang C. Chen W. Wu C. Yang W. Sun Y. Deng H. GATA family members as inducers for cellular reprogramming to pluripotency.Cell Res. 2015; 25 (10.1038/cr.2015.6 25591928): 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Actually, overexpression of Gata3 up-regulated Sall4 both in MEFs and during reprogramming (Fig. 4E). shRNA against Gata3 attenuated the ability of Msx2 to up-regulate Sall4 during reprogramming (Fig. 4E). Thus, Msx2 up-regulates Sall4 by up-regulating Gata3. We then used the Cdh1, Gata3, Nanog, and Sall4 promoters (−1. 6 to +0.12 kb relative to the TSS) to drive luciferase expression. The potential binding sites of MSX2 were predicted and deleted on these promoters based on the information provided by JASPAR 2018 (Fig. 4F) (12Khan A. Fornes O. Stigliani A. Gheorghe M.

A luciferase assay confirmed direct targeting of MSX2 to Cdh1, Gata3, and Nanog promoters but not Sall4 promoter (Fig. 4G). By using primers surrounding the predicted binding sites (Table S2), ChIP–qPCR analysis further confirmed the targeting (Fig. 4H). The targeting of GATA3 to the Sall4 promoter was confirmed in a similar manner. Overexpression of Gata3 activated the WT Sall4 promoter. Mutating either the binding domain of GATA3 or the binding motif on the Sall4 promoter diminished the increase in luciferase expression (Fig. 4I). ChIP–qPC"

Here, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the death of Bacillus pumilus spores after exposure to electric arcs in water. Cutting-edge microscopies at the nanoscale did not reveal any structural disorganization of spores exposed to electric arcs. This result suggested the absence of physical destruction by a propagating shock wave or an exposure to an electric field. However, Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed genomic DNA damage induced by UV radiation and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).

Banana flower thrips occurred throughout the year with monthly variation, and the maximum occurrence was observed in October and November during the bud burst (73.80 ± 6.32 adults/trap) and young fruit (70.06 ± 5.69 adults/trap) periods. The damage rates were as follows: interior flowers >3rd-layer flowers > 2nd-layer flowers > 1st-layer flowers > young fruits. This result indicates that thrips migrated to lower bracts, young fruits, and other flower buds as bracts gradually opened. Results also showed that the reducing sugar, vitamin C, protein and ash contents in thrips-damaged flowers were all significantly lower than those in undamaged flowers, while there was no significant difference between damaged and undamaged young banana fruit. Our results indicated that the abundances of banana flower thrips were closely associated with the growing stage of banana. Thrips mainly infested flower buds and caused a reduction in nutrients for the host plant, especially the reducing sugar and vitamin C contents, which reduced the nutritional quality of banana fruits and the quality of flower bud by-products of banana."

Early genetic studies into AD uncovered variants in several genes involved in the production of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, leading to the formulation of the amyloid hypothesis: Extracellular deposits of Aβ are neurotoxic and are the underlying cause of the disease. However, more recent genome-wide association studies and whole genome sequencing approaches have uncovered several additional genes that modulate risk for AD, including a number functioning within the immune system, such as TREM2, CR1, and CD33 (1.Heneka M.T.

In particular, the R47H variant of TREM2 is associated with a 3–5-fold increased risk for late-onset AD (2.Guerreiro R. Wojtas A. Bras J. Carrasquillo M. Rogaeva E. Majounie E. Cruchaga C. Sassi C.

Alzheimer's disease phosphatidylserine positive ligand–interacting surface amyloid-β complementarity-determining region. TREM2 is an immune receptor expressed on myeloid lineage cells, including the brain-resident microglia that constantly scavenge the brain, looking for and removing plaques and damaged cells. TREM2 forms a signaling complex with the adaptor protein DAP12 and is activated by ligand binding, which initiates phagocytosis. The extracellular region of the receptor contains a single V-set Ig-like domain, similar to an antibody-variable domain, on whose surface most AD-associated variants map (4.Kober D.L.

Data from the past 5 years indicate that TREM2 functions as a rather promiscuous pattern recognition receptor, binding to a range of targets, including membrane phospholipids (5.Wang Y. Cella M.

WT TREM2 appears critical for microglial modulation into a more phagocytic state, able to ameliorate AD via clearance of amyloid plaques and neuronal debris. One study also demonstrated that WT, but not R47H, TREM2 Ig-like domain shed from microglia in a soluble form is able to decorate the surfaces of amyloid plaques and neurons (8.Song W.M. Joshita S.

That TREM2 performs a critical role in regulating microglial activation is clear. However, the precise mechanisms leading to loss-of-function in R47H TREM2 and the functional consequences at the molecular level remain poorly defined. In their study, Sudom et al. (10.Sudom A.

A previous publication (4.Kober D.L. Alexander-Brett J.M. Karch C.M. Cruchaga C. Colonna M. Holtzman M.J. Brett T.J. Neurodegenerative disease mutations in TREM2 reveal a functional surface and distinct loss-of-function mechanisms.Elife. 2016; 5 (27995897): e2039110.7554/eLife.20391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) determined a structure for WT TREM2 at low resolution, defining the overall fold. Here, Sudom et al. (10.Sudom A. Talreja S. Danao J. Bragg E. Kegel R. Min X. Sharkov N. Marcora E. Thibault S. Bradley J. Wood S. Lim A.-C. Chen H. Wang S. Foltz I.N. Sambashivan S. Wang Z.

The authors screened several expression systems and constructs with differing termini and glycosylation site mutations, indicating the challenges of crystallizing this protein. WT TREM2 was expressed in mammalian HEK293-S cells, whereas the R47H protein was refolded following expression in an insoluble form in Escherichia coli. Overall, the WT and R47H structures are highly similar, conforming to the expected fold for a V-set Ig-like domain. By analogy with antibody-variable domains, the TREM2 domain possesses three complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, and it is in the CDR2 loop that a striking difference is observed: The loop remodels from an irregular conformation in the WT structure to a short helix in the R47H structure (Fig. 1). This alteration can be directly explained by the set of interactions that the residue at position 47 in the neighboring CDR1 loop makes with residues in the CDR2 loop. Arg47 extends out from CDR1 toward CDR2 and makes several hydrogen bonds to residues in CDR2, acting to stabilize the conformation of this loop. In contrast, the side-chain of His47 is unable to make the same set of contacts, and, as a result, the R47H CDR2 loop swings out into a different conformation. The R47H CDR2 loop and surrounding regions of the structure display increased B-factors, suggesting increased flexibility, and the authors go on to show that this flexibility correlates with a reduced thermal stability in vitro and furthermore with a reduction in soluble TREM2 levels in a R47H TREM2 CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited mouse. The previous publication describing a lower resolution WT TREM2 structure introduced the concept of a positive ligand-interacting surface (PLIS) on one face of TREM2 (4.Kober D.L. Alexander-Brett J.M. Karch C.M. Cruchaga C. Colonna M. Holtzman M.J. Brett T.J.

Sudom et al. (10.Sudom A. Talreja S. Danao J. Bragg E. Kegel R. Min X. Sharkov N. Marcora E. Thibault S. Bradley J. Wood S. Lim A.-C. Chen H. Wang S. Foltz I.N. Sambashivan S. Wang Z.

This results in R47H TREM2 exhibiting reduced binding to phosphatidylserine (PS) and reduced signaling upon stimulation by PS in a reporter cell line. The authors also provide significant new insight into the nature of ligand binding through the observation of a hexameric arrangement of WT (but not R47H) TREM2 in the crystal structure. Although the interaction surface areas are not extensive, the authors were able to demonstrate that addition of PS induces a ligand-driven oligomerization of the WT protein in solution as observed by light-scattering measurements. To further investigate the interaction of PS with WT TREM2, the structure of the complex was determined. Three PS molecules were located per hexamer, with each binding primarily to a single protomer, but with additional contacts to a neighboring protomer, explaining the ligand-induced oligomerization. The negatively charged head group of PS interacts with several positively charged side chains, particularly in the CDR2 loop. The structural basis for the effects of the R47H mutation on TREM2 function reported by Sudom et al. (10.Sudom A. Talreja S. Danao J. Bragg E. Kegel R. Min X. Sharkov N. Marcora E. Thibault S.

That is, activation of TREM2 drives a phagocytic microglial response enabling clearance of amyloid plaques and associated debris. Several other mutations associated with AD, such as R62H, also map to the PLIS described in the paper and likely lead to a similar disruption of this surface and consequent effects on stability and ligand binding. TREM2 binds a range of ligands, including the recently reported Aβ (6.Zhao Y. Wu X. Li X. Jiang L.-L. Gui X. Liu Y. Sun Y. Zhu B. Piña-Crespo J.C. Zhang M. Zhang N. Chen X. Bu G. An Z. Huang T.Y.

The possibility of ligand-induced clustering of TREM2 is intriguing, and future studies should look to confirm this finding and explore its functional consequences.
