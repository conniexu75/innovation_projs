https://openalex.org/W1973831267,"Land plants associate with a root microbiota distinct from the complex microbial community present in surrounding soil. The microbiota colonizing the rhizosphere (immediately surrounding the root) and the endophytic compartment (within the root) contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration and phytoremediation. Colonization of the root occurs despite a sophisticated plant immune system, suggesting finely tuned discrimination of mutualists and commensals from pathogens. Genetic principles governing the derivation of host-specific endophyte communities from soil communities are poorly understood. Here we report the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene of more than 600 Arabidopsis thaliana plants to test the hypotheses that the root rhizosphere and endophytic compartment microbiota of plants grown under controlled conditions in natural soils are sufficiently dependent on the host to remain consistent across different soil types and developmental stages, and sufficiently dependent on host genotype to vary between inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We describe different bacterial communities in two geochemically distinct bulk soils and in rhizosphere and endophytic compartments prepared from roots grown in these soils. The communities in each compartment are strongly influenced by soil type. Endophytic compartments from both soils feature overlapping, low-complexity communities that are markedly enriched in Actinobacteria and specific families from other phyla, notably Proteobacteria. Some bacteria vary quantitatively between plants of different developmental stage and genotype. Our rigorous definition of an endophytic compartment microbiome should facilitate controlled dissection of plant-microbe interactions derived from complex soil communities."
https://openalex.org/W2078510083,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary malignant brain tumour, with a median survival of about one year. This poor prognosis is due to therapeutic resistance and tumour recurrence after surgical removal. Precisely how recurrence occurs is unknown. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of glioma, here we identify a subset of endogenous tumour cells that are the source of new tumour cells after the drug temozolomide (TMZ) is administered to transiently arrest tumour growth. A nestin-ΔTK-IRES-GFP (Nes-ΔTK-GFP) transgene that labels quiescent subventricular zone adult neural stem cells also labels a subset of endogenous glioma tumour cells. On arrest of tumour cell proliferation with TMZ, pulse-chase experiments demonstrate a tumour re-growth cell hierarchy originating with the Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene subpopulation. Ablation of the GFP+ cells with chronic ganciclovir administration significantly arrested tumour growth, and combined TMZ and ganciclovir treatment impeded tumour development. Thus, a relatively quiescent subset of endogenous glioma cells, with properties similar to those proposed for cancer stem cells, is responsible for sustaining long-term tumour growth through the production of transient populations of highly proliferative cells."

https://openalex.org/W2066362124,"Cancer Stem Cells in Color One of the liveliest debates in contemporary cancer research centers on whether cancer stem cells (CSCs) exist and, if so, how these cells are defined phenotypically. CSCs are hypothesized to be a small population of cells within a tumor that are endowed with the unique capacity to drive tumor growth—a scenario that in principle would offer important therapeutic opportunities. By studying mice expressing multicolor reporter genes, Schepers et al. (p. 730 , published online 1 August) were able to visualize and monitor the fate of a candidate stem cell for intestinal adenomas, an early stage of cancer. This “lineage tracing” analysis suggests that tumor cells expressing the intestinal crypt stem cell marker Lgr5 (leucine-rich repeat containing G protein–coupled receptor 5) are the cells that fuel the growth of intestinal adenomas."
https://openalex.org/W2131447660,"Nuclear-retained transcripts containing expanded repeats are shown to be sensitive to antisense silencing, and in a transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy type 1, systemic administration of ASOs causes a rapid knockdown of the toxic RNA in skeletal muscle, correcting some hallmark features of the disease. In myotonic dystrophy type I, a common hereditary neuromuscular disorder, the DMPK gene, which normally codes for a protein kinase that is expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, is mutated in such a way that its transcription results in a toxic RNA molecule that is retained in the nucleus. Charles Thornton and colleagues report the reversal of physical and histological signs of the disease in a mouse model treated with antisense oligonucleotides that caused a rapid knockdown the toxic RNA in skeletal muscle. The effect persisted for up to a year after treatment. Other nuclear-resident RNAs were also sensitive to antisense oligonucleotides, suggesting that this strategy could be used to correct other RNA gain-of-function disorders. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) hold promise for gene-specific knockdown in diseases that involve RNA or protein gain-of-function effects. In the hereditary degenerative disease myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), transcripts from the mutant allele contain an expanded CUG repeat1,2,3 and are retained in the nucleus4,5. The mutant RNA exerts a toxic gain-of-function effect6, making it an appropriate target for therapeutic ASOs. However, despite improvements in ASO chemistry and design, systemic use of ASOs is limited because uptake in many tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, is not sufficient to silence target messenger RNAs7,8. Here we show that nuclear-retained transcripts containing expanded CUG (CUGexp) repeats are unusually sensitive to antisense silencing. In a transgenic mouse model of DM1, systemic administration of ASOs caused a rapid knockdown of CUGexp RNA in skeletal muscle, correcting the physiological, histopathologic and transcriptomic features of the disease. The effect was sustained for up to 1 year after treatment was discontinued. Systemically administered ASOs were also effective for muscle knockdown of Malat1, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that is retained in the nucleus9. These results provide a general strategy to correct RNA gain-of-function effects and to modulate the expression of expanded repeats, lncRNAs and other transcripts with prolonged nuclear residence."
https://openalex.org/W1967163463,"Of the 20 amino acids, the precise function of methionine (Met) remains among the least well understood. To establish a determining characteristic of methionine that fundamentally differentiates it from purely hydrophobic residues, we have used in vitro cellular experiments, molecular simulations, quantum calculations, and a bioinformatics screen of the Protein Data Bank. We show that approximately one-third of all known protein structures contain an energetically stabilizing Met-aromatic motif and, remarkably, that greater than 10,000 structures contain this motif more than 10 times. Critically, we show that as compared with a purely hydrophobic interaction, the Met-aromatic motif yields an additional stabilization of 1-1.5 kcal/mol. To highlight its importance and to dissect the energetic underpinnings of this motif, we have studied two clinically relevant TNF ligand-receptor complexes, namely TRAIL-DR5 and LTα-TNFR1. In both cases, we show that the motif is necessary for high affinity ligand binding as well as function. Additionally, we highlight previously overlooked instances of the motif in several disease-related Met mutations. Our results strongly suggest that the Met-aromatic motif should be exploited in the rational design of therapeutics targeting a range of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2057619229,"Establishment of marine protected areas, including fully protected marine reserves, is one of the few management tools available for local communities to combat the deleterious effect of large scale environmental impacts, including global climate change, on ocean ecosystems. Despite the common hope that reserves play this role, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of local protection against global problems is lacking. Here we show that marine reserves increase the resilience of marine populations to a mass mortality event possibly caused by climate-driven hypoxia. Despite high and widespread adult mortality of benthic invertebrates in Baja California, Mexico, that affected populations both within and outside marine reserves, juvenile replenishment of the species that supports local economies, the pink abalone Haliotis corrugata, remained stable within reserves because of large body size and high egg production of the protected adults. Thus, local protection provided resilience through greater resistance and faster recovery of protected populations. Moreover, this benefit extended to adjacent unprotected areas through larval spillover across the edges of the reserves. While climate change mitigation is being debated, coastal communities have few tools to slow down negative impacts of global environmental shifts. These results show that marine protected areas can provide such protection."
https://openalex.org/W1963853740,"Motor axons receive retrograde signals from skeletal muscle that are essential for the differentiation and stabilization of motor nerve terminals. Identification of these retrograde signals has proved elusive, but their production by muscle depends on the receptor tyrosine kinase, MuSK (muscle, skeletal receptor tyrosine-protein kinase), and Lrp4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein 4), an LDLR family member that forms a complex with MuSK, binds neural agrin and stimulates MuSK kinase activity. Here we show that Lrp4 also functions as a direct muscle-derived retrograde signal for early steps in presynaptic differentiation. We demonstrate that Lrp4 is necessary, independent of MuSK activation, for presynaptic differentiation in vivo, and we show that Lrp4 binds to motor axons and induces clustering of synaptic-vesicle and active-zone proteins. Thus, Lrp4 acts bidirectionally and coordinates synapse formation by binding agrin, activating MuSK and stimulating postsynaptic differentiation, and functioning in turn as a muscle-derived retrograde signal that is necessary and sufficient for presynaptic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2138171776,"Telomerase activation plays a critical role in human carcinogenesis through the maintenance of telomeres, but the activation mechanism during carcinogenesis remains unclear. The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter has been shown to promote hTERT gene expression selectively in tumor cells but not in normal cells. Deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is reported to be associated with human carcinogenesis. However, little is known about whether the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is involved in activating hTERT transcription and inducing telomerase activity (TA). In this study, we report that hTERT is a novel target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Transient activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway either by transfection of a constitutively active form of β-catenin or by LiCl or Wnt-3a conditioned medium treatment induced hTERT mRNA expression and elevated TA in different cell lines. Furthermore, we found that silencing endogenous β-catenin expression by β-catenin gene-specific shRNA effectively decreased hTERT expression, suppressed TA, and accelerated telomere shortening. Of the four members of the lymphoid-enhancing factor (LEF)/T-cell factor (TCF) family, only TCF4 showed more effective stimulation on the hTERT promoter. Ectopic expression of a dominant negative form of TCF4 inhibited hTERT expression in cancer cells. Through promoter mapping, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that hTERT is a direct target of β-catenin·TCF4-mediated transcription and that the TCF4 binding site at the hTERT promoter is critical for β-catenin·TCF4-dependent expression regulation.

Telomeres are highly specialized structures at chromosome ends that are essential for genome stability (1Blackburn E.H. Telomeres.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 378-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that catalyzes de novo synthesis of repetitive telomeric DNA after cell division and maintains chromosomal stability, leading to cellular immortalization (2Perrem K.

Overexpression of telomerase can stabilize telomeres in normal human cells and extend their replicative life span by at least 20 doublings (7Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P.

Conversely, inhibition of TA in cancer cells leads to reduction in telomere length and death of tumor cells (8Hahn W.C. Stewart S.A. Brooks M.W. York S.G. Eaton E. Kurachi A. Beijersbergen R.L.

These findings establish an important role of telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance in human cells and suggest that telomerase up-regulation may contribute actively to cellular immortalization and carcinogenesis (9Shay J.W. Keith W.N. Targeting telomerase for cancer therapeutics.Br J. Cancer. 2008; 98: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, telomerase can be considered as a prime target for cancer diagnosis, and telomerase repression may be a tumor-suppressive mechanism (10Kyo S. Takakura M. Fujiwara T. Inoue M.

The expression level of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), a catalytic subunit bearing the enzymatic activity of telomerase, is the rate-limiting determinant of human TA and is thought to be a sensitive indicator of telomerase function and activity, whereas the other subunits are constitutively expressed both in normal and cancer cells (12Nakayama J. Tahara H. Tahara E. Saito M. Ito K. Nakamura H. Nakanishi T. Tahara E. Ide T. Ishikawa F. Telomerase activation by hTRT in human normal fibroblasts and hepatocellular carcinomas.Nat.

Numerous studies suggest that TA and the expression of telomerase components are regulated at multiple levels, including transcription and post-transcription, accurate assembly, and proper localization; however, hTERT expression level is considered primarily under transcriptional control (15Aisner D.L.

Thus, investigation of transcriptional regulation of hTERT should be essential for elucidating molecular mechanisms of telomerase regulation, cellular senescence, immortalization, and carcinogenesis in humans. Many factors have been implicated in direct or indirect regulation of hTERT in cancer and normal cells, including cellular transcriptional activators (like c-Myc, Sp1, HIF-1, and AP2) (18Kirkpatrick K.L.

The telomerase inhibitor PinX1 is a major haploinsufficient tumor suppressor essential for chromosome stability in mice.J. Clin.

However, it remains largely unknown how hTERT is inactivated during development and how it is reactivated during carcinogenesis. Given that most cancer cells exhibit high TA, we hypothesized that certain cancer-specifically activated signaling pathways play critical roles in telomerase activation. In this study, by using qTRAP, a real-time PCR-based version of the telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) (5Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M.

Specific association of human telomerase activity with immortal cells and cancer.Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6539) Google Scholar), we sought to identify novel TA inhibitors from well known Wnt, epidermal growth factor receptor, and JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor libraries. Moreover, this screen will unveil novel signaling pathways implicated in telomerase regulation. We have identified one of the Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors, FH535 (β-catenin·TCF complex inhibitor), which could significantly inhibit TA in all cell lines used in this study, suggesting that the Wnt pathway may play a critical role in telomerase regulation in cancer cells. Signaling by the Wnt family is one of the fundamental mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation, cell polarity, and cell fate determination during embryonic development and tissue homeostasis (25Logan C.Y. Nusse R. The Wnt signaling pathway in development and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). As a result, abnormalities in Wnt signaling are reported to promote cancer development (26Clevers H. Wnt/β-catenin signaling in development and disease.Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4490) Google Scholar, 27Barker N. Clevers H. Mining the Wnt pathway for cancer therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 997-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). β-catenin, a central effector of the Wnt pathway, is involved in diverse cellular processes, including cell adhesion, growth, differentiation, and transcription of Wnt-responsive genes (28Morin P.J. β-Catenin signaling and cancer.BioEssays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 29Nusse R. Wnt signaling in disease and in development.Cell Res. 2005; 15: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). In the absence of the Wnt signaling, β-catenin is tightly regulated by a multiprotein degradation complex, in which β-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3β), leading to its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (30MacDonald B.T. Tamai K. He X. Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Components, mechanisms, and diseases.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). This continual elimination of β-catenin prevents it from reaching the nucleus, and Wnt target genes are thereby repressed by the DNA-bound lymphoid-enhancing factor (LEF)/T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factors. In the presence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin is uncoupled from the degradation complex and translocates to the nucleus to form complexes with LEF/TCF, thus activating Wnt target gene expression. Deregulation of β-catenin leads to the formation of β-catenin·TCF complexes and altered expression of oncogenes, such as c-MYC (31He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T.

McCormick F. β-catenin regulates expression of cyclin D1 in colon carcinoma cells.Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar), and NOS2 (33Du Q. Park K.S. Guo Z. He P. Nagashima M. Shao L. Sahai R. Geller D.A. Hussain S.P.

Barker N. Clevers H. You Wnt some, you lose some. Oncogenes in the Wnt signaling pathway.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in regulating telomerase gene expression has not yet been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the hTERT gene is a novel target of the Wnt pathway. We employed a combination of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and luciferase reporter gene assays that led to the identification of hTERT as a direct transcriptional target of the β-catenin·TCF4 complex. Moreover, knockdown of β-catenin by shRNA largely repressed hTERT gene expression and TA in cancer cells. Our findings highlight the significance of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in telomerase regulation and aid in the advancement of our understanding of the role of the canonical Wnt pathway in carcinogenesis. AGS, MCF7, 293T, MCF10A, HCT116, and LS174T were used in this study. HTC116, LS174T, and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), whereas AGS was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI 1640; Sigma-Aldrich). Both media contain 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. (FBS; Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixtures (Invitrogen). MCF10A was cultured in DMEM/F-12 with 15 mm HEPES buffer, 5% horse serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml EGF, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin mixtures. L-cells (control) and Wnt-3a-expressing L-cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Wnt-3a-expressing L-cells were additionally supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. For the preparation of L-control medium and Wnt-3a conditioned medium (CM), CM was collected from cultured parental L-cells or Wnt-3a-expressing L-cells and was diluted to 50% in serum-free DMEM. All cells were cultured in an incubator with 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The InhibitorSelectTM inhibitor library, consisting of well defined inhibitors from Wnt, epidermal growth factor receptor, and JAK/STAT signaling pathway inhibitor libraries, was purchased from Merck. Wnt pathway inhibitors A–O are listed in supplemental Table S1. qTRAP is a real-time PCR-based method that measures the ability of telomerase to add telomeric repeats to a substrate. The real-time PCR-based version of the TRAP assay allows the estimation of TA in real time via fluorescence measurements. The qTRAP assay was modified from a conventional TRAP assay for use on the Rotor-Gene 6000 system (Qiagen) as described previously (35Betts D.H. Perrault S. Harrington L. King W.A. Quantitative analysis of telomerase activity and telomere length in domestic animal clones.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 325: 149-180PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with various signaling pathway inhibitors, and samples were lysed in 0.5% (v/v) CHAPS buffer (pH 7.5) supplemented with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol for 30 min on ice. Following lysis, the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The telomerase reaction was carried out in 1× TRAP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 63 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) and 50 μm each of the four dNTPs and 80 ng/μl TS primer (5′-AAT CCG TCG AGC AGA GTT-3′) and 2 μg (protein amount) of cell lysate in a total volume of 10 μl for 30 min at 30 °C and was stopped by incubation at 94 °C for 10 min. The qTRAP was subsequently carried out by adding 10 μl of the following 2× PCR mixture (2× TRAP buffer, 1 mg/μl BSA, 40 ng/μl ACX primer (5′-GCG CGG CTT ACC CTT ACC CTT ACC CTA ACC-3′), 15% glycerol, 1:10,000 SYBR Green, 0.08 unit/μl Taq polymerase). The PCR conditions used were as follows: 10-min incubation at 94 °C and 40 cycles of PCR at 94 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 90 s. All of the samples were quantified using the Rotor-Gene quantification software and then compared with the standard curve generated using 293T cells and activity expressed as relative TA, relative to the control. Reverse transcription was performed using the Promega RT-PCR kit and oligo(dT) primer as per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed using Brilliant SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix on the Rotor-Gene 6000 system (Qiagen). The following primers were used for real-time PCR: 5′-CATGAGGTGGTAGCCTGGAT-3′ and 5′-ACCACTGTGCCCTGTCTTCT-3′ (human DKC1), 5′- GCGAAGAGTTGGGCTCTGTC-3′ and 5′-CATGTGTGAGCCGAGTCCTG-3′ (human telomerase RNA), 5′-ATGCGACAGTTCGTGGCTCA-3′ and 5′-ATCCCCTGGCACTGGACGTA-3′ (hTERT), and 5′-GTGGACCTGACCTGCCGTCT-3′ and 5′-GGAGGAGTGGGTGTCGCTGT-3′ (human glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)). Data were analyzed using the ΔΔCT method. Lentiviral pLKO.1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against human β-catenin and control scramble shRNA lentiviral particles (Sigma) and retroviral vector pSUPER-retro containing human β-catenin sequence, retroviral vector pBabe-hTERT-hygro, were used to generate lentivirus and retrovirus in 293T or phoenix cells. The viruses were then used to infect cells, followed by 2 μg/ml puromycin or 100 μg/ml hygromycin (AG Scientific, Inc.) selection 24 h after infection. After 14 days of selection, stable pools of puromycin- or hygromycin-resistant cells were obtained and further expanded. DNA was extracted from the cells using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). Telomere length analysis was carried out using a non-radioactive TeloTAGGG telomere length assay (Roche Applied Science) as described by the manufacturer. Approximately 1 μg of DNA of each sample was digested with HinfI/RsaI enzyme mix and separated by gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments were transferred to a nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) by Southern transfer and hybridized to digoxigenin (digoxigenin-labeled probe), specific for telomeric repeats. A digoxigenin-specific antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used to incubate the membrane, and the probe was visualized by chemiluminescence detection and subsequent exposure to x-ray film (GE Healthcare). Mean telomeric repeat binding factor lengths were determined by comparison with the molecular weight standard. Luciferase vector pGL3–88bp, pGL3–385bp, and pGL3–949bp driven by various length of wild-type hTERT promoter were kind gifts of Prof. Horikawa, Izumi (NCI, National Institutes of Health). The putative TCF4 binding element (TBE) (5′-TGCAAAG-3′) contained in the hTERT promoter (between −659 and −653 bp) was mutated to 5′-TGCGGAG-3′ (Mut1) and 5′-TGCAAGA-3′ (Mut2) using site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's recommendations (QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The following primers were used for generating the mutants: 5′-CCG CCT GAG AAC CTG CGG AGA GAA ATG ACG GGC C-3′ and 5′-GGC CCG TCA TTT CTC TCC GCA GGT TCT CAG GCG G-3′ (Mut1), 5′-GCC GCC TGA GAA CCT GCA AGA AGA AAT GAC GGG CC-3′ and 5′-GGC CCG TCA TTT CTT CTT GCA GGT TCT CAG GCG GC-3′ (Mut2), and 5′-GCG AGA TCT GCG AGA AAT GAC GGG CCT GTG TCA AGG-3′ and 5′-GGC CAG GGC TTC CCA CGT GCG CAG TAT CCA TGG TAT-3′ (Truncate). All transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Respective amounts of cells (2 × 105/ml for MCF7, 4 × 105/ml for HCT116 and 293T cells) were seeded in a 24-well plate. 1 μg of plasmid encoding the protein ΔN β-catenin, ΔN TCF4, LEF1, TCF1, TCF3, TCF4, TAK1, or TAB or pCDNA control were transfected into cells. 2 days after transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed by real-time PCR and qTRAP. In a luciferase reporter assay, wild-type pGL3–88bp, pGL3–385bp and pGL3–949bp or mutant reporter plasmids were transfected into cells. After 24 h, cells were harvested, and whole cell lysates were used to measure luciferase activities using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). To examine the effect of the activated Wnt pathway on the hTERT promoter, cells were treated with Wnt-3a CM or LiCl after transfection. In another assay, pGL3–88bp, pGL3–385bp, and pGL3–949bp reporter plasmids were co-transfected with TAK1 and TAB expression vector to study TAK1 negative regulation on the hTERT promoter. All firefly luciferase readings were normalized with the Renilla luciferase readings. Reporter assays were conducted in duplicates and repeated three times. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing TCF4 binding sites were labeled by the Biotin 3′ End DNA labeling kit (Thermo Scientific). The binding reactions contain 10 μg of crude 293T nuclear extract, 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), and 10 fmol of biotin-labeled probe in 20 μl of 1× EMSA buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 62.5 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgCl2, 8% Ficoll 400, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A), and 3.75 μl of H2O). The incubation was carried out for 30 min at room temperature. Unlabeled probes in 500-fold molar excess were included at the time of reaction for competitive binding assays. Anti-TCF4 and c-Myc antibodies were used for supershift analysis. 20 μl of the reaction was loaded onto a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane. DNA was cross-linked to the membrane under UV light. The biotin-end-labeled DNA was detected using the streptavidin-horseradish peroxide conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate. The assays for ChIP were performed using reagents commercially obtained from Upstate Biotechnology and conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin was isolated from 5 × 107 of HCT116 cells and sonicated into 500–1000-bp fragments. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-TCF4, anti-β-catenin (Millipore), and normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). ChIP-enriched DNA was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR, and primer sets were designed flanking the putative TBE: hTERT 1, forward (5′-CCGGTGGGTGATTAACAGAT-3′) and reverse (5′-GGACGTGAAGGGGAGGAC-3′); hTERT 2, forward (5′- CCCCGGTGGGTGATTAACAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAGTGCCTCCCTGCAACAC-3′); hTERT 3, forward (5′-CTCCATTTCCCACCCTTTCT-3′) and reverse (5′-ACTTGGGCTCCTTGACACAG-3′; hTERT 4, forward (5′-AGGCCGTTGTGGCTGGTGTGAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCGTCATTTCTCTTTGCAGGT-3′); hTERT 5, forward (5′- TTGCTCATGGTGGGGACCC-3′) and reverse (5′- GACGAACCCGAGGACGCAT-3′). Data are expressed as percentage of input. TCF binding sites (A/T)(A/T)CAAAG in the hTERT promoter were identified using an in silico tool named TFExplorer. TFExplorer is a database of regulatory elements in the genomic sequences of humans, mice, and rats. We obtained a TCF4 binding sequence 653 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the hTERT promoter from the human genome annotation files provided by NCBI. BJ fibroblast cells were cultured to the same population doubling level in the presence or absence of LiCl or Wnt-3a CM. Cell staining was performed using a kit from U.S. Biological. After removing growth medium from the cells, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with the manufacturer's fixative solution for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and stained with X-gal staining solution overnight at 37 °C following the manufacturer's protocol. All experiments were independently performed at least three times, with similar results. All data are presented as mean ± S.D. of data obtained and were analyzed using either one-way analysis of variance or Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To identify telomerase inhibitors from the InhibitorSelectTM inhibitor library, consisting of Wnt, epidermal growth factor receptor, and JAK/STAT inhibitor libraries, we modified the existing qTRAP to suit the screen (36Chai J.H. Zhang Y. Tan W.H. Chng W.J. Li B. Wang X. Regulation of hTERT by BCR-ABL at multiple levels in K562 cells.BMC Cancer. 2011; 11: 512Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TA was quantitated using qTRAP, and all data obtained were normalized against the vehicle control, DMSO. The concentration of each inhibitor was chosen based on its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Screen and validation were carried out in a wide range of cancer cell lines (gastric cancer, AGS; breast cancer, MCF7; colorectal cancer, HCT116 and LS174T) that have similarly reactivated telomerase enzymatic activity but differ in genetic backgrounds. Inhibitors shown to be able to reduce TA by at least 50% in the initial screen were considered as potent telomerase inhibitors and further validated. It has been shown that STAT III and V are implicated in transcriptional activation of the hTERT promoter (36Chai J.H. Zhang Y. Tan W.H. Chng W.J. Li B. Wang X.

As shown in Fig. 1A, STAT III and V inhibitors were able to significantly reduce TA in HCT116 cells by 60 and 40% respectively, suggesting that the screen platform is workable. The screen result"

Here we present novel evidence that peripheral nerve injury diminishes glycine-mediated inhibition and induces a depolarizing shift in the reversal potential of glycine-mediated currents (E(glycine)) in spinal dorsal horn neurons. Blocking glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors normalizes synaptic inhibition, E(glycine), and KCC2 by nerve injury. Strikingly, nerve injury increases calcium-dependent calpain activity in the spinal cord that in turn causes KCC2 cleavage at the C terminus. Inhibiting calpain blocks KCC2 cleavage induced by nerve injury and NMDA, thereby normalizing E(glycine). Furthermore, calpain inhibition or silencing of μ-calpain at the spinal level reduces neuropathic pain. Thus, nerve injury promotes proteolytic cleavage of KCC2 through NMDA receptor-calpain activation, resulting in disruption of chloride homeostasis and diminished synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord. Targeting calpain may represent a new strategy for restoring KCC2 levels and tonic synaptic inhibition and for treating chronic neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2033508868,"Cyclotides are bioactive cyclic peptides isolated from plants that are characterized by a topologically complex structure and exceptional resistance to enzymatic or thermal degradation. With their sequence diversity, ultra-stable core structural motif, and range of bioactivities, cyclotides are regarded as a combinatorial peptide template with potential applications in drug design. The mode of action of cyclotides remains elusive, but all reported biological activities are consistent with a mechanism involving membrane interactions. In this study, a diverse set of cyclotides from the two major subfamilies, Möbius and bracelet, and an all-d mirror image form, were examined to determine their mode of action. Their lipid selectivity and membrane affinity were determined, as were their toxicities against a range of targets (red blood cells, bacteria, and HIV particles). Although they had different membrane-binding affinities, all of the tested cyclotides targeted membranes through binding to phospholipids containing phosphatidylethanolamine headgroups. Furthermore, the biological potency of the tested cyclotides broadly correlated with their ability to target and disrupt cell membranes. The finding that a broad range of cyclotides target a specific lipid suggests their categorization as a new lipid-binding protein family. Knowledge of their membrane specificity has the potential to assist in the design of novel drugs based on the cyclotide framework, perhaps allowing the targeting of peptide drugs to specific cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2142881120,"DNA synthesis across lesions during genomic replication requires concerted actions of specialized DNA polymerases in a potentially mutagenic process known as translesion synthesis. Current models suggest that translesion synthesis in mammalian cells is achieved in two sequential steps, with a Y-family DNA polymerase (κ, η, ι, or Rev1) inserting a nucleotide opposite the lesion and with the heterodimeric B-family polymerase ζ, consisting of the catalytic Rev3 subunit and the accessory Rev7 subunit, replacing the insertion polymerase to carry out primer extension past the lesion. Effective translesion synthesis in vertebrates requires the scaffolding function of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rev1 that interacts with the Rev1-interacting region of polymerases κ, η, and ι and with the Rev7 subunit of polymerase ζ. We report the purification and structure determination of a quaternary translesion polymerase complex consisting of the Rev1 CTD, the heterodimeric Pol ζ complex, and the Pol κ Rev1-interacting region. Yeast two-hybrid assays were employed to identify important interface residues of the translesion polymerase complex. The structural elucidation of such a quaternary translesion polymerase complex encompassing both insertion and extension polymerases bridged by the Rev1 CTD provides the first molecular explanation of the essential scaffolding function of Rev1 and highlights the Rev1 CTD as a promising target for developing novel cancer therapeutics to suppress translesion synthesis. Our studies support the notion that vertebrate insertion and extension polymerases could structurally cooperate within a megatranslesion polymerase complex (translesionsome) nucleated by Rev1 to achieve efficient lesion bypass without incurring an additional switching mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1621604326,"REV1, REV3, and REV7 are pivotal proteins in translesion DNA synthesis, which allows DNA synthesis even in the presence of DNA damage. REV1 and REV3 are error-prone DNA polymerases and function as inserter and extender polymerases in this process, respectively.

Here, we show the crystal structure of the ternary complex, composed of the C-terminal domain of human REV1, REV7, and a REV3 fragment. The REV1 C-terminal domain adopts a four-helix bundle that interacts with REV7. A linker region between helices 2 and 3, which is conserved among mammals, interacts with the β-sheet of REV7. Remarkably, the REV7-binding interface is distinct from the binding site of DNA polymerase η or κ. Thus, the REV1 C-terminal domain might facilitate polymerase switching by providing a scaffold for both inserter and extender polymerases to bind.

https://openalex.org/W2017126621,"How stereoselective monolignol-derived phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions are differentially biochemically orchestrated in planta, whereby for example they afford (+)- and (-)-pinoresinols, respectively, is both a fascinating mechanistic and evolutionary question. In earlier work, biochemical control of (+)-pinoresinol formation had been established to be engendered by a (+)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein in Forsythia intermedia, whereas the presence of a (-)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein was indirectly deduced based on the enantiospecificity of downstream pinoresinol reductases (AtPrRs) in Arabidopsis thaliana root tissue. In this study of 16 putative dirigent protein homologs in Arabidopsis, AtDIR6, AtDIR10, and AtDIR13 were established to be root-specific using a β-glucuronidase reporter gene strategy. Of these three, in vitro analyses established that only recombinant AtDIR6 was a (-)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein, whose physiological role was further confirmed using overexpression and RNAi strategies in vivo. Interestingly, its closest homolog, AtDIR5, was also established to be a (-)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein based on in vitro biochemical analyses. Both of these were compared in terms of properties with a (+)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein from Schizandra chinensis. In this context, sequence analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and region swapping resulted in identification of putative substrate binding sites/regions and candidate residues controlling distinct stereoselectivities of coupling modes."
https://openalex.org/W2041744455,"Insulin is an inducer of chondrocyte hypertrophy and growth plate chondrogenesis, although the specific molecular mechanisms behind these effects are mostly unknown. Our aim was to investigate whether insulin-induced chondrocyte hypertrophy occurs through a modification in the amount of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)-modified proteins and in the expression of the key enzymes of this pathway, O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). We also studied if O-GlcNAc accumulation per se, induced by an OGA inhibitor, was able to induce pre-hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Insulin-induced differentiation of ATDC5 pre-chondrocytes occurred alongside a gradual increase in the accumulation of O-GlcNac-modified proteins (O-GlcNAcylated proteins), as well as an increase in the expression of O-GlcNAc transferase and OGA. In the absence of insulin, O-GlcNAc accumulation induced by thiamet-G, a specific OGA inhibitor, was able to increase the gene expression of differentiation markers, as well as the activity of MMP-2 and -9. Thiamet-G also activated pERK, p-JNK, and p-p38 and the O-GlcNAcylation of Akt. Thiamet-G administration to C57/bl mice induced a significant expansion in the growth plate height and in the hypertrophic zone height. Therefore, our results show that O-GlcNAc glycosylation has chondromodulating activity."
https://openalex.org/W2045496696,"The functional relevance of natural cis-antisense transcripts is mostly unknown. Here we have characterized the association of three antisense RNAs and one intergenically encoded noncoding RNA with an operon that plays a crucial role in photoprotection of photosystem II under low carbon conditions in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Cyanobacteria show strong gene expression dynamics in response to a shift of cells from high carbon to low levels of inorganic carbon (Ci), but the regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Among the most up-regulated genes in Synechocystis are flv4, sll0218, and flv2, which are organized in the flv4-2 operon. The flavodiiron proteins encoded by this operon open up an alternative electron transfer route, likely starting from the QB site in photosystem II, under photooxidative stress conditions. Our expression analysis of cells shifted from high carbon to low carbon demonstrated an inversely correlated transcript accumulation of the flv4-2 operon mRNA and one antisense RNA to flv4, designated as As1_flv4. Overexpression of As1_flv4 led to a decrease in flv4-2 mRNA. The promoter activity of as1_flv4 was transiently stimulated by Ci limitation and negatively regulated by the AbrB-like transcription regulator Sll0822, whereas the flv4-2 operon was positively regulated by the transcription factor NdhR. The results indicate that the tightly regulated antisense RNA As1_flv4 establishes a transient threshold for flv4-2 expression in the early phase after a change in Ci conditions.

In plants, small RNA-based mechanisms control almost all aspects of plant biology, including chromatin structure, genome stability, gene expression, and defense. The functions and phylogenetic distribution of plant microRNAs, one particular class of RNA regulators, have been studied comparatively well (for a review, see Ref. 1Cuperus J.T. Fahlgren N. Carrington J.C. Evolution and functional diversification of MIRNA genes.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), whereas the functions of longer noncoding RNAs are only beginning to emerge (2De Lucia F. Dean C. Long non-coding RNAs and chromatin regulation.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2011; 14: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transcripts, which originate from the reverse complementary strand of an annotated gene and hence fully or partially overlap with their respective mRNAs, are known as cis-natural antisense transcripts or antisense RNAs (asRNAs). 3The abbreviations used are: asRNAantisense RNAncRNAnoncoding RNAPSIIphotosystem IILClow carbon (0.038% CO2 in air)HChigh carbon (3% CO2 in air)Ciinorganic carbonntnucleotide(s)CCMCO2-concentrating mechanismFlvflavodiironRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase.

Indeed, recent observations for plant chloroplasts indicated asRNAs to be associated to 35% of all genes (6Zhelyazkova P. Sharma C.M. Förstner K.U. Liere K. Vogel J. Börner T.

Here we report the identification of three asRNAs and one noncoding RNA (ncRNA) associated with the flv4-2 operon. These transcripts were primarily detected by microarray analysis (7Georg J. Voss B. Scholz I. Mitschke J. Wilde A. Hess W.R. Evidence for a major role of antisense RNAs in cyanobacterial gene regulation.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 305Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and 454 sequencing (8Mitschke J. Georg J. Scholz I. Sharma C.M. Dienst D. Bantscheff J. Voss B. Steglich C. Wilde A. Vogel J. Hess W.R.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2124-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We verified the existence of these ncRNAs by Northern blotting and characterized the asRNA As1_flv4 in more detail. The inversely correlated accumulation of As1_flv4 transcript with the transcripts and proteins from the flv4-2 operon and the results obtained from artificial modulation of As1_flv4 levels suggest a stoichiometric function of As1_flv4 to control the expression of the flv4-2 operon according to the environmental Ci availability. Furthermore, the direct or indirect repression by the AbrB-like transcriptional regulator Sll0822 and the control of the promoter activity by the Ci level support the assumption that ncRNAs play a significant role in the Ci-regulatory network in Synechocystis. The glucose-tolerant strain of cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, served as the WT. Cultivation of mutants was performed at 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin and 20 μg ml−1 spectinomycin, respectively. For the experiments, axenic cultures of the cyanobacteria were grown photoautotrophically under 50 μmol photons m−2 s−1 (white light) at 30 °C. Cells were cultivated in BG-11 medium (pH 7.5) and aerated by shaking in the presence of CO2-enriched air (3% CO2 in air; high carbon (HC)) or ambient air CO2 (LC). In the case of the LC shift experiment, the cells were collected by centrifugation (2 min at 1730 × g at room temperature) and resuspended in fresh BG-11, and the OD750 measured with a Spectronic Genesys 2 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madison, WI) was adjusted to 0.8. After precultivation at HC conditions for 1 h, cultures were transferred to LC conditions. In analogous experiments, cells were aerated directly by continuous bubbling with LC or HC. For the asRNA overexpression experiments, the two overexpression mutants As1_flv4(+)/2 and As1_flv4(+)/3 and a control strain (mutant in spkA) were precultivated in Cu2+-containing BG-11 medium and bubbled with HC. For induction of petJ promoter activity by Cu2+ depletion (43Tous C. Vega-Palas M.A. Vioque A. Conditional expression of RNase P in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Subsequently, cultures were treated as described above. 300- and 700-nt promoter regions of the genes encoding the asRNA As1_flv4 and the flv4-2 operon, respectively, were amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA and specific primers (supplemental Table S1). After digestion with KpnI, the respective promoter fragment was ligated into the unique KpnI site of the promoter test vector pILA (37Kunert A. Hagemann M. Erdmann N.

The vector pILA allows transcriptional fusion of the promoter sequence with the luxAB genes and its stable integration into the chromosome at a neutral site (37Kunert A. Hagemann M. Erdmann N.

Plasmids with correct promoter insertion direction relative to the reporter genes were selected for subsequent transformation of Synechocystis. Completely segregated clones were checked by PCR analysis as described (19Eisenhut M. Kahlon S. Hasse D. Ewald R. Lieman-Hurwitz J. Ogawa T. Ruth W. Bauwe H. Kaplan A. Hagemann M.

Subsamples of 100 μl were transferred in triplicate to white 96-well microtiter plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To start the measurement, 100 μl of 2 mm decanal ready-to-use solution was added, and the plate was immediately placed into the plate reader (Wallac Victor 2 1420 multilabel counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 100 mm decanal stock solution was prepared in methanol and freshly diluted with BG-11 for 2 mm decanal ready-to-use solution. Bioluminescence was measured for 30 min at 25 °C. The maximum light emission (around 10 min after the start) was used as the bioluminescence value and related to the OD750. Results are presented in relative bioluminescence units. Experiments were repeated three times. All primers used for plasmid preparation in this work are listed in supplemental Table S1. To generate the overexpression construct, a 563-nt DNA fragment beginning from the mapped as1_flv4 transcriptional start site (nucleotide 166849 according to Ref. 7Georg J. Voss B. Scholz I. Mitschke J. Wilde A. Hess W.R. Evidence for a major role of antisense RNAs in cyanobacterial gene regulation.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 305Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was fused with the petJ promoter and integrated with a kanamycin resistance cassette in the spkA gene. The spkA gene can be used as an uncommitted integration site because this gene is disrupted by a frameshift mutation in the Synechocystis strain used (44Kamei A. Yuasa T. Orikawa K. Geng X.X. Ikeuchi M. A eukaryotic-type protein kinase, SpkA, is required for normal motility of the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment is longer than the asRNA transcript to allow for transcription termination at its own terminator. To prevent eventual read-through, the λ phage oop terminator was fused to the 3′-end of the fragment. First a platform for the integration of a ncRNA between the petJ promoter and the oop terminator was constructed. The primers “5′ApaI_petJ” and “3′petJ_AsuII_oop_SalI” were used to amplify the petJ promoter fragment. The construct contained ApaI and SalI restriction sites for integration in the pJet-spk plasmid and an AsuII restriction site for the integration of an ncRNA between petJ promoter and oop terminator. The new pJet-spk-petJp plasmid was AsuII-digested for the integration of the AsuII-digested as1_flv4 fragment generated with the as_flv4_asuII_for and as_flv4_asuII_rev primers. The sense orientation of the fragment was tested with the as_flv4_asuII_rev primer and the spK_seg_for primer. The segregation of the construct in the genome was tested with the spK_seg_for and spK_seg_rev primers. A schematic presentation of the cloning strategy is shown in supplemental Fig. S1A. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with a TURBO DNase kit (Invitrogen) to remove genomic DNA. To characterize small RNAs, RNA samples (5 μg) were mixed with RNA loading dye (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), denatured for 10 min at 70 °C, separated in 10% polyacrylamide-urea gels, and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (GE Healthcare) by electroblotting for 1 h. For the mRNA studies, RNA samples were mixed with denaturation solution, incubated for 10 min at 70 °C, separated in 1.3% agarose gels containing 7% formaldehyde in MOPS, and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes by capillary blotting with 10× SSC overnight (38Hagemann M.

https://openalex.org/W2043639010,"An interacting one-dimensional electron system, the Luttinger liquid, is distinct from the ""conventional"" Fermi liquids formed by interacting electrons in two and three dimensions. Some of its most spectacular properties are revealed in the process of electron tunneling: as a function of the applied bias or temperature the tunneling current demonstrates a non-trivial power-law suppression. Here, we create a system which emulates tunneling in a Luttinger liquid, by controlling the interaction of the tunneling electron with its environment. We further replace a single tunneling barrier with a double-barrier resonant level structure and investigate resonant tunneling between Luttinger liquids. For the first time, we observe perfect transparency of the resonant level embedded in the interacting environment, while the width of the resonance tends to zero. We argue that this unique behavior results from many-body physics of interacting electrons and signals the presence of a quantum phase transition (QPT). In our samples many parameters, including the interaction strength, can be precisely controlled; thus, we have created an attractive model system for studying quantum critical phenomena in general. Our work therefore has broadly reaching implications for understanding QPTs in more complex systems, such as cold atoms and strongly correlated bulk materials."

https://openalex.org/W2111509870,"In mitochondria, complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) uses the redox potential energy from NADH oxidation by ubiquinone to transport protons across the inner membrane, contributing to the proton-motive force. However, in some prokaryotes, complex I may transport sodium ions instead, and three subunits in the membrane domain of complex I are closely related to subunits from the Mrp family of Na(+)/H(+) antiporters. Here, we define the relationship between complex I from Bos taurus heart mitochondria, a close model for the human enzyme, and sodium ion transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane. In accord with current consensus, we exclude the possibility of redox-coupled Na(+) transport by B. taurus complex I. Instead, we show that the ""deactive"" form of complex I, which is formed spontaneously when enzyme turnover is precluded by lack of substrates, is a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter. The antiporter activity is abolished upon reactivation by the addition of substrates and by the complex I inhibitor rotenone. It is specific for Na(+) over K(+), and it is not exhibited by complex I from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, which thus has a less extensive deactive transition. We propose that the functional connection between the redox and transporter modules of complex I is broken in the deactive state, allowing the transport module to assert its independent properties. The deactive state of complex I is formed during hypoxia, when respiratory chain turnover is slowed, and may contribute to determining the outcome of ischemia-reperfusion injury."

TIPE2 is a very recently identified negative regulator of inflammation that maintains immune homeostasis. However, it is unknown whether TIPE2 is expressed in the brain and contributes to the regulation of cerebral diseases. In this study, we explored the potential roles of TIPE2 in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. TIPE2−/− mice were used to assess whether TIPE2 provides neuroprotection following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and in vitro primary cerebral cell cultures were used to investigate the expression and regulation of TIPE2. Our results show that genetic ablation of the Tipe2 gene significantly increased the cerebral volume of infarction and neurological dysfunction in mice subjected to MCAO. Flow cytometric analysis revealed more infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the ischemic hemisphere of TIPE2−/− mice. The responses to inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were significantly increased in TIPE2−/− mouse brain after MCAO. We further observed that TIPE2 was highly induced in WT mice after cerebral ischemia and was expressed mainly in microglia/macrophages, but not in neurons and astrocytes. Finally, we found that regulation of TIPE2 expression was associated with NADPH oxidase activity. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that TIPE2 is involved in the pathogenesis of stroke and suggest that TIPE2 plays an essential role in a signal transduction pathway that links the inflammatory immune response to specific conditions after cerebral ischemia.

Interestingly, although TIPE2 is not expressed in the NIH 3T3 fibroblast cell line, following stimulation with TNF-α, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts express detectable levels of TIPE2 mRNA, suggesting that TIPE2 may be expressed in other cell types to establish equilibrium during an inflammatory response (1Sun H.

Stroke is one of the most common vascular diseases of the central nervous system. The inflammatory responses accompanying stroke are recognized to contribute to secondary ischemic injury (6Amantea D.

Recent studies have indicated that the activation of the immune system as a result of disturbances in the redox state of cells seems to contribute to the brain damage and cerebrovascular diseases in these conditions. However, to date, it is unclear whether the TNFAIP8 family is expressed in the brain and contributes to the regulation of cerebral functions. Given the role of TIPE2 in the regulation of TLR function and the link between TLRs and ischemic cerebral injury, in this study, we used an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and in vitro primary cerebral cell cultures to determine the expression and functions of TIPE2 in cerebral ischemia-induced injury. TIPE2-deficient (TIPE2−/−) mice were generated as described (1Sun H. Gong S. Carmody R.J. Hilliard A. Li L. Sun J. Kong L. Xu L. Hilliard B. Hu S. Shen H. Yang X. Chen Y.H. TIPE2, a negative regulator of innate and adaptive immunity that maintains immune homeostasis.Cell. 2008; 133: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). All TIPE2−/− mice used in these studies had been backcrossed to the C57BL/6 genetic background for 10 generations and were <10 weeks old. These mice do not develop spontaneous inflammatory diseases at this age. All procedures were preapproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Transient MCAO was induced in both TIPE2−/− and WT C57BL/6 mice (22–25 g) as described previously (9Jasmin J.F. Malhotra S. Singh Dhallu M. Mercier I. Rosenbaum D.M. Lisanti M.P. Caveolin-1 deficiency increases cerebral ischemic injury.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After 2 h of MCAO, the filament was removed, and blood flow was restored. Mice were killed after reperfusion at 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 h. The sham groups were subjected to the same procedure except for the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Stroke outcomes were assessed at 12, 24, 48, or 72 h after reperfusion using both cerebral infarct volume and a four-tiered neurological scoring system as described previously (10Mocco J. Mack W.J.

Complement component C3 mediates inflammatory injury following focal cerebral ischemia.Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Primary microglia and astrocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (11Halim N.D. Mcfate T. Mohyeldin A. Okagaki P. Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. Jeoung N.H. Harris R.A. Schell M.J. Verma A. Phosphorylation status of pyruvate dehydrogenase distinguishes metabolic phenotypes of cultured rat brain astrocytes and neurons.Glia. 2010; 58: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The purity of microglia and astrocytes was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against CD11b (Pharmingen) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Invitrogen), respectively. Primary microglial cells were pretreated with apocynin (100 μm) for 30 min and then stimulated with LPS (0.1 μg/ml) or by the model of oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD). Total RNA was isolated from brain or cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (12Wang Z. Wei X. Zhang Y. Ma X. Li B. Zhang S. Du P. Zhang X. Yi F.

Biochem. 2009; 24: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR or real-time quantitative RT-PCR using a Bio-Rad iCycler system. Proinflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA as described (13Manhas N. Shi Y. Taunton J. Sun D. p90 activation contributes to cerebral ischemic damage via phosphorylation of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1.J. Neurochem. 2010; 114: 1476-1486PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described (14Yi F. Xia M. Li N. Zhang C. Tang L. Li P.L.

Anti-TIPE2 and anti-NOX2 primary antibodies (Proteintech Group Inc., Chicago, IL) were used in this study. To document the loading controls, the membrane was reprobed with a primary antibody against the housekeeping protein β-actin. Staining was performed on tissue sections or cultured cells as described (10Mocco J. Mack W.J. Ducruet A.F. Sosunov S.A. Sughrue M.E. Hassid B.G. Nair M.N. Laufer I. Komotar R.J. Claire M. Holland H. Pinsky D.J. Connolly Jr., E.S. Complement component C3 mediates inflammatory injury following focal cerebral ischemia.Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To determine the lineage of TIPE2-positive cells, additional staining of neurons was performed using anti-NeuN antibody (Invitrogen), and that of astrocytes was performed using anti-GFAP antibody, whereas anti-CD11b antibody was used to stain microglia/macrophages. Cresyl violet staining was performed as described previously (15Zhao J. Pei D.S. Zhang Q.G. Zhang G.Y. Down-regulation Cdc42 attenuates neuronal apoptosis through inhibiting MLK3/JNK3 cascade during ischemic reperfusion in rat hippocampus.Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and TUNEL staining was performed using an ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The infiltrating cells in the brain were prepared according to the procedure described previously (16Campanella M. Sciorati C. Tarozzo G. Beltramo M. Flow cytometric analysis of inflammatory cells in ischemic rat brain.Stroke. 2002; 33: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Rat monoclonal antibodies specific for mouse surface markers (Pharmingen) were as follows. FITC-conjugated anti-CD11b antibody recognizes monocytes/macrophages and microglia. Peridinin-chlorophyll-protein complex-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody identifies leukocyte common antigen expressed in all leukocytes and at lower levels in resting microglia. Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD3 antibody is a T cell-specific marker. Allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-Ly-6G antibody is a specific marker for neutrophils. Recovered cells were stained with fluorescently conjugated antibodies. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed (FlowJo software, Tree Star Inc.) using isotype control antibodies to set quadrants before calculating the percentage of positive cells. NADPH oxidase activity was determined by measurement of superoxide (O2̇̄) production in brain tissue homogenates. Fluorescence spectrometry for O2̇̄ production was performed using a modified dihydroethidium-based fluorescence spectrometric assay as described previously (17Yi F. Zhang A.Y. Janscha J.L. Li P.L.

All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis of variance, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. When only two groups were compared, Student's t test was used. Significance was placed at p < 0.05. To determine the expression patterns of the TNFAIP8 family in the brain, total RNA was extracted from tissues of C57BL/6 mice, and RT-PCR was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, of the brain (cortex and hippocampus), kidney, liver, and spleen, TNFAIP8 was the most abundant in the kidney and was hardly detectable in the liver. TIPE1 was detected in these tissues with a relatively high level in the liver. TIPE2 was rich in the spleen, present in the brain and liver, and weak in the kidney, and TIPE3 was abundant in the brain. Because we wanted to focus on the role of TIPE2 in cerebral ischemia injury, we further confirmed the protein expression patterns of TIPE2 in these tissues by Western blot analysis as shown in Fig. 1B. The neurological deficit score was used to evaluate neurological function after MCAO. TIPE2−/− mice showed worse neurological dysfunctions compared with WT mice at different time points after reperfusion (Fig. 2A). To confirm that the ischemic insult was equivalent among all groups, relevant physiological parameters were assessed before and during MCAO. As an example in Table 1, physiological variables were not significantly different between WT and TIPE2−/− mice before MCAO, during MCAO, or at 24 h after reperfusion. However, infarction volume at 24 h after reperfusion was significantly larger in TIPE2−/− mice (42.1 ± 3.8%) compared with WT mice (31.5 ± 3.3% (n = 8/group), p = 0.0016) (Fig. 2B). The increase in infarct size in TIPE2−/− mice was associated with more severe neurological impairment (Fig. 2A). To further assess the role of TIPE2 in ischemia-evoked neuronal apoptosis, H&E staining was used to show morphological features of injured neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (Fig. 2C). Cresyl violet staining was used to examine the surviving neurons (Fig. 2D). We found that ischemia/reperfusion induced severe neuron death in TIPE2−/− mice. TUNEL staining was used to assess the apoptosis-like neurons (Fig. 2E); a significant number of TUNEL-positive neurons manifested as brownish staining in the nuclei of TIPE2−/− mice. Collectively, these results indicate that a lack of TIPE2 is detrimental to the brain during ischemia.TABLE 1Comparison of physiological variablesWT miceTIPE2−/− miceBefore MCAOHeart rate (beats/min)455.13 ± 5.72459.36 ± 6.12Arterial blood pH738 ± 0.107.40 ± 0.08SpO2 (%)95.75 ± 0.5493.74 ± 0.89Temperature (°C)36.47 ± 0.2136.41 ± 0.11Glucose (mg/dl)215.25 ± 5.22213.16 ± 5.13During MCAOHeart rate (beats/min)451.33 ± 4.59449.28 ± 5.98Arterial blood pH7.38 ± 0.277.41 ± 0.31SpO2 (%)94.97 ± 0.7194.51 ± 0.57Temperature (°C)36.35 ± 0.2636.29 ± 0.31Glucose (mg/dl)222.13 ± 10.20217.67 ± 7.21After MCAOHeart rate (beats/min)451.49 ± 12.21453.57 ± 10.29Arterial blood pH7.37 ± 0.197.43 ± 0.35SpO2 (%)94.27 ± 0.6394.51 ± 0.92Temperature (°C)36.28 ± 05236.11 ± 0.32Glucose (mg/dl)211.22 ± 27.88203.27 ± 24.33 Open table in a new tab To elucidate the roles of TIPE2 in vivo, we measured the production of cytokines in ischemic brains of TIPE2−/− mice. We found that the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in the TIPE2−/− group were significantly enhanced compared with the ischemic brains of WT mice. The up-regulation of TNF-α peaked at 12 h after reperfusion, and the extent of the post-ischemic response was approximately the same as IL-1β, but a delayed peak expression of IL-6 was observed at 24 h after reperfusion. Expression of the chemokine MCP-1 was also dramatically increased and reached a peak value at 24 h after reperfusion (Fig. 3A). Leukocytes are major effectors of inflammatory damage after cerebral ischemia (18Gee J.M. Kalil A. Shea C. Becker K.J. Lymphocytes: potential mediators of post-ischemic injury and neuroprotection.Stroke. 2007; 38: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Wang Q. Tang X.N. Yenari M.A. The inflammatory response in stroke.J. Neuroimmunol. 2007; 184: 53-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). To determine whether the TIPE2 deficiency altered leukocyte composition in the brain after MCAO, the numbers of infiltrating Gr1+ neutrophils, CD11b+CD45high macrophages, and CD3+ T cells were evaluated by flow cytometry after 2 h of ischemia at different reperfusion times. We found that the accumulation of these leukocyte subtypes was significantly greater in the TIPE2−/− group after reperfusion. (Fig. 3, B–D). TIPE2 deficiency significantly increased in the percentage of neutrophils and microglia/macrophages especially during the early reperfusion period. It seems that the threshold of the leukocytes lacking TIPE2 was decreased. The infiltration patterns of neutrophils and macrophages were similar and reached a peak value at 48 h after reperfusion. On the other hand, T cell infiltration peaked at 72 h. Overall, the absence of TIPE2 has a profound effect on the inflammatory response after reperfusion. By real-time RT-PCR analysis, we found that, among the TNFAIP8 family members, TIPE2 mRNA levels were markedly enhanced in the brains from ischemic WT mice. TNFAIP8, TIPE1, and TIPE3 had no significant change compared with the sham groups, although TNFAIP8 had a tendency to decrease (Fig. 4A). We further confirmed the up-regulation of TIPE2 in post-ischemic brain by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B) and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 4C). To identify cell types that express TIPE2 in the brain after ischemia/reperfusion, dual immunofluorescence staining was performed. We identified neurons by staining for the neuronal nuclear marker NeuN, astrocytes by staining for GFAP, and activated microglia/macrophages by staining for CD11b. We found that TIPE2 is expressed in microglia from ischemic brain. However, our results did not reveal a colocalization of TIPE2 and GFAP (NeuN), despite expression of GFAP and TIPE2 in the direct vicinity (Fig. 4D), indicating that neither astrocytes nor neurons express TIPE2 before and after cerebral ischemia. Collectively, microglia are a major source of TIPE2 in regions vulnerable to ischemic insult. To provide evidence to establish the relationship between TIPE2 expression in microglia and the altered immune response in the brain, we isolated microglia and astrocytes, and purity was confirmed by staining with the specific markers. By immunofluorescence staining, we found that TIPE2 was expressed and reduced by OGD in microglia but not in astrocytes (Fig. 5A). We then examined the expression of cytokines in isolated microglia from both WT and TIPE2−/− mice. We found that TIPE2−/− microglia expressed significantly more cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1, than WT microglia upon OGD (Fig. 5B). Similar results were also obtained by knocking down TIPE2 expression in BV-2 cells (data not shown). Our results indicate that immune responses in TIPE2−/− microglia are augmented. In this study, we treated C57BL/6 mice with apocynin, a well known NADPH oxidase inhibitor, at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg 30 min before reperfusion as described (20Tang X.N. Cairns B. Cairns N. Yenari M.A. Apocynin improves outcome in experimental stroke with a narrow dose range.Neuroscience. 2008; 154: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cerebral ischemia induced expression of the NADPH oxidative subunit NOX2 (Fig. 6A), and its activity was markedly attenuated by apocynin treatment (Fig. 6B). Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity significantly reduced infarct volume (Fig. 6C) and the neurological deficit score (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, we further found that apocynin significantly induced more TIPE2 expression in ischemic WT mice (Fig. 6E). Together with our preliminary studies showing that apocynin had no effect on TIPE2 expression in WT mice under the sham-operated conditions, our results suggest that NADPH oxidase activity is involved in the regulation of TIPE2 expression after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. WT microglia were treated with LPS, and we found that LPS significantly reduced TIPE2 expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). To further elucidate the role of NADPH oxidase in the regulation of TIPE2 expression, apocynin was used in this study. As shown in Fig. 7 (B and C), NOX2 expression was markedly enhanced by OGD, and apocynin inhibited OGD-induced NADPH oxidase activity. Moreover, we found that OGD decreased TIPE2 expression, which could be recovered by apocynin (Fig. 7D). Increasing evidence indicates that the post-ischemic inflammatory response plays a detrimental role in the secondary progression of stroke injury (21Becker K.J. Modulation of the post-ischemic immune response to improve stroke outcome.Stroke. 2010; 41: S75-S78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Yilmaz G. Arumugam T.V. Stokes K.Y. Granger D.N. Role of T lymphocytes and interferon-γ in ischemic stroke.Circulation. 2006; 113: 2105-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Inflammatory cell recruitments and activation have been implicated in the progression of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Studies have demonstrated that the infiltration of T cells into the brain, as well as the cytokines IL-23 and IL-17, has a pivotal role in the evolution of brain infarction and the accompanying neurological deficits (23Shichita T. Sugiyama Y. Ooboshi H. Sugimori H. Nakagawa R. Takada I. Iwaki T. Okada Y. Iida M. Cua D.J. Iwakura Y. Yoshimura A. Pivotal role of cerebral interleukin-17-producing γδ T cells in the delayed phase of ischemic brain injury.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), and T and B cell-deficient mice with experimental stroke have reduced lesion size and inflammation (24Hurn P.D. Subramanian S. Parker S.M. Afentoulis M.E. Kaler L.J. Vandenbark A.A. Offner H. T and B cell-deficient mice with experimental stroke have reduced lesion size and inflammation.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2007; 27: 1798-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A major conundrum in the immunology of stroke is how to enhance the early immunoregulation that limits excessive inflammation of the central nervous system. This is the first report to characterize TIPE2, a newly identified regulator of immunity, in the brain and to evaluate the role of TIPE2 in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our results show that genetic ablation of the Tipe2 gene increased the cerebral volume of infarction, neurological dysfunction, inflammatory cytokine production, and infiltration of inflammatory cells in mice subjected to MCAO, suggesting a neuroprotective role of TIPE2 via anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the pathogenic processes of stroke. We further found that TIPE2 was highly induced after cerebral ischemia and that regulation of TIPE2 expression was associated with NADPH oxidase activity. These data indicate that TIPE2 is an immunoregulator that prevents deleterious inflammatory responses after stroke. A subfamily of proteins that contribute to cellular homeostasis possesses a hexahelical bundle motif called the death effector domain (DED) (25Freundt E.C. Bidere N. Lenardo M.J. A different TIPE of immune homeostasis.Cell. 2008; 133: 401-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Proteins with DED are key signal transducers involved in cell death and inflammation (26Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A.

A role for FADD in T cell activation and development.Immunity. 1998; 8: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The TNFAIP8 family is normally considered as a new subfamily of DED-containing proteins, although the three-dimensional structure of the TIPE2 DED-like domain is distinct (4Zhang X. Wang J. Fan C.

Recent reports have demonstrated that TIPE2 is an essential regulator of inflammation and immune homeostasis (1Sun H. Gong S. Carmody R.J. Hilliard A. Li L. Sun J. Kong L. Xu L. Hilliard B. Hu S.

Biol. 2009; 16: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). TIPE2 governs immune homeostasis by negatively regulating signaling by T cell receptors and TLRs. The most important findings of this study are that TIPE2 deficiency increases the cerebral volume of infarction in ischemic mice and that TIPE2 is significantly induced after cerebral ischemia, indicating that TIPE2 is involved in the pathogenesis of stroke. TIPE2 deficiency increasing the cerebral volume of infarction could account for inflammation. TIPE2 influences the production of proinflammatory cytokines and immune cell infiltration, which are required for the detrimental post-ischemic inflammatory response contributing to secondary brain damage. Although these data clearly implicate TIPE2 as a critical mediator of cerebral injury following stroke, the source and distribution of TIPE2 in ischemic brain remain to be further characterized. The brain responds to ischemic injury with acute and prolonged inflammatory phases, which are characterized by rapid activation of resident cells (mainly microglia), production of proinflammatory mediators, and infiltration of various types of inflammatory cells into the ischemic brain tissue (29Jin R. Yang G. Li G. Inflammatory mechanisms in ischemic stroke: role of inflammatory cells.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2010; 87: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). These cellular events collaboratively contribute to ischemic brain injury. It is not surprising that infiltration of inflammatory cells into ischemic brain contributes to the up-regulation of TIPE2 expression in ischemic brain as we reported in this study. We wondered whether TIPE2 is also induced in cerebral resident cells after ischemia to establish equilibrium during an inflammatory response; we then detected the expression of TIPE2 in three major types of cerebral cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain, play a critical role as resident immunocompetent and phagocytic cells in the brain. Resident microglia are activated within minutes of ischemia onset and produce a plethora of proinflammatory mediators to exacerbate tissue damage (29Jin R. Yang G. Li G. Inflammatory mechanisms in ischemic stroke: role of inflammatory cells.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2010; 87: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified that TIPE2 is expressed in microglia in the ischemic cerebral cortex and hippocampus rather than in astrocytes and neurons, although like microglia, astrocytes are also capable of secreting inflammatory factors. We isolated microglia from both WT and TIPE2−/− mice and found that TIPE2−/− microglia expressed significantly more cytokines upon OGD, indicating that TIPE2 from microglia may play an important role in the regulation of immune responses in cerebral ischemia injury. Recent studies have indicated that activation of the immune system as a result of disturbances in the redox state of cells seems to contribute to brain damage (30Arumugam T.V. Okun E. Tang S.C.

Inhibition of NADPH oxidase is neuroprotective after ischemia/reperfusion.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2009; 29: 1262-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that expression of the NADPH oxidase subunit NOX2 (gp91phox) and NADPH oxidase activity were dramatically increased after reperfusion. Therefore, it is important to determine whether the regulation of TIPE2 expression is associated with NADPH oxidase activity. Indeed, our results show that inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity further increased TIPE2 expression under cerebral ischemia conditions. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity after ischemia/reperfusion are associated with the regulation of TIPE2-related signaling pathways. In an in vitro study, the expression of TIPE2 was significantly decreased, and apocynin increased the expression of TIPE2 to protect against OGD in microglia. It is known that resting microglia are in a quiescent state and that their ability to induce inflammation is low. Upon cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, activation, recruitment, and accumulation of inflammatory cells are significantly enhanced. The results reported here indicate that TIPE2 serves as a regulator of this process. TIPE2 is constitutively expressed at relatively high levels in microglial cells to prevent their activation. Although OGD reduces TIPE2 levels in microglia, leading to enhanced immune responses as in vitro studies indicated, which is inconsistent with our in vivo study, the overall higher expression of TIPE2 may be due to more inflammatory cells infiltrating into the ischemic penumbra. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity further induced TIPE2 expression in microglia to protect against this damage. Thus, TIPE2 serves as a negative regulator of inflammation to maintain immune homeostasis by mediating oxidative stress. It should be noted that we did not further explore the regulatory mechanisms of TIPE2 expression by NADPH oxidase activity. Further studies need to address this issue. We investigated the expression and action of TIPE2 in the brain and addressed the role of TIPE2 in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that TIPE2 is involved in the pathogenesis of stroke and suggest that TIPE2 may play an essential role in a signal transduction pathway that links the inflammatory immune response to specific conditions after cerebral ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1547450215,"UV-induced stress response involves expression change of a myriad of genes, which play critical roles in modulating cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and cell survival. Alteration of microRNAs has been found in cells exposed to UV, yet their function in UV stress response remains elusive. Here, we show that UV radiation induces up-regulation of miR-125b, which negatively regulates p38α expression through targeting its 3'-UTR. Increase of miR-125b depends on UV-induced NF-κB activation, which enhances miR-125b gene transcription upon UV radiation. The DNA damage-responsive kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) is indispensable for UV-induced NF-κB activation, which may regulate p38α activation and IKKβ-dependent IκBα degradation in response to UV. Consequently, repression of p38α by miR-125b prohibits prolonged hyperactivation of p38α by UV radiation, which is required for protecting cells from UV-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our data support a critical role of NF-κB-dependent up-regulation of miR-125b, which forms a negative feedback loop to repress p38α activation and promote cell survival upon UV radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1993720041,"Annexin A2 (ANXA2) overexpression is required for cancer cell proliferation; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying ANXA2-mediated regulation of the cell cycle are still unknown. ANXA2 is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is positively correlated with a poor prognosis. NSCLC A549 cells lacking ANXA2 exhibited defects in tumor growth in vivo and in cell proliferation in vitro without cytotoxicity. ANXA2 knockdown induced cell cycle arrest at G(2) phase. Unexpectedly, ANXA2 silencing increased the expression of p53 and its downstream genes, which resulted in p53-dependent and -independent G(2) arrest. Aberrant JNK inactivation, which was observed in ANXA2-deficient cells, inhibited cell proliferation following G(2) arrest. A lack of ANXA2 caused a loss of JNK-regulated c-Jun expression, resulting in an increase in p53 transcription. These results demonstrate a novel role for ANXA2 in NSCLC cell proliferation by facilitating the cell cycle partly through the regulation of p53 via JNK/c-Jun."
https://openalex.org/W1978371202,"The Znt7 gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed zinc transporter that is involved in transporting cytoplasmic zinc into the Golgi apparatus and a ZnT7-containing vesicular compartment. Overexpression of ZnT7 in the pancreatic β-cell stimulates insulin synthesis and secretion through regulation of insulin gene transcription. In this study, we demonstrate that ZnT7 is expressed in the mouse skeletal muscle. The activity of the insulin signaling pathway was down-regulated in myocytes isolated from the femoral muscle of Znt7 knock-out (KO) mice. High fat diet consumption (45% kcal) induced weight gain in male Znt7 KO mice but not female Znt7 KO mice. Male Znt7 KO mice fed the high fat diet at 5 weeks of age for 10 weeks exhibited hyperglycemia in the non-fasting state. Oral glucose tolerance tests revealed that male Znt7 KO mice fed the high fat diet had severe glucose intolerance. Insulin tolerance tests showed that male Znt7 KO mice were insulin-resistant. Diet-induced insulin resistance in male Znt7 KO mice was paralleled by a reduction in mRNA expression of Insr, Irs2, and Akt1 in the primary skeletal myotubes isolated from the KO mice. Overexpression of ZnT7 in a rat skeletal muscle cell line (L6) increased Irs2 mRNA expression, Irs2 and Akt phosphorylation, and glucose uptake. We conclude that a combination of decreased insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance accounts for the glucose intolerance observed in Znt7 KO mice."

Development of live, attenuated vaccines has traditionally relied on empirical methods, such as growth in nonhuman cells. These approaches require substantial time and expense to identify vaccine candidates and to determine their mechanisms of attenuation.

We recently reported the discovery of an active site lysine residue that contributes to the catalytic efficiency of all nucleic acid polymerases (Castro, C., Smidansky, E. D., Arnold, J.

Given the conservation of this residue in all viral polymerases, this study suggests that a universal, mechanism-based strategy may exist for viral attenuation and vaccine development. The current state of the art for vaccinology limits the development of a vaccine as a first response to an epidemic caused by the natural or intentional spread of a new virus. Live, attenuated virus vaccines are most efficacious because both humoral and cellular immunity are generally elicited. In addition, transmission of the vaccine strain can lead to herd immunity. Creation of a live, attenuated virus vaccine usually involves random approaches, for example adaptation of a virus to growth at low temperatures or in nonhuman cell cultures (2Lauring A.S. Jones J.O. Andino R. Rationalizing the development of live attenuated virus vaccines.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The process of adaptation leads to numerous genetic changes, only a subset of which may be responsible for the attenuated phenotype in humans (3Nomoto A. Omata T. Toyoda H. Kuge S. Horie H.

One of these approaches involved increasing the replication fidelity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of a prototypical positive strand RNA virus, PV (10Vignuzzi M. Wendt E. Andino R. Engineering attenuated virus vaccines by controlling replication fidelity.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Enhanced replication fidelity of the viral RdRp has two major outcomes. First, the reduced genetic variation is attenuating because variants in the population required to evade barriers of the host are not generated at the appropriate frequency (11Vignuzzi M. Stone J.K. Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Andino R. Quasispecies diversity determines pathogenesis through cooperative interactions in a viral population.Nature. 2006; 439: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Second, the enhanced fidelity reduces the frequency of genetic reversion to a wild-type, pathogenic phenotype (12Arnold J.J. Vignuzzi M. Stone J.K. Andino R. Cameron C.E.

Unfortunately, none of the mutations in the RdRp gene that lead to increased replication fidelity are at positions conserved across virus families, making it difficult to extrapolate attenuation by enhanced fidelity to other systems. In this study, we show that mutating the conserved active site lysine residue that serves as a general acid catalyst during nucleotide incorporation to arginine produces a viral RdRp that replicates slower with higher fidelity. This virus variant is genetically stable, replicates well in cell culture, is attenuated (fails to cause disease), and elicits a protective immune response in vivo. Due to the conservation of this residue in viral polymerases, this study suggests that a universal, mechanism-based strategy may exist for viral attenuation and vaccine development.

For TCID50, virus was serially diluted in medium, and each dilution was added to 10 wells of a 96-well plate previously seeded with 5 × 103 HeLa cells. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 7 days before being manually scored for Cytopathic effect. The percentage of wells with CPE for each dilution was used to calculate viral titer (in TCID50/ml). When the same stock was titered by both methods, 1 pfu/ml was approximately equivalent to 20 TCID50/ml. To analyze one-step virus growth, cells in 12-well plates were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Virus was allowed to adsorb, cells were washed with PBS, medium was added to each well, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times after infection. Virus was harvested by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and virus titers were performed by TCID50 assays. Northern blots were performed as described previously (21Oh H.S. Pathak H.B.

HeLa cell monolayers in 6-well plates were pretreated for 1 h with various concentrations of ribavirin and then infected with 50 pfu of WT, G64S, or K359R PV, incubated for 20 min to allow for virus adsorption, and then washed and overlaid with 0.5% agarose medium containing the same concentration of ribavirin. Plates were incubated for 3–4 days at 37 °C before overlays were removed, and monolayers were stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted and compared with the untreated (0 mm ribavirin) control dish. To determine the IC50 value, the percentage of plaques was plotted as a function of ribavirin concentration and fit to a sigmoidal dose response equation (Equation 1)Y=A+((100-A)/(1+([ribavirin]/IC50)H))(Eq. 1) where Y is the percentage of plaques relative to untreated cells, A is the minimum percentage of plaques, and H is the Hill Slope.

Mice were bred and housed in standard ventilated caging for all experiments. Viral stocks generated in serum-free medium, harvested and titered as above, were diluted to 2 × 109 TCID50 per 3 ml of serum-free medium.

Surviving mice were challenged using the same methods with a lethal dose (2 × 109 TCID50) of WT PV 1 month after infection and observed for 14 days as above. Survival curves were performed using the product limit method of Kaplan and Meier and survival curve comparisons using the log rank test as provided by GraphPad Prism 4. p values are indicated. It is long established that nucleic acid polymerases use a two-metal-ion mechanism for nucleotidyl transfer (Fig. 1A)(24Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A.

In this mechanism, two magnesium ions are used to organize the reactants, 3′-OH of primer and α-phosphorous atom of the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), and one magnesium ion lowers the pKa of the 3′-OH for deprotonation by a base that has yet to be identified. We recently expanded the chemical mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer to include a general acid, which protonates the pyrophosphate leaving group of the NTP substrate and contributes a 50–2000-fold rate enhancement to nucleotidyl transfer (Fig. 1A)(1Castro C.

This residue is located in a motif termed D that is conserved in the structures of all RdRps and reverse transcriptases (Fig. 1B). Importantly, an orthologous residue is predicted in RNA viruses for which vaccines could be of great benefit (Fig. 1C).

The PV RdRp with Lys-359 substituted by Arg (referred to as K359R RdRp) is known to catalyze nucleotidyl transfer at a rate 10-fold lower than wild type (1Castro C. Smidansky E.D. Arnold J.J.

A slow polymerase with high incorporation fidelity could contribute to a stable, attenuated phenotype in the context of a virus. Fidelity was evaluated by two approaches using sym/sub-U, which has a uridine as the first templating nucleotide (Fig. 1D). The first approach monitored utilization of GTP (misincorporation); the second approach monitored utilization of ribavirin triphosphate (RTP). RTP was chosen because the first high fidelity variant of PV RdRp, G64S, was isolated by selection of mutants with reduced sensitivity to ribavirin, which was caused by reduced utilization of RTP (12Arnold J.J.

Under conditions in which AMP incorporation went to completion for both WT and K359R RdRps (lanes 2 and 5, Fig. 1E), a substantial reduction in GMP misincorporation and ribavirin monophosphate incorporation was observed for K359R RdRp (Fig. 1E, lanes 6 and 7) relative to WT RdRp (Fig. 1E, lanes 3 and 4). To obtain a more quantitative perspective of the change in fidelity, we evaluated the kinetics of incorporation of the various nucleotides at saturating concentrations. K359R RdRp was on the order of 5-fold more faithful than WT RdRp (Fig. 1F). Under the same conditions, G64S RdRp exhibited only a 2–3-fold enhancement in fidelity (Fig. 1F)(12Arnold J.J. Vignuzzi M. Stone J.K. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Remote site control of an active site fidelity checkpoint in a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25706-25716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because GMP incorporation opposite uridine represents the most facile misincorporation event, this study only establishes a lower limit for the increase in fidelity caused by the K359R substitution. To determine how the biochemical changes associated with the K359R RdRp impact virus multiplication in cell culture, we constructed a PV genome encoding the K359R RdRp. The AAA codon encoding lysine was changed to the CGT codon encoding arginine. Therefore, genetic reversion requires two transversion mutations, a very inefficient event that provides some barrier to reversion. Transcripts encoding the K359R RdRp were on the order of 10-fold less cytolytic to HeLa cells than those encoding WT RdRp (Fig. 2A). K359R PV recovered from this type of experiment exhibited a reduced rate of virus production, with a final yield 10-fold less than that of WT PV (Fig. 2B). Despite the reduced fitness of K359R PV, both the K359R change and the corresponding phenotype were stable over eight serial passages at a multiplicity of infection of infection from 0.1 to 1 (data not shown). Interestingly, the duration of neither the eclipse phase (lag) nor the exponential phase of infectious virus production was reduced by the magnitude of the nucleotidyl transfer rate (10-fold) measured in vitro (Fig. 2B). It is therefore possible that RNA synthesis does not contribute directly to the rate-limiting step for virus production. To address this possibility, we used Northern blotting to evaluate RNA synthesis as a function of time after infection. We found that the kinetics of RNA accumulation were clearly diminished (Fig. 2C). To increase the signal for replication, we engineered the K359R substitution into a PV subgenomic replicon that permits RNA synthesis to be evaluated indirectly by monitoring luciferase activity. In this experiment, it was clear that at least a 10-fold reduction occurred in all phases of genome replication (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data suggest that the biochemical defect associated with the Arg-359 substitution is manifested in cells. We interpret the reduction in viral genomes, and consequentially reduced infectious virus, to mean that some innate process capable of squelching RNA synthesis is manifested when replication requires longer than 4 h for completion. A PV variant exhibiting increased nucleotide incorporation fidelity exhibits reduced sensitivity to the antiviral nucleoside, ribavirin (12Arnold J.J. Vignuzzi M. Stone J.K. Andino R. Cameron C.E.

Chem. 2005; 280: 25706-25716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Pfeiffer J.K. Kirkegaard K.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7289-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess K359R fidelity in cells, we evaluated the sensitivity of K359R PV to ribavirin. By plaque assay, there was a clear reduction in sensitivity of K359R PV to ribavirin when compared with WT PV (Fig. 2E). The ribavirin resistance phenotype was on par with that observed for G64S PV (Fig. 2E), consistent with biochemical data for the corresponding polymerases (Fig. 1F). More rigorous analysis revealed an intermediate resistance for K359R PV relative to WT and G64S PVs (Fig. 2F). It is possible that the reduced speed of genome replication is antagonistic with the increased fidelity of genome replication, leading to the observation that K359R PV is less fit than G64S PV in the presence of ribavirin. In cells, K359R PV is delayed in growth but replicates with high fidelity. These characteristics predict that K359R PV should be more attenuated in animals than G64S PV. We compared the virulence of K359R PV with G64S and WT PVs in a mouse transgenic for the PV receptor (27Crotty S. Hix L. Sigal L.J. Andino R. Poliovirus pathogenesis in a new poliovirus receptor transgenic mouse model: age-dependent paralysis and a mucosal route of infection.J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this system, infection by WT PV is generally lethal (27Crotty S. Hix L. Sigal L.J. Andino R. Poliovirus pathogenesis in a new poliovirus receptor transgenic mouse model: age-dependent paralysis and a mucosal route of infection.J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At the highest dose of K359R PV readily attainable, none of the inoculated mice showed any symptoms of infection (Fig. 3A). At the same dose, both G64S and WT PVs caused two-limb paralysis (IACUC-approved end point for these experiments) (Fig. 3A). Previous studies of G64S PV used a different end point, thus permitting the diminished virulence of G64S PV relative to WT PV to be observed (11Vignuzzi M. Stone J.K. Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Andino R. Quasispecies diversity determines pathogenesis through cooperative interactions in a viral population.Nature. 2006; 439: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). To determine whether K359R PV actually replicates in the mice and has potential as a vaccine candidate, we performed a challenge experiment with WT PV. Mice were inoculated with K359R PV. Four weeks after inoculation, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of WT PV. All of the K359R PV-inoculated mice survived this lethal challenge; none of the mock-infected (naive) mice survived (Fig. 3B). We conclude that K359R PV replicates in these animals as UV-inactivated, replication-incompetent PV is incapable of eliciting immunity sufficient to protect against a lethal challenge with WT PV (10Vignuzzi M. Wendt E. Andino R. Engineering attenuated virus vaccines by controlling replication fidelity.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Vignuzzi M. Stone J.K. Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Andino R. Quasispecies diversity determines pathogenesis through cooperative interactions in a viral population.Nature. 2006; 439: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). To place the protection afforded by this mechanism-based approach into context, we compared the efficacy of K359R PV vaccination with that of Sabin-1 PV. Doses of K359R PV below 2 × 109 infectious units were less effective than the corresponding dose of Sabin-1 PV (Fig. 3C). Overall, the efficacy of K359R PV appeared on the order of one log lower than Sabin-1 PV in this model (Fig. 3C). Given that Sabin-1 PV has 57 nucleotide changes that cause 21 amino acid changes relative to the Mahoney strain of PV (3Nomoto A. Omata T. Toyoda H. Kuge S. Horie H. Kataoka Y. Genba Y. Nakano Y. Imura N. Complete nucleotide sequence of the attenuated poliovirus Sabin-1 strain genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 5793-5797Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), the attenuation and stability afforded by this single change of lysine to arginine is remarkable. We have used the PV system to show that the general acid of the viral RdRp can be changed to create a slower, more faithful RdRp derivative that produces an attenuated virus capable of protecting mice against a lethal challenge with wild-type virus. This is the first polymerase mechanism-based approach for viral attenuation. Importantly, this attenuation strategy can be easily and rapidly deployed in any positive-strand RNA virus, and perhaps other RNA and DNA viruses as well. As long as the polymerase belongs to one of the known superfamilies, sequence alone should be sufficient to identify the general acid (e.g. Fig. 1C). The polymerases of negative- and double-strand RNA viruses are all predicted to have this conserved lysine residue (22Poch O. Sauvaget I. Delarue M. Tordo N.

In addition, the replicative polymerases of herpes-pox and adenoviruses, all DNA viruses, are B-family polymerases predicted to have this conserved lysine (29Wang T.S. Wong S.W. Korn D. Human DNA polymerase α: predicted functional domains and relationships with viral DNA polymerases.FASEB J. 1989; 3: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Evaluating the impact of the Lys-to-Arg substitution in other viruses will be necessary to determine how generalizable this attenuation strategy will be. A great benefit associated with this attenuation mechanism is that it should combine in a predictable manner with other rational attenuation strategies, especially those that alter codon pair bias (7Coleman J.R. Papamichail D. Skiena S. Futcher B. Wimmer E. Mueller S.

Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The increased fidelity of RNA synthesis may further diminish the rate of genetic reversion and restoration of the virulent phenotype. An immediate application of this technology is in the production of seed stocks for creation of inactivated PV vaccine. Currently, wild-type strains are used, increasing production costs due to containment and limiting the number of sites globally capable of producing the vaccine, which leads to expenses for shipment and storage. An attenuating mutation in polymerase-coding sequence will not alter the stability or antigenicity of the capsid. It is also easy to envision using this polymerase mechanism-based strategy when the toxicity associated with virus is sufficiently high that virus yield is negatively impacted. This circumstance may have contributed to the shortage of vaccine for the swine flu outbreak in 2009. Viruses encoding polymerases with a substitution of the general acid may also prove to be useful reagents to study virus molecular and cellular biology. The 10-fold reduction in polymerase activity appears to prolong the kinetics of virus multiplication. Therefore, processes that occur early during infection may now be slow enough to interrogate experimentally. For example, during the first 30 min to 2 h after infection of HeLa cells by PV, the site of replication changes from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (30Hsu N.Y. Ilnytska O. Belov G.

https://openalex.org/W2107332416,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that significantly contributes to the mortality of patients with cystic fibrosis. Chronic infection by Pseudomonas induces sustained immune and inflammatory responses and damage to the airway. The ability of Pseudomonas to resist host defenses is aided, in part, by secreted proteases, which act as virulence factors in multiple modes of infection. Recent studies suggest that misregulation of protease activity in the cystic fibrosis lung may alter fluid secretion and pathogen clearance by proteolytic activation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). To evaluate the possibility that proteolytic activation of ENaC may contribute to the virulence of Pseudomonas, primary human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to P. aeruginosa and ENaC function was assessed by short circuit current measurements. Apical treatment with a strain known to express high levels of alkaline protease (AP) resulted in an increase in basal ENaC current and a loss of trypsin-inducible ENaC current, consistent with sustained activation of ENaC. To further characterize this AP-induced ENaC activation, AP was purified, and its folding, activity, and ability to activate ENaC were assessed. AP folding was efficient under pH and calcium conditions thought to exist in the airway surface liquid of normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs. Short circuit measurements of ENaC in polarized monolayers indicated that AP activated ENaC in immortalized cell lines as well as post-transplant, primary human bronchial epithelial cells from both CF and non-CF patients. This activation was mapped to the γ-subunit of ENaC. Based on these data, patho-mechanisms associated with AP in the CF lung are proposed wherein secretion of AP leads to decreased airway surface liquid volume and a corresponding decrease in mucocilliary clearance of pulmonary pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1982224124,"Cystathionine (R-S-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-l-homocysteine) is a non-proteinogenic thioether containing amino acid. In mammals, cystathionine is formed as an intermediate of the transsulfuration pathway by the condensation of serine and homocysteine (Hcy) in a reaction catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS). Cystathionine is subsequently converted to cysteine plus ammonia and α-ketobutyrate by the action of cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL). Pathogenic mutations in CBS result in CBS-deficient homocystinuria (HCU) which, if untreated, results in mental retardation, thromboembolic complications and connective tissue disorders. Currently there is no known function for cystathionine other than serving as an intermediate in transsulfuration and to date, the possible contribution of the abolition of cystathionine synthesis to pathogenesis in HCU has not been investigated. Using both mouse and cell-culture models, we have found that cystathionine is capable of blocking the induction of hepatic steatosis and kidney injury, acute tubular necrosis, and apoptotic cell death by the endoplasmic reticulum stress inducing agent tunicamycin. Northern and Western blotting analysis indicate that the protective effects of cystathionine occur without any obvious alteration of the induction of the unfolded protein response. Our data constitute the first experimental evidence that the abolition of cystathionine synthesis may contribute to the pathology of HCU and that this compound has therapeutic potential for disease states where ER stress is implicated as a primary initiating pathogenic factor."

The identity of human ELP1 through ELP4 has been reported but human ELP5 and ELP6 have remained uncharacterized. Here, we report that DERP6 (ELP5) and C3ORF75 (ELP6) encode these subunits of human Elongator. We further investigated the importance and function of these two subunits by a combination of biochemical analysis and cellular assays. Our results show that DERP6/ELP5 is required for the integrity of Elongator and directly connects ELP3 to ELP4. Importantly, the migration and tumorigenicity of melanoma-derived cells are significantly decreased upon Elongator depletion through ELP1 or ELP3. Strikingly, DERP6/ELP5 and C3ORF75/ELP6-depleted melanoma cells have similar defects, further supporting the idea that DERP6/ELP5 and C3ORF75/ELP6 are essential for Elongator function. Together, our data identify DERP6/ELP5 and C3ORF75/ELP6 as key players for migration, invasion and tumorigenicity of melanoma cells, as integral subunits of Elongator."

MB has previously been approved for testing in multiple human clinical trials to determine its value as an antiviral therapeutic, and as an adjuvant for injected vaccines. We have found a new use for this immunomodulator; it functions as a mucosal adjuvant that enhances immunogenicity of virus-like particles (VLP) administered intranasally. MB enhanced Norwalk virus (NV) VLP-specific IgG systemically and IgA production at distal mucosal sites following intranasal (IN) vaccination. A dose escalation study identified 100 µg as the optimal MB dosage in mice, based on the magnitude of VLP-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgA production in serum and VLP-specific IgA production at distal mucosal sites. IN vaccination using VLP with MB was compared to IN delivery VLP with cholera toxin (CT) or gardiquimod (GARD) and to parenteral VLP delivery with alum; the MB groups were equivalent to CT and GARD and superior to alum in inducing mucosal immune responses and stimulated equivalent systemic VLP-specific antibodies. These data support the further testing of MB as a potent mucosal adjuvant for inducing robust and durable antibody responses to non-replicating subunit vaccines."

Amino acids are identified with their topological site numbers as defined in the conventional globin fold, e.g. His-64(E7) in Mb is the distal histidine located at the position 7 from the N terminus of the E helix. The current evidence for movement of photodissociated ligands out of the distal pocket and into the Xe1 and Xe4 sites in SwMb is clear and comes from time-resolved spectroscopic methods (10Lim M.

However, these measurements cannot detect whether ligands enter and exit the protein from these transient positions. Ligand movements out of the protein involve overcoming larger activation barriers, and the resultant unstable transition states cannot be seen directly. Consequently, entry and exit pathways have to be inferred either theoretically from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or experimentally from the effects of mutagenesis on kinetic parameters for ligand entry and escape. In 1990, Elber and Karplus (21Elber R. Karplus M. Enhanced sampling in molecular dynamics.

Boxer S.G. Discovery of new ligand binding pathways in myoglobin by random mutagenesis.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) used an elegant random mutagenesis protocol to create and screen a library of ∼1,500 single point mutants. Mutations were identified from colonies that produced lysates containing Mbs with kinetic parameters significantly different (>50%) from those of wild-type (WT) controls. Roughly 10% of the mutants examined showed differences, and a structural model of Mb was constructed to highlight the positions of the mutants showing altered kinetic parameters. In addition to positions near the bound ligand, other regions were highlighted, including interior positions near the Xe cavities and the C-terminal portion of the H helix. These results were interpreted to mean that multiple pathways for CO and O2 entry and exit exist, supporting the conclusions from the initial MD simulations (32Huang X. Boxer S.G. Discovery of new ligand binding pathways in myoglobin by random mutagenesis.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Building on Huang and Boxer's strategy, our group explored the E7 gate and Xe cavity pathways in SwMb by a rational mutagenesis mapping strategy in which small (Gly or Ala) and large (Phe or Trp) mutations were constructed in ligand-accessible cavities, along the major trajectories specified by the MD simulations and at some of the positions found in the random mutagenesis screen (13Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. Mapping the pathways for O2 entry into and exit from myoglobin.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5177-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Each of 90 different mutants was produced in milligram quantities; geminate and bimolecular rate parameters for ligand binding were measured with pure proteins; and in many cases, crystal structures were determined (33Liong E.C.

A review of trp cavity mutations.IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis mapping results strongly indicate the following: 1) although O2 can move from the binding pocket into the Xe cavities, it must return to the distal pocket to exit the protein, and 2) the major pathway (≥75%) for O2 entry and exit is the short channel that opens by outward movement of the distal histidine side chain. The discrepancy between our mutagenesis map and that of Huang and Boxer (32Huang X. Boxer S.G. Discovery of new ligand binding pathways in myoglobin by random mutagenesis.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) is not as great as it first appears. The largest changes in their random mutagenesis map were observed at or near the E7 gate, and most of the effects observed at remote positions can be rationalized as false positives due to mutations that destabilize the Mb structure, leading to lysates containing partially unfolded proteins with exposed or weakly bound heme groups (i.e. many of the Pro substitutions (32Huang X. Boxer S.G. Discovery of new ligand binding pathways in myoglobin by random mutagenesis.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). The multiple trajectories obtained from MD simulations are harder to reconcile and imply that either we cannot “find” internal pathways with a rational mutagenesis mapping strategy or the models and interaction potentials used in the simulations cannot accurately define ligand movements into solvent. In 2002, Pesce et al. (39Pesce A. Nardini M. Dewilde S. Geuens E. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Riggs A.F. Moens L. Bolognesi M. The 109-residue nerve tissue minihemoglobin from Cerebratulus lacteus highlights striking structural plasticity of the α-helical globin fold.Structure. 2002; 10: 725-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported the structure of the mini-hemoglobin from the sea worm Cerebratulus lacteus (CerHb). CerHb is a neuronal O2 storage protein, which surrounds the axons and brain of the Nemertean worm, and it rapidly releases O2 when the worm burrows into sand and becomes anaerobic while searching for prey (40Vandergon T.L. Riggs C.K. Gorr T.A. Colacino J.M. Riggs A.F. The mini-hemoglobins in neural and body wall tissue of the nemertean worm, Cerebratulus lacteus.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16998-17011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The analysis of the CerHb crystal structure revealed the presence of an apolar tunnel leading from the distal pocket to solvent, with an exit point between the E and H helices created by the loss of the N-terminal A helix (Fig. 1B). This tunnel was suggested to be the major route of entry and exit for O2 binding, and later work indicated that this “open” channel accounts for the very large association rate constants for O2 and NO binding to CerHb (200–300 μm−1 s−1), which are close to the values expected for diffusion-controlled processes (41Pesce A. Nardini M. Ascenzi P. Geuens E. Dewilde S. Moens L. Bolognesi M. Riggs A.F. Hale A. Deng P. Nienhaus G.U. Olson J.S. Nienhaus K.

Our initial mutagenesis and Xe binding studies of CerHb supported the original idea of Pesce et al. (39Pesce A. Nardini M. Dewilde S. Geuens E. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Riggs A.F. Moens L. Bolognesi M.

Chem. 2011; 286: 5347-5358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, we have used CerHb as a counter example to SwMb where the histidine gate mechanism for O2 binding appears to apply. However, Orlowski and Nowak (44Orlowski S. Nowak W. Oxygen diffusion in minihemoglobin from Cerebratulus lacteus. A locally enhanced sampling study.Theor. Chem. Acc. 2007; 117: 253-258Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) carried out simulations with CerHb and, as with SwMb, obtained multiple trajectories with the apolar tunnel being only one of them. To resolve this discrepancy and determine whether the experimental mutagenesis mapping strategy can identify internal pathways, we constructed and examined the O2, CO, and NO ligand binding properties of 120 different mutants of CerHb. Rates of ligand entry and exit for this library of CerHb variants were compared with results for an expanded library of SwMb mutants, which extends the results of Scott et al. (13Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. Mapping the pathways for O2 entry into and exit from myoglobin.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5177-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) to regions near the ends of the E and H helices. Our goals were: 1) to verify the mutagenesis mapping strategy; 2) to define experimentally the ligand pathways in the two proteins; 3) to compare the results to MD simulations; and 4) to provide benchmarks for future theoretical work. WT and mutant recombinant CerHbs were expressed and purified as described previously using a synthetic gene with codon usage optimized for expression in Escherichia coli (39Pesce A. Nardini M.

The Vps-C complex regulates multiple vesicle transport pathways to the lysosome in lower organisms. However, little is known regarding its physiological function in mammals. We deleted Vps18, a central member of Vps-C core complex, in neural cells by generating Vps18(F/F); Nestin-Cre mice (Vps18 conditional knock-out mice). These mice displayed severe neurodegeneration and neuronal migration defects. Mechanistic studies revealed that Vps18 deficiency caused neurodegeneration by blocking multiple vesicle transport pathways to the lysosome, including autophagy, endocytosis, and biosynthetic pathways. Our study also showed that ablation of Vps18 resulted in up-regulation of β1 integrin in mouse brain probably due to lysosome dysfunction but had no effects on the reelin pathway, expression of N-cadherin, or activation of JNK, which are implicated in the regulation of neuronal migration. Finally, we demonstrated that knocking down β1 integrin partially rescued the migration defects, suggesting that Vps18 deficiency-mediated up-regulation of β1 integrin may contribute to the defect of neuronal migration in the Vps18-deficient brain. Our results demonstrate important roles of Vps18 in neuron survival and migration, which are disrupted in multiple neural disorders."

Activation by Ca2+ is slower at low pH (2H+·E2 to E1·2Ca2+) and little sensitive to temperature-dependent activation energy. On the other hand, subsequent (forward or reverse) phosphoenzyme processing is sensitive to activation energy, which relieves conformational constraints limiting Ca2+ translocation. A “H+-gated pathway,” demonstrated by experiments on pH variations, charge transfer, and Glu-309 mutation allows luminal Ca2+ release by H+/Ca2+ exchange. As compared with SERCA, initial utilization of ATP by ATP7A/B is much slower and highly sensitive to temperature-dependent activation energy, suggesting conformational constraints of the headpiece domains.

Recently, a novel plasma protein named MBL/ficolin-associated protein-1 (MAP-1) was identified in humans. This protein is the result of a differential splicing of the MASP1 gene and includes the major part of the heavy chain but lacks the serine protease domain. We investigated the direct interactions of MAP-1 and MASP-3 with ficolin-3 and MBL using surface plasmon resonance and found affinities around 5 nm and 2.5 nm, respectively. We studied structural aspects of MAP-1 and could show by multi-angle laser light scattering that MAP-1 forms a calcium-dependent homodimer in solution. We were able to determine the crystal structure of MAP-1, which also contains a head-to-tail dimer ∼146 Å long. This structure of MAP-1 also enables modeling and assembly of the MASP-1 molecule in its entirety. Finally we found that MAP-1 competes with all three MASPs for ligand binding and is able to mediate a strong dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the lectin pathway activation, as measured by levels of C3 and C9."
https://openalex.org/W2043569763,"There has been ongoing debate over whether tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) is pro- or anti-oncogenic. We confirmed that TIMP-1 reinforced cell proliferation in an αvβ3 integrin-dependent manner and conferred resistance against cytotoxicity triggered by TNF-α and IL-2 in WiDr colon cancer cells. The cell-proliferative effects of TIMP-1 contributed to clonogenicity and tumor growth during the onset and early phase of tumor formation in vivo and in vitro. However, mass-produced TIMP-1 impeded further tumor growth by tightly inhibiting the activities of collagenases, which are critical for tumor growth and malignant transformation. Tumor cells could overcome this impasse by overexpression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V, which deteriorates TIMP-1 into an aberrant glycoform. The aberrant glycoform of TIMP-1 was responsible for the mitigated inhibition of collagenases. The outbalanced activities of collagenases can degrade the basement membrane and the interstitial matrix, which act as a physical barrier for tumor growth and progression more efficiently. The concomitant overexpression of TIMP-1 and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V enabled WiDr cells to show a higher tumor growth rate as well as more malignant behaviors in a three-dimensional culture system."

To explore the link of pericellular proteolysis to events relevant to capillary sprouting within the inflammatory context, we aimed at the identification of the collection of substrates of the protease MT1-MMP in endothelial tip cells induced by inflammatory stimuli. We applied quantitative proteomics to endothelial cells (ECs) derived from wild-type and MT1-MMP-null mice to identify the substrate repertoire of this protease in TNF-α-activated ECs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a combinatorial MT1-MMP proteolytic program, in which combined rather than single substrate processing would determine biological decisions by activated ECs, including chemotaxis, cell motility and adhesion, and vasculature development. MT1-MMP-deficient ECs inefficiently processed several of these substrates (TSP1, CYR61, NID1, and SEM3C), validating the model. This novel concept of MT1-MMP-driven combinatorial proteolysis in angiogenesis might be extendable to proteolytic actions in other cellular contexts.—Koziol, A., Gonzalo, P., Mota, A., Pollán, Á., Lorenzo, C., Colomé, N., Montaner, D., Dopazo, J., Arribas, J., Canals, F., Arroyo, A.

https://openalex.org/W1990564989,"Paralemmin-1 is a protein implicated in plasma membrane dynamics, the development of filopodia, neurites and dendritic spines, as well as the invasiveness and metastatic potential of cancer cells. However, little is known about its mode of action, or about the biological functions of the other paralemmin isoforms: paralemmin-2, paralemmin-3 and palmdelphin. We describe here evolutionary analyses of the paralemmin gene family in a broad range of vertebrate species. Our results suggest that the four paralemmin isoform genes (PALM1, PALM2, PALM3 and PALMD) arose by quadruplication of an ancestral gene in the two early vertebrate genome duplications. Paralemmin-1 and palmdelphin were further duplicated in the teleost fish specific genome duplication. We identified a unique sequence motif common to all paralemmins, consisting of 11 highly conserved residues of which four are invariant. A single full-length paralemmin homolog with this motif was identified in the genome of the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus and an isolated putative paralemmin motif could be detected in the genome of the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae. This allows us to conclude that the paralemmin gene family arose early and has been maintained throughout vertebrate evolution, suggesting functional diversification and specific biological roles of the paralemmin isoforms. The paralemmin genes have also maintained specific features of gene organisation and sequence. This includes the occurrence of closely linked downstream genes, initially identified as a readthrough fusion protein with mammalian paralemmin-2 (Palm2-AKAP2). We have found evidence for such an arrangement for paralemmin-1 and -2 in several vertebrate genomes, as well as for palmdelphin and paralemmin-3 in teleost fish genomes, and suggest the name paralemmin downstream genes (PDG) for this new gene family. Thus, our findings point to ancient roles for paralemmins and distinct biological functions of the gene duplicates."

We aimed at identifying the polyubiquitin signal that mediates proteasomal action and at a better characterization of the role of CDK1 inactivation at this stage of meiosis. Microinjections of mutated ubiquitin proteins into mouse oocytes revealed that interference with lysine-11 polyubiquitin chains abrogated chromosome segregation and reduced PBI extrusion by 63% as compared to WT ubiquitin-injected controls. Inactivation of CDK1 in oocytes arrested at first metaphase by a proteasome inhibitor fully rescued PBI extrusion. However, removal of CDK1 inhibition failed to allow progression to the second metaphase, rather, inducing PBI reengulfment in 62% of the oocytes. Inhibition of either PLK1 or MEK1/2 during the first anaphase changed spindle dimensions. The PLK1 inhibitor also blocked PBI emission and prevented RhoA translocation. Our results identified lysine-11 rather than the canonic lysine-48 ubiquitin chains as the degradation signal in oocytes resuming meiosis, further disclosing that CDK1 inactivation is necessary and sufficient for PBI emission. This information significantly contributes to our understanding of faulty chromosome segregation that may lead to aneuploidy."
https://openalex.org/W1990816617,"The Wnt β-catenin pathway controls numerous cellular processes including cell differentiation and cell-fate decisions. Wnt ligands engage Frizzled receptors and the low-density-lipoprotein-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) receptor complex leading to the recruitment of Dishevelled (Dvl) and Axin1 to the plasma membrane. Axin1 has a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain that binds adenomatous polyposis coli and Gα subunits, thereby providing a mechanism by which Gα subunits can affect β-catenin levels. Here we show that Wnt signaling enhances the expression of another RGS domain-containing protein, PDZ-RGS3. Reducing PDZ-RGS3 levels impaired Wnt3a-induced activation of the canonical pathway. PDZ-RGS3 bound GSK3β and decreased its catalytic activity toward β-catenin. PDZ-RGS3 overexpression enhanced Snail1 and led to morphological and biochemical changes reminiscent of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). These results indicate that PDZ-RGS3 can enhance signals generated by the Wnt canonical pathway and that plays a pivotal role in EMT."

T cell receptor ovalbumin bronchoalveolar lavage T helper type 1 nuclear factor of activated T cell bronchoalveolar lavage. CD4+ T cells play multiple and essential roles in the immune system. They help B cells generate antibody, regulate responses of CD8+ T cells, modulate macrophage functions and coordinate immune responses against pathogenic microorganisms. These functions are largely achieved by the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into effector cells after stimulation by antigen presentation and the cytokine environment (12Zhu J. Yamane H. Paul W.E. Differentiation of effector CD4 T cell populations.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 28: 445-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). There are at least four types of T helper cells, Th1, Th2, Th17, and Tregs. Although the specific role of p38α in T cells is not known, previous studies using mice expressing a dominant negative form of p38 have demonstrated reduced expression of IFN-γ in Th1 cells (13Rincón M.

These results suggest that inhibition of p38 may promote IL-4 production and Th2 responses.

Therefore, to understand the physiologic role of p38α in T cell-mediated immune responses, we have utilized a newly established p38α conditional deletion system. Our studies demonstrate that disruption of p38α in CD4+ T cells promotes IL-4 production in response to antigen stimulation. p38α-deficient CD4+ T cells preferentially differentiate into Th2 phenotype through increased endogenous production of IL-4. During T helper cell activation, mRNA and protein levels of p38α are decreased. p38α deficiency alters the balance in the expression of NFATc1 and NFATc2 and increases protein level and nuclear translocation of NFATc1 in CD4+ T cells upon TCR stimulation. Down-regulation of NFATc1 reverses enhanced Th2 differentiation due to absence of p38α. Deletion of p38α also impairs TCR-induced activation of Akt and enhances the activation of ERK. In ovalbumin-induced acute allergic airway inflammation, p38α−/− mice show increased infiltration of eosinophils and a higher concentration of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid relative to control mice. We conclude that p38α is a negative regulator of Th2 responses in vitro and in vivo by affecting multiple TCR-associated signals.

First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript system (Invitrogen). Gene expression was examined with the 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the Stratagene Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR kit. Data were normalized to the expression of β-actin. Primer set for p38α detection was purchased from RealTimePrimers (Elkins Park, PA). Splenocytes were mechanically disrupted to obtain single cell suspensions. Splenocytes were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody. Cells were pulsed with 1.0 μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) during the last 6 h of a 48-h culture period. Cells were then harvested with an automated 96-well cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD), and thymidine incorporation was determined as counts per minute. Splenocytes from OVA-sensitized mice were stimulated with OVA (100 μg/ml) for 72 h, cell-free supernatants were collected, and the concentrations of IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-γ were measured by ELISA. Naïve CD4+CD25−CD62LhiCD44lo T cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were purified from spleen via magnetic isolation (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). For Th0 differentiation, purified naïve T cells in complete RPMI 1640 medium with IL-2 (25units/ml) were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (2 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) antibodies. Cells were expanded on day 3. After 5 days of culture, differentiated cells were re-stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and stained for IL-4 and IFN-γ or re-stimulated to prepare supernatants, and cytokine production was measured by ELISA. For Th1 differentiation, IL-12 (5 ng/ml) and anti-IL-4 (10 μg/ml; BD Bioscience) were added to primary cultures. For Th2 differentiation, IL-4 (5 ng/ml) and anti-IFN-γ (10 μg/ml; BD Bioscience) were added to primary cultures. For Th17 differentiation, IL-6 (20 ng/ml), TGF-β (2 ng/ml), anti-IL-4 (10 μg/ml), and anti-IFN-γ (10 μg/ml) were used. CD4+ T cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Nuclear extracts were prepared by first incubating the cells with a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors for 15 min, then 0.4% Nonidet P-40 was added, and cells were vortexed. Cells were then spun to pellet at 6000 rpm for 5 min in a benchtop centrifuge. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in an extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.63 m NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors, then vigorously vortexed for 30 min in the cold room. The lysed nuclei were centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min. For nuclear translocation assay, the supernatants were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The pMKO.1 GFP retroviral vector (Addgene plasmid 10676, Cambridge, MA) was kindly provided by Dr. William Hahn. Mouse NFATc1 shRNA sequences were obtained from Origene and were cloned into pMKO.1 GFP vector. Recombinant retrovirus was generated as described (16Hu P. Carlesso N. Xu M. Liu Y. Nebreda A.R. Takemoto C. Kapur R. Genetic evidence for critical roles of p38α protein in regulating mast cell differentiation and chemotaxis through distinct mechanisms.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20258-20269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For retroviral transduction, purified naïve CD4+ T cells were activated by plate-bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 and were “spininfected” with fresh retroviral supernatant containing Polybrene. After viral transduction, GFP-positive cells were sorted and cultured under Th0 condition for further analysis. To induce acute allergic airway inflammation, mice were sensitized on day 0 and day 7 by intraperitoneal injection of 25 μg of OVA emulsified in aluminum hydroxide gel (Sigma). On days 14, 15, and 16, anesthetized mice were challenged intranasal with 100 μg of OVA in PBS. Mice were analyzed after the last challenge. Mice were anesthetized and the tracheas were cannulated. BAL fluid was collected with 1.0 ml of ice-cold PBS. BAL fluid was centrifuged at 1400 × g, and the supernatant was used to measure cytokine levels. The pellet was resuspended, the total cell count was measured, and cytospin was prepared. Lungs were fixed (10% formaldehyde) overnight. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue, and Giemsa. Supernatants were collected for cytokine detection. Cytokines were detected with ELISA kit from Biolegend (IL-4, IL-5, IFN-γ, and IL-17A) according to the instructions. Serum OVA-specific IgE was quantified with ELISA kit from SHIBAYGI (Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two-group comparisons were done with Student's t tests. Intergroup differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. To address the genetic role of p38α in regulation of immune response, a newly established p38α conditional deletion system was utilized (14Ventura J.J. Tenbaum S. Perdiguero E. Huth M. Guerra C. Barbacid M. Pasparakis M. Nebreda A.R. p38α MAP kinase is essential in lung stem and progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.Nat.

Previous studies have used Mx-Cre mice to efficiently delete the targeted gene to study its effect on CD4+ T helper cells (17Hao Z. Hampel B. Yagita H. Rajewsky K. T cell-specific ablation of Fas leads to Fas ligand-mediated lymphocyte depletion and inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis.J. Exp.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8691-8696Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By crossing mice bearing floxed p38α alleles with Mx-Cre bearing mice, p38α protein in splenocytes and purified CD4+CD25−CD62LhiCD44lo naïve T cells from p38α−/− mice was completely deleted after three injections of polyIC (Fig. 1A). Based on previous reports and our observations, there was no significant phenotypic difference between wild type and p38α+/− mice. Thus, in this study, we used p38α+/− mice as the control mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that CD4:CD8 ratios were similar in the thymus and spleen of p38α+/− and p38α−/− mice (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that inactivation of p38α does not perturb the development of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. We next investigated T cell function in the absence of p38α. Inhibition of the p38 pathway promotes cell cycle progression in multiple cell types (14Ventura J.J. Tenbaum S. Perdiguero E. Huth M. Guerra C. Barbacid M. Pasparakis M. Nebreda A.R. p38α MAP kinase is essential in lung stem and progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 19Hui L.

Wagner E.F. p38α suppresses normal and cancer cell proliferation by antagonizing the JNK-c-Jun pathway.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To determine whether p38α affects T cell proliferation in response to antigen exposure, splenocytes from p38α+/− and p38α−/− mice were stimulated with αCD3 and αCD28 antibodies. [3H]Thymidine incorporation assay showed that p38α−/− T cells proliferated modestly but significantly more than p38α+/− T cells (Fig. 1C). Studies have shown that IL-4 prevents the apoptosis of CD4+ T cells in the absence of TCR activation (20Lee K. Gudapati P. Dragovic S. Spencer C. Joyce S. Killeen N. Magnuson M.A. Boothby M. Mammalian target of rapamycin protein complex 2 regulates differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cell subsets via distinct signaling pathways.Immunity. 2010; 32: 743-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We, therefore, questioned whether deletion of p38α imposed more resistance in T cells to apoptotic stimuli. Under culture conditions lacking IL-4, apoptotic CD4+ T cells detected by annexin V and aminoactinomycin D staining were not altered as a result of p38α deficiency (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that inactivation of p38α is dispensable for T cell development and apoptosis but modestly influences T cell proliferation. CD4+ helper T cells are the essential regulator of adaptive immunity. After being activated, naïve CD4+ precursor cells differentiate into cytokine-secreting effector cells. Th1 produce interferon-γ, and Th2 cells make IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (21Ansel K.M. Djuretic I. Tanasa B. Rao A. Regulation of Th2 differentiation and Il4 locus accessibility.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 607-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the cytokine profile of CD4+ T cells from p38α−/− mice after TCR stimulation. Control and p38α−/− mice were immunized with OVA plus aluminum hydroxide, and total splenocytes were isolated and re-stimulated with OVA to determine the antigen-specific T cell response. As shown in Fig. 2A, enhanced production of IL-4 and IL-5 was detected by ELISA from p38α−/− splenocytes compared with control splenocytes. However, the production of IFN-γ, a key Th1 cytokine, was lower in p38α−/− splenocytes relative to control splenocytes. These results suggest that deletion of p38α causes a systemic increase in Th2 immunity. To further determine whether the enhanced Th2 cytokine production is due to an intrinsic T cell hyperresponsiveness to antigen stimulation, purified CD4+CD25−CD62LhiCD44lo naive T cells from control and p38α−/− mice were stimulated with plate-bound antibody to CD3 and anti-(α)CD28 for 48 h. The absence of p38α triggered greater production of IL-4. Meanwhile, the production of IFN-γ moderately decreased in p38α−/− T cells compared with control T cells (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that inactivation of p38 promotes the production of Th2 cytokines in T cells when exposed to antigen stimulation. Because p38α−/− CD4+ T cells showed enhanced production of IL-4 and IL-4 is required for the initiation of Th2 cell differentiation (21Ansel K.M. Djuretic I. Tanasa B. Rao A. Regulation of Th2 differentiation and Il4 locus accessibility.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 607-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), we examined if p38α regulates the differentiation of Th2 cells. To assess whether deficiency of p38α in T cells interfered with their ability to differentiate into IL-4-producing Th2 cells, IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells, and IL-17-producing Th17 cells, naïve CD4+CD25−CD62LhiCD44lo T cells were purified from control and p38α−/− spleens and cultured under neutral (Th0), Th1, Th2, or Th17 polarizing conditions. In the Th0 condition, the frequency of IL-4-producing cells increased almost 2-fold as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A), and a more potent production of IL-4 and IL-5 was detected by ELISA in supernatants derived from p38α−/− cultures (Fig. 3B). In contrast, p38α deficiency resulted in fewer IFN-γ-producing cells, and reduced production of IFN-γ was seen by ELISA in supernatants from cultured cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Both p38α+/− and p38α−/− CD4+ T cells barely differentiated into Th17 cells or produced IL-17A under Th0 conditions (data not shown). In Th2 conditions, with excess exogenous IL-4, p38α−/− T cells developed into IL-4+ cells as efficiently as control T cells, and no significant difference in the secretion of IL-4 was observed between p38α−/− and control T cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Th1-polarizing conditions induced a moderate decrease in the percentage of IFN-γ-producing cells and less IFN-γ production in p38α-deficient populations than in control populations (Fig. 3, C and D). Noubade et al. (22Noubade R. Krementsov D.N. Del Rio R. Thornton T. Nagaleekar V. Saligrama N. Spitzack A. Spach K. Sabio G. Davis R.J. Rincon M. Teuscher C. Activation of p38 MAPK in CD4 T cells controls IL-17 production and autoimmune.Blood. 2011; 118: 3290-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) reported that p38 controls Th17 development in a T cell-intrinsic manner. However, Huang et al. (23Huang G. Wang Y. Vogel P. Kanneganti T.D. Otsu K. Chi H. Signaling via the kinase p38α programs dendritic cells to drive TH17 differentiation and autoimmune inflammation.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) recently reported that p38α plays a selective role in dendritic cell-mediated Th17 differentiation but not in T cell-intrinsic Th17 differentiation. In our experiments we detected no significant difference in the differentiation of Th17 cells between p38α+/− and p38α−/− CD4+ T cells under Th17 skewing conditions (Fig. 3, C and D). These results suggest that p38α may not regulate Th17 differentiation directly. The differences in the conclusions among different research groups could be a result of differences in the specificity of the mouse models used. We further wondered whether p38α modulates the expression of the master transcription factors involved in T helper cell differentiation, including T-bet (Th1), Gata-3 (Th2), and RORγt (Th17). Consistent with the differentiation data, deletion of p38α slightly increased the expression of Gata-3 and inhibited the expression of T-bet. At the same time, p38α deficiency did not significantly alter RORγt expression (Fig. 3, E and F). Next, we showed that the presence of anti-IL-4 abolished the ability of p38α−/− naïve T cells to preferentially commit to the Th2 phenotype and mildly increased Th1 differentiation in p38α−/− T cells (Fig. 3G). This observation is consistent with the concept of inhibitory action of IL-4 on Th1 development (24Seder R.A. Paul W.E. Davis M.M. Fazekas de St Groth B. The presence of interleukin 4 during in vitro priming determines the lymphokine-producing potential of CD4+ T cell from T cell receptor transgenic mice.J. Exp.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 6065-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Together, these results demonstrate that in the absence of polarizing cytokine, TCR-induced IL-4 production by CD4+ T helper cells is enhanced due to the absence of p38α, and p38α-deficient naive T cells preferentially differentiate into Th2 cells due to increased endogenous production of IL-4. In T helper cells, short-term stimulation of TCR (less than an hour) can activate p38 through alternative mechanisms that are independent of MKK3/6 (7Salvador J.M. Mittelstadt P.R. Guszczynski T. Copeland T.D. Yamaguchi H. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. Ashwell J.D. Alternative p38 activation pathway mediated by T cell receptor-proximal tyrosine kinases.Nat.

Scaffold protein Dlgh1 coordinates alternative p38 kinase activation, directing T cell receptor signals toward NFAT but not NF-κB transcription factors.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the expression of p38α during a time span required for T helper cell differentiation remains unknown. We collected protein samples from wild type naïve CD4+ T cells that were induced to differentiate under un-polarized conditions (Th0). Western blotting results showed that compared with naïve CD4+ T cells, p38α levels were significantly reduced during T cell differentiation (Fig. 4A), whereas the expression of NFATc1, a positive regulator of IL-4 production and Th2 differentiation (26Hodge M.R. Ranger A.M. Charles de la Brousse F. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Hyperproliferation and dysregulation of IL-4 expression in NF-ATP-deficient mice.Immunity. 1996; 4: 397-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), was increased (Fig. 4A). The inverse expression pattern between p38α and NFATc1 further suggests that repression of p38α pathway may be necessary for IL-4 secretion and Th2 development. We further examined the mechanism underlying down-regulation of p38α during T cell commitment. Treatment of cells with bafilomycin A1, a lysosome inhibitor, and MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, failed to prevent reduc"
https://openalex.org/W2112848646,"We developed a novel, highly accurate, capillary based vacuum-assisted microdissection device CTAS - Cell and Tissue Acquisition System, for efficient isolation of enriched cell populations from live and freshly frozen tissues, which can be successfully used in a variety of molecular studies, including genomics and proteomics. Specific diameter of the disposable capillary unit (DCU) and precisely regulated short vacuum impulse ensure collection of the desired tissue regions and even individual cells. We demonstrated that CTAS is capable of dissecting specific regions of live and frozen mouse and rat brain tissues at the cellular resolution with high accuracy. CTAS based microdissection avoids potentially harmful physical treatment of tissues such as chemical treatment, laser irradiation, excessive heat or mechanical cell damage, thus preserving primary functions and activities of the dissected cells and tissues. High quality DNA, RNA, and protein can be isolated from CTAS-dissected samples, which are suitable for sequencing, microarray, 2D gel-based proteomic analyses, and Western blotting. We also demonstrated that CTAS can be used to isolate cells from native living tissues for subsequent recultivation of primary cultures without affecting cellular viability, making it a simple and cost-effective alternative for laser-assisted microdissection."

The latter studies suggest that IL-7/IL-7Rα signaling plays a supportive role in DN-to-DP transition, which contradicts some other studies. Insights into direct interaction of IL-7 and pre-TCR signaling pathways could help resolve the controversy.

However, Jurkat cells are considered to be mature T cells and do not recapitulate T cell precursor activities during pre-T cell development. Therefore, we evaluated different T cell progenitor T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines and engineered an IL-7Rα-expressing Molt3 cell line as a model pre-T cell system. Our results indicate that IL-7 enhances pre-TCR signaling through Erk1/2 and Akt pathways. This is consistent with the report that receptors with cytoplasmic domain-associated kinases aggregate with TCR and promote TCR signaling. On the other hand, the receptors with phosphatase-associated cytoplasmic domains move away from TCR (38Kabouridis P.S. Lipid rafts in T cell receptor signaling.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Further examination of the membrane compartmentalization of IL-7Rα and CD3ζ in live cells using confocal microscopy indicated that IL-7Rα co-localizes with CD3ζ, confirming a cooperative role of IL-7Rα in pre-TCR signaling. The antibodies used for surface and intracellular staining were as follows: phycoerythrin-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD3 (clone SK7), Pacific Blue-conjugated anti-CD4 (clone RPA-T4), allophycocyanin-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD8 (clone SK1), FITC-conjugated anti-phospho-Tyr-694 STAT5 (clone 47), phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-phospho-Ser-473 Akt (clone M89-61), and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-phospho-Thr-202/phospho-Tyr-204 Erk1/2 (clone 20A) (BD Biosciences); anti-CD127 (clone 40131; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); and anti-pre-Tα (G-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For flow cytometry staining, cells were first washed with PBS plus 2% FBS and blocked with mouse and human serum at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were incubated with antibodies following the manufacturers' instructions. For each fluorochrome-labeled antibody used, an appropriate isotype control was included. After antibody staining, the cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Intracellular staining was performed using a BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For detection of phosphorylated proteins, cells were stimulated using the indicated stimulus for 15 min. The cells were then fixed by adding an equal amount of prewarmed 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 90% methanol for 30 min on ice or at −20 °C overnight. Next, the cells were washed and incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, followed by two washes with FACS buffer. Data were acquired using BD FACSDiva software (Version 5.0.1) on a BD LSR II flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software (Version 7.1.3.0, Tree Star Inc., Pasadena, TX). Lentiviral vectors were generated using the NHP/TYF lentiviral vector system as described previously (39Chang L.J. Liu X. He J.

IL-7Rα cDNA was cloned into the pTYF transducing vector behind the human EF1α promoter. Jak3 inhibitor V was purchased from Calbiochem. MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). RNA was harvested from cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a two-step avian myeloblastosis virus RT-PCR kit (GeneChoice, Frederick, MD). The following primers were used for PCR: GAPDH, 5′-CCG ATG GCA AAT TCG ATG GC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAT GAC CCT TTT GGC TCC CC-3′ (reverse); pre-Tα, 5′AGT ACA CAG CCC ATG CAT CTG TCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAT GCT CCA AGA CTG GAG GAA GGA-3′ (reverse); CD3ϵ, 5′-TGA AGC ATC ATC AGT AGT CAC AC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC CTC TGT CAA CAT TTA CC-3′ (reverse); and IL-7Rα, 5′-TCG CAG CAC TCA CTG ACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTC ATT GGC TCC TTC CCG-3′ (reverse). After 30 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s), PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel. Molt3 and Jurkat cells were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator dye Indo-1/AM (Molecular Probes) and stimulated with HIT3a (5 μg/ml), anti-mouse IgG (0.15 mg/ml), or ionomycin (1 μg/ml). A 1-ml volume of cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml was warmed to 37 °C and placed onto the BD LSR II flow cytometer. Base-line measurements were collected for 1 min, anti-CD3 antibody and anti-mouse IgG were added, and measurement was continued for an additional 5 min, followed by the addition of ionomycin and measurement for an additional 1–2 min. Stimulus-induced changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration were determined over time by monitoring the fluorescence emission ratio of the Ca2+-bound versus free form of Indo-1 at 405 and 495 nm, respectively; data were analyzed and plotted using FlowJo software. Antibodies for phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204; D13.14.4E and 137F5) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. For Western blot analysis, cells were collected at specific time points post-treatment and washed with cold PBS before being lysed in Blue loading buffer with DTT (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Protein was separated on a 10% gel and then transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked and probed with antibodies as indicated and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Bound proteins were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Statistical analysis was performed by applying the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test using GraphPad Prism 5 software. Key stages of human T cell development have been characterized as DN, CD3low DP, CD3hi TCRαβ+ DP, CD8 SP, or CD4 SP as shown at top of Fig. 1. Full-length transcripts of TCRβ and pre-Tα have been detected in the CD3low DP stage, and pre-TCR signaling drives progression to CD3hi DP and induces allelic exclusion at the TCRβ locus, followed by TCRα locus rearrangement (41Ramiro A.R. Trigueros C. Márquez C. San Millán J.L. Toribio M.L. Regulation of pre-T cell receptor (pTα-TCRβ) gene expression during human thymic development.J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have recently established that concomitant IL-7/IL-7Rα signaling and pre-TCR activation play a central role in promoting DN-to-DP transition as well as T cell maturation during human T cell development in vitro (73Patel E.S. Okada S. Hachey K. Yang L.-J. Durum S.K. Moreb J.S. Chang L.-J. Regulation of in vitro human T cell development through interleukin-7 deprivation and anti-CD3 stimulation.BMC Immunol. 2012; 13: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To investigate the direct effect of IL-7 on pre-TCR signaling, we examined several T-ALL cell lines, including Jurkat, SupT1, and Molt3. In mice, pre-TCR signaling is initiated at the DN3 stage in the absence of coreceptors. In humans, pre-TCR signaling is initiated at the CD4 immature SP and early DP stages of development. Molt3 resembles an early stage of DP T cells characterized by low CD3 and low CD4/CD8 coreceptor expression; SupT1 resembles a later stage of DP T cell development with high CD3 and coreceptor expression. As Molt3 has a rearranged TCRβ chain and is positive for intracellular TCRβ expression (42Burger R. Hansen-Hagge T.E. Drexler H.G. Gramatzki M.

Immunol. 1992; 88: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we further evaluated the intracellular and extracellular expression of CD3, pre-Tα, and IL-7Rα. RT-PCR analysis of RNA showed comparable levels of CD3 and pre-Tα but reduced IL-7Rα transcripts in Molt3 compared with SupT1 and Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A). Analysis of surface markers showed that Molt3 is CD4lowCD8low DP with low surface CD3 expression (Fig. 1B, upper panels), but intracellular staining revealed that cytoplasmic CD3 expression in Molt3 was similar to that in SupT1 and Jurkat cells (Fig. 1B, lower panels). Intracellular staining of IL-7Rα and pre-Tα showed comparable expression of IL-7Rα but higher pre-Tα in Molt3 compared with SupT1 and Jurkat cells (Fig. 1B). In addition, Molt3 showed CD7+CD1alow expression (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that Molt3 is arrested in the CD3low DP pre-T cell development stage, during which pre-TCR signaling occurs (44Plum J. De Smedt M. Leclercq G. Taghon T. Kerre T. Vandekerckhove B. Human intrathymic development: a selective approach.Semin. Immunopathol. 2008; 30: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it lacks surface IL-7Rα expression, a critical requirement for IL-7 signaling (45Jiang Q. Li W.Q. Aiello F.B. Mazzucchelli R. Asefa B. Khaled A.R. Durum S.K. Cell biology of IL-7, a key lymphotrophin.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 513-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 46Mazzucchelli R. Durum S.K.

IL-7 induces rapid clathrin-mediated internalization and JAK3-dependent degradation of IL-7Rα in T cells.Blood. 2010; 115: 3269-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SupT1 expresses high levels of CD3 and IL-7Rα and would be an ideal choice to study the effect of IL-7 on pre-TCR signaling. However, we found that SupT1 failed to respond to both IL-7 and anti-CD3 stimulation as assessed by the lack of STAT5 activation, lacked up-regulation of T cell activation markers CD25 and CD69, and did not show induction of calcium flux. Hence, we constructed a lentiviral vector encoding IL-7Rα and established an IL-7Rαhi Molt3 cell line. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed surface IL-7Rα expression in the lentiviral IL-7Rα-transduced Molt3 cell line (Fig. 2A, +LV IL-7Rα). IL-7 responsiveness was then assessed by the induction of STAT5 phosphorylation; the result illustrated that IL-7 induced STAT5 (Tyr-694) activation in IL-7Rαhi Molt3 but not in unmodified Molt3 (Fig. 2B). We further evaluated the response to anti-CD3 stimulation by the analysis of T cell activation markers CD25 and CD69 (48Biselli R. Matricardi P.M. D'Amelio R. Fattorossi A. Multiparametric flow cytometric analysis of the kinetics of surface molecule expression after polyclonal activation of human peripheral blood T lymphocytes.Scand. J. Immunol. 1992; 35: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Whereas anti-CD3 antibody activated CD25 and CD69 in Jurkat cells, both the unmodified and IL-7Rαhi Molt3 cell lines up-regulated CD25, but only induced low levels of CD69 in response to anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 2C). TCR stimulation directly corresponds to calcium flux, which can be measured by Indo-1/AM violet/blue ratio. Thus, we evaluated induction of calcium flux, and the results showed a low level of response to anti-CD3 stimulation of both unmodified and IL-7Rαhi Molt3 compared with control ionomycin treatment or anti-CD3 antibody-stimulated Jurkat cells (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the anti-CD3 signaling consequence differed between the early T cells (Molt3) and the mature T cells (Jurkat). To more precisely assess the effect of IL-7 on anti-CD3 antibody-mediated pre-TCR activation, we tested four conditions( no treatment, anti-CD3 Ab, anti-CD3 Ab plus IL-7, and IL-7) using IL-7Rαhi Molt3 cells (Fig. 3A). The results showed a consistent increase (n = 10, p = 0.002) in the expression of CD25 after anti-CD3 Ab plus IL-7 treatment (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, IL-7 alone also induced a slight increase in CD25 (p = 0.002) (Fig. 3, A and B). The intensity and duration of TCR stimulation directly correspond to calcium flux, which can be measured by Indo-1/AM violet/blue ratio over time. Evaluation of the effect of IL-7 on anti-CD3 antibody-induced calcium flux showed no change in both the intensity and duration of calcium flux (Fig. 3, C and D). Pre-TCR signaling drives DN-to-DP transition, but the signaling partners of the cytoplasmic tail of the human pre-TCR complex have not yet been identified (6von Boehmer H. Unique features of the pre-T cell receptor α-chain: not just a surrogate.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

To understand how IL-7 enhances pre-TCR signaling, we first examined the candidate pathways involved in pre-TCR signaling in IL-7Rαhi Molt3. For the PI3K pathway, we tested the inhibitor LY294002. Erk1/2 signaling pathway activation is important for DN-to-DP transition, so we tested the inhibitor U0126 (56Crompton T. Gilmour K.C. Owen M.J.

https://openalex.org/W1998889319,"Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with most cases of chronic pancreatitis, a progressive necrotizing inflammatory disease that can result in pancreatic insufficiency due to acinar atrophy and fibrosis and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. At a cellular level acute alcohol exposure can sensitize pancreatic acinar cells to secretagogue stimulation, resulting in dysregulation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and premature digestive enzyme activation; however, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol exerts these toxic effects have remained undefined. In this study we identify Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein as an essential mediator of ethanol-induced sensitization of cholecystokinin- and carbachol-regulated Ca(2+) signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. We show that exposure of rodent acinar cells to ethanol induces protein kinase C-dependent Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein phosphorylation, sensitization of cholecystokinin-stimulated Ca(2+) signaling, and potentiation of both basal and cholecystokinin-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Furthermore, we show that either suppression of Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein expression using short hairpin RNA or gene ablation prevented the sensitizing effects of ethanol on cholecystokinin- and carbachol-stimulated Ca(2+) signaling and intracellular chymotrypsin activation in pancreatic acinar cells, suggesting that the modulation of Raf-1 inhibitory protein expression may have future therapeutic utility in the prevention or treatment of alcohol-associated pancreatitis."
