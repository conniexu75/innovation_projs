It is possible that the agent, carried in the transplanted mammary tumor cells, may be responsible for the genetic mutations which have been detected in transplantable tumors. Preliminary results show that the agent can be recovered from the yolk sac of chick embryos 12 days after the injection into eggs of either tumor suspensions or cell-free filtrates of tissues containing the active agent."

The general plan of conducting the assay is discussed and several advantages of the use of the guide are noted. We wish to thank Mr. Albert G. Sterling, instrument maker, for fabricating the guide and the aluminum cylinders."

They thus appear to represent a state of matter totally unknown and possibly unattainable on earth."

That part of the standard of living which is based on large-scale consumption of energy is not likely to improve during this century. However, those who prefer optimism have reason for hope. Human ingenuity in solving problems is great. And native intelligence has been amplified enormously by the use of knowledge accumulated through research. An important product of research and a basis for hoping for a bright new future is the vitality of the electronics revolution, which promises to be of more enduring consequencethan the earlier industrial revolution."
