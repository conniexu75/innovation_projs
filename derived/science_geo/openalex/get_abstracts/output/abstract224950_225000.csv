There is little in the literature to indicate that such a reaction may play a part in liver metabolism, and it is the purpose of this short statement to indicate that this reaction may occupy a significant place in hepatic amino-acid metabolism. The literature will be reviewed in a more extensive publication in which full experimental details and results will be given."

https://openalex.org/W1971859432,"THE amount of thiocyanate has been determined in the blood of volunteers from Šumperk in Moravia and Roudnice in Bohemia, two districts in Czechoslovakia where the incidence of endemic goitre is high. In Šumperk, the investigations were carried out in both spring and autumn, but in Roudnice in the autumn only. The Roudnice district has a greater production and consumption of fruit and vegetables."

The morphology and physiology of the fungus have been investigated by Gogoi2 and its appearance in the wood-vessels described by Kovachich3."

https://openalex.org/W2082031707,"THE great usefulness and versatility of chromatography for qualitative separation of metals have been shown recently in a number of reports. So far, much less work appears to have been published on the quantitative possibilities of the method. Lacourt et al.1 have described the determination of aluminium, iron and titanium separated on paper strips using colorimetric procedures for the final estimation. Burstall and his colleagues2 have employed cellulose columns for the analysis of alloy steels; in the same paper the separation of gold from the metals of the platinum group is mentioned, and the possibility of other quantitative separations is foreshadowed. Using thick strips of filter paper, Anderson and Lederer3 have recently separated thallium quantitatively from other metals."
https://openalex.org/W2013910430,"SEVERAL recent publications1–4 have suggested that a rational basis for the quantitative analysis of the ideas (interference, coincidence, etc.) arising in the study of genetic recombination will be found in the use of a mapping metric, differing from ‘map distance’, in that interference phenomena shall now be uniform. Among the forms discussed by Owen, one of great elegance and comparative simplicity gives to intercept lengths of long chromosome arms the distribution of χ2/4 for four degrees of freedom."

https://openalex.org/W1972945291,"ALTHOUGH there is little doubt that the best method of detecting and estimating infestations of Heterodera rostochiensis is by examining samples of air-dried soil, it is sometimes necessary to obtain an estimate of the density of white cysts present on growing roots. Chitwood and Feldmesser1 describe a technique for this purpose using a ‘nematode index’, which is the number of white cysts which can be counted on a root in one minute. Although such a technique is interesting, we feel that when critical experiments are in progress it is unwise to confound true experimental effects with such personal factors as the varying rate at which different observers count. Moreover, it is important to be able to estimate the accuracy of any given technique so that the results can be analysed and significance-levels determined. The following method which we have used for obtaining a quantitative measure of numbers of cysts present on roots may, therefore, be of interest."

The accompanying table compares (a) the percentage abundance found for davidite, with (b) that given by Goldschmidt and Thomassen1 for some uranium–titanium–niobium–tantalum complex oxide minerals, and (c) xenotime. Also included in the table are Goldschmidt's values (d) for the average terrestrial abundance of the lanthanons, this abundance differing from that found for monazite mainly in exhibiting a slightly smaller proportion of the lighter (cerium group) lanthanons."

Rodhain2 successfully infected the cotton rat with the parasite. Adler, Yoeli and Zuckerman3 found that the golden hamster and the field vole were susceptible to P. berghei infections."

https://openalex.org/W2068850356,"AN unidentified strain of ‘pink yeast’ (probably a species of Rhodotorula) isolated from brewer's finings grows well in a defined glucose – salts – ammonia medium in the absence of vitamins of the B complex, with the exception of aneurin. Up to 24 hr., the response to added aneurin is poor, this period presumably being that required for the phosphorylation of aneurin to its pyrophosphate; afterwards the response is marked, whereas controls containing no aneurin grow up poorly, even after 72 hr. of incubation."

https://openalex.org/W1973730048,"IN a recent article on the evolution of vertebrates, D. M. S. Watson1 takes into consideration a number of anatomical features of recent and fossil animals, showing that the overwhelming majority of them can be easily understood as the results of functional adaptations. Watson underlines, however, the importance of a major evolutionary trend in lower vertebrates, consisting in the gradual loss of cartilage bone in the skeleton and the growing importance of the membrane bones. This trend can be followed in many groups of fishes and amphibians. It is difficult, however, to find for it an adaptive significance. Watson writes (p. 58): “I have been able to find no advantage that an animal can obtain by a reduction in the amount of cartilage bone”, and further: “these basal changes … are not of such a character that it is at present possible to explain their occurrence as an adaptation and hence their appearance as a result of natural selection”."

https://openalex.org/W2027515559,"BOTH methyl radicals and hydrogen atoms have been proposed as chain-carriers in the photo-chlorination of methane1,3; and, although the former are generally favoured, in neither case has direct evidence been produced4. However, the theoretical heat content change of the corresponding partial reaction would be approximately zero, if methyl radicals were involved, but endothermic by 21 kcal./mole, on the basis of hydrogen atom formation."
