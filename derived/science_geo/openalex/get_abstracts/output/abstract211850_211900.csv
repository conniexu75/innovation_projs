https://openalex.org/W2104957635,"We found that in another facultative anaerobe, Escherichia coli,’ the levels of these two activities also varied in a nonparallel manner when aerobically and anaerobically grown cells were compared. To determine unequivocally whether two distinct enzymes were produced for these reactions, we sought to dissociate the enzymes by eliminating one through mutation. Since these activities are particle-bound in E. coli (lo), this approach circumvents the difficulties and possible artifacts of solubilizing for fractionation. It also permits one to determine definitively the physiological role of an enzyme, since one can observe the effect in viva that results from its loss. The desired mutant was obtained, making possible the separation and characterization of two succinate-oxidizing and fumarate-reducing enzymes in E. coli."

These disadvantages have been tolerated since use of sections not exceeding 50µ is necessary to ensure even penetration of incubation media1,2, and no alternative sectioning method has been available."

While the phenomena were observed earlier by Kuo1 in human beings and in dogs by Stutman2 and Cain3, the observations have not been extremely pursued nor has the mechanism of such a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation been fully explained."

A review of the available evidence led Manchester and Young2 to the conclusion that the action of insulin on accumulation of amino-acid by the diaphragm of the rat is probably limited to non-utilizable amino-acids and that it may represent an effect secondary to a direct stimulation of protein synthesis. In their view, AIB accumulation “can be regarded as filling the gap left by amino-acids used up in the synthesis of extra protein which occurs in the presence of insulin”. The more recent observation3 that insulin increases the transport of a number of naturally occurring amino-acids into muscle cells prompted us to re-examine the possibility that the effect of insulin on AIB accumulation may be a direct action of the hormone on an amino-acid transport system."

https://openalex.org/W2086299426,"RECENT investigations have demonstrated a wide range of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) base compositions which correlate well with other taronomic criteria in both bacteria1–4 and protozoa5,6. The available data for metazoans are less extensive4,7. However, a considerable variation in DNA base composi ions is found among the porifera8, and the published analyses for three species of molluscs4,9 indicate the probability of a range of compositions in that phylum. This communication describes work on several other species of molluscs. DNA was isolated from sperm on testes using a modification10 of Marmur's procedure11. Base compositions were estimated from density gradient centrifugation studies13 and from thermal denaturation temperatures12. The results are recorded in Table 1."

Bendall and Wismer-Pedersen3 presented evidence that these bands consisted of denatured sarcoplasmic protein. The denatured proteins appeared to be precipitated on to the myofibrils under the conditions of relatively low pH and high temperature, which obtain during post-mortem glycolysis in this disorder. It has recently been shown, using starch-gel electrophoresis, that various glycolytic enzymes, including creatine kinase, are among the sarcoplasmic proteins which precipitate in exudative pork4. These proteins remain soluble if the temperature during post-mortem glycolysis is relatively low or, irrespective of temperatures up to 37° C, if the ultimate pH is high."

https://openalex.org/W2067775695,"ISOVALTHINE is a new sulphur-containing amino-acid which is isolated from the urine of hypercholesterolaemic patients1,2. A molecular model of isovalthine suggests a possibility of forming a thiamorpholinone derivative by the intramolecular cyclization. Such thiamorpholinone derivative may also be produced in the animal body and have some biological effects. From these considerations, 2-isopropylthiamorpholin-3-one-5-carboxylic acid was prepared from L-isovalthine and its biological effect was examined."
