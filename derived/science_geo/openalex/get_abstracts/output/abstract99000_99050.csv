https://openalex.org/W2065413461,"Mice homozygous for lpr (lymphoproliferation) or gld (generalized lymphoproliferative disease) develop lymphadenopathy and suffer from autoimmune disease. The lpr mice have a mutation in a cell-surface protein, Fas, that mediates apoptosis. Fas ligand (FasL) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related type II membrane protein and binds to Fas. Here, mouse Fasl gene was isolated and localized to the gld region of mouse chromosome 1. Activated splenocytes from gld mice express Fasl mRNA. However, FasL in gld mice carries a point mutation in the C-terminal region, which is highly conserved among members of the TNF family. The recombinant gld FasL expressed in COS cells could not induce apoptosis in cells expressing Fas. These results indicate that lpr and gld are mutations in Fas and Fasl, respectively, and suggest important roles of the Fas system in development of T cells as well as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1975336660,"Fas is an apoptosis-signaling receptor molecule on the surface of a number of cell types. Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a human Fas messenger RNA variant capable of encoding a soluble Fas molecule lacking the transmembrane domain because of the deletion of an exon encoding this region. The expression of soluble Fas was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunocytochemical analysis. Supernatants from cells transfected with the variant messenger RNA blocked apoptosis induced by the antibody to Fas. Levels of soluble Fas were elevated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and mice injected with soluble Fas displayed autoimmune features."

https://openalex.org/W1592758533,"Addition of 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates in Swiss 3T3 cells including bands of M(r) 110,000-130,000 and M(r) 70,000-80,000. An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the M(r) 110,000-130,000 cluster of bands was detected as soon as 30 s after LPA stimulation reaching a maximum within 1 min. LPA stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of all bands in a concentration-dependent fashion; a half-maximal effect occurred at 30 nM. Immunoprecipitation of lysates of LPA-treated cells with monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK), paxillin, and p130 revealed that these proteins are prominent substrates for LPA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by prolonged pretreatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, selective inhibition of PKC by GF109203X, or depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool by thapsigargin had no effect on LPA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, protein tyrosine phosphorylation by LPA is largely independent of either the PKC or Ca2+ pathways. In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with cytochalasin D, which selectively disrupts the network of the actin filaments, completely inhibited LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK induced by LPA was completely prevented when cells were stimulated in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor at a concentration (30 ng/ml) that causes disruption of actin stress fibers. This suggests that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and reveals a novel cross-talk between LPA and platelet-derived growth factor on p125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1564170528,"Abstract Ribonuclease E has a central role in Escherichia coli mRNA decay and is dependent on a functional product of the rne (also called ams or hmp1) gene. We investigated the requirements for RNase E cleavage by introducing random mutations into the decanucleotide region at the 5' end of pACYC184 RNA I and studying the effects of these mutations on the position of rne-dependent cleavage in vivo and RNase E-mediated cutting in vitro. We find that the precise point of RNase E cleavage can be altered specifically and reproducibly by sequence changes in the region cleaved and, therefore, is not determined by a distance measured in nucleotides from any other sequence or region of secondary structure in RNA I. Although cleavage by RNase E occurs within sequences rich in A and/or U nucleotides and is affected by the extent of continuity of A and U nucleotides in the regions cleaved, there is no simple relationship between the order of nucleotides and the phosphodiester bond cleaved. Thus, our results are not consistent with either the notion that RNase E cleavages are determined by a simple consensus sequence or the contrary view that RNase E has few primary structural constraints other than a preference for cleaving 5' to an AU dinucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W2076584494,"The crystal structure of a complex between a 24-amino acid peptide from the third variable (V3) loop of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) gp 120 and the Fab fragment of a broadly neutralizing antibody (59.1) was determined to 3 angstrom resolution. The tip of the V3 loop containing the Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg-Ala-Phe sequence adopts a double-turn conformation, which may be the basis of its conservation in many HIV-1 isolates. A complete map of the HIV-1 principal neutralizing determinant was constructed by stitching together structures of V3 loop peptides bound to 59.1 and to an isolate-specific (MN) neutralizing antibody (50.1). Structural conservation of the overlapping epitopes suggests that this biologically relevant conformation could be of use in the design of synthetic vaccines and drugs to inhibit HIV-1 entry and virus-related cellular fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1519310145,"T lymphocytes contain both Grb2, an SH2 and SH3 domain containing adaptor protein, and Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras. Immunoprecipitates of Sos from the lysates of T cells contain a 36-kDa protein which is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to T cell receptor/CD3 cross-linking. In vitro studies using different bacterially synthesized GST-Sos fusion proteins confirm the formation of complexes containing p36 and the proline-rich COOH-terminal domain of Sos. The use of mutant GST-Grb2 proteins in which both SH3 domains have been mutationally inactivated shows that Grb2 binds to tyrosine phosphorylated p36 via its SH2 domain. In Jurkat cells phosphorylated p36 is localized exclusively in the particulate fraction. In addition, another SH2 domain-containing protein, p52Shc is tyrosine phosphorylated upon TCR.CD3 cross-linking and associates with a 150-kDa phosphotyrosine containing protein. Taken together these data suggest that activation of Ras in T cells via the TCR.CD3 complex might be controlled, at least in part, by mechanisms similar to those found in fibroblasts, involving in this case formation of a complex of Grb2, Sos, and a membrane-bound tyrosine phosphoprotein of molecular mass 36-kDa."
https://openalex.org/W2154111468,"Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), fused to diphtheria toxin and translocated into cells, stimulated DNA synthesis in toxin-resistant cells lacking functional aFGF receptors while having a high number of diphtheria toxin receptors. In NIH 3T3 cells that lack diphtheria toxin receptors, but have receptors for aFGF, both aFGF and the fusion protein induced tyrosine phosphorylation, but only aFGF as such entered the nuclei and stimulated DNA synthesis. The results indicate that signaling occurs partly through cell surface receptors and partly by transport of the growth factor into the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2106059813,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a stromally derived member of the fibroblast growth factor family (FGF7) with potent mitogenic activity on a variety of epithelial cells. To identify molecules that regulate the expression of this paracrine mediator of epithelial proliferation, we investigated the effects of various cytokines and growth factors on KGF production by fibroblasts. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 (IL1) strongly induced the expression of KGF RNA in fibroblasts from multiple sources. Platelet-derived growth factor BB, IL6, and transforming growth factor alpha caused a moderate elevation, while tumor necrosis factor alpha and basic FGF did not alter the level of KGF RNA expression. The induction by IL1 of KGF transcript levels was time and dose dependent and specifically blocked by anti-IL1 antibodies. Nuclear run on experiments indicated that IL1 stimulated KGF gene transcription. Western blot analysis and keratinocyte proliferation assays demonstrated a corresponding increase in mitogenically active KGF protein in conditioned medium obtained from IL1-treated fibroblasts. The stimulation of KGF expression by IL1 and other cytokines such as IL6, transforming growth factor alpha, and platelet-derived growth factor may provide a mechanism for KGF induction during inflammation that would support its proposed role as mediator of reepithelialization and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1587239119,"Phosphorylation of purified Na+,K(+)-ATPase by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) decreases the activity of this enzyme. We have now shown, using several experimental approaches, that a highly conserved seryl residue on the catalytic (alpha) subunit of Na+,K(+)-ATPase, corresponding to Ser943 of the rat alpha 1 isoform, is the phosphorylation site for protein kinase A. cDNAs corresponding to wild-type Na+,K(+)-ATPase and Na+,K(+)-ATPase in which Ser943 was mutated to Ala were transfected into COS cells. Treatment of the transfected cells with forskolin plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine resulted in a decrease in the activity of the wild-type enzyme but not in that of the mutated enzyme. The results suggest that, in intact cells, the activity of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase is regulated in part by signal transduction pathways that use protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W3119074784,"Integrin alpha 2 beta 1 is a cell surface adhesion receptor for collagen and echovirus 1. Here we localized the epitopes for anti-alpha 2 monoclonal antibodies using interspecies (human/bovine) alpha 2 chimeras with different lengths of human alpha 2 sequence on the amino-terminal side and site-directed mutagenesis. The antibodies that block the collagen and/or echovirus 1 binding to human alpha 2 beta 1 (6F1, RMAC11, 12F1, and AA10) recognizes a small region (residues 173-259) within the I domain. Asp-160 and Arg-242 are critical for binding of the two other function-inhibiting antibodies, P1H5 and 5E8, respectively. Notably, mutations of Asp-151 and Asp-254 block the binding of alpha 2 beta 1 to collagen. These data suggest that the I domain (residues 140-359) is critically involved in the ligand/receptor interactions, and collagen and echovirus 1 binding sites are adjacent or overlapping within the I domain. The sequence of the residues 173-259 of alpha 2 overlap with the peptide sequences (M11 and M20) that derive from von Willebrand factor A1 and A3 domains (homologous to the alpha 2 I domain) and block von Willebrand factor/collagen interaction, suggesting that the epitope region of alpha 2 (residues 173-259) may really be involved in ligand recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1573683888,"FK506, an immunosuppressant, inhibits the production of several cytokines in T lymphocytes. We observed that FK506 suppressed the transcription of a chemotactic cytokine, interleukin-8 (IL-8) in a human T cell line, Jurkat cells, activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and calcium (Ca2+) ionophore (ionomycin). By deleted and mutated analysis of the IL-8 promoters, the AP-1 and kappa B-like sites were identified as the responsive elements for PMA and ionomycin. FK506 suppressed the transcriptions through the AP-1 or kappa B-like sites induced by PMA plus Ca(2+)-mobilizing agents, but not those induced by Ca(2+)-independent stimuli. In gel retardation analysis, FK506 had little effect on the binding to the AP-1 site of PMA/ionomycin-induced nuclear factors, which were recognized with anti-JunD or c-Fos antibody. In contrast, FK506 or EGTA (Ca2+ chelator) similarly affected the formation of kappa B-like site binding complexes, which were not recognized by any antibodies against the human Rel family proteins (c-Rel, p65, p50, and p49). Furthermore, we confirmed the previous report that FK506 suppressed the PMA/ionomycin-induced activation through authentic kappa B site of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene, to which NF-kappa B binding was also decreased by FK506, indicating that both IL-8 kappa B-like site and Ig kappa B site are FK506-sensitive in spite of the difference of binding factors. Our results indicate that not only the reported IL-2 NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites and Ig kappa B site, but also the IL-8 AP-1 and kappa B-like sites are terminals of FK506-sensitive pathway involving Ca2+ mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1659382355,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is tightly regulated in the cell and is phosphorylated at multiple sites by several different protein kinases. We have investigated the phosphorylation of p53 by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, a protein kinase that plays a central role in mediating many mitogenic and differentiation signals. Recombinant wild-type mouse p53 was phosphorylated in vitro by activated recombinant p42-MAP kinase but not by inactive MAP kinase or by the activating protein, MAP kinase kinase. Phosphorylation of p53 by MAP kinase occurred at two N-terminal sites, threonine residues 73 and 83. Tryptic phosphopeptides of recombinant p53 phosphorylated in vitro by MAP kinase comigrated on two-dimensional maps with p53 from SV3T3 cells labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate, suggesting that MAP kinase targets a site in p53 that is phosphorylated in the cell. Following serum stimulation of quiescent C57MG cells, two p53 kinases, which were resolved by chromatography on Mono Q, were stimulated 15-20-fold within 5 min. Each of these kinase activities co-eluted with myelin basic protein kinase activity and could be inactivated following treatment with protein phosphatase 2A, a serine/threonine phosphatase, or leukocyte antigen receptor, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, suggesting that these activities were members of the MAP kinase family. The two kinase activities from the lysates targeted the same phosphorylation sites on p53 as the purified recombinant MAP kinase. These protein kinase activities were also stimulated following exposure of the cells to ultraviolet radiation, but with slightly delayed kinetics. Phorbol ester treatment of SV3T3 cells led to increased phosphorylation of the peptide containing the residues targeted by MAP kinase. The data suggest that p53 may be phosphorylated by MAP kinase physiologically and that this interaction may be involved in the cell's response to UV exposure, growth factor stimulation, or transformation by oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1602793726,"Nitric oxide synthase produces NO, citrulline, water, and NADP at the expense of arginine, NADPH, and dioxygen. While citrulline has been considered to be an inert by-product of the high output inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS), we show here that immunostimulants induce a metabolic pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells, which enables them to regenerate arginine from citrulline. Regeneration of arginine from citrulline is accomplished by two urea cycle enzymes: arginino-succinate synthetase (AS) and argininosuccinate lyase (AL). Whereas AL is constitutive to vascular smooth muscle cells, AS mRNA and enzyme activity is markedly induced in cells by treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The induction of AS mRNA and activity by LPS follows a time course which mirrors that for iNOS but lags 1-2 h behind. As shown for iNOS, interferon-gamma does not itself induce AS but is synergistic with LPS. AS induction is suppressed by glucocorticoids, actinomycin D, and, to a lesser extent, cycloheximide. On the other hand, AS induction is unaffected by an excess of citrulline or the inhibitor of iNOS, N omega-methyl-L-arginine. Our results show the urea cycle enzymes AS and AL confer cells with the capacity to produce NO without a need for exogenous arginine. In conjunction with NOS, citric acid cycle enzymes that covert fumarate to oxaloacetate (fumarase and malate dehydrogenase) and oxaloacetate to aspartate (aspartate transaminase), AS and AL form a novel arginine-citrulline cycle that enables high output NO production by cells."
https://openalex.org/W1576886106,"We analyzed the function of Trk nerve growth factor (NGF) receptors containing a point mutation (Tyr-->Phe) in a major autophosphorylation site (Tyr-785). Tyr-785 is required for phospholipase C-gamma 1 to interact with Trk and to become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to NGF. The altered receptors were transfected into a mutant subline of PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells (designated PC12nnr5) that, unlike wild-type PC12 cells, lack expression of endogenous Trk and responsiveness to NGF. PC12nnr5 cells permanently transfected with Trk Y785F exhibit NGF-dependent autophosphorylation and normal NGF binding and internalization. Moreover, Trk Y785F mediates NGF-stimulated neurite outgrowth as well as a variety of additional responses including induction of immediate-early and late genes. However, in contrast to cells expressing wild-type Trk, cells expressing Trk Y785F lack NGF-promoted elevation of peripherin intermediate filament mRNA and protein. These observations indicate that phospholipase C-gamma 1 activation or other signaling pathways dependent on Tyr-785 autophosphorylation are selectively required for regulation of peripherin expression by NGF, but not for many other functional NGF responses. This supports the presence of multiple and separable signaling pathways in the NGF mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W1606759639,"We have isolated cDNA clones that encode the human and murine forms of a novel receptor-type tyrosine kinase termed Rse. Sequence analysis indicates that human Rse contains 890 amino acids, with an extracellular region composed of two immunoglobulin-like domains followed by two fibronectin type III domains. Murine Rse contains 880 amino acids and shares 90% amino acid identity with its human counterpart. Rse is structurally similar to the receptor-type tyrosine kinase Axl/Ufo, and the two proteins have 35 and 63% sequence identity in their extracellular and intracellular domains, respectively. To study the synthesis and activation of this putative receptor-type tyrosine kinase, we constructed a version of Rse (termed gD-Rse, where gD represents glycoprotein D) that contains an NH2-terminal epitope tag. NIH3T3 cells were engineered to express gD-Rse, which could be detected at the cell surface by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Moreover, gD-Rse was rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon incubation of the cells with an antibody directed against the epitope tag, suggesting that rse encodes an active tyrosine kinase. In the human tissues we examined, the highest level of expression of rse mRNA was observed in the brain; rse mRNA was also detected in the premegakaryocytopoietic cell lines CMK11-5 and Dami. The gene for rse was localized to human chromosome 15."
https://openalex.org/W2025035706,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) CI− channel consists of two motifs (each containing a membrane-spanning domain [MSD] and a nucleotide-binding domain [NBD]) linked by an R domain. We tested the hypothesis that one MSD-NBD motif could form a CI− channel. The amino-terminal portion of CFTR (D836X, which contains MSD1, NBD1, and the R domain) formed CI− channels with conductive properties identical to those of CFTR. However, channel regulation differed. Although phosphorylation increased activity, channels opened without phosphorylation. MgATP stimulated D836X more potently than CFTR and may Interact at more than one site. These data and migration of D836X on sucrose density gradients suggest that D836X may function as a multimer. Thus, the amino-terminal portion of CFTR contains all of the structures required to build a regulated CI− channel."
https://openalex.org/W1570147840,"RNase E, an endoribonuclease encoded by the Escherichia coli ams/rne/hmp1 locus, cleaves RNA I, an antisense regulator of the replication of ColE1 type plasmids, in a single-stranded region near its 5' end. The rne-3071 mutation prolongs the RNA 1 half-life in cells cultured at an elevated temperature and imparts temperature sensitivity on RNase E isolated from the mutant strain. Here we report the effects of specific sequence changes introduced by site-directed mutagenesis on the location of ribonucleolytic cleavage near the 5' end of pBR322 RNA I in rne-3071 and congenic rne+ E. coli and on cleavage of RNA I by RNase E in vitro. Primer extension analyses showed that the occurrence and position of cleavages in vivo and in vitro are altered highly specifically by sequence changes but that the site of cleavage bears no simple relationship to a particular nucleotide order. Our results do not support either the notion that cleavage by RNase E is determined by a consensus sequence or the contrary view that RNase E is a virtually nonspecific single-stranded endonuclease with a preference for cutting 5' to an AU dinucleotide."

https://openalex.org/W1542936802,"CHIP28 is a major water transporting protein in erythrocytes and kidney which forms tetramers in membranes (Verbavatz, J. M., Brown, D., Sabolic, I., Valenti, G., Ausiello, D. A., Van Hoek, A. N., Ma, T., and Verkman, A. S. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 123, 605-618). To determine whether CHIP28 monomers function independently, chimeric cDNA dimers were constructed which contained wild-type CHIP28 in series with either wild-type CHIP28, a non-water transporting CHIP28 mutant (C189W), or a functional but mercurial-insensitive CHIP28 mutant (C189S). Transcribed cRNAs were injected in Xenopus oocytes and plasma membrane expression was assayed by quantitative immunofluorescence. Water channel function was measured by osmotically induced swelling. CHIP28 homo- and heterodimers were targeted to the oocyte plasma membrane and functioned as water channels. Relative osmotic water permeability (Pf) values (normalized for plasma membrane expression of monomeric subunits) were: 1.0 (CHIP28 monomer), 0.0 (C189W), 1.07 (C189S), 1.10 (CHIP28-CHIP28 dimer) and 0.52 (CHIP28-C189W). The increase in oocyte Pf was linearly related to plasma membrane expression of wild-type CHIP28 and C189S subunits. HgCl2 (0.3 mM) inhibited channel-mediated Pf in oocytes expressing wild-type CHIP28 monomers and dimers by 85-90%, but did not inhibit Pf in oocytes expressing C189S. HgCl2 inhibited Pf in oocytes expressing CHIP28-C189S dimers by 44 +/- 7%, consistent with one mercurial-sensitive and one insensitive subunit in the heterodimer. These results indicate that despite their assembly in tetramers, monomeric CHIP28 subunits function independently as water channels."
https://openalex.org/W1573294964,"The phosphorylation of the Hsp27 complex is rapidly altered in MRC-5 cells when they are exposed to mitogens, cytokines, stress, or serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitors. Here we performed experiments to identify which cellular protein phosphatase (PP1, PP2A, or PP2B) is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Hsp27. In their purified forms, PP2A dephosphorylates Hsp27 more effectively than PP2B, whereas PP1 is weakly active. Measurements of enzyme activity of lysates derived from inhibitor-treated cells indicated that Hsp27 phosphatase activity is equally sensitive to okadaic acid (PPI/PP2A inhibitor) and cyclosporin (PP2B inhibitor) and that both okadaic acid and cyclosporin treatment inhibited Hsp27 phosphatase activity additively. Together the in vitro data suggest that both PP2A and PP2B can dephosphorylate Hsp27. However, the phosphorylation of Hsp27 in vivo is only affected when cells are treated with PP1 and PP2A inhibitors (okadaic acid, calyculin A) or cantharidin (PP2A inhibitor), but not the PP2B inhibitor, cyclosporin A, suggesting PP2A to be the main enzyme dephosphorylating Hsp27 in the cells. Purification and immunoblotting of Hsp27 phosphatase from MRC-5 cells also suggest it to be PP2A and not PP1 or PP2B. The ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate Hsp27 is shown to be regulated by the phosphorylation state of PP2A itself."
https://openalex.org/W1589445078,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor attachment is directed by a COOH-terminal signal that is proteolytically removed and replaced with a preformed GPI anchor in a coupled reaction. Failure to complete proteolytic cleavage and anchor addition results in the retention of an uncleaved precursor in a post-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment. In this report, we address three issues: (i) the exact position of the transport block, (ii) the subsequent fate of the retained molecules, i.e. where are they degraded, and (iii) the mechanism whereby these proteins are selected for retention. Using decay accelerating factor (DAF), we provide evidence that failure to cleave the GPI signal totally prevents O-glycosylation, suggesting that the uncleaved polypeptides are not transported into the cis-Golgi complex. This implies that transport is blocked at the boundary between the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi stacks. The degradation of an intracellularly retained human growth hormone (hGH)-DAF fusion protein containing a nonfunctional GPI signal shows some features of ER degradation, i.e. the degradation is insensitive to leupeptin, chloroquine, and ammonium chloride, and is inhibited at 16 degrees C or after ATP depletion. However, morphological evidence points to a pathway resembling autophagy. To reconcile these observations, we suggest either that hGHDAF is degraded by two distinct pathways (ER degradation and autophagy) or that ER degradation takes place in an ER-associated vesicular compartment in a process resembling autophagy. Using as probes a soluble hGH receptor and an antibody recognizing only native hGH, we show that a significant fraction of the retained protein is correctly folded, ruling out general misfolding as the basis for retention. We also show that hGHDAF fusion proteins are present in high molecular weight, disulfide-linked aggregates in COS cells. We suggest a model for retention in which the uncleaved GPI signal drives the formation of large micelle-like aggregates that cannot be secreted."
https://openalex.org/W1535348459,"Abstract Resting human blood monocytes from some donors were found to produce a small amount of 3'-5' guanine cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) in response to interleukin 4 (IL-4). A much higher response was observed when monocytes were preincubated with interferon (IFN-gamma), which alone was ineffective. Preincubation of monocytes with IL-4 led, in contrast, to their subsequent incapacity to generate cGMP in response to IL-4. The accumulation of cGMP induced by IL-4 in IFN-gamma preincubated monocytes was dose-dependent and peaked about 15 min after its addition. It was inhibited in the presence of NG-mono-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthase pathway. This suppressive effect of L-NMMA was reverted by an excess of L- but not of D-arginine. Accumulation of cGMP was significantly reduced by addition of soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitors, such as LY83583 [correction of LY83853] and methylene blue, but was not impaired in the presence of EGTA, suggesting that the pathway involved is calcium independent. In addition, IL-4 induced an increased secretion of nitrite by monocytes, that was potentiated by IFN-gamma and inhibited by L-NMMA. Taken together, these results suggest that the sequential exposure of monocytes to IFN-gamma and IL-4 elicits the release of NO from L-arginine, which in turn is capable to stimulate soluble guanylyl cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1480011331,"Thrombin stimulation of the T leukemic cell line Jurkat induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Proteolytic activity of the enzyme was required for this effect since diisopropyl fluorophosphate-thrombin failed to increase [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, hirudin and anti-thrombin III inhibited the thrombin-induced [Ca2+]i rise in Jurkat T cells. A synthetic thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRP) of 7 residues (SFLLRNP) was found to be as effective as thrombin for [Ca2+]i mobilization, and both agonists induced Ca2+ release exclusively from internal stores. Thrombin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of molecular mass 40, 42, 70, 120, and 130 kDa. There was a good correlation between thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the latter three proteins and Ca2+ mobilization. Thrombin and TRP also caused translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. As a likely consequence of these events, thrombin activated the nuclear factor NF-kB. Several cell lines of hematopoietic origin including the leukemic T cell line HPB.ALL and the erythroleukemic cell line K562 were responsive to thrombin, whereas others such as THP1, a myelomonocytic cell line, and BL2, a Burkitt lymphoma were refractory to thrombin or TRP stimulation. The magnitude of the thrombin response in the different cell types paralleled the expression of the thrombin receptor mRNA. We found that activation of Jurkat T cells by a combination of phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate led to a dramatic inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression and to a concomitant loss of the thrombin response. Finally, we demonstrate that thrombin and TRP enhanced CD69 expression and interleukin 2 production induced by T cell receptor cross-linking in both Jurkat T cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. These findings highlight the role of thrombin as a potential regulator of T lymphocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W1561260527,"The intracellular COOH-terminal domain of the glycoprotein, P0, has been proposed to be involved in the formation of the major dense line of peripheral myelin. We have addressed this hypothesis by generating and subsequently isolating a peptide fragment that contains 65 of the 69 residues of the cytoplasmic region of rat P0. This peptide, termed P0(intra), bound to artificial phospholipid vesicles and caused their rapid aggregation. The peptide-induced aggregation of membrane bilayers appeared to result from ionic interactions, since P0(intra) vesicle association was decreased by 1) reducing the phosphatidylserine content of the membranes, 2) increasing the NaCl concentration of the surrounding buffer, or 3) elevating the divalent cation concentration within the buffers. Cationic disc gel electrophoresis of P0(intra) revealed at least four charge isoforms of the peptide. Treatment of sciatic nerve slices with phorbol ester prior to isolation of P0(intra) increased the amount of the more negatively charged species, suggesting that at least some of the charge heterogeneity of the peptide can be attributed to differing phosphorylation states. The ability of P0(intra) to bind to phospholipid bilayers implies that the cytoplasmic domain of P0 may be responsible for the formation and maintenance of the myelin major dense line."
https://openalex.org/W1563954981,"CD44 species of widely differing molecular mass have been identified on various normal and/or transformed cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that much of this heterogeneity is produced as a result of the alternative splicing of a series of 10 exons present within the CD44 gene generating a large number of CD44 isoforms containing additional peptide sequences of varying length inserted into a single site within the extracellular domain of the molecule. At present, the effect of such insertions on the ligand binding specificity of CD44 remains unclear. CD44H, the major CD44 isoform expressed by most resting cell types, has been shown to function as a receptor for the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan. In contrast, CD44E, the major isoform expressed by the colon carcinoma cell line HT29, which contains a 132-amino acid insert, is unable to recognize and bind this ligand. In the present study we demonstrate that CD44R1, an isoform isolated from the myelomonocytic cell line KG1a, that differs from CD44E by just 3 amino acid substitutions, is fully capable of mediating the attachment of transfected COS7 cells to hyaluronan-coated plastic. In order to confirm that such binding was directly mediated by the introduced CD44 species, chimeric proteins containing the entire extracellular domain of CD44H or CD44R1 fused in-frame to human bone/liver/kidney alkaline phosphatase were prepared and tested for their ability to bind hyaluronan-coated plastic. Both fusion proteins bound equally well to hyaluronan and in each case their attachment could be readily inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against the hyaluronan-binding domain of CD44. These data indicate that the 132-amino acid insert present within the extracellular domain of CD44R1 does not interfere with the hyaluronan binding function of the molecule. Since CD44E contains an identically sized insert but is unable to bind hyaluronan, it is likely that mutation of one or more of the 3 amino acid residues that differ between CD44E and CD44R1 is responsible for the altered functional activity of this particular molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1527086839,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an autosomal dominant myopathy. Molecular genetic studies have shown that the alteration of Arg615 to Cys in the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor) is cosegregated with porcine MH (Fujii, J., Otsu, K., Zorzato, F., de Leon, S., Khanna, V. K., Weiler, J. E., O'Brien, P. J., and MacLennan, D. H. (1991) Science 253, 448-451; Otsu, K., Khanna, V. K., Archibald, A., and MacLennan, D. H. (1991) Genomics 11, 744-750). Here, using the fluorescence calcium indicator indo-1, we determined the concentration of ionized cytosolic calcium in myoblastic cells transfected with either the wild-type or mutated ryanodine receptor cDNA. The cells expressing the mutant ryanodine receptor showed higher sensitivity to caffeine, which induces Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor. Exposure to clinical doses of halothane resulted in a rapid increase of [Ca2+]i in cells expressing the mutated ryanodine receptor, whereas no [Ca2+] changes were observed in cells expressing the wild-type ryanodine receptor. These results provide definite evidence that a single amino acid mutation, Arg615-->Cys, in the ryanodine receptor is causative of MH."
https://openalex.org/W1488607169,"BTF2/TFIIH from human, delta from rat, and factor b from yeast are multisubunit basal transcription factors that have been shown to be closely associated with a protein kinase capable of phosphorylating the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Lu, H., Zawel, L., Fischer, L., Egly, J. M., and Reinberg, D. (1992) Nature 358, 641-645; Serizawa, H., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 7476-7480; Feaver, W. J., Gileadi, O., and Kornberg, R. D.

We report here that a DNA-dependent ATPase and the previously characterized helicase (Schaeffer, L., Roy, R., Humbert, S., Moncollin, V., Vermeulen, W., Hoeijmakers, J., Chambon, P., and Egly, J. M. (1993) Science 260, 58-63) are both associated with BTF2 and reside with the p89 polypeptide subunit. The DNA requirement, the effect of Sarkosyl and staurosporine inhibitors, as well as nucleotide competition experiments, clearly distinguished ATPase/helicase from the carboxyl-terminal domain kinase. Using recombinant wild type or mutated p89/ERCC3 polypeptides and different forms of DNA template, we show the connection between ATPase and the helicase."
https://openalex.org/W1491234920,"Antibodies to pp60v-arc and phosphotyrosine were introduced into rabbit platelets using an electropermeabilization technique. The presence of these antibodies inside platelets was detected by flow cytometry. Platelet-activating factor (PAF)-stimulated phospholipase C activity (inositol phosphate production) and aggregation were dramatically inhibited in platelets transjected with either of these antibodies. Incubation of these antibodies with intact cells (i.e. nonpermeabilized) or electrotransjection of several nonspecific antibodies/agents (e.g. goat anti-mouse IgG, mouse serum, human platelet glycoprotein Ib monoclonal antibody, and fetal calf serum) into platelets had no effect on the PAF responses. trpE (another isotype-matched control antibody of pp60v-src) and pp56lck polyclonal antibody (another src-related kinase not present in platelets) also had no effect on PAF-induced aggregation and inositol phosphate production in permeabilized platelets. This indicates that the effect of internalized pp60v-src antibody is direct and specific in platelets. Stimulation of platelets by PAF increased the association and phosphorylation of both pp60c-src (60 kDa) and phospholipase C gamma 1 (145 kDa). This study provides the first evidence in platelets for a direct and specific involvement of pp60c-src in PAF-mediated phospholipase C activation and aggregation response."
https://openalex.org/W1538880248,"To characterize the effects of the cellular events associated with contraction on atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) secretion, primary neonatal rat atrial myocytes were electrically paced to contract while being monitored for ANF release, cytoplasmic calcium, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and protein kinase C activation. Similar measurements were also carried out in the presence of endothelin-1 (ET) for comparison of contraction-related and hormone-stimulated ANF secretion. Pacing (6-8 Hz) immediately increased ANF secretion by 3-5-fold and the time-averaged cytoplasmic calcium concentration (as monitored with indo-1 fluorescence) varied with pace frequency in a similar manner, suggesting that cytoplasmic calcium may play a key role in pace-induced ANF secretion. Furthermore, nifedipine and ryanodine, which inhibited the contractile calcium transients, inhibited pace-induced ANF release, whereas Bay K 8644 increased both the calcium transients and ANF secretion. Pace-induced ANF release was also completely inhibited by KN-62, a specific inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) but was not inhibited by chelerythrine, a protein kinase C-selective inhibitor. Pace-induced ANF release averaged 40% of that elicited by ET which is known to require both PKC and CaMK for maximal effects on ANF secretion. The effects of pacing and ET on ANF secretion were approximately additive. In contrast to pacing, ET strongly stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, activated PKC, and did not increase cytoplasmic calcium. Thus, regulation of ANF secretion by contraction rate depends primarily on the contractile calcium transients and CaMK and is independent of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1526756159,"The regulation of interleukin (IL)-6 synthesis by cAMP-increasing agents remains an unresolved issue. Since an increase in cAMP levels via activation of histamine H2 receptors does not induce IL-1 beta synthesis but enhances self-induction of IL-1 (Vannier, E., and Dinarello, C. A. (1993) J. Clin. Invest. 92, 281-287), we investigated whether histamine regulates IL-6 synthesis. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with IL-1 alpha in the absence or presence of histamine (1 nM to 100 microM). IL-6 was measured using a specific radioimmunoassay. Histamine alone did not induce protein synthesis or mRNA accumulation for IL-6. Histamine (1-100 microM) enhanced IL-1 alpha-induced synthesis of IL-6 (p < 0.001). Cimetidine and ranitidine, H2 receptor antagonists structurally unrelated to each other, completely reversed the histamine-mediated increase in IL-1 alpha-induced IL-6 synthesis. However, diphenhydramine, an H1 receptor antagonist, did not reverse this effect. Prostaglandin E2, an activator of adenylate cyclase, also enhanced IL-1 alpha-induced synthesis of IL-6. Histamine increased and sustained steady-state levels of IL-6 mRNA in IL-1 alpha-stimulated cells, but reduced IL-6 mRNA half-life (3.5 h versus 1.8 h). Our results indicate that cAMP-increasing agents, such as histamine or prostaglandin E2, fail to induce IL-6 synthesis but rather enhance IL-1-induced IL-6 synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1525290026,"The inverse correlation between plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and the risk for cardiovascular disease has been attributed in part to the role of HDL in facilitating the transport of cholesterol to the liver for catabolism. One component of this reverse cholesterol transport is removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral cells. An immunochemical approach was employed to evaluate the role of human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I in cellular cholesterol efflux and to test the hypothesis that discrete structural domains of the molecule mediate this function. Two apoA-I-specific monoclonal antibodies (AI-11 and AI-14) inhibited in vitro cellular cholesterol efflux from THP-1 monocytic cells to HDL or apoA-I proteoliposomes by approximately 50%. Six other antibodies had no effect although three of these bound significant proportions of the apoA-I proteoliposomes. Antibody AI-11 binds apoA-I amino acid residues 96-111 (Banka, C. L., Bonnet, D. J., Black, A. S., Smith, R. S., and Curtiss, L. K. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23886-23892). The AI-14 epitope was localized to residues 74-105. Therefore, the two antibodies that inhibited HDL promotion of cellular cholesterol efflux bound overlapping but distinct regions of the apoA-I molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1507116771,"Two alternatively spliced human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) receptor mRNA transcripts have been described that differ by three nucleotides (CAG) starting at position 2829. This results in an amino acid coding sequence change from Thr-Gly to Arg in the extracellular portion of the receptor beta subunit. To investigate the functional significance of this sequence difference, we obtained full-length cDNAs for the CAG+ and CAG- receptor forms, transfected CHO cells, and isolated multiple clones expressing approximately equal numbers of receptors (0.57-0.73 x 10(6) receptors/cell). The two receptors bound IGF I with similar affinity (Kd approximately 1.7 nM), but the CAG- form exhibited an approximately 2-fold increase in IGF I stimulation of receptor autophosphorylation, insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation, thymidine incorporation, and IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. In contrast to its higher signaling activity, the rate of receptor-mediated internalization of IGF I by the CAG-receptor was decreased by 50% in comparison with the CAG+ receptor. We conclude that proteins corresponding to the two alternatively spliced human IGF I receptor transcripts are biologically active, but have distinct signaling properties. These experiments further indicate a previously unrecognized role for the extramembranous portion of the beta subunit in receptor signaling and internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1650925177,"Human angiogenin is an excellent substrate for the adhesion of HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells. These cells adhere more quickly to human angiogenin than to fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, and collagen IV. Anti-angiogenin antibodies and the angiogenesis inhibitors platelet factor-4 and placental ribonuclease inhibitor prevent adhesion of HT-29 cells to angiogenin. Calcium and magnesium ions are not required for adhesion and Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser has no effect, indicating that the interaction is integrin-independent. Instead, adhesion seems to involve a heparan/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Treatment of the cells with heparinase or heparitinase decreases HT-29 cell adhesion onto angiogenin but not onto collagen I. Moreover, cell adhesion is decreased by the presence of heparin or chondroitin sulfates and by preincubation of the cells with inhibitors of proteoglycan synthesis or secretion. In addition, angiogenin binds tightly to heparin-Sepharose, requiring 0.78 M NaCl for elution. Angiogenin-affinity chromatography of a 35S-, 3H-labeled HT-29 cell fraction enriched in cell-surface proteoglycans yields a single, heparinase-sensitive component of apparent molecular mass > 200 kDa, as detected by autoradiography after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results suggest that angiogenin could be an effective substrate for tumor cell adhesion during metastasis and may provide a basis for the design of inhibitors of this process."
https://openalex.org/W1605425039,"We investigated interrelations among changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), tyrosine phosphorylation, and the cell cycles of rat aorta smooth muscle cells in primary culture, as stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the microfluorometry of Fura-2. The phase of the cell cycle and the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation were examined by immunocytochemical analysis of monoclonal antibodies against cell cycle-specific nuclear antigens and against phosphotyrosine, respectively. Prior to the application of PDGF, the cell cycle was synchronized in the G0 phase by serum deprivation for 24 h. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, PDGF induced an initial transient (first component) and a subsequent lower steady-state (second component) elevation of [Ca2+]i. NiCl2 and the removal of extracellular Ca2+ inhibited the second, but not the first, component. The first component was inhibited by pretreatment with ryanodine. These results are compatible with the notion that the first and second components may be mediated mainly through the release of intracellular Ca2+ and the influx of extracellular Ca2+, respectively. After pretreatment with ryanodine and in the presence of NiCl2, PDGF also stimulated the entry of G0 cells into G1 phase, but there were no [Ca2+]i transients. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase blocker, inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation induced by PDGF and blocked the first, but not the second, component of [Ca2+]i elevation induced by PDGF. However, genistein did not inhibit the release of intracellular Ca2+ induced by angiotensin II or by caffeine. Genistein prevented G0 cells from entering the G1 phase, as induced by PDGF, but this was not the case when serum was reapplied to the growth medium. Similar results were obtained with another tyrosine kinase blocker, tyrphostin. These data suggest that in vascular smooth muscle cells: 1) an increase in [Ca2+]i is not required for competent (G0 to G1) cell proliferation induced by PDGF; and 2) tyrosine kinase plays an important role in the release of intracellular Ca2+ and in cell proliferation, as induced by PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W1587743369,"We have studied the involvement of the factor for inversion stimulation (FIS) in the growth rate-dependent expression of the arginine, leucine, and methionine acceptor tRNA species. The concentration of individual tRNA species relative to 16 S rRNA was determined by blot hybridization using RNA preparations from bacteria with the fis gene deleted and from isogenic wild type bacteria. The RNA preparations were obtained from bacteria growing under steady state conditions in different media. The levels of tRNA(1Leu), tRNA(2Arg), tRNA(4Arg), and tRNA(5Arg decreased in the fis bacteria, relative to the wild type. The difference in levels increased with increasing growth rate. Surprisingly, tRNA(3Leu), tRNA(rMet), and tRNA(eMet) showed the opposite response, with an increase of the tRNA/16 S ratio in the fis bacteria. The tRNA(2Leu, tRNA(4Leu), tRNA(5Leu), and tRNA(3 Arg) had unaffected tRNA/16 S ratios in fis cells. We conclude that FIS, directly or indirectly, is involved in growth rate regulation of some tRNA species and that it affects the composition of the cellular tRNA pool."
https://openalex.org/W1495106755,"Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) plus ionomycin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) substrates, including one with an apparent molecular weight of 100,000 (pp100) in cloned murine CTL. cis-Unsaturated fatty acids and low concentrations of phenylarsine oxide specifically inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100. Genistein also inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100, but not with the same specificity as cis-fatty acids or low concentrations of phenylarsine oxide. Degranulation triggered by PMA plus ionomycin is inhibited by cis-fatty acids, low concentrations of phenylarsine oxide, and genistein, under the same conditions that these agents inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100. Depleting CTL of protein kinase C (PKC) activity by prolonged exposure to PMA eliminates the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation when challenged by PMA plus ionomycin, but not when these PKC-depleted CTL are activated by cognate target cells, immobilized anti-T cell receptor (TCR) antibodies, or concanavalin A. Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100 triggered by TCR engagement in PKC-depleted cells is inhibited by cis-fatty acids and phenylarsine oxide, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism of the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100 is independent of PKC. Furthermore, because all three tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitors are unlikely to inhibit PKC, these results suggest that, in addition to PKC activation and a rise in intracellular Ca2+, CTL degranulation requires the tyrosine phosphorylation of a CTL substrate(s), in addition to phospholipase C, and the present results are consistent with pp100 as that substrate. Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp100 may play a central role in CTL function."
https://openalex.org/W1546532250,"We have been studying cAMP signaling in L6 myoblasts because of its potential role in regulating the differentiation of these cells into multinucleate myotubes. Previous studies have shown that treatment of L6 myoblasts with cAMP analogs causes an increase in cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. To assess the role of protein kinase A in this cAMP-mediated increase in cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, L6 myoblasts were transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA for a mutant regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, which functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of this enzyme. The cDNA was under control of the metallothionein promoter in the construct. Induction of the mutant regulatory subunit with Zn2+ decreased cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity by 90%. Zn2+ treatment was also able to completely block the cAMP-mediated increase in phosphodiesterase activity, showing that this effect is mediated by protein kinase A. The activity of the cAMP-induced phosphodiesterase was inhibited by low concentrations of RO 20-1724, showing that it was a member of the type IV low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase family of enzymes. We used the polymerase chain reaction and consensus primers designed to amplify phosphodiesterase sequences to show that L6 myoblasts also contain mRNA for a type IV low Km cAMP phosphodiesterase designated PDE3.1. The levels of this mRNA were increased greatly by treatment with dibutyryl cAMP or forskolin in L6 myoblasts and also in differentiated L6 myotubes. Run-off transcription assays showed that this increase in PDE mRNA was regulated, at least in part, by an increase in the rate of transcription of the PDE3 gene. The induction of PDE3 message by cAMP was blocked when the L6 transfectants were treated with Zn2+ to induce protein kinase A inhibition. Therefore, some of the cAMP-mediated increase in phosphodiesterase activity seen in L6 myoblasts is due to a protein kinase A-mediated increase in PDE3 mRNA. This pathway may serve as a feedback mechanism to modulate the inhibitory effects of cAMP on myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1602786033,"The Src homology 2 (SH2) region is a noncatalytic domain of Src-family tyrosine kinases and other proteins which participants in inter- and intramolecular interactions of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. A synthetic peptide modeled on the c-Src carboxyl terminus, which contains phosphotyrosine at position 527, binds recombinant SH2 and the SH2-domain of c-Src which lacks phosphotyrosine 527. Unphosphorylated peptide does not bind detectably. Thus, the phosphorylated peptide is a specific probe for investigating SH2 accessibility. Since Src and other tyrosine kinases may participate in regulating events in mitosis, we used the SH2-binding probe to test the prediction that decreased tyrosine 527 phosphorylation would lead to increased accessibility of the c-Src SH2-domain during mitosis. Probe binding to overexpressed chicken c-Src was enhanced at least 6-fold during mitosis, indicating that the c-Src SH2-domain is more accessible in this part of the cell cycle. This suggests that there may be mitosis-specific interactions of the c-Src SH2-domain with cellular proteins in vivo."

In contrast, myoblasts derived from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts treated with DNA demethylating agents or transfected with the cDNA encoding MyoD expressed the Ae (M(r) = 400,000) and a novel Ae-related laminin chain (designated Ac3h, M(r) = 350,000) in addition to the B1e and B2e chains. Expression of the Ae and Ac3h chains paralleled the capacity for myofiber formation in six additional C3H10T1/2 myoblast clones with varied potentials for terminal differentiation and coincided with a switch in laminin isoforms from those of M(r) = 850,000 synthesized by C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts to those of M(r) = 900,000-950,000 synthesized by C3H10T1/2 myoblasts and myofibers. Cultures of mouse C2C12, mouse BC3H1, rat L6, and primary mouse myoblasts also synthesized the Ae, Ac3h, B1e, and B2e laminin chains. The results demonstrate that expression of the Ae and Ac3h laminin chains is associated with expression of MyoD and the mammalian myogenic differentiation program."
https://openalex.org/W1480526395,"Cl- conductance of the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells has properties of a passive diffusion mechanism but is decreased by inhibition of oxidative metabolism. Recent reports that cAMP-dependent Cl- conductance also requires ATP at the intracellular domains of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) suggests that ATP concentration could mediate metabolic regulation of Cl- conductance. However, metabolic inhibitors affect processes other than ATP free energy levels, including notably the metabolic pathways that set the redox potential of pyridine nucleotides within the cell. We have investigated the possibility that CFTR-mediated Cl- conductance is affected by the ratio of oxidized to reduced intracellular pyridine nucleotides. CFTR was expressed in airway and heterologous cells and studied under whole cell voltage clamp conditions, which permitted the intracellular NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratio to be varied independently of ATP concentration. In three cell types expressing CFTR, whole cell dialysis with reduced pyridine nucleotides inhibited activation of Cl- currents by forskolin and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), whereas dialysis with oxidized pyridines increased both basal and stimulated CFTR-mediated Cl- conductance. In cell-attached membrane patches, the open probability of 5-6-picosiemens Cl- channels that had been activated by forskolin and CPT-cAMP was further and reversibly increased by permeant oxidants. Neither swelling-induced whole cell K+ currents in CFTR-expressing cells nor swelling-induced whole cell Cl- currents in multidrug resistance protein-expressing cells were affected by NADPH. Pyridine nucleotide redox potential had little effect on phosphorylation of histone by protein kinase A. We conclude that CFTR Cl- conductance function can be modulated by pyridine nucleotide redox potential. This effect points to the existence of a mechanism or mechanisms by which cytosolic nucleotides other than ATP can affect plasma membrane Cl- conductance and may help explain how a passive ion conductance is linked to cellular energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1543637383,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and cholesterol metabolism. In studies reported herein, we show bFGF increases low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding, uptake, and degradation in arterial smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner. This increase was paralleled by an increase in LDL receptor mRNA steady state levels. To determine if bFGF activated transcription of the LDL receptor gene, we transiently transfected smooth muscle cells with a gene construct consisting of the 5'-upstream promoter region of the DNA from the human LDL receptor gene ligated to a plasmid containing the luciferase gene. We found that bFGF and a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, significantly induced luciferase activity driven by the LDL receptor promoter, whereas 25-hydroxycholesterol reduced the luciferase activity in bFGF-stimulated cells. These findings show that bFGF and PKC are inducing LDL receptor gene transcription. We also evaluated potential signal transduction pathways induced by bFGF to establish the mechanism(s) leading to the activation of the LDL receptor gene. Activation of the activity of FGF receptor tyrosine kinase in smooth muscle cells by ligand binding resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of one of the FGF receptors and a 90-kDa-protein as well as increased tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma. Parallel observations were made in that increased PKC and protein kinase A activities occurred with bFGF as compared with control cells. Inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase and other protein kinases significantly reduced transcription and surface expression of LDL receptor. Finally, several key enzymes that are central to the regulation of LDL-cholesteryl ester metabolism were also studied in bFGF-stimulated cells. An increase in acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity and cholesterol esterification was observed with bFGF stimulation, but there was no effect on the lysosomal or cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester hydrolase activities. Our findings suggest potential signal transduction pathways activated by bFGF which play a role in regulating transcription and surface expression of the LDL receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1561335619,"We have generated two groups of deletion mutants of the alpha PDGFR and one group of chimeras between alpha PDGFR and beta PDGFR to further investigate the structural requirements of the alpha PDGFR for binding to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and to a monoclonal antibody against alpha PDGFR (designated as mAb-alpha R1). The mAb-alpha R1 has recently been reported to block high affinity binding of PDGF-AA to alpha PDGFR. The first group of mutants were carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants encoding the first two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (alpha R1-216), the first four Ig-like domains (alpha R1-415), or all five Ig-like domains (alpha R1-530) of the alpha PDGFR. Since these mutants lacked transmembrane domains, their expression in NIH/3T3 cells resulted in secretion of the truncated alpha PDGFRs. Using conditioned medium from NIH/3T3 transfectants, we showed that mAb-alpha R1 was able to immunoprecipitate each of these secreted form of alpha PDGFRs, suggesting that the epitope recognized by mAb-alpha R1 is located within Ig-like domains 1 and 2 of the alpha PDGFR. Furthermore, PDGF-AA exhibited detectable binding to alpha R1-415 or alpha R1-530 but failed to interact with alpha R1-216, suggesting that the first two Ig-like domains of the alpha PDGFR are not sufficient for PDGF-AA binding. The second group of alpha PDGFR mutants were internal deletion mutants lacking Ig-like loop 1 (alpha R delta 49-100), Ig-like loop 2 (alpha R delta 150-189), Ig-like loop 3 (alpha R delta 235-290), or part of Ig-like loops 4 and 5 (alpha R delta 375-450). The internal deletion mutants were transfected into 32D cells which lack both alpha PDGFR and beta PDGFR. PDGF-AA bound with high affinity to 32D cells expressing alpha R delta 375-450 but not to 32D cells expressing the other three internal deletion mutants, suggesting that the region required for PDGF-AA binding should be within the first three Ig-like domains of the alpha PDGFR. In addition, mAb-alpha R1 bound to 32D cells expressing alpha R delta 235-290 but failed to bind 32D cells transfected with alpha R delta 49-100 or alpha R delta 150-189.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2167541165,"The mitochondrial inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) is a transport pathway which is believed to be involved in mitochondrial volume homeostasis. The protein, however, has not been identified. In this paper, we examine the relationship between IMAC and the adenine nucleotide translocator. Many inhibitors of the adenine nucleotide translocase are shown to block IMAC, including Cibacron blue 3GA, bromcresol green, alizarin red S, agaric acid, palmitoyl-CoA, and the fluorescein derivatives erythrosin B, erythrosin isothiocyanate, rose bengal, and eosin Y. The following evidence suggests that Cibacron blue, agaric acid, and palmitoyl-CoA inhibit by binding to a common site. 1) They all only partially block the transport of small anions such as Cl-, NO3-, and HCO3-, but completely block the transport of larger anions such as malonate. 2) They decrease the IC50 values of each other in a manner consistent with competitive binding. 3) N-Ethylmaleimide decreases their IC50 values by a similar extent. 4) Inhibition by all shows no dependence on matrix pH and only a small dependence on medium pH. It is suggested that these agents may selectively bind to an open state of IMAC and inhibit by decreasing its conductance. The physiological nucleotides CoA, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADH, and ATP do not inhibit; in fact, IMAC is shown to transport ATP. Despite these similarities between IMAC and the adenine nucleotide translocase, IMAC appears to be a separate entity, since some of the IC50 values differ by up to 8-fold, and carboxyatracyloside, the most selective inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocase, has no effect on IMAC. In addition, IMAC is also able to transport AMP, while the adenine nucleotide translocase does not."
