https://openalex.org/W2972246420,"Efficient sampling of equilibrium states Molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods can be used to sample equilibrium states, but these methods become computationally expensive for complex systems, where the transition from one equilibrium state to another may only occur through rare events. Noé et al. used neural networks and deep learning to generate distributions of independent soft condensed-matter samples at equilibrium (see the Perspective by Tuckerman). Supervised training is used to construct invertible transformations between the coordinates of the complex system of interest and simple Gaussian coordinates of the same dimensionality. Thus, configurations can be sampled in this simpler coordinate system and then transformed back into the complex one using the correct statistical weighting.

They are also implicated in human developmental disorders and cancers5–8, supporting the critical role of DNA methylation in the specification and maintenance of cell fate. Previous studies have suggested that post-translational modifications of histones are involved in specifying patterns of DNA methyltransferase localization and DNA methylation at promoters and actively transcribed gene bodies9–11. However, the mechanisms that control the establishment and maintenance of intergenic DNA methylation remain poorly understood. Tatton–Brown–Rahman syndrome (TBRS) is a childhood overgrowth disorder that is defined by germline mutations in DNMT3A. TBRS shares clinical features with Sotos syndrome (which is caused by haploinsufficiency of NSD1, a histone methyltransferase that catalyses the dimethylation of histone H3 at K36 (H3K36me2)8,12,13), which suggests that there is a mechanistic link between these two diseases. Here we report that NSD1-mediated H3K36me2 is required for the recruitment of DNMT3A and maintenance of DNA methylation at intergenic regions. Genome-wide analysis shows that the binding and activity of DNMT3A colocalize with H3K36me2 at non-coding regions of euchromatin. Genetic ablation of Nsd1 and its paralogue Nsd2 in mouse cells results in a redistribution of DNMT3A to H3K36me3-modified gene bodies and a reduction in the methylation of intergenic DNA. Blood samples from patients with Sotos syndrome and NSD1-mutant tumours also exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic DNA. The PWWP domain of DNMT3A shows dual recognition of H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 in vitro, with a higher binding affinity towards H3K36me2 that is abrogated by TBRS-derived missense mutations. Together, our study reveals a trans-chromatin regulatory pathway that connects aberrant intergenic CpG methylation to human neoplastic and developmental overgrowth. H3K36me2 targets DNMT3A to intergenic regions and this process, together with H3K36me3-mediated recruitment of DNMT3B, has a key role in establishing and maintaining genomic DNA methylation landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2972260587,"The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through mutations or the acquisition of genetic material such as resistance plasmids represents a major public health issue1,2. Persisters are subpopulations of bacteria that survive antibiotics by reversibly adapting their physiology3–10, and can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant mutants11. We investigated whether persisters can also promote the spread of resistance plasmids. In contrast to mutations, the transfer of resistance plasmids requires the co-occurrence of both a donor and a recipient bacterial strain. For our experiments, we chose the facultative intracellular entero-pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Escherichia coli, a common member of the microbiota12. S. Typhimurium forms persisters that survive antibiotic therapy in several host tissues. Here we show that tissue-associated S. Typhimurium persisters represent long-lived reservoirs of plasmid donors or recipients. The formation of reservoirs of S. Typhimurium persisters requires Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-1 and/or SPI-2 in gut-associated tissues, or SPI-2 at systemic sites. The re-seeding of these persister bacteria into the gut lumen enables the co-occurrence of donors with gut-resident recipients, and thereby favours plasmid transfer between various strains of Enterobacteriaceae. We observe up to 99% transconjugants within two to three days of re-seeding. Mathematical modelling shows that rare re-seeding events may suffice for a high frequency of conjugation. Vaccination reduces the formation of reservoirs of persisters after oral infection with S. Typhimurium, as well as subsequent plasmid transfer. We conclude that—even without selection for plasmid-encoded resistance genes—small reservoirs of pathogen persisters can foster the spread of promiscuous resistance plasmids in the gut. The re-seeding of antibiotic-resistant persister subpopulations of Salmonella enterica into the gut lumen favours the transfer of resistance plasmids to gut-resident enterobacteria, showing that even small reservoirs of persister bacteria facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2971559235,"The molecular mechanisms of exon definition and back-splicing are fundamental unanswered questions in pre-mRNA splicing. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the yeast spliceosomal E complex assembled on introns, providing a view of the earliest event in the splicing cycle that commits pre-mRNAs to splicing. The E complex architecture suggests that the same spliceosome can assemble across an exon, and that it either remodels to span an intron for canonical linear splicing (typically on short exons) or catalyses back-splicing to generate circular RNA (on long exons). The model is supported by our experiments, which show that an E complex assembled on the middle exon of yeast EFM5 or HMRA1 can be chased into circular RNA when the exon is sufficiently long. This simple model unifies intron definition, exon definition, and back-splicing through the same spliceosome in all eukaryotes and should inspire experiments in many other systems to understand the mechanism and regulation of these processes. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of an early spliceosome complex in yeast reveal a unified mechanism for defining introns and exons and also for back-splicing to generate circular RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2971841027,"Astrocytes are particularly promising candidates for reprogramming into neurons, as they maintain some of the original patterning information from their radial glial ancestors. However, to which extent the position of astrocytes influences the fate of reprogrammed neurons remains unknown. To elucidate this, we performed stab wound injury covering an entire neocortical column, including the gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and targeted local reactive astrocytes via injecting FLEx switch (Cre-On) adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors into mGFAP-Cre mice. Single proneural factors were not sufficient for adequate reprogramming, although their combination with the nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) improved reprogramming efficiency. Nurr1 and Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2) resulted in high-efficiency reprogramming of targeted astrocytes into neurons that develop lamina-specific hallmarks, including the appropriate long-distance axonal projections. Surprisingly, in the WM, we did not observe any reprogrammed neurons, thereby unveiling a crucial role of region- and layer-specific differences in astrocyte reprogramming."

https://openalex.org/W2971873417,"Choosing a valid and feasible method to measure child developmental outcomes is key to addressing developmental delays, which have been shown to be associated with high levels of unemployment, participation in crime, and teen pregnancies. However, measuring early childhood development (ECD) with multi-dimensional diagnostic tests such as the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III (Bayley-III) can be time-consuming and expensive; therefore, parental screening tools such as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) are frequently an alternative measure of early childhood development in large-scale research. The ASQ is also becoming more frequently used as the first step to identify children at risk for developmental delays before conducting a diagnostic test to confirm. However, the effectiveness of the ASQ-3 is uncertain. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the ASQ-3 as a screening measure for children at risk of developmental delay in rural China by age group. To do so, we administered the Bayley-III, widely considered to be the “gold standard” of ECD diagnostic tests, to a sample of 1,831 five to twenty-four month-old children and also administered the ASQ-3 to their caregivers. We then compared the outcomes of the ASQ-3 test to those of the Bayley-III. We find that the ASQ-3 was significantly though weakly correlated with the Bayley-III and that the strength of this correlation increased with child age and was stronger when the mother was the primary caregiver (as compared to the grandmother). We also find that the sensitivity and specificity of ASQ-3 ranged widely. The overall findings suggest that the ASQ-3 may not be a very accurate screening tool for identifying developmentally delayed children, especially for children under 13 months of age or children whose primary caregiver is not the mother."
https://openalex.org/W2971414793,"Organisms from temperate ecosystems experience a cyclic alternation of favorable seasons, when they can grow and develop, and unfavorable periods, characterized by low temperatures and reduced resource availability. A common adaptation to these changing conditions is to undergo a state of metabolic arrest triggered by environmental cues (e.g. diapause) during the unfavorable periods. Altered environmental conditions resulting from global change can expose organisms to contradictory cues, potentially triggering maladaptive responses. Here, I compared the performance of an oligophagous butterfly when experiencing consistent vs contradictory environmental cues by manipulating temperature, daylength, and host plant in the laboratory. I implemented a fully factorial design with realistic temperature and photoperiodic regimes to resemble environmental conditions during mid-summer and the summer-autumn transition within the focal species’ range. To assess the role of host plant at mediating the effects of abiotic factors, larvae were fed foliage of either a high or a low-quality host species. Decreasing daylength was the primary cue inducing diapause; however, feeding on a low-quality host at low temperatures also induced diapause in larvae growing under constant summer daylength. Conversely, exposure to high temperatures while feeding on a high-quality host occasionally overruled the diapause-inducing effect of decreasing daylength. Feeding on a high-quality host mitigated the lethal effects of cold, but not of hot temperatures. In addition, exposure to cold temperatures resulted in a significant reduction of pupal mass only under decreasing daylength. These results indicate that responses to environmental stressors in this multivoltine butterfly differ across the growing season according to the eco-physiological state of individuals (whether they undergo direct development or diapause). Traits related to oligophagy, such as sensitivity to multiple cues for diapause induction, as well as some of its consequences, such as the occurrence of overlapping generations, are likely to mitigate some of the detrimental effects of global change."
https://openalex.org/W2971780522,"In protein tertiary structure prediction, model quality assessment programs (MQAPs) are often used to select the final structural models from a pool of candidate models generated by multiple templates and prediction methods. The 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3DCNN) is an expansion of the 2DCNN and has been applied in several fields, including object recognition. The 3DCNN is also used for MQA tasks, but the performance is low due to several technical limitations related to protein tertiary structures, such as orientation alignment. We proposed a novel single-model MQA method based on local structure quality evaluation using a deep neural network containing 3DCNN layers. The proposed method first assesses the quality of local structures for each residue and then evaluates the quality of whole structures by integrating estimated local qualities. We analyzed the model using the CASP11, CASP12, and 3D-Robot datasets and compared the performance of the model with that of the previous 3DCNN method based on whole protein structures. The proposed method showed a significant improvement compared to the previous 3DCNN method for multiple evaluation measures. We also compared the proposed method to other state-of-the-art methods. Our method showed better performance than the previous 3DCNN-based method and comparable accuracy as the current best single-model methods; particularly, in CASP11 stage2, our method showed a Pearson coefficient of 0.486, which was better than those of the best single-model methods (0.366–0.405). A standalone version of the proposed method and data files are available at https://github.com/ishidalab-titech/3DCNN_MQA."
https://openalex.org/W2971873444,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent stem cells with the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into any cell types of the 3 germ layers. Recent studies have demonstrated that there is a strong connection between mitochondrial function and pluripotency. Here, we report that methyltransferase like (Mettl) 17, identified from the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats knockout screen, is required for proper differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Mettl17 is located in mitochondria through its N-terminal targeting sequence and specifically interacts with 12S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (mt-rRNA) as well as small subunits of mitochondrial ribosome (MSSUs). Loss of Mettl17 affects the stability of both 12S mt-rRNA and its associated proteins of MSSUs. We further showed that Mettl17 is an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding protein and regulates mitochondrial ribosome function in a SAM-binding-dependent manner. Loss of Mettl17 leads to around 70% reduction of m4C840 and 50% reduction of m5C842 of 12S mt-rRNA, revealing the first regulator of the m4C840 and indicating a crosstalk between the 2 nearby modifications. The defects of mitochondrial ribosome caused by deletion of Mettl17 lead to the impaired translation of mitochondrial protein-coding genes, resulting in significant changes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cellular metabolome, which are important for mESC pluripotency.-Shi, Z., Xu, S., Xing, S., Yao, K., Zhang, L., Xue, L., Zhou, P., Wang, M., Yan, G., Yang, P., Liu, J., Hu, Z., Lan, F. Mettl17, a regulator of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA modifications, is required for the translation of mitochondrial coding genes."
https://openalex.org/W2971941110,"In light of increasing calls for transparent reporting of research and prevention of detrimental research practices, we conducted a cross-sectional machine-assisted analysis of a representative sample of scientific journals’ instructions to authors (ItAs) across all disciplines. We investigated addressing of 19 topics related to transparency in reporting and research integrity. Only three topics were addressed in more than one third of ItAs: conflicts of interest, plagiarism, and the type of peer review the journal employs. Health and Life Sciences journals, journals published by medium or large publishers, and journals registered in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) were more likely to address many of the analysed topics, while Arts & Humanities journals were least likely to do so. Despite the recent calls for transparency and integrity in research, our analysis shows that most scientific journals need to update their ItAs to align them with practices which prevent detrimental research practices and ensure transparent reporting of research."
https://openalex.org/W2971658391,"Severe strains of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) cause quick decline and stem pitting resulting in significant economic losses in citrus production. A immunocapture reverse-transcriptase loop-mediated amplification (IC-RT-LAMP) assay was developed in this study to detect the severe VT strains that are typically associated with severe CTV symptoms. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay was determined by ten-fold serial dilutions of CA-VT-AT39 RNA, in comparison to one-step RT-droplet digital (dd) PCR. RT-LAMP detected up to 0.002 ng RNA with an amplification time of 10:35 (min:sec.), equivalent to 11.3 copies as determined by one step RT-ddPCR. The RT-LAMP assay specifically detected CA-VT-AT39 RNA and did not cross react with other CTV genotypes tested (T36, T30, RB, S1 and T68). To facilitate rapid on-site detection, the RT-LAMP assay was improved by first capturing the CTV virions from citrus crude leaf sap using CTV-IgG (IC-RT-LAMP), thereby eliminating nucleic acid extraction steps. IC-RT-LAMP assay was optimized with two-fold dilutions of CTV-IgG ranging from 1:500 to 1:16,000. The IC-RT-LAMP assay detected the CA-VT-AT39 virions in all dilutions tested. The minimum amplification time was 6:45 (min:sec) with 1:500 and 1:1000 of CTV-IgG dilutions. The limit of detection of IC-RT-LAMP assay with crude leaf sap of CA-VT-AT39 was 1:320 with a maximum amplification time of 9:08 (min:sec). The IC-RT-LAMP assay was validated for VT genotype by comparing to IC-RT-qPCR using the CTV from 40 field tree samples. A 100% agreement was observed between tests, regardless of single or mixed infections of CTV VT with other genotypes. Therefore, the IC-RT-LAMP assay can serve as a useful tool in the management of potentially severe strains of CTV."
https://openalex.org/W2971845120,"Objectives Amyloid-β 1–40 (Aβ 1–40) and amyloid-β 1–42 (Aβ 1–42) are the proteins known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)–the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Hypoxia is suspected to be one of conditions associated with Aβ plasma level increase. A common reason of hypoxia is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by recurrent episodes of apnea. Aim The aim of the study was to evaluate plasma Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 concentrations in patients with OSA. Methods Patients with suspected OSA (n = 112) underwent polygraphic examinations Patients with confirmed OSA (n = 81) showed apnea/hypopnea index greater than or equal to 5. Mild and moderate form of the disease was defined when AHI was 5–30 (n = 38, OSA+), severe–when AHI was >30 (n = 43, OSA++). Individuals with AHI<5 (n = 31) served as control group (OSA-). Results Aβ 1–40 concentrations in OSA++ (191.1 pg/ml) group was significantly (p<0.05) higher compared with OSA- (76.9 pg/ml) and OSA+ (159.4 pg/ml) and correlated with selected parameters of hypoxemia severity. There were no differences in Aβ 1–42 concentration between the groups. Conclusion In patients with severe OSA Aβ 1–40 plasma concentrations are significantly higher compared with OSA- and OSA+ and seem to be related to hypoxia severity, which may indicate increased risk of AD development in this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2971622067,"Bladder urine volume has been estimated using an ellipsoid method based on triaxial measurements of the bladder extrapolated from two-dimensional ultrasound images. This study aimed to automate this process and to determine the accuracy of the automated estimation method for normal and small amounts of urine. A training set of 81 pairs of transverse and longitudinal ultrasound images were collected from healthy volunteers on a tablet-type ultrasound device, and an automatic detection tool was developed using them. The tool was evaluated using paired transverse/longitudinal ultrasound images from 27 other healthy volunteers. After imaging, the participants voided and their urine volume was measured. For determining accuracy, regression coefficients were calculated between estimated bladder volume and urine volume. Further, sensitivity and specificity for 50 and 100 ml bladder volume thresholds were evaluated. Data from 50 procedures were included. The regression coefficient was very similar between the automatic estimation (β = 0.99, R2 = 0.96) and manual estimation (β = 1.05, R2 = 0.97) methods. The sensitivity and specificity of the automatic estimation method were 88.5% and 100.0%, respectively, for 100 ml and were 94.1% and 100.0%, respectively, for 50 ml. The newly-developed automated tool accurately and reliably estimated bladder volume at two different volume thresholds of approximately 50 ml and 100 ml."
https://openalex.org/W2972088882,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria activates pro-inflammatory pathways, dys-regulates the function of endometrial cells and is a key player in the mechanisms involved in endometritis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of LPS on bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEEC) from whole transcriptome with a special focus on genes involved in embryo-maternal interactions. Following in vitro culture, bEEC from three cows were exposed to 0, 2, and 8 μg/mL LPS for 24h. RNA samples extracted at 0 and 24 hours were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). At 24h, 2035 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between controls and samples treated with 2 μg/mL LPS. Gene ontology analysis showed that over-expressed DEGs were associated to immune response, response to stress and external stimuli, catalytic activity, and cell cycle. Genes associated with cell membrane and cell adhesion pathways were under-expressed. LPS induced changes in expression of specific genes related to embryo-maternal interactions including under-expression of eight members of the cadherin superfamily, over-expression of six members of the mucin family, and differential expression of a large set of genes binding the above molecules and of more than 20 transcripts coding for cytokines and their receptors. Type I interferon-τ dependent genes were also over-expressed. From a sub-set of 19 genes, (biological replicates of bEEC from cows taken at time 6 (n = 3), 24 (n = 6) and 48 hours (n = 3), and 2 technical replicates per sample) differential gene expression was confirmed by RT2-qPCR (r2 between fold changes at 24 hours by RT2-qPCR and RNA-seq = 0.97). These results indicate that LPS affects the function of bEEC in many ways by differential transcription, glycolytic metabolism and oxidative stress. Many transcriptomic signatures related to implantation and embryo maternal interactions were strongly affected by LPS. These results pave the way for further studies to investigate the duration of these changes and their possible impact on endometrial function and fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2972125407,"Radiocarbon dating Pacific archaeological sites is fraught with difficulties. Often situated in coastal beach ridges or sand dunes, these sites exhibit horizontal and vertical disturbances, datable materials such as wood charcoal are typically highly degraded, may be derived from old trees or driftwood unless specifically identified to short-lived material, while bone collagen rarely survives in tropical conditions. Shell, therefore, is the most logical material for dating Pacific sites since it is resistant to alteration, can be sampled to ensure only the last few seasons of growth are represented and is often closely tied to human economic activities. However, shell radiocarbon (14C) dating has been plagued by interpretive problems largely due to our limited knowledge of the 14C cycle in nearshore marine and estuarine environments. Consequently, shell dates are typically ignored in regional chronometric evaluations and in recent years shell is often avoided for dating altogether. Recent advances in our understanding of the source of shell 14C as well as the development of the first South Pacific Gyre model of changing marine 14C over time, combined with Bayesian statistical modelling, now provide us with insight into the value of these shell radiocarbon dates. Here we present a revision of the age of the To’aga site on Ofu Island–an early occupation site associated with the initial Polynesian Plainware period in Sāmoa, the earliest use of which we date to between 2785 and 2607 cal BP (68% probability)."
https://openalex.org/W2972247158,"Objective To investigate the association of bilateral high-frequency hearing loss (BHFHL) with blood pressure and hypertension among occupational noise exposed workers. Methods Occupational noise exposed workers were enrolled in 2017 from the occupational diseases survey of Chengdu. BHFHL was classified as normal, mild, or high by the bilateral high-frequency tone average. Linear regression model was used to assess the effects of occupational noise exposure time and BHFHL on blood pressure. Logistic regression model was performed to estimate hypertension risk odds ratios (ORs) associated to occupational noise exposure time and BHFHL. Results Increasing years of occupational noise exposure and BHFHL were significantly associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure increase (all P<0.001). The lineal trend was only significant in males, with adjusted ORs for hypertension gradually increasing with increasing years of occupational noise exposure (P<0.001). Furthermore, subjects having mild and high BHFHL had a higher hypertension risk of 34% and 281%, respectively (both P<0.001). Dose-response relationship between BHFHL and hypertension was found in both males and females. Conclusions Occupational noise exposure was positively associated with blood pressure levels and hypertension risk."
https://openalex.org/W2971856439,"Background Patients and clinicians endorse the importance of compassionate healthcare but patients report gaps between its perceived importance and its demonstration. Empathy and compassion have been associated with quality of life and significant health outcomes but these characteristics are not optimally measured or used for performance and organizational improvement. Objective To address these gaps, we conducted a study with the objective of evaluating the properties of the 12-item Schwartz Center Compassionate Care Scale® using psychometric analysis and cognitive debriefing. Methods Non-hospitalized patients with multiple chronic conditions were sampled using an on-line platform. Classical test theory and Rasch measurement theory were used to evaluate psychometric properties of the scale. Structured questions elicited cognitive responses regarding clarity of each item. Results Classical test theory analysis confirmed that the 12-item Schwartz Center Compassionate Care Scale is a unidimensional scale with excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Patients’ ratings of compassionate behaviors using the Schwartz Center Compassionate Care Scale correlated significantly with a related instrument designed to measure empathy, demonstrating convergent validity. Rasch measurement theory showed that reducing the number of response options on 3 items in the scale would improve respondents’ discrimination between responses on these items. Although person-item threshold distribution analysis showed that patients may wish to rate compassionate care at levels both higher and lower than the scale permits, items could be ordered on an interval scale from low to high levels of compassionate care. Conclusions The current 12-item Schwartz Center Compassionate Care Scale demonstrates excellent psychometric properties by Classical Test Theory and Rasch measurement theory. The 12-item Schwartz Center Compassionate Care Scale adds questions related to understanding and discussing emotional, contextual issues and the needs of the patient and family. Easily completed on-line, it could be used for work-place based assessment and feedback to clinicians and performance or quality improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2971876530,"Brachiopods were thought to have dominated deep-sea hydrothermal vents and hydrocarbon seeps for most of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, and were believed to have been outcompeted and replaced by chemosymbiotic bivalves during the Late Cretaceous. But recent findings of bivalve-rich seep deposits of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age have questioned this paradigm. By tabulating the generic diversity of the dominant brachiopod and bivalve clades–dimerelloid brachiopods and chemosymbiotic bivalves–from hydrocarbon seeps through the Phanerozoic, we show that their evolutionary trajectories are largely unrelated to one another, indicating that they have not been competing for the same resources. We hypothesize that the dimerelloid brachiopods generally preferred seeps with abundant hydrocarbons in the bottom waters above the seep, such as oil seeps or methane seeps with diffusive seepage, whereas seeps with strong, advective fluid flow and hence abundant hydrogen sulfide were less favorable for them. At methane seeps typified by diffusive seepage and oil seeps, oxidation of hydrocarbons in the bottom water by chemotrophic bacteria enhances the growth of bacterioplankton, on which the brachiopods could have filter fed. Whereas chemosymbiotic bivalves mostly relied on sulfide-oxidizing symbionts for nutrition, for the brachiopods aerobic bacterial oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons played a more prominent role. The availability of geofuels (i.e. the reduced chemical compounds used in chemosynthesis such as hydrogen sulfide, methane, and other hydrocarbons) at seeps is mostly governed by fluid flow rates, geological setting, and marine sulfate concentrations. Thus rather than competition, we suggest that geofuel type and availability controlled the distribution of brachiopods and bivalves at hydrocarbon seeps through the Phanerozoic."

The current case-control study was performed on 144 patients with colorectal cancer and 130 matching controls. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan assays for four Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in PRNCR1. RNAsnp Web Server was used to detect variations in the secondary structure for each SNP. The genotyping analysis for SNP rs1456315 showed increased association with colorectal cancer with the homozygous CC variant allele (OR: 2.09; χ2 = 4.95; CI: 1.08–4.02; p = 0.02), the minor allele frequency, and additive genotype, respectively (OR: 1.55; χ2 = 6.24; CI: 1.09–2.19; p = 0.01) & (OR: 1.64; χ2 = 4.04; CI: 1.01–2.67; p = 0.04). A risk association was also observed among younger age patients (≤57) and in female patients as well as in patients with tumors of the colon. For the other SNPs tested (rs16901946, rs13252298, rs1016343), no significant association was observed. The secondary structure of the rs1456315 mutant is different from that of the wild-type. Our findings suggest that the upregulation of PRNCR1 and its variants is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer in Saudi patients, indicating that PRNCR1 might be a unique and valuable signature for predicting the risk of colorectal cancer in a Saudi population."
https://openalex.org/W2971696794,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an irreversible and incurable multigenic neurodegenerative disorder. It involves progressive loss of mid brain dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN). We compared brain gene expression profiles with those from the peripheral blood cells of a separate sample of PD patients to identify disease-associated genes. Here, we demonstrate the use of gene expression profiling of brain and blood for detecting valid targets and identifying early PD biomarkers. Implementing this systematic approach, we discovered putative PD risk genes in brain, delineated biological processes and molecular functions that may be particularly disrupted in PD and also identified several putative PD biomarkers in blood. 20 of the differentially expressed genes in SN were also found to be differentially expressed in the blood. Further application of this methodology to other brain regions and neurological disorders should facilitate the discovery of highly reliable and reproducible candidate risk genes and biomarkers for PD. The identification of valid peripheral biomarkers for PD may ultimately facilitate early identification, intervention, and prevention efforts as well."
https://openalex.org/W2971410597,"Introduction Vancomycin is widely used to treat infections caused by Gram positive bacteria, mostly methicillin-resistant strains. Despite its therapeutic effectiveness, vancomycin is a nephrotoxic drug that has been associated with the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). In this study, we sought to evaluate the variability of serum trough concentrations of vancomycin and to determine the incidence and risk factors of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity (VAN) in non-critically ill patients. Methods This was a prospective cohort including Brazilian public hospital inpatients from April 2017 to June 2018. The participants received intravenous vancomycin therapy for at least 48 hours for any suspected or confirmed infection by Gram positive bacteria. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected. Information on vancomycin therapy and concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs were also recorded. Patients were followed up until discontinuation of vancomycin treatment or death, whatever occurred first. The primary outcome was the occurrence of AKI. We performed a Poisson regression to determine risk factors for AKI. Results Overall, 98 participants were included in the study. Median age was 55.9 (interquartile range [IQR] 40.6–66.8) years and 58 (59.2%) were men. Most of them showed subtherapeutic (<10mg/L) or supratherapeutic (>20mg/L) trough levels of vancomycin; 42.9% and 15.3%, respectively. A total of 19 (19.4%) patients developed AKI. Poisson regression showed that male sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.90; confidence interval [CI] 95% 1.28–6.53; p = 0.011), concomitant use of piperacillin-tazobactam (OR 4.66; CI 95% 2.26–9.58; p <0.001) and vancomycin trough levels above 20mg/mL (OR 4.21; CI 95% 1.57–11.278; p = 0.004) were independently associated with AKI. Conclusions Our study showed that usual doses of vancomycin did not reach recommended therapeutic serum trough levels of vancomycin in non-critically ill patients.

This allows us to analyze numerically the different strategies according to the types of track since different designs of tracks lead to straights of different lengths. In particular, we find that the tracks with shorter straights lead to better performances, while the double bend track with the longest straight leads to the worst performances and the biggest difference between lanes. Then for a race with two runners, we introduce a psychological interaction: there is an attraction to follow someone just ahead, but after being overtaken, there is a delay before any benefit from this interaction occurs. We provide numerical simulations in different cases. Overall, the results agree with the IAAF rules for lane draws in competition, where the highest ranked athletes get the center lanes, the next ones the outside lanes, while the lowest ranked athletes get the inside lanes."
https://openalex.org/W2972151315,"Two critical tasks in multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) are to describe criterion values and to aggregate the described information to generate a ranking of alternatives. A flexible and superior tool for the first task is q-rung orthopair fuzzy number (qROFN) and an effective tool for the second task is aggregation operator. So far, nearly thirty different aggregation operators of qROFNs have been presented. Each operator has its distinctive characteristics and can work well for specific purpose. However, there is not yet an operator which can provide desirable generality and flexibility in aggregating criterion values, dealing with the heterogeneous interrelationships among criteria, and reducing the influence of extreme criterion values. To provide such an aggregation operator, Muirhead mean operator, power average operator, partitioned average operator, and Archimedean T-norm and T-conorm operations are concurrently introduced into q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, and an Archimedean power partitioned Muirhead mean operator of qROFNs and its weighted form are presented and a MCGDM method based on the weighted operator is proposed in this paper. The generalised expressions of the two operators are firstly defined. Their properties are explored and proved and their specific expressions are constructed. On the basis of the specific expressions, a method for solving the MCGDM problems based on qROFNs is then designed. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the method is demonstrated via a numerical example, a set of experiments, and qualitative and quantitative comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W2972163325,"Intracellular pH and redox states are critical for multiple processes and partly determine cell behavior. Here, we developed a genetically encoded dual-function probe, named p H and redox-sensitive fluorescent protein (pHaROS), for simultaneous real-time detection of changes in redox potential and pH in living cells. pHaROS consists of the Arabidopsis flavin mononucleotide-binding fluorescent protein iLOV and an mKATE variant, mBeRFP. Using pHaROS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, we confirmed that H2O2 raises the overall redox potential of the cell and found that this increase is accompanied by a decrease in cytosolic pH. Furthermore, we observed spatiotemporal pH and redox homeostasis within the nucleus at various stages of the cell cycle in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) during cellular development and responses to oxidative stress. Importantly, we could tailor pHaROS to specific applications, including measurements in different organelles and cell types and the GSH/GSSG ratio, highlighting pHaROS's high flexibility and versatility. In summary, we have developed pHaROS as a dual-function probe that can be used for simultaneously measuring cellular pH and redox potential, representing a very promising tool for determining the cross-talk between intracellular redox- and pH-signaling processes in yeast and mammalian U87 cell."
https://openalex.org/W2971755588,"Our earlier studies indicated an important role of inducible transcription factor STAT3 in the establishment of persistent infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and promotion of cervical carcinogenesis. Since HPV load and its physical state are two potential determinants of this virally-induced carcinogensis, though with some exceptions, we extended our study to examine the role of active STAT3 level in cervical precancer and cancer lesions and it’s association with HPV viral load and physical state. An elevated level of active STAT3 was measured by assessing phospho-STAT3-Y705 (pSTAT3), in tumor tissues harboring higher viral load irrespective of the disease grade. Physical state analysis of HPV16 by assessing the degree of amplification of full length E2 and comparing it with E6 (E2:E6 ratio), which predominantly represent episomal form of HPV16, revealed low or undetectable pSTAT3. A strong pSTAT3 immunoreactivity was found in tissues those harbored either mixed or predominantly integrated form of viral genome. Cumulative analysis of pSTAT3 expression, viral load and physical state demonstrated a direct correlation between pSTAT3 expression, viral load and physical state of HPV. The study suggests that there exists a strong clinical correlation between level of active STAT3 expression and HPV genome copy number, and integrated state of the virus that may play a pivotal role in promotion/maintanence of tumorigenic phenotype."

Animal models of brain injury afford the opportunity for controlled study of the effects of injury on functional outcomes. In this study, male and cycling female C57BL/6J mice sustained rCBI (3x) at 24-hr intervals and were tested in a context and cued fear conditioning paradigm, open field (OF), elevated zero maze and tail suspension test. All mice with rCBI showed less freezing behavior than sham control mice during the fear conditioning context test. Injured male, but not female mice also froze less in response to the auditory cue (tone). Injured mice were hyperactive in an OF environment and spent more time in the open quadrants of the elevated zero maze, suggesting decreased anxiety, but there were no differences between injured mice and sham-controls in depressive-like activity on the tail suspension test. Pathologically, injured mice showed increased astrogliosis in the injured cortex and white matter tracts (optic tracts and corpus callosum). There were no changes in the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the cortex or amygdala, but injured male mice had fewer parvalbumin-positive neurons in the hippocampus. Parvalbumin-reactive interneurons of the hippocampus have been previously demonstrated to be involved in hippocampal-cortical interactions required for memory consolidation, and it is possible memory changes in the fear-conditioning paradigm following rCBI are the result of more subtle imbalances in excitation and inhibition both within the amygdala and hippocampus, and between more widespread brain regions that are injured following a diffuse brain injury."

In most mammalian species, the CD23 residues required to form a sugar-binding site are present, although binding of CD23 to IgE does not involve sugars. Solid-phase binding competition assays, glycoprotein blotting experiments, and glycan array analysis employing the lectin-like domains of cow and mouse CD23 demonstrate that they bind to mannose, GlcNAc, glucose, and fucose and to glycoproteins that bear these sugars in nonreducing terminal positions. Crystal structures of the cow CRD in the presence of α-methyl mannoside and GlcNAcβ1–2Man reveal that a range of oligosaccharide ligands can be accommodated in an open binding site in which most interactions are with a single terminal sugar residue. Although mouse CD23 shows a pattern of monosaccharide and glycoprotein binding similar to cow CD23, the binding is weaker. In contrast, no sugar binding was observed in similar experiments with human CD23. The absence of sugar-binding activity correlates with accumulation of mutations in the gene for CD23 in the primate lineage leading to humans, resulting in loss of key sugar-binding residues. These results are consistent with a role for CD23 in many species as a receptor for potentially pathogenic microorganisms as well as IgE. However, the ability of CD23 to bind several different ligands varies between species, suggesting that it has distinct functions in different organisms.

https://openalex.org/W2971772570,"Phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) is key to both phototransduction and health of rods and cones. Proper folding of PDE6 relies on the chaperone activity of aryl hydrocarbon receptor–interacting protein–like 1 (AIPL1), and mutations in both PDE6 and AIPL1 can cause a severe form of blindness. Although AIPL1 and PDE6 are known to interact via the FK506-binding protein domain of AIPL1, the contribution of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of AIPL1 to its chaperone function is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that AIPL1–TPR interacts specifically with the regulatory Pγ subunit of PDE6. Use of NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) mapping technique revealed the interface between the C-terminal portion of Pγ and AIPL1–TPR. Our solution of the crystal structure of the AIPL1–TPR domain provided additional information, which together with the CSP data enabled us to generate a model of this interface. Biochemical analysis of chimeric AIPL1–AIP proteins supported this model and also revealed a correlation between the affinity of AIPL1–TPR for Pγ and the ability of Pγ to potentiate the chaperone activity of AIPL1. Based on these results, we present a model of the larger AIPL1–PDE6 complex. This supports the importance of simultaneous interactions of AIPL1–FK506–binding protein with the prenyl moieties of PDE6 and AIPL1–TPR with the Pγ subunit during the folding and/or assembly of PDE6. This study sheds new light on the versatility of TPR domains in protein folding by describing a novel TPR-protein binding partner, Pγ, and revealing that this subunit imparts AIPL1 selectivity for its client."

Reduction of the ascorbate breakdown product 2-keto-l-gulonic acid to l-idonic acid constitutes a critical step in this l-tartaric acid biosynthetic pathway. However, the underlying enzymatic mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we identified a V. vinifera aldo-keto reductase, Vv2KGR, with 2-keto-l-gulonic acid reductase activity. Vv2KGR belongs to the d-isomer–specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase superfamily and displayed the highest similarity to the hydroxyl pyruvate reductase isoform 2 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Enzymatic analyses revealed that Vv2KGR efficiently reduces 2-keto-l-gulonic acid to l-idonic acid and uses NADPH as preferred coenzyme. Moreover, Vv2KGR exhibited broad substrate specificity toward glyoxylate, pyruvate, and hydroxypyruvate, having the highest catalytic efficiency for glyoxylate. We further determined the X-ray crystal structure of Vv2KGR at 1.58 Å resolution. Comparison of the Vv2KGR structure with those of d-isomer–specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases from animals and microorganisms revealed several unique structural features of this plant hydroxyl pyruvate reductase. Substrate structural analysis indicated that Vv2KGR uses two modes (A and B) to bind different substrates. 2-Keto-l-gulonic acid displayed the lowest predicted free-energy binding to Vv2KGR among all docked substrates.

The initial shock to her supporters turned into despair for most, but not everyone was affected equally. We draw from the literature on political activism, identity, and self-other overlap in predicting that not all Clinton voters would be equivalently crushed by her loss. Specifically, we hypothesize that pre-election measures of political activism, and level of self-other identification between participants and Clinton–that is, how much a person was “with her”–will interact to predict the level of distress of Clinton voters two months later. Longitudinal data support our hypothesis. Notably, among Clinton voters, greater activism negatively predicted depressive symptoms, and positively predicted sleep quality, but only when participants were highly identified with Clinton. We discuss the implications of the results for theory and research on social action and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W2971854575,"The eastern foot of Helan mountain is a famous production area of high-end wine grapes in China. Excessive application of NPK fertilizer induced deficiency in trace elements, such as calcium, and seriously affected the properties of wine grapes. A vineyard in the eastern foot of Helan mountain was selected to investigate the influence of five different concentration treatments of 15 (T1), 30 (T2), 45 (T3), 60 (T4), and 75 (T5) kg·ha-1 of water-soluble calcium fertilizer (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O) application on grape calcium content, yield and fruit properties. The application of calcium fertilizer significantly increased the calcium content in leaves but reduced that in stems and fruits. The highest grape production of 6560.83 kg·ha-1 was achieved at T5 calcium fertilizer application, corresponding to increase of 30.92% than that for the control (CK, normal fertilization) treatment. The minimum titratable acid of 4.63 g·L-1 in grapes was detected at T2 calcium fertilizer application, which was 16.38% lower than CK, however, 13.40% increase in sugar-to-acid ratio was observed at T2. At 45 kg·ha-1 calcium fertilizer concentration, the anthocyanins content was 6.47 mg·L-1, indicating an increase of 53.23% than CK. This study showed that the optimal calcium fertilizer concentration was 30 kg·ha-1 with the lowest °Brix, titratable acidity, anthocyanins, the highest total phenols, reducing sugar, sugar-to-acid ratio, and an acceptable concentration of the soluble sugar and tannins."
https://openalex.org/W2971915868,"Radiomics studies require large patient cohorts, which often include patients imaged using different imaging protocols. We aimed to determine the impact of variability in imaging protocol parameters and interscanner variability using a phantom that produced feature values similar to those of patients. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans of a Hoffman brain phantom were acquired on GE Discovery 710, Siemens mCT, and Philips Vereos scanners. A standard-protocol scan was acquired on each machine, and then each parameter that could be changed was altered individually. The phantom was contoured with 10 regions of interest (ROIs). Values for 45 features with 2 different preprocessing techniques were extracted for each image. To determine the impact of each parameter on the reliability of each radiomics feature, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated with the ROIs as the subjects and the parameter values as the raters. For interscanner comparisons, we compared the standard deviation of each radiomics feature value from the standard-protocol images to the standard deviation of the same radiomics feature from PET scans of 224 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. When the pixel size was resampled prior to feature extraction, all features had good reliability (ICC > 0.75) for the field of view and matrix size. The time per bed position had excellent reliability (ICC > 0.9) on all features. When the filter cutoff was restricted to values below 6 mm, all features had good reliability. Similarly, when subsets and iterations were restricted to reasonable values used in clinics, almost all features had good reliability. The average ratio of the standard deviation of features on the phantom scans to that of the NSCLC patient scans was 0.73 using fixed-bin-width preprocessing and 0.92 using 64-level preprocessing. Most radiomics feature values had at least good reliability when imaging protocol parameters were within clinically used ranges. However, interscanner variability was about equal to interpatient variability; therefore, caution must be used when combining patients scanned on equipment from different vendors in radiomics data sets."
https://openalex.org/W2972063511,"Background In response to a physician shortage in Ethiopia, the number of medical students admitted to public universities was rapidly increased through a “flooding” policy. Objectives To assess medical student perceptions on the impact of the “flooding” policy on medical education and e-learning initiatives, as well as plans for future emigration. Design A cross-sectional survey of medical students at AAU was implemented in 2014. Attitude and practice items were assessed using a Likert scale. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify characteristics associated with an interest in future emigration. Results 673 (99.6%) of 676 students approached completed the survey, representing 39.5% of all 1705 medical students enrolled at AAU in 2014. Most students felt the “flooding” policy had a negative impact on their medical education and >90% felt there was not adequate infrastructure to support the increased student body. E-learning activities to accommodate increased class size included distribution of electronic tablets, but at the time of the survey only 34.8% of students still had a working tablet and 82.3% reported problems with internet connectivity. Most preclinical students (85.1%) who had attended live-streamed lectures preferred traditional classroom lectures. Half of the students (49.5%) intended to practice medicine in Ethiopia. Independent risk factors for planning to emigrate included age <21 years (aOR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.04, 1.97); having applied to medical school for reasons other than “wanting to be a physician” (aOR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.14, 2.20), and not believing that “flooding” policy would increase the number of physicians working in Ethiopia (aOR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.33, 2.58). Conclusions The “flooding” policy lead to significant educational challenges that were not fully alleviated by e-learning initiatives. Concomitant increases in resources for infrastructure development and faculty expansion are needed to maintain quality medical education. Additional research is needed on factors that influence medical graduates decision to emigrate."
https://openalex.org/W2972195186,"Androdioecy is one of the rarest sexual systems among plants, characterized by males co-occurring with hermaphrodites. Osmanthus delavayi (Oleaceae), an ornamental shrub from southern China, is known to have both male and hermaphrodite individuals, but little is known regarding the breeding system of this species and whether it is functionally androdioecious, and how this potentially evolved. In this study, we explore the characteristics of the breeding system of O. delavayi through the study of phenology, sex ratio, floral organ morphology, pollen number, stigma receptivity, artificial pollination, pollinators, and gene flow within and between populations, while also discussing the evolution and maintenance of androdioecy within the genus. The proportion of males was less than 0.5 and the out-crossing index (OCI) was 5. Morphological androdioecy was observed, with hermaphrodite flowers having fertile pistils, while male flowers had degenerated pistils. Males and hermaphrodites both had large amounts of small and fertile pollen grains, although the pollen number of males was ca. 1.21 × more than that of hermaphrodites, and pollen was generally smaller. Self-pollination was found to produce a much lower fruit set than outcrossing under natural conditions. Gene flow between males and hermaphrodites within a population was greater (1.007) than that between populations (0.753). All these results indicate that O. delavayi is functionally androdioecious, which may be an intermediate state in the evolutionary transition from hermaphroditism to dioecy."
https://openalex.org/W2971633762,"Social capital has long been associated with opportunities of access to valuable resources that individuals, groups, communities, and places can extract from the social structure emerging from their interactions. Despite the overall consensus on the structural signature of social capital, there is still controversy over the relative benefits associated with different types of social structure. In this article, we advocate a two-faceted perspective on social capital, regarded as value originating from both closed (rich in third-party relationships) and open (rich in brokerage opportunities) bridging structures. We uncover these structures from place-centric networks and investigate their association with key socio-economic indicators. To this end, we draw on aggregated mobile phone usage data, and construct the place-centric communication and mobility networks in the city of Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire. We begin by defining appropriate network metrics to capture the interplay between bonding and bridging social structures in each of the 10 districts (communes) in Abidjan. We then examine the correlation between these metrics and a number of district-level socio-economic indicators related to economic prosperity, wealth, security and democratic participation. Our findings suggest that both closed and open structures can serve as wellsprings of social capital: while closed bonding structures are associated with higher economic prosperity, open bridging structures are associated with increased democratic participation and security. By uncovering sources of social capital from communication and mobility place-centric networks in a developing country, our work contributes to a better understanding of how these networks could be used to enhance and sustain socio-economic growth and prosperity, and ultimately paves the way towards a broader comparative study of social capital in developed and developing countries."

Polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG) phosphate is the main ingredient of the HDs found to be associated with lung disease. However, the association of HDs with other interstitial lung disease including idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) is not clear. We examined the relationship between HD exposure and IIP in a family-based study.This case-control study included 244 IIP cases and 244 family controls who lived with the IIP patients. The IIP cases were divided into two groups, HDLI and other IIP, and were matched to family controls based on age and gender. Information on exposure to HDs was obtained from a structured questionnaire and field investigations. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), investigating the association of HD-related exposure characteristics with IIP risk.The risks of IIP increased two-fold or more in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of several HD use characteristics, including average total use hours per day, cumulative sleep hours, use of HD during sleep, and cumulative exposure level. In analyses separated by HDLI and other IIP, the risks of HDLI were associated with airborne HD concentrations (adjusted OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.34-6.76; Q4 versus Q1) and cumulative exposure level (adjusted OR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.59-8.01; Q4 versus Q1), but this relationship was not significant in the patients with other IIP.

https://openalex.org/W2971788876,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease characterized by the pathological remodeling of air sacs as a result of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, but the mechanism governing the robust protein expression is poorly understood. Our recent findings demonstrate that alternative polyadenylation (APA) caused by NUDT21 reduction is important for the increased expression of fibrotic mediators and ECM proteins in lung fibroblasts by shortening the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of mRNAs and stabilizing their transcripts, therefore activating pathological signaling pathways. Despite the importance of NUDT21 reduction in the regulation of fibrosis, the underlying mechanisms for the depletion are unknown. We demonstrate here that NUDT21 is depleted by TGFβ1. We found that miR203, which is increased in IPF, was induced by TGFβ1 to target the NUDT21 3′-UTR, thus depleting NUDT21 in human and mouse lung fibroblasts. TGFβ1-mediated NUDT21 reduction was attenuated by the miR203 inhibitor antagomiR203 in fibroblasts. TGFβ1 transgenic mice revealed that TGFβ1 down-regulates NUDT21 in fibroblasts in vivo. Furthermore, TGFβ1 promoted differential APA of fibrotic genes, including FGF14, RICTOR, TMOD2, and UCP5, in association with increased protein expression. This unique differential APA signature was also observed in IPF fibroblasts. Altogether, our results identified TGFβ1 as an APA regulator through NUDT21 depletion amplifying pulmonary fibrosis."

The purpose of this study was to apply extremely low repetition rate electromagnetic fields (ELEFs) to change the molecular network of water molecules existing in freezing media used for human sperm cryopreservation. First, different time periods and pulsed electromagnetic fields were used to evaluate the physiochemical properties of water. The lowest rate of cluster size, surface tension, viscosity, and density was observed for water samples exposed to 1000 Hz ELEF for 60 min (P < 0.05) that could be results in small ice crystal formation. Therefore, this treatment was selected for further evaluations in human sperm freezing because there was minimal probability of amorphous ice crystallization in this group. To assess fertilizing potential, human semen samples were subjected to ELEF (1000 Hz) water-made freezing medium and cryopreserved. The highest percentage of total motility, progressive motility, viability, membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA integrity, and TAC were obtained in frozen ELEF as compared to other groups. The percentage of viable spermatozoa (Annexin V-/PI-) in frozen ELEF was significantly higher than in frozen control. The level of ROS was significantly lower in frozen ELEF when compared to frozen control. It can be concluded that the modification of physicochemical properties of water existing in cryopreservation media by ELEF is a suitable strategy to improve the outcome of cryopreservation."

To measure language ability, behaviour and mental health, adolescents aged 13 (n = 200) were assessed using the Riddles subtest of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children Version 2, the parent report Child Behaviour Checklist, and the self-report Moods and Feelings Questionnaire and the Self-Esteem Questionnaire. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to determine associations between language skills, self-esteem and mental health in this group of adolescents. Poor language ability was related to a range of concurrent adverse difficulties, such as attention deficits, self-esteem problems, social withdrawal, and depressive symptoms. Increased levels of language ability were related to better psychosocial profiles. In some cases, only individuals with a low level of language (bottom 10% of sample) were at increased risk of maladaptive outcomes. This study replicates the well-established relationship between language ability and poorer mental health found within high income countries in an upper middle-income country setting. Locally accessible support for children with reduced language ability is required, given the longer-term consequences of poorer mental health."

The M domain communicates with the catalytic domain via a conserved ∼20-residue linker, essential for lipid activation of CCT. Previous analysis of this region (denoted as the αEC/J) using MD simulations, cross-linking, mutagenesis, and solvent accessibility suggested that membrane binding of domain M promotes remodeling of the αEC/J into a more compact structure that is required for enzyme activation. Here, using tryptophan fluorescence quenching, we show that the allosteric linker lies superficially on the membrane surface. Analyses with truncated CCTs show that the αEC/J can interact with lipids independently of the M domain. We observed strong FRET between engineered tryptophans in the αEC/J and vesicles containing dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine that depended on the native J sequence. These data are incompatible with the extended conformation of the αE helix observed in the previously determined crystal structure of inactive CCT but support a bent αE helix conformation stabilized by J segment interactions. Our results suggest that the membrane-adsorbed, folded allosteric linker may partially cover the active site cleft and pull it close to the membrane surface, where cytidyl transfer can occur efficiently in a relatively anhydrous environment.

Allosteric linkers propagate signals between effector-binding regulatory domains and functional domains of proteins by modulating their conformation and dynamics. Allosteric linkers generally possess conserved sequences that encode favored folding pathways that are triggered by effector binding events in the regulatory domain (1Ma B. Tsai C.J. Haliloğlu T.

CCT is an intriguing enzyme of phosphatidylcholine metabolism that is regulated allosterically by membrane binding. In effect, its “ligand” is a membrane surface, and not just any membrane. In vitro CCT binds preferentially to membranes that are relatively depleted in PC by recognition of lipid-packing defects and higher negative charge that are features of PC-depleted membrane surfaces (6Cornell R.B.

The CCT membrane-binding M domain folds into a long amphipathic helix on such surfaces and creates a stable association (Fig. 1).

Bridging the C and M domains is an allosteric linker we refer to as the αEC/J (residues 216–234, mammalian numbering; Fig. 1) that is highly conserved across phyla (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G.

Cross-linking studies suggested that the activity relies on the malleability of the αE (14Ramezanpour M. Lee J. Taneva S.G. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B.

The modular nature is evident in the different conformations adopted in solved crystal structures of this homodimeric enzyme. In the inactive soluble form (CCTsol), the αE is a 22-residue unbroken helix extending from the active site and is constrained by formation of a four-helix complex consisting of two αE and two auto-inhibitory (AI) helices contributed from the M domain. The J segment is not visible in this structure, suggesting disorder. In the structure of the truncated CCT-236 that lacks domain M (and the AI) but includes the allosteric linker, only the N-terminal 14 or 15 residues of the two αE helices (αEN (Thr-202 to Asp-212) and αE hinge (Tyr-213 to Val-215) are resolved, whereas neither the αEC (Tyr-216 to Arg-223) nor J segment (Tyr-225 to Phe-234) are visible, suggesting that they are both disordered. Although no electron density was obtained for the J segment in these high-resolution structures, the electron density for a low-resolution (8 Å) crystal of a CCT tetramer (PDB code 4MVD) defined the residues comprising the αEC/J as helical. In two of the four chains, the αEC and J segment were linked by a sharp ∼75° turn at 223RGY225 (15Lee J. Taneva S.G. Holland B.W. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B.

These data suggest a helical preference for the αE and J segment that is interrupted by hinges in the middle of the αE (αE hinge) and between the αEC and J segment. But acquisition of stable helix structure may require a template upon which to fold. Recent molecular dynamics simulations also revealed the plasticity of the αE hinge. In the simulations of CCT-236, residues of the αEC and J segment showed a high degree of malleability and divergence from the starting structure (15Lee J. Taneva S.G. Holland B.W. Tieleman D.P.

In simulations of residues 40–223 missing the J segment and M domain, the αEC was externally restrained to remain helical, but the rest of the αE was unrestrained. The αEN pair retained helical structure and interhelical contacts throughout the 1-μs simulations, but the hinge at residues 212–215 sampled many conformations (14Ramezanpour M. Lee J. Taneva S.G. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B. An auto-inhibitory helix in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase hijacks the catalytic residue and constrains a pliable, domain-bridging helix pair.J. Biol.

The most long-lived conformers (up to 700 ns) displayed a prolonged sharp bend at the hinge that brought the C terminus of the αEC proximal to the active site and loop L2. The bent αE helix conformations showcased a new interdomain aromatic cluster involving two tyrosines within or proximal to the αE hinge and a phenylalanine in loop L2 of the active site. In vitro support for αE malleability as essential to drive CCT activation was provided by “straight-jacketing” the αE helices with chemical cross-links (14Ramezanpour M. Lee J. Taneva S.G. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B. An auto-inhibitory helix in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase hijacks the catalytic residue and constrains a pliable, domain-bridging helix pair.J. Biol.

When the helices were constrained from bending, activation of the membrane-bound enzyme (CCTmem) was impaired. The activity-promoting impact of mutations in the αE hinge that destabilize interactions between the αE helix pair underscored the importance of helix αE malleability (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: XXXXX-XXXXX10.1074/jbc.RA119.009849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The solvent accessibility of residues in the αE hinge in CCTmem was consistent with a hinge that exists within a folded ensemble (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: XXXXX-XXXXX10.1074/jbc.RA119.009849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The working hypothesis is that the membrane-triggered displacement of the AI helices frees the αEC to sample other conformations, including ones more productive for catalysis. Based on the conserved and amphipathic nature of the αEC/J segment and its proximity to domain M, we further hypothesize that the fully active conformation of this sequence includes an association with membranes as a compact, folded unit. Such an association could stabilize a rearrangement of the αE helices that would dock the catalytic domain close to the membrane surface. In the present work, we show that the αEC and J segment interact with the membrane surface in CCTmem, and both can do so independently of the adjacent M domain. FRET analysis between Trp donor sites in CCT and a lipid acceptor shows that the active site is pulled closer to the membrane surface than would be predicted in a model with the αE helices fully extended. These data provide evidence for a compact structure of the αE and J segment that together comprise an allosteric linker whose conformational ensemble is constrained and directed by membrane association. Last, we address how catalysis could be enhanced by drawing the active site close to the membrane surface. As there is no solved structure of lipid-bound CCT, the orientation of the αEC/J relative to the membrane surface is not known. To assess whether sites in this segment interact with the membrane surface, we explored the fluorescence quenching of engineered tryptophans by vesicles containing Br-PC. The preparation and analysis of the impact of many of the αE/J-engineered Trps on CCT activity and thermal stability were presented in the companion paper (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: XXXXX-XXXXX10.1074/jbc.RA119.009849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In addition, we analyzed single Trps engineered into the catalytic domain at F121W and F124W that were characterized previously (14Ramezanpour M. Lee J. Taneva S.G. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B. An auto-inhibitory helix in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase hijacks the catalytic residue and constrains a pliable, domain-bridging helix pair.J. Biol.

The Trp substitutions did not affect the stability of the catalytic domain fold (Table S1). The Trps engineered into αE/J did not impair the interaction of the M domain with membrane vesicles. All active αE/J Trp variants had approximately the same affinity as the WT CCT for the highly curved vesicles used in the fluorescence experiments (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol.

We probed Trp quenching by PCs brominated at the 6,7-, 9,10-, or 11,12- positions of the acyl chain. Quenching by Br-PC requires van der Waals contact of the excited Trp and bromine on the acyl chain (16Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.3rd Ed. Springer, New York2006: 278-279Google Scholar). In keeping with published data using domain M peptides (17Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Membrane-binding amphipathic α-helical peptide derived from CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase.Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (8155650): 4327-433510.1021/bi00180a029Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), Trp-278 was strongly quenched by all three depths of bromine quenchers in the context of CCT-312, with the strongest impact using 9,10-Br-PC (Fig. 2). These data support a stable interaction between the vesicles and domain M. In contrast, Trp-55 at the N terminus of the catalytic domain was not significantly quenched by any Br-PC vesicles. Trp-151 near the active site was also not quenched. These results provide evidence that Br-PC quenching monitors the persistence of Trp residue–membrane interactions and that random collision with vesicles does not contribute significantly to quenching. Trps at the N terminus (Trp-225), middle (Trp-230), and C terminus (Trp-234) of the J segment were moderately quenched by Br-PC, most prominently at the shallower 6,7- and 9,10-positions (Fig. 2). Interestingly, Trp-216 and Trp-221 were weakly quenched, despite their location in the αEC. Even more surprisingly, Trp-124 in loop L2 of the catalytic domain was quenched beyond background levels by the Br-PC. These data suggest that the conformational ensemble for CCTmem includes a population where the allosteric linker situates superficially at the membrane surface and where Phe-124 in loop L2 makes transient excursions toward the membrane surface. The Trps in the αEC/J remain accessible to acrylamide, except for the Trp at residue 216, near the αE hinge, which is buried in CCTmem (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: XXXXX-XXXXX10.1074/jbc.RA119.009849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We attempted to interrupt the membrane interaction of the allosteric linker by mutation to probe whether this association is required for signaling from the bound M domain to the active site. We tested the effects of three mutants on quenching by Br-PC: 3Φ (L230A/V232A/F234A) to reduce the hydrophobicity, 3R (R219Q/R223Q/K228Q) to reduce the electrostatic drive, and 3Aro (Y216A/Y225A/F234A) to eliminate the aromatic pull toward the bilayer interface (Fig. 3A). The transition temperatures for unfolding of these variants were the same as the parent CCT from which they were derived, indicating proper domain C folding (49.8 ± 0.2 °C for the four CCTs). The mutations devastated the enzyme activity (Fig. 3B), confirming the strong dependence of catalytic function on the native linker sequence (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: XXXXX-XXXXX10.1074/jbc.RA119.009849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We did not assay the activity of the triple aromatic variant, as we knew that the substitution of just one of the sites, Y216A, was strongly inactivating (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: XXXXX-XXXXX10.1074/jbc.RA119.009849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The interaction with the membrane was monitored by Br-PC quenching of either engineered Trp-225 or Trp-221. To our surprise, none of the mutations reduced the quenching of Trp-225 or Trp-221 (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that either the linker interaction with the membrane involves multiple disperse interactions that survive the loss of a few sites or that the method of Br-PC quenching of engineered Trps is not accurately reporting a binding event for the linker. The allosteric linker is in close proximity to the M domain with its known membrane-anchoring properties. Could the bound M domain and the engineered Trps be pulling the linker to the surface at the engineered site? To address this concern, we probed whether the linker has membrane-binding properties independent of the M domain and engineered Trps. CCT-236 is truncated at the boundary between the allosteric linker and domain M. It has weak constitutive activity, but we have documented that its Vmax can be elevated ∼2-fold by lipid vesicles (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: XXXXX-XXXXX10.1074/jbc.RA119.009849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). By contrast, the Vmax for full-length CCT is elevated >30-fold by lipids. In the companion paper (13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: XXXXX-XXXXX10.1074/jbc.RA119.009849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar) we showed that deletion of residues 227–232 of the J segment decreased the activity of CCT-236 both in the absence and presence of lipids, but the mutant was still activated ∼2-fold by lipids (Fig. 3B of Ref. 13Taneva S.G. Lee J. Knowles D.G. Tishyadhigama C. Chen H. Cornell R.B. Interdomain communication in the phosphatidylcholine-regulatory enzyme, CCTα, relies on a modular αE helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: XXXXX-XXXXX10.1074/jbc.RA119.009849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We examined the membrane binding of CCT-236 with a native J sequence or with the J segment deletion, using Br-PC quenching of an engineered Trp-225 at the start of the J segment. We found that Br-PC quenching of Trp-225 was even stronger in CCT-236 than in CCT-312 (Fig. 4). Trp-151 in the active site, a negative control, showed no quenching. Surprisingly, the quenching of Trp-225 in CCT-236 was not reduced by deletion of J segment residues 227–232, but was even enhanced (Fig. 4). This suggests that the J segment, although important for catalytic function, is not required for association of CCT-236 with membranes. Rather, membrane association involves alternative or additional residues (e.g. residues in the αEC). We then analyzed CCT-236 lipid association using an alternative method that does not rely on engineering tryptophans, which could impart membrane partitioning bias. We used gel filtration of CCTs containing only native Trps in the presence or absence of activating micelles (lyso-PC 16:0). These micelles activate CCT-236 and the 236 ΔJ deletion mutant as effectively as sonicated lipid vesicles (Fig. 5A). They are also effective but weaker activators of full-length CCT and CCT-312. To probe whether Superdex-200 chromatography can distinguish CCT that is free versus micelle-bound, we first examined a CCT with domain M. We used CCT-312Δ32 with a shortened domain M as it retained better solubility than the CCT-312 construct with a full-length M domain during concentration prior to gel filtration. This construct retains the AI helix but is missing the leash portion of domain M, residues 238–269. In the absence of lipid, CCT-312Δ32 eluted as two populations, one with a mass approximating a dimer, slightly larger than the albumin standard (67 kDa) and the rest as heterogeneous high-mass aggregates. In the presence of lyso-PC, the protein elution profile converted to a single homogeneous peak with a mass of ∼270 kDa, overlapping with the elution of the lipid (Fig. 5B). Whereas this construct binds to lipid micelles, it is only weakly activated by them (15Lee J. Taneva S.G. Holland B.W. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B.

In the absence of lipid, CCT-236 eluted as a single, broad peak approximating a dimer, but upon the addition of micelles, the eluted complex size increased to ∼220 kDa and co-eluted with phospholipid (Fig. 5C). The J-segment deletion mutant, CCT-236 Δ227–232, eluted as a ∼70-kDa dimer in the absence of lipids. With the introduction of micelles, the elution profile shifted to a larger size, broadened, and co-eluted with lipid, confirming that the J segment is not solely responsible for the lipid interaction (Fig. 5D). However, CCT-212, lacking all of the αEC and J segment, eluted as a 70-kDa dimer both in the absence and presence of micelles (Fig. 5E), suggesting that the αEC contributes to the lipid interaction. The mass shifts in both the protein and lipid components (Fig. 5F) argue strongly for lyso-PC complex formation with CCTs containing the αEc/J, and provide evidence that a combination of the αEC and J segment can form an independent, catalytically relevant membrane interaction. The lipid/protein molar ratios we measured in the higher mass-shifted peaks were ∼70 for CCT-236 and CCT-236ΔJ, and ∼115 for CCT-312Δ32. Using the mass shifts indicated in Fig. 5, we estimate an average of ∼2 CCT dimers bound to a single lyso-PC particle. Although the interaction shown here is with a micellar lipid particle, it demonstrates that residues in the αEC/J are lipophilic and thus would seek to embed in an accessible membrane surface. The data in support of direct lipid interactions of the αEC/J challenge the model shown in Fig. 6E with an extended structure for this region. If the αE helices bend to allow membrane interactions during the conversion from inactive to active CCT, the distance between the membrane and the catalytic domain would be shorter compared with the fully extended model. We estimate, using the solved structure of CCTsol and estimating ≥10 Å for"
https://openalex.org/W2971602440,"CTPphosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), the rate-limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, is an amphitropic enzyme that regulates PC homeostasis. Recent work has suggested that CCTα activation by binding to a PC-deficient membrane involves conformational transitions in a helix pair (αE) that, along with a short linker of unknown structure (J segment), bridges the catalytic domains of the CCTα dimer to the membrane-binding (M) domains. In the soluble, inactive form, the αE helices are constrained into unbroken helices by contacts with two auto-inhibitory (AI) helices from domain M. In the active, membrane-bound form, the AI helices are displaced and engage the membrane. Molecular dynamics simulations have suggested that AI displacement is associated with hinge-like bending in the middle of the αE, positioning its C terminus closer to the active site. Here, we show that CCTα activation by membrane binding is sensitive to mutations in the αE and J segments, especially within or proximal to the αE hinge. Substituting Tyr-213 within this hinge with smaller uncharged amino acids that could destabilize interactions between the αE helices increased both constitutive and lipid-dependent activities, supporting a link between αE helix bending and stimulation of CCT activity. The solvent accessibilities of Tyr-213 and Tyr-216 suggested that these tyrosines move to new partially buried environments upon membrane binding of CCT, consistent with a folded αE/J structure. These data suggest that signal transduction through the modular αE helix pair relies on shifts in its conformational ensemble that are controlled by the AI helices and their displacement upon membrane binding. phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), the rate-limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, is an amphitropic enzyme that regulates PC homeostasis.

The lipid composition of cell membranes must be regulated to maintain fluidity, elasticity, curvature, surface charge, impermeability, and the optimal function of both integral and peripheral membrane proteins that depend on these physical properties.

CCTα is the dominant isoform, and CCTβ is tissue-restricted. Whereas their disordered termini are divergent, their catalytic and membrane-binding domains are >98% similar within a species (1Cornell R.B. Ridgway N.D.

It is activated by translocation to membrane sites that have reduced PC content, according to the prevailing theory. When unbound to membranes in vitro, the CCT catalytic efficiency is reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude by effects on both kcat and the Km for CTP (2Ding Z. Taneva S.G. Huang H.K.

It is the physical properties of the PC-depleted membrane that attract CCT, properties such as high surface charge and packing voids that accompany a bilayer relatively enriched in acidic and/or nonbilayer-forming lipids (4Cornell R.B.

Once CCT is membrane-bound and activated, PC production will ramp up and the membrane PC content will be restored, with ensuing release of CCT.

The question we are trying to solve is: How does membrane binding activate this enzyme? CCTs are homodimers with each monomer composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain (domain C) and a C-terminal regulatory domain. The latter contains a membrane-binding domain (M) of ∼70 amino acids and a C-terminal phosphorylation region (P) of ∼50 amino acids. The M domain of CCT has two conformations. Engagement with membranes is accompanied by the folding of >60 residues into a long amphipathic helix (Fig. 1A), which binds via a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (10Arnold R.S.

When unbound to membranes, this domain is composed of an auto-inhibitory (AI) helix (residues 272–293) tethered to the catalytic domain via a disordered “leash” (residues ∼236–271) (2Ding Z.

In the crystal structure of an inactive CCT dimer containing the complete catalytic domain and the M domain with a shortened leash, each AI helix docks onto the αE helix pair that extends from the base of the active site (Fig. 1B) (15Lee J.

The two αE helices and two AI helices form a stable four-helix complex that positions the C termini of the AI helices in backbone-to-backbone contact with loop L2 in the active site (Fig. 1B).

We recently explored potential mechanisms for catalytic silencing by the AI helix. MD simulations of the CCT dimer with and without the AI helices revealed that docking of the AI helices increased the frequency of an electrostatic trap for Lys-122 that captures its amino group, pre-empting contacts with substrates. The AI helices also constrained the dynamics of the αE helices (18Ramezanpour M. Lee J. Taneva S.G. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B.

But upon removal of the AI helices in silico, the dynamics of the αE helices was dramatically increased. The binding of CCT to membrane vesicles in vitro, which displaces the two AI helices, was linked to an increase in the distance between the two αE helices, monitored by cross-linking at a site in the middle of the αE helix. When remodeling of the αE helices was prevented by a constraining disulfide bond, the enzyme, although membrane-bound, was not activated (18Ramezanpour M. Lee J. Taneva S.G. Tieleman D.P.

These findings suggest that reorganization of the αE helix pair accompanies membrane binding and is required for full activation of CCT. However, in the absence of a solved structure of membrane-bound CCT, the precise conformation and mechanism of modulation of the αE helices during activation remain unknown. All eukaryotic CCTs explored thus far are lipid-regulated, including CCTs from unicellular S. cerevisiae and P. falciparum. These CCTs have a highly conserved sequence corresponding to the 22-residue αE helix seen in the solved mammalian CCT structure obtained from crystals grown in the absence of lipid (PDB code 4MVC). The αE is followed by a turn at Gly-224. This turn was visible in the low-resolution structure of CCT-312 (15Lee J. Taneva S.G. Holland B.W. Tieleman D.P. Cornell R.B. Structural basis for autoinhibition of CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), the regulatory enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis, by its membrane-binding amphipathic helix.J. Biol.

The turn is followed by a structurally unresolved, conserved 10-residue linker to domain M that we refer to as the J (joining) segment (Figure 1, Figure 2). In contrast, nonlipid regulated cytidylyltransferases, such as the CTs that use glycerol phosphate or ethanolamine phosphate as cytidyl acceptors (GCT and ECT) have short αE helices that terminate at or before the residue corresponding to Val-210 (Figs. 1E and 2). The differences between regulated and constitutive CTs suggest that the αE and J sequence are conserved in CCTs for an important function, such as transducing the membrane-binding event to the activation of the catalytic domain. We refer to the N-terminal αE segment in CCTs (residues 202–211) that resembles the GCT and ECT αE sequences as the αEN and consider the αEN to be part of the catalytic domain fold, as it contains residues that contribute to the active site (19Lee J.

Within the CCT αE hinge and αEC, two tyrosines (Tyr-213 and Tyr-216; mammalian numbering), two arginines (Arg-219 and Arg-223), and a glycine (Gly-224) appear to be universal. The J segment (residues 225–234) is less strictly conserved, but the sequence conservation is much higher than the M domain. The previously reported simulations showed that without the constraining AI helices, the two αE helices bent at the predicted break in each of the 10 replicates, and in six of them, the bending led to a new stable conformation featuring splayed helices, each contacting the L2 loops at the base of the active sites, in trans (18Ramezanpour M.

We hypothesize that a similar conformational change in the αE helices may occur upon membrane engagement via the M domain and that this is required for activation. In this work, we explored this hypothesis by (i) examining the impacts of mutations at conserved sites in the αE on lipid activation and (ii) probing the environment of conserved tyrosines and engineered tryptophans within the αE hinge, αEC, and J segment in various CCT forms: the soluble form (CCTsol), the membrane-bound form (CCTmem), and a fragment encompassing the catalytic domain and allosteric linker (CCT-236). The catalytic domain and the M and P regions have been extensively probed via mutagenesis. However, the αE and J segments, which constitute the only physical pathway between the membrane-bound M domain and the active site, have never been explored to determine the contribution of conserved sites to catalysis or regulation of catalysis by lipids. The kcat/Km(CTP) value measured for CCT when membrane-bound (9800 s−1 m−1; Fig. 3A) is similar to that obtained for the constitutively active GCT (13,500 s−1 m−1) (20Park Y.S. Gee P. Sanker S.

We queried whether a similarly truncated CCT would be constitutively active. However, when we truncated CCT at residue 212 to create a short αE helix like GCT, the enzyme activity was completely obliterated (Fig. 3, A and B). The transition temperature for unfolding (Tm) for CCT-212, as monitored by Sypro Orange fluorescence, was reduced 10 °C, from 55 °C (full-length) to 45 °C (CCT-212) (Table 1). These data suggest a requirement for some or all of the C-terminal region for CCT catalytic function and catalytic domain stability.Table 1Tm for CCT variantsCCT parentSite mutationLocation of mutationTmn367 untaggedNone55 ± 0.12His-212None45 ± 12His-236None54 ± 13236 untaggedNone53.51His-236Y213FαE hinge51.0 ± 0.12His-236Y213TαE hinge46.9 ± 0.12His-236Y213GαE hinge47.5 ± 0.52His-236Y213AαE hinge50.5 ± 0.52His-236Δ227–232J segment51.9 ± 0.12His-312None57 ± 12His-312Y213AαE hinge49.7 ± 1.22312-His ΔNLSNone55.51312-His ΔNLSW151FActive site56.0 ± 0.73312-His ΔNLS, W151FΔ227–232J segment57 ± 12312-His ΔNLS, W151F227GGGSGG232J segment57.8 ± 0.252312-His ΔNLSW278FAI helix501312-His ΔNLS, W151F, W278FY216WαEc helix511312-His ΔNLS, W151F, W278FL221WaEc helix501312-His ΔNLS, W151F, W278FL230WJ segment50.51312-His ΔNLS, W151F, W278FV232WJ segment501 Open table in a new tab In the absence of membranes the C-terminal region is inhibitory (2Ding Z.

How much of the enzyme C-terminal to domain C contributes to the activation of catalysis in CCTmem? Analysis of CCTs progressively truncated from the C terminus showed that deletion of the P region has little impact on activity (Fig. 3A), as noted previously (26Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J.

But the activity was progressively compromised with increasing truncation of the M domain, especially with loss of the hydrophobic AI helix between residues 272 and 295 (Fig. 3A), that contributes strongly to the membrane-binding free energy (2Ding Z.

These decreases are due to impacts on both the kcat and the Km for CTP (Fig. S1). Whereas CCT-212 had no measurable activity, ∼5% of WT catalytic function is retained with a truncation at the start of domain M (CCT-236; Fig. 3A). The truncation at residue 236 did not destabilize the catalytic domain fold, as the Tm for unfolding was equivalent to the full-length enzyme (Table 1). The 10 °C Tm depression measured for CCT-212 indicates that the catalytic domain is adequately stabilized by the αEC and J segment. The partial constitutive activity of CCT-236 makes sense as it lacks the AI motif. But the low activity of CCT-236 compared with the full-length enzyme in its membrane-bound form also argues that full activation requires domain M to be present and engaged with the membrane. Following the turn at Gly-224, the J segment comprises 10 conserved amino acids linking the αEC to the start of domain M. To assess the importance of this sequence to CCT activity, we substituted a glycine-rich J segment, replacing residues 227–232 with GGGSGG, or we simply deleted residues 227–232. Neither of these constructs affected the association of domain M with membrane vesicles as monitored by a lipid fluorescence quenching assay (Fig. S2); nor did they affect the unfolding transition temperature (Table 1). However, both were completely devastating to enzyme Vmax assayed with or without lipid (Fig. 3B). The loss of all activity accompanying the deletion of the J segment is consistent with total inactivation upon truncation at residue 228 (26Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Functions of the C-terminal domain of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase: effects of C-terminal deletions on enzyme activity, intracellular localization and phosphorylation potential.Biochem. J. 1995; 310 (7654214): 699-70810.1042/bj3100699Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Deletion of the 6 residues from the J segment had a milder impact on the activity of CCT-236, lowering it 3-fold (Fig. 3B). Thus, both the αEC and the J segment improve the catalytic function of a CCT missing domain M and are essential for any activity in CCTs with domain M. These data argue that the J segment functions as more than a simple tether between domains. We analyzed the impact on activity of site-specific mutations at the conserved polar residues in the αE hinge and αEC segments in the context of CCT-312. This construct contains all of the catalytic and M domains, missing only the P region. This truncation has no negative impact on binding to anionic membrane vesicles in vitro (15Lee J. Taneva S.G.

https://openalex.org/W2971856140,"Climate change is amongst the main threats to biodiversity. Considering extant mammals endured Quaternary climate change, we analyzed the extent to which this past change predicts current mammals’ extinction risk at global and biogeographical scales. We accessed range dynamics by modeling the potential distribution of all extant terrestrial mammals in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago) and in current climate conditions and used extinction risk from IUCN red list. We built General Linear Mixed-Effects Models to test the magnitude with which the variation in geographic range (ΔRange) and a proxy for abundance (ΔSuitability) between the LGM and present-day predicts current mammal’s extinction risk. We found past climate change most strongly reduced the geographical range and climatic suitability of threatened rather than non-threatened mammals. Quaternary range contractions and reduced suitability explain around 40% of species extinction risk, particularly for small-bodied mammals. At global and biogeographical scales, all groups that suffered significant Quaternary range contractions now contain a greater proportion of threatened species when compared to groups whose ranges did not significantly contract. This reinforces the importance of using historical range contractions as a key predictor of extinction risk for species in the present and future climate change scenarios and supports current efforts to fight climate change for biodiversity conservation."

The aim of this study was to identify the final set of items that can be included in a patient-reported outcome measure to assess recovery of patients following percutaneous coronary interventions.A consecutive sample of 200 patients registered in the Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry participated in a telephone survey 30 days following their percutaneous cardiac procedure. Rasch analysis was used to select the best set of items to form a concise and psychometrically sound patient-reported outcome measure. Key measurement properties assessed included overall fit to the Rasch measurement model, unidimensionality, response formats (thresholds), targeting, internal consistency and measurement invariance.Five items were identified as being reliable and valid measures of patient-reported outcomes: pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, confidence in performing usual activities, feeling unhappy and having trouble sleeping. Data showed overall fit to a Rasch model of expected item functioning (χ2 16.99; p = 0.07) and all items demonstrated unidimensionality (t-test less than 0.05 threshold value). Internal consistency was acceptable (equivalent Cronbach's α 0.65) given there are only five items, but there was a ceiling effect (mean logit score -1.24) with compromised score precision for patients with better recovery.We identified a succinct set of items that can be used in a patient-reported outcome measure following percutaneous coronary interventions. This patient-report outcome measure has good structural validity and acceptable internal consistency. While further psychometric evaluations are recommended, the items identified capture the patient's perspective of their recovery following a percutaneous coronary intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2971439140,"The interaction between phenotypic plasticity, e.g. learning, and evolution is an important topic both in Evolutionary Biology and Machine Learning. The evolution of learning is commonly studied in Evolutionary Biology, while the use of an evolutionary process to improve learning is of interest to the field of Machine Learning. This paper takes a different point of view by studying the effect of learning on the evolutionary process, the so-called Baldwin effect. A well-studied result in the literature about the Baldwin effect is that learning affects the speed of convergence of the evolutionary process towards some genetic configuration, which corresponds to the environment-induced plastic response. This paper demonstrates that learning can change the outcome of evolution, i.e., lead to a genetic configuration that does not correspond to the plastic response. Results are obtained both analytically and experimentally by means of an agent-based model of a foraging task, in an environment where the distribution of resources follows seasonal cycles and the foraging success on different resource types is conditioned by trade-offs that can be evolved and learned. This paper attempts to answer a question that has been overlooked: whether learning has an effect on what genotypic traits are evolved, i.e. the selection of a trait that enables a plastic response changes the selection pressure on a different trait, in what could be described as co-evolution between different traits in the same genome."
https://openalex.org/W2971551285,"This study investigated the perceptions of Chinese physical therapy students on use of the Health Improvement Card (HIC) as a clinical tool to assess lifestyle and prescribe health education to others. The biometrics and health indices/attributes/lifestyles of these students were also evaluated with self-administration of the HIC. After a tutorial on the HIC and its clinical application, physical therapy students (n = 82) from two Chinese universities, completed the Chinese translation of the HIC followed by a questionnaire on students' perceptions of it. Second, they invited a friend/relative to complete the HIC. Then, they provided feedback on the HIC's strengths and challenges related to its administration. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and content thematic analysis. Response rate of self-completed HICs was 100% (n = 82) and that of questionnaires was 99% (n = 81). Participants' age range was 20-34 years; mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.9±5.4 for men and 20.5±2.6 kg/m2 for women. Generally, participants had low-risk BMIs (82%) and blood pressures (BPs) (91%), moderate-risk dietary habits (90%), but fewer had low-risk exercise habits (41%). Of 81 friends/relatives who participated, 25% had high-risk exercise habits. Student participants concurred the HIC is useful in developing lifestyle education programs. Challenges included uncertainty about obtaining laboratory data, serving-size quantities and confidence to effect lifestyle change in others. Although students appeared receptive to assessing health and lifestyle behaviors using the HIC, they reported being unconfident to prescribe long-term effective lifestyle advice. We recommend introducing the HIC in physical therapy curricula as an effective way of sensitizing emerging physical therapists to their responsibility to assess health/attributes/lifestyle non-communicable diseases (NCDs) risk factors. Prescribing lifestyle education/counselling warrants greater curricular focus. Further research will establish how HIC data and information can be effectively used as a clinical assessment and education tool to target health and lifestyle, and track behavior change over time."
https://openalex.org/W2971376271,"Explants of embryonic chick sympathetic and sensory ganglia were found to exhibit asymmetric radial outgrowth of neurites under standard culture conditions with or without exogenous Nerve Growth Factor [NGF]. Opposing sides of an explant exhibited: a) differences in neurite length and, b) differences in neurite morphology. Strikingly, this asymmetry exhibited co-orientation among segregated, neighboring explants. The underlying mechanism(s) of the asymmetry and its co-orientation are not known but appear to depend on cell clustering because dissociated sympathetic neurons do not exhibit co-orientation whereas re-aggregated clusters of cells do. This emergent behavior may be similar to the community effect described in other cell types. If a similar phenomenon exists in the embryo, or in maturity, it may contribute to the establishment of proper orientation of neurite outgrowth during development and/or injury-induced neuronal plasticity."

Called Sac Balam, or the white jaguar, it was founded more than 400 years ago by Lacandon Maya, one of several Indigenous groups in southern Mexico and Central America who resisted Spanish colonial rule for centuries. Until 1695, that is, when Spanish finally found city. Less than 20 years later, they forcibly relocated its inhabitants and abandoned place once and for all. It faded off colonial maps and back into forest. If found, Sac Balam could offer archaeologists an unparalleled time capsule of Lacandon culture, showing how they preserved their independence as world changed around them."
