 biological processes. From the late 1950s on, he devoted most of his research efforts to the pursuit of the ideas outlined
 here."
https://openalex.org/W2082937921,Studies on the coast of Baja California show that oceanic zooplankters carried into shallow water provide abundant food for resident predators. The vertically migrating zooplankters apparently are vulnerable when they encounter the sea floor in shoal areas. This ecologically significant mechanism may be of importance to fisheries and military operations.
https://openalex.org/W1986627299,"Germinating pollen of Lilium longiflorum (cv. Ace) briefly exhibited a high rate of respiration before pollen tubes began to grow. A second period of high respiration occurred while tubes were growing. Between these periods respiration proceeded at a lower rate. Respiration was stimulated by 2,4-dinitrophenol to occur at approximately the same rate in all three periods."
https://openalex.org/W2030767579,"Calculations based on comparison of the isotopic composition of lead from iron meteorites with that of various modern terrestrial leads have placed the age of the earth at around 4550 million years. However, recent data from young volcanic rocks reveal that modern terrestrial lead can have a wide range in isotopic composition. The variations in its coinposition mean that one or more of the assumptions used in the age calculation have been violated. We modified the usual approach by comparing meteorite lead with lead from rocks 2700 million years old, from the Canadian Shield. Using this method and the same constants and assumptions utilized in the earlier calculations we calculated an age of 4750 +/- 50 million years for the earth. The earth may be approximately 200 million years older than previously thought; alternatively, primordial terrestrial lead may not have had the same isotopic composition as lead in iron meteorites does."

The reflectivity curve is flat in this spectral interval and the geometric albedo equals 0.05 +/- 0.01. These results, together with Phobos's reflectivity spectrum in the ultraviolet, are compared with laboratory spectra of carbonaceous chondrites and basalts. The spectra of carbonaceous chondrites are consistent with the observations, whereas the basalt spectra are not. These findings raise the possibility that Phobos may be a captured object rather than a natural satellite of Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2090846587,"The isotopic compositions and concentrations of rubidium and strontium were determined in silicate nodules contained in Weekeroo Station meteorite, a brecciated coarse octahedrite. The strontium had a Sr(87):Sr(86) range from 0.729 to 0.768, showing considerable enrichment in Sr(87) in coinparison with achondrites. Data for six samples of nodules lie on a straight line on the Sr-Rb evolution diagram, with an initial Sr(87):Sr(86) ratio of 0.696 to 0.702; the slope is 0.0674, corresponding to an age of 4.7 x 10(9) years for lambda = 1.39 x 10(-11) year(-1). These data agree with the previously assigned ages for the formation of stony meteorites and the earth; they support the conclusion that the major period of chemical and physical differentiation in the solar system occurred in a narrow interval at about this time. This result disagrees with the Ar(40)-K(40) ages of 5 to 13 x 10(9) years determined from other iron meteorites. A wide variety of isotopic-age investigations now seem experimentally feasible on iron meteorites that contain silicates."
https://openalex.org/W2018260394,"Ice-rafted detritus is readily identified in sediment cores raised from the deep ocean floor around Antarctica. A few cores have reached a depth below which no ice-rafted material is found. This depth is interpreted as indicating the establishment of earliest Pleistocene glaciation in the Southern Hemisphere. It is just below a depth where there is a change in assemblages of Radiolaria which Hays associates with the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary. The presence of ice-rafted material throughout the upper zone in cores taken south of the Polar Front indicates continuity of glaciation in Antarctica. Further north, near 45 degrees S in the Argentine Basin, zonation of the ice-rafted detritus can be used to delineate glacial stages of the Pleistocene."

https://openalex.org/W2003272150,"Large, living, flightless weevils feeding on leaves of woody plants high moss forest on various New Guinea mountain ranges have plant growth on their backs. Fungi and algae have been found on 11 species of Gymnopholus, lichens on six species, and liverworts on one species. In other genera of weevils, on the same mountains, there are additional specific associations with fungi, algae, lichens, and liverworts. The fungi and lichens, at least, are inhabited by oribatid mites of a new family, which may spread the plants from beetle to beetle. Also, nematodes, rotifers, psocids, and diatoms occur among the plants. Specialized scales or hairs, and a secretion, in depressions on the weevils' backs, appear to be associated with cpcouragement of the plant growth. Mutualistic symbiotic relationships seem to be clearly indicated."

https://openalex.org/W1981531556,"Holes bounded by crystal-lographic faces, or ""negative"" crystals, may be made in ice by inserting a hypodermic needle and connecting it to a vacuum. The evaporation habit changes as a function of temperature and growth rate. This procedure is a simple way of producing mirror-smooth, uncontaminated, crystallographic surfaces in compounds which have high vapor pressure."

https://openalex.org/W2050534091,"The geologic section consists of a folded and metamorphosed basement complex of geosynclinal and nearshore sediments and intrusives, a thick sequence of nearshore and terrestrial sediments of middle to late Paleozoic age, and thick diabase sheets and basalt flows of Jurassic age. Block faulting, probably during the Miocene age, produced the range, which has been carved into its present from by glaciers."
