https://openalex.org/W2041749675,"SIRT1 is a NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase that governs a number of genetic programs to cope with changes in the nutritional status of cells and organisms. Behavioral responses to food abundance are important for the survival of higher animals. Here we used mice with increased or decreased brain SIRT1 to show that this sirtuin regulates anxiety and exploratory drive by activating transcription of the gene encoding the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) to reduce serotonin levels in the brain. Indeed, treating animals with MAO-A inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) normalized anxiety differences between wild-type and mutant animals. SIRT1 deacetylates the brain-specific helix-loop-helix transcription factor NHLH2 on lysine 49 to increase its activation of the MAO-A promoter. Both common and rare variations in the SIRT1 gene were shown to be associated with risk of anxiety in human population samples. Together these data indicate that SIRT1 mediates levels of anxiety, and this regulation may be adaptive in a changing environment of food availability."
https://openalex.org/W2018780060,"N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) are bioactive lipids that engage diverse receptor systems. Recently, we identified fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) as intracellular NAE carriers. Here, we provide two new functions for FABPs in NAE signaling. We demonstrate that FABPs mediate the nuclear translocation of the NAE oleoylethanolamide, an agonist of nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Antagonism of FABP function through chemical inhibition, dominant-negative approaches, or shRNA-mediated knockdown reduced PPARα activation, confirming a requisite role for FABPs in this process. In addition, we show that NAE analogs, traditionally employed as inhibitors of the putative endocannabinoid transmembrane transporter, target FABPs. Support for the existence of the putative membrane transporter stems primarily from pharmacological inhibition of endocannabinoid uptake by such transport inhibitors, which are widely employed in endocannabinoid research despite lacking a known cellular target(s). Our approach adapted FABP-mediated PPARα signaling and employed in vitro binding, arachidonoyl-[1-(14)C]ethanolamide ([(14)C]AEA) uptake, and FABP knockdown to demonstrate that transport inhibitors exert their effects through inhibition of FABPs, thereby providing a molecular rationale for the underlying physiological effects of these compounds. Identification of FABPs as targets of transport inhibitors undermines the central pharmacological support for the existence of an endocannabinoid transmembrane transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2081764707,"Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a hypoxia-induced cell surface enzyme expressed in solid tumors, and functionally involved in acidification of extracellular pH and destabilization of intercellular contacts. Since both extracellular acidosis and reduced cell adhesion facilitate invasion and metastasis, we investigated the role of CA IX in cell migration, which promotes the metastatic cascade. As demonstrated here, ectopically expressed CA IX increases scattering, wound healing and transwell migration of MDCK cells, while an inactive CA IX variant lacking the catalytic domain (ΔCA) fails to do so. Correspondingly, hypoxic HeLa cells exhibit diminished migration upon inactivation of the endogenous CA IX either by forced expression of the dominant-negative ΔCA variant or by treatment with CA inhibitor, implying that the catalytic activity is indispensable for the CA IX function. Interestingly, CA IX improves cell migration both in the absence and presence of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), an established inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. On the other hand, HGF up-regulates CA IX transcription and triggers CA IX protein accumulation at the leading edge of lamellipodia. In these membrane regions CA IX co-localizes with sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBCe1) and anion exchanger 2 (AE2) that are both components of the migration apparatus and form bicarbonate transport metabolon with CA IX. Moreover, CA IX physically interacts with AE2 and NBCe1 in situ, as shown here for the first time. Thus, our findings suggest that CA IX actively contributes to cell migration via its ability to facilitate ion transport and pH control at protruding fronts of moving cells.

https://openalex.org/W2085716542,"The SUN (Sad1-UNC-84 homology) domain is conserved in a number of nuclear envelope proteins involved in nuclear migration, meiotic telomere tethering, and antiviral responses. The LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex, formed by the SUN and the nesprin proteins at the nuclear envelope, serves as a mechanical linkage across the nuclear envelope. Here we report the crystal structure of the SUN2 protein SUN domain, which reveals a homotrimer. The SUN domain is sufficient to mediate binding to the KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, and Syne homology) domain of nesprin 2, and the regions involved in the interaction have been identified. Binding of the SUN domain to the KASH domain is abolished by deletion of a region important for trimerization or by point mutations associated with nuclear migration failure. We propose a model of the LINC complex, where the SUN and the KASH domains form a higher ordered oligomeric network in the nuclear envelope. These findings provide the structural basis for understanding the function and the regulation of the LINC complex."
https://openalex.org/W1976082900,"Isofagomine (IFG) is an acid β-glucosidase (GCase) active site inhibitor that acts as a pharmacological chaperone. The effect of IFG on GCase function was investigated in GCase mutant fibroblasts and mouse models. IFG inhibits GCase with Ki ∼30 nm for wild-type and mutant enzymes (N370S and V394L). Fibroblasts treated with IFG at μm concentrations showed enhancement of WT and mutant GCase activities and protein levels. Administration of IFG (30 mg/kg/day) to the mice homozygous for GCase mutations (V394L, D409H, or D409V) led to increased GCase activity in visceral tissues and brain extracts. IFG effects on GCase stability and substrate levels were evaluated in a mouse model (hG/4L/PS-NA) that has doxycycline-controlled human WT GCase (hGCase) expression driven by a liver-specific promoter and is also homozygous for the IFG-responsive V394L GCase. Both human and mouse GCase activity and protein levels were increased in IFG-treated mice. The liver-secreted hGCase in serum was stabilized, and its effect on the lung and spleen involvement was enhanced by IFG treatment. In 8-week IFG-treated mice, the accumulated glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine were reduced by 75 and 33%, respectively. Decreases of storage cells were correlated with >50% reductions in substrate levels. These results indicate that IFG stabilizes GCase in tissues and serum and can reduce visceral substrates in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2079591167,"Burkholderia ambifaria is generally associated with the rhizosphere of plants where it has biocontrol effects on other microorganisms. It is also a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of closely related bacteria that cause lung infections in immunocompromised patients as well as in patients with granulomatous disease or cystic fibrosis. Our previous work indicated that fucose on human epithelia is a frequent target for lectins and adhesins of lung pathogens (Sulák, O., Cioci, G., Lameignère, E., Balloy, V., Round, A., Gutsche, I., Malinovská, L., Chignard, M., Kosma, P., Aubert, D. F., Marolda, C. L., Valvano, M. A., Wimmerová, M., and Imberty, A. (2011) PLoS Pathog. 7, e1002238). Analysis of the B. ambifaria genome identified BambL as a putative fucose-binding lectin. The 87-amino acid protein was produced recombinantly and demonstrated to bind to fucosylated oligosaccharides with a preference for αFuc1-2Gal epitopes. Crystal structures revealed that it associates as a trimer with two fucose-binding sites per monomer. The overall fold is a six-bladed β-propeller formed by oligomerization as in the Ralstonia solanacearum lectin and not by sequential domains like the fungal fucose lectin from Aleuria aurantia. The affinity of BambL for small fucosylated glycans is very high as demonstrated by microcalorimetry (K(D) < 1 μM). Plant cell wall oligosaccharides and human histo-blood group oligosaccharides H-type 2 and Lewis Y are bound with equivalent efficiency. Binding to artificial glycosphingolipid-containing vesicles, human saliva, and lung tissues confirmed that BambL could recognize a wide spectrum of fucosylated epitopes, albeit with a lower affinity for biological material from nonsecretor individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2049064036,"B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 (Bmi1) is a Polycomb Group (PcG) protein important in gene silencing. It is a component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which is required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes. Bmi1 was initially identified as an oncogene that regulates cell proliferation and transformation, and is important in hematopoiesis and the development of nervous systems. Recently, it was reported that Bmi1 is a potential marker for intestinal stem cells. Because Wnt signaling plays a key role in intestinal stem cells, we analyzed the effects of Wnt signaling on Bmi1 expression. We found that Wnt signaling indeed regulates the expression of Bmi1 in colon cancer cells. In addition, the expression of Bmi1 in human colon cancers is significantly associated with nuclear β-catenin, a hallmark for the activated Wnt signaling. Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc finger protein highly expressed in the gut and skin. We recently found that KLF4 cross-talks with Wnt/β-catenin in regulating intestinal homeostasis. We demonstrated that KLF4 directly inhibits the expression of Bmi1 in colon cancer cells. We also found that Bmi1 regulates histone ubiquitination and is required for colon cancer proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Our findings further suggest that Bmi1 is an attractive target for cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2042089580,"The Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mouse has a disruption in the gene encoding cytosolic carboxypeptidase 1 (CCP1). This study tested two proposed functions of CCP1: degradation of intracellular peptides and processing of tubulin. Overexpression (2-3-fold) or knockdown (80-90%) of CCP1 in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) did not affect the levels of most intracellular peptides but altered the levels of α-tubulin lacking two C-terminal amino acids (delta2-tubulin) ≥ 5-fold, suggesting that tubulin processing is the primary function of CCP1, not peptide degradation. Purified CCP1 produced delta2-tubulin from purified porcine brain α-tubulin or polymerized HEK293T microtubules. In addition, CCP1 removed Glu residues from the polyglutamyl side chains of porcine brain α- and β-tubulin and also generated a form of α-tubulin with two C-terminal Glu residues removed (delta3-tubulin). Consistent with this, pcd mouse brain showed hyperglutamylation of both α- and β-tubulin. The hyperglutamylation of α- and β-tubulin and subsequent death of Purkinje cells in pcd mice was counteracted by the knock-out of the gene encoding tubulin tyrosine ligase-like-1, indicating that this enzyme hyperglutamylates α- and β-tubulin. Taken together, these results demonstrate a role for CCP1 in the processing of Glu residues from β- as well as α-tubulin in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1965462834,"The metabolism of Streptococcus pneumoniae was studied by isotopologue profiling after bacterial cultivation in chemically defined medium supplemented with [U-(13)C(6)]- or [1,2-(13)C(2)]glucose. GC/MS analysis of protein-derived amino acids showed lack of (13)C label in amino acids that were also essential for pneumococcal growth. Ala, Ser, Asp, and Thr displayed high (13)C enrichments, whereas Phe, Tyr, and Gly were only slightly labeled. The analysis of the labeling patterns showed formation of triose phosphate and pyruvate via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. The labeling patterns of Asp and Thr suggested formation of oxaloacetate exclusively via the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase reaction. Apparently, α-ketoglutarate was generated from unlabeled glutamate via the aspartate transaminase reaction. A fraction of Phe and Tyr obtained label via the chorismate route from erythrose 4-phosphate, generated via the pentose phosphate pathway, and phosphoenolpyruvate. Strikingly, the data revealed no significant flux from phosphoglycerate to Ser and Gly but showed formation of Ser via the reverse reaction, namely by hydroxymethylation of Gly. The essential Gly was acquired from the medium, and the biosynthesis pathway was confirmed in experiments using [U-(13)C(2)]glycine as a tracer. The hydroxymethyl group in Ser originated from formate, which was generated by the pyruvate formate-lyase. Highly similar isotopologue profiles were observed in corresponding experiments with pneumococcal mutants deficient in PavA, CodY, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase pointing to the robustness of the core metabolic network used by these facultative pathogenic bacteria. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the dual utilization of carbohydrates and amino acids under in vitro conditions and identifies the unconventional de novo biosynthesis of serine by pneumococci."
https://openalex.org/W2016958628,"14-3-3 proteins regulate key processes in eukaryotic cells including nitrogen assimilation in plants by tuning the activity of nitrate reductase (NR), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. The homodimeric NR harbors three cofactors, each of which is bound to separate domains, thus forming an electron transfer chain. 14-3-3 proteins inhibit NR by binding to a conserved phosphorylation site localized in the linker between the heme and molybdenum cofactor-containing domains. Here, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of 14-3-3-mediated NR inhibition using a fragment of the enzyme lacking the third domain, allowing us to analyze electron transfer from the heme cofactor via the molybdenum center to nitrate. The kinetic behavior of the inhibited Mo-heme fragment indicates that the principal point at which 14-3-3 acts is the electron transfer from the heme to the molybdenum cofactor. We demonstrate that this is not due to a perturbation of the reduction potentials of either the heme or the molybdenum center and conclude that 14-3-3 most likely inhibits nitrate reductase by inducing a conformational change that significantly increases the distance between the two redox-active sites."
https://openalex.org/W2159252621,"The highly conserved DYNLL1 (LC8) protein was originally discovered as a light chain of the dynein motor complex, but is increasingly emerging as a sequence-specific regulator of protein dimerization with hundreds of targets and wide-ranging cellular functions. Despite its important roles, DYNLL1's own regulation remains poorly understood. Here we identify ASCIZ (ATMIN/ZNF822), an essential Zn(2+) finger protein with dual roles in the DNA base damage response and as a developmental transcription factor, as a conserved regulator of Dynll1 gene expression. DYNLL1 levels are reduced by ∼10-fold in the absence of ASCIZ in human, mouse and chicken cells. ASCIZ binds directly to the Dynll1 promoter and regulates its activity in a Zn(2+) finger-dependent manner. DYNLL1 protein in turn interacts with ten binding sites in the ASCIZ transcription activation domain, and high DYNLL1 levels inhibit the transcriptional activity of ASCIZ. In addition, DYNLL1 was also required for DNA damage-induced ASCIZ focus formation. The dual ability of ASCIZ to activate Dynll1 gene expression and to sense free DYNLL1 protein levels enables a simple dynamic feedback loop to adjust DYNLL1 levels to cellular needs. The ASCIZ-DYNLL1 feedback loop represents a novel mechanism for auto-regulation of gene expression, where the gene product directly inhibits the transcriptional activator while bound at its own promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2163818502,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) are widely distributed environmental contaminants, known as potent ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). These chemicals trigger an early and transient increase of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), required for AhR-related effects of PAHs. The mechanisms involved in this calcium mobilization were investigated in the present study. We demonstrated that B(a)P-mediated [Ca2+]i induction was prevented in endothelial HMEC-1 cells by counteracting β2-adrenoreceptor (β2ADR) activity using pharmacological antagonists, anti-β2ADR antibodies, or siRNA-mediated knockdown of β2ADR expression; by contrast, it was strongly potentiated by β2ADR overexpression in human kidney HEK293 cells. B(a)P was shown, moreover, to directly bind to β2ADR, as assessed by in vitro binding assays and molecular modeling. Pharmacological inhibition and/or siRNA-mediated silencing of various signaling actors acting downstream of β2ADR in a sequential manner, such as G protein, adenylyl cyclase, Epac-1 protein, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)/IP3 receptor, were next demonstrated to prevent B(a)P-induced calcium signal. Inhibition or knockdown of these signaling elements, as well as the use of chemical β-blockers, were finally shown to counteract B(a)P-mediated induction of cytochrome P-450 1B1, a prototypical AhR target gene. Taken together, our results show that B(a)P binds directly to β2ADR and consequently utilizes β2ADR machinery to mobilize [Ca2+]i, through activation of a G protein/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/Epac-1/IP3 pathway. This β2ADR-dependent signaling pathway activated by PAHs may likely be crucial for PAH-mediated up-regulation of AhR target genes, thus suggesting a contribution of β2ADR to the health-threatening effects of these environmental pollutants.

https://openalex.org/W1987679415,"Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) is a cofactor for many important enzymatic reactions and a powerful antioxidant. AA provides protection against oxidative stress by acting as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, either directly or indirectly by recycling of the lipid-soluble antioxidant, α-tocopherol (vitamin E). Only a few species, including humans, guinea pigs, and zebrafish, cannot synthesize AA. Using an untargeted metabolomics approach, we examined the effects of α-tocopherol and AA deficiency on the metabolic profiles of adult zebrafish. We found that AA deficiency, compared with subsequent AA repletion, led to oxidative stress (using malondialdehyde production as an index) and to major increases in the metabolites of the purine nucleotide cycle (PNC): IMP, adenylosuccinate, and AMP. The PNC acts as a temporary purine nucleotide reservoir to keep AMP levels low during times of high ATP utilization or impaired oxidative phosphorylation. The PNC promotes ATP regeneration by converting excess AMP into IMP, thereby driving forward the myokinase reaction (2ADP → AMP + ATP). On the basis of this finding, we investigated the activity of AMP deaminase, the enzyme that irreversibly deaminates AMP to form IMP. We found a 47% increase in AMP deaminase activity in the AA-deficient zebrafish, complementary to the 44-fold increase in IMP concentration. These results suggest that vitamin C is crucial for the maintenance of cellular energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2074946486,"Glutathione (GSH) has several important functions in eukaryotic cells, and its intracellular concentration is tightly controlled. Combining mathematical models and (35)S labeling, we analyzed Saccharomyces cerevisiae sulfur metabolism. This led us to the observation that GSH recycling is markedly faster than previously estimated. We set up additional in vivo assays and concluded that under standard conditions, GSH half-life is around 90 min. Sulfur starvation and growth with GSH as the sole sulfur source strongly increase GSH degradation, whereas cadmium (Cd(2+)) treatment inhibits GSH degradation. Whatever the condition tested, GSH is degraded by the cytosolic Dug complex (composed of the three subunits Dug1, Dug2, and Dug3) but not by the γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase, raising the question of the role of this enzyme. In vivo, both DUG2/3 mRNA levels and Dug activity are quickly induced by sulfur deprivation in a Met4-dependent manner. This suggests that Dug activity is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. Finally, analysis of dug2Δ and dug3Δ mutant cells shows that GSH degradation activity strongly impacts on GSH intracellular concentration and that GSH intracellular concentration does not affect GSH synthesis rate. Altogether, our data led us to reconsider important aspects of GSH metabolism, challenging notions on GSH synthesis and GSH degradation that were considered as established."
https://openalex.org/W1977385137,"Endothelial cells form a barrier between blood and the underlying vessel wall, which characteristically demonstrates inflammatory damage in atherosclerotic disease. MICA is a highly polymorphic ligand for the activating immune receptor NKG2D and can be expressed on endothelial cells. We hypothesized that damaged vessel walls, such as those involved in atherosclerosis, might express MICA, which could contribute to the vascular immunopathology. Immune activation resulting from MICA expression could play a significant role in the development of vascular damage. We have demonstrated that TNFα up-regulates MICA on human endothelial cells. The up-regulation is mediated by NF-κB, and we have defined the regulatory control site responsible for this at -130 bp upstream of the MICA transcription start site. This site overlaps with a heat shock response element and integrates input from the two pathways. We have shown that in atherosclerotic lesions there is expression of MICA on endothelial cells. Using lentivirus-mediated gene delivery in primary human endothelial cells, we were able to inhibit the MICA response to TNFα with a truncated HSF1 that lacked a transactivation domain. This highlights the potential for transcription-based therapeutic approaches in atherosclerotic vascular disease to reduce immune-mediated endothelial and vessel wall damage."
https://openalex.org/W2063163055,"Thymine glycol (Tg) and 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU) are common oxidized products of pyrimidines, which are recognized and cleaved by two DNA glycosylases of the base excision repair pathway, endonuclease III (Nth) and endonuclease VIII (Nei). Although there are several structures of Nei enzymes unliganded or bound to an abasic (apurinic or apyrimidinic) site, until now there was no structure of an Nei bound to a DNA lesion. Mimivirus Nei1 (MvNei1) is an ortholog of human NEIL1, which was previously crystallized bound to DNA containing an apurinic site (Imamura, K., Wallace, S. S., and Doublié, S. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 26174-26183). Here, we present two crystal structures of MvNei1 bound to two oxidized pyrimidines, Tg and 5-OHU. Both lesions are flipped out from the DNA helix. Tg is in the anti conformation, whereas 5-OHU adopts both anti and syn conformations in the glycosylase active site. Only two protein side chains (Glu-6 and Tyr-253) are within hydrogen-bonding contact with either damaged base, and mutating these residues did not markedly affect the glycosylase activity. This finding suggests that lesion recognition by Nei occurs before the damaged base flips into the glycosylase active site."
https://openalex.org/W2168541634,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that contributes to the mortality of immunocompromised individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas infection presents clinical challenges due to its ability to form biofilms and modulate host-pathogen interactions through the secretion of virulence factors. The calcium-regulated alkaline protease (AP), a member of the repeats in toxin (RTX) family of proteins, is implicated in multiple modes of infection. A series of full-length and truncation mutants were purified for structural and functional studies to evaluate the role of Ca(2+) in AP folding and activation. We find that Ca(2+) binding induces RTX folding, which serves to chaperone the folding of the protease domain. Subsequent association of the RTX domain with an N-terminal α-helix stabilizes AP. These results provide a basis for the Ca(2+)-mediated regulation of AP and suggest mechanisms by which Ca(2+) regulates the RTX family of virulence factors."

With tissue insult, resident tissue macrophages rapidly efflux to lymph nodes where they modulate the adaptive immune response, and inflammatory macrophages attracted to the site of injury then exit during the resolution phase. However, the mechanisms that regulate macrophage efflux are poorly understood. This study has investigated soluble forms of integrin β2 whose levels are elevated in experimental peritonitis at times when macrophages are exiting the peritoneum, suggesting that its proteolytic shedding may be involved in macrophage efflux. Both constitutive and inducible metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of integrin β2 from mouse macrophages are demonstrated. Soluble integrin β2 is primarily released as a heterodimeric complex with αM that retains its ability to bind its ligands intracellular adhesion molecule-1, fibrin, and collagen and thus may serve as a soluble antagonist. In a model of accelerated exiting, administration of a metalloproteinase inhibitor prevents macrophage efflux by 50% and impedes loss of macrophage integrin β2 from the cell surface. Exiting of peritoneal macrophages in mice lacking integrin β2 is accelerated, and antibody disruption of integrin β2-substrate interactions can reverse 50% of the metalloprotease inhibitor blockade of macrophage exiting. Thus, our study demonstrates the ability of metalloproteinase-mediated shedding of integrin β2 to promote macrophage efflux from inflammatory sites, and the release of soluble integrin heterodimers may also limit local inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2060818486,"The p15 fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein is a nonstructural viral protein that induces cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation. The exceptionally small, myristoylated N-terminal ectodomain of p15 lacks any of the defining features of a typical viral fusion protein. NMR and CD spectroscopy indicate this small fusion module comprises a left-handed polyproline type II (PPII) helix flanked by small, unstructured N and C termini. Individual prolines in the 6-residue proline-rich motif are highly tolerant of alanine substitutions, but multiple substitutions that disrupt the PPII helix eliminate cell-cell fusion activity. A synthetic p15 ectodomain peptide induces lipid mixing between liposomes, but with unusual kinetics that involve a long lag phase before the onset of rapid lipid mixing, and the length of the lag phase correlates with the kinetics of peptide-induced liposome aggregation. Lipid mixing, liposome aggregation, and stable peptide-membrane interactions are all dependent on both the N-terminal myristate and the presence of the PPII helix. We present a model for the mechanism of action of this novel viral fusion peptide, whereby the N-terminal myristate mediates initial, reversible peptide-membrane binding that is stabilized by subsequent amino acid-membrane interactions. These interactions induce a biphasic membrane fusion reaction, with peptide-induced liposome aggregation representing a distinct, rate-limiting event that precedes membrane merger. Although the prolines in the proline-rich motif do not directly interact with membranes, the PPII helix may function to force solvent exposure of hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the regions flanking the helix to promote membrane binding, apposition, and fusion.

The genus Orthoreovirus contains five recognized species, four of which induce cell-cell fusion and multinucleated syncytium formation (1Chappell J.D. Duncan R. Mertens P.P. Dermody T.S. Fauquet C.

Thus, nonenveloped viruses generally do not encode membrane fusion proteins and as a result do not induce syncytium formation. The fusogenic orthoreoviruses are a rare exception to this rule. Studies over the past few years have identified the orthoreovirus and aquareovirus proteins responsible for syncytiogenesis (2Thalmann C.M. Cummins D.M. Yu M. Lunt R. Pritchard L.I. Hansson E.

The three different classes of enveloped virus fusion proteins have dramatically different structures but remarkably conserved structural changes occur during the fusion reaction. These virus structural proteins contain large, multimeric ectodomains that undergo complex conformational changes to drive virus-cell membrane fusion (9Kielian M. Rey F.A.

An intermediate structure positions a fusion peptide (FP) at one end of the structure for partial insertion into the target membrane, whereas the opposite end is anchored in the viral membrane by the transmembrane domain. Collapse of the extended structure into a compact trimeric hairpin is presumed to pull the two membranes together and positions the fusion peptide and transmembrane domain at the same end of the structure, thereby driving membrane merger (8White J.M.

Some of the Class I fusogens, and all of the Class II and III fusogens, have internal FPs at the tips of elongated β-strands. These fusion loops position hydrophobic and aromatic residues at the tips of the loops for shallow insertion into the outer leaflet of the target membrane (16Gibbons D.L. Vaney M.C. Roussel A.

Whether FPs serve merely as membrane anchors or function to destabilize the lamellar structure of the outer leaflet of the bilayer to induce the first stage of membrane fusion is still unclear (22Epand R.M. Fusion peptides and the mechanism of viral fusion.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 23Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Mechanics of membrane fusion.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). In contrast to the enveloped virus fusion proteins, the FAST proteins are all small (95–198 amino acids), single pass membrane proteins with very small N-terminal ecto- and C-terminal endodomains that function from both sides of the membrane to drive the fusion process (24Boutilier J. Duncan R. Chernomordik L.V. Koslov M.M. Membrane Fusion. Vol. 68. Elsevier, San Diego, CA2011: 107-140Google Scholar). Unlike the enveloped virus fusogens, the FAST proteins are nonstructural viral proteins that are expressed inside virus-infected cells where they traffic to the plasma membrane to induce fusion of virus-infected cells with neighboring uninfected cells (5Dawe S. Duncan R. The S4 genome segment of baboon reovirus is bicistronic and encodes a novel fusion-associated small transmembrane protein.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. A new class of fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins encoded by the non-enveloped fusogenic reoviruses.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The FAST proteins have therefore specifically evolved to induce cell-cell, rather than virus-cell, membrane fusion. The structural limitations of the FAST protein ectodomains (only 19–43 residues) means they cannot induce membrane merger using complex structural rearrangements to pull membranes into close proximity. Instead, mutational studies indicate the FAST protein ectodomains, endodomains, and transmembrane domains are all directly involved in the fusion process (25Barry C. Duncan R.

Virol. 2003; 77: 9769-9779Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Specific functional motifs have been identified in each of these fusion modules, although each FAST protein fusion module has its own unique repertoire of these motifs. Chimeric studies demonstrate that various combinations of the fusion modules from the different FAST proteins can be assembled to generate functional chimeras, but not all combinations are tolerated (24Boutilier J. Duncan R. Chernomordik L.V. Koslov M.M. Membrane Fusion. Vol. 68. Elsevier, San Diego, CA2011: 107-140Google Scholar, 26Clancy E.K. Duncan R.

Virol. 2011; 85: 4707-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The FAST proteins are therefore modular fusogens, but specific combinations of functional motifs must be present in the different fusion modules on either side of the membrane to generate an active cell-cell fusogen. Defining the roles of these functional motifs is the focus of ongoing research efforts. One such functional motif is the hydrophobic patches (HPs) present in each of the FAST proteins. These motifs are the only regions of the FAST proteins that possess an overall hydrophobic character (aside from the transmembrane domain), although they are actually more amphiphilic than hydrophobic (2Thalmann C.M.

The HP motifs are located in the ectodomains of the p10 and p14 FAST proteins, but in the cytosolic endodomains of the p13, p15 and p22 FAST proteins. In the case of p10 and p14, the ectodomain HPs possess functional features of FPs. Synthetic peptides of both motifs induce liposome-liposome lipid mixing indicating they have membrane destabilizing properties, and amino acid substitutions in these motifs have adverse effects on cell-cell fusion activity of the full-length FAST protein (29Barry C.

Structural and functional properties of an unusual internal fusion peptide in a non-enveloped virus membrane fusion protein.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The p14 HP contains a myristoylated, proline-hinged loop, whereas the p10 HP contains a cystine loop, and the apices of both of these loops contain a Phe-Val dipeptide, similar to the residues located at the tips of the enveloped virus fusion loops. The p10 and p14 FPs are not sequestered within a complex protein tertiary structure, nor are they likely to serve as membrane anchors because the FAST proteins cannot use mechanical energy provided by complex ectodomain structural rearrangements to promote close membrane apposition. Instead, the Phe and Val residues in the p10 and p14 FPs may be positioned to directly interact with a closely apposed target membrane, thereby inducing curvature changes or other alterations to the interfacial region of the membrane required for merger of the outer leaflets. The p15 FAST protein of baboon reovirus contains the hallmark features of a FAST protein, including a single transmembrane domain that functions as a reverse signal anchor to direct an Nexternal/Cinternal membrane topology, an essential fatty acid modification (i.e. N-terminal myristoylation), a membrane-proximal polybasic motif of no known function, and a HP (Fig. 1A). The p15 FAST protein has the smallest ectodomain (19 residues), and this fusion module has a proline-rich motif (PRM) and an overall hydrophilic nature with no apparent FP motif (5Dawe S. Duncan R. The S4 genome segment of baboon reovirus is bicistronic and encodes a novel fusion-associated small transmembrane protein.J.

Unusual topological arrangement of structural motifs in the baboon reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane protein.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6216-6226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is not at all apparent how this fusion module could function to promote cell-cell membrane fusion. To examine this issue, we used a combination of NMR and CD spectroscopy, syncytium formation, peptide-induced lipid mixing assays, and peptide-liposome binding studies. Results indicate the p15 ectodomain functions as a novel FP motif to induce lipid mixing, dependent on both the N-terminal myristate and the presence of a polyproline type II (PPII) helix. Although residues in the PPII helix do not directly associate with membranes, this structure appears to be required to force exposure of flanking hydrophobic residues that do interact with membranes, stabilizing the weak myristate-membrane interactions and driving the fusion reaction. QM5 and Vero cells were maintained as previously described (4Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. Reptilian reovirus utilizes a small type III protein with an external myristylated amino terminus to mediate cell-cell fusion.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells growing in 12-well plates were transfected with Lipofectamine using the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen), and supplemented with serum-containing medium 5 h post-transfection and incubated for the indicated periods of time. The generation and specificity of the rabbit polyclonal p15-specific antisera has been previously described (32Dawe S. Corcoran J.A. Clancy E.K. Salsman J. Duncan R. Unusual topological arrangement of structural motifs in the baboon reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane protein.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6216-6226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis method was used to replace individual residues within the proline-rich motif (PPAPPP; residues 10–15). Authentic p15 was used as a template to make the following substitutions: Q9A, A12P, P13A, P15A, P11A/A12P, P10A/P14A, p15pro1 (AAAAAA), and p15pro2 (PAAAPA). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed. The p15 ectodomain proline-rich motif (VQPPAPPPNA) and a mutant version of this peptide (VQPAAAPANA) were obtained from Dalton Chemical Laboratories, Inc. at 95% purity. A poly-l-proline peptide was purchased from Sigma. All CD spectra were acquired using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter with a 0.1-cm optical path. The p15 peptides were dissolved in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.0) to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, unless otherwise noted. Spectra were obtained between 250 and 200 nm, and 10 scans were acquired and summed for each sample and the resulting spectrum was smoothed to remove residual noise. Measurements requiring different buffers were modified to include either 3 m urea or 4 m NaCl. Because of the absorbance and light scattering of the buffer components in these solutions at short wavelengths, measurements were taken to 210 nm. Transfected monolayers were fixed and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain (Diff-Quik), and the syncytiogenic activity of various p15 mutants was quantified using a syncytial index assay as previously described (4Corcoran J.A. Duncan R. Reptilian reovirus utilizes a small type III protein with an external myristylated amino terminus to mediate cell-cell fusion.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), based on microscopic quantification of the numbers of syncytial nuclei present in five random fields of view. Transfected monolayers were methanol-fixed and immunostained using primary rabbit polyclonal anti-p15 antiserum as previously described (32Dawe S. Corcoran J.A. Clancy E.K. Salsman J. Duncan R. Unusual topological arrangement of structural motifs in the baboon reovirus fusion-associated small transmembrane protein.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6216-6226Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and lysed in RIPA buffer 8 h post-transfection. Equivalent protein loads of sample (as determined by a Lowry assay) were separated by SDS-PAGE and p15 was detected by immunoblotting as described previously (5Dawe S. Duncan R. The S4 genome segment of baboon reovirus is bicistronic and encodes a novel fusion-associated small transmembrane protein.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Synthetic p15 peptides were dissolved in buffered 95:5 or 0:100% H2O/D2O with and without 300 mm perdeuterated dodecylphosphocholine (DPC-d38; 98 atom %D). The aqueous buffer used for sample preparation contained 50 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4 at pH 6.0 or 8.0. For all samples, the concentration of peptide was 5 mm. One- and two-dimensional 1H NMR data sets were collected on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer and processed as previously described (33Syvitski R.T. Burton I. Mattatall N.R. Douglas S.E. Jakeman D.L. Structural characterization of the antimicrobial peptide pleurocidin from winter flounder.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7282-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For structure calculations, distance restraints determined from the integration of NOESY cross-peaks (80 ms for myristoylated p15 peptide and 250 ms for non-myristoylated p15 peptide) were classified into four groups: strong, medium, weak, and very weak, corresponding to inter-proton distance ranges of <2.3, 2.0–3.5, 3.3–5.0, and 4.8–6.0 Å, respectively. All structural calculations were based on previous studies (34Nilges M. Kuszewski J. Brunger A.T. Computational Aspects of the Study of Biological Macromolecules by NMR. Plenum Press, New York1991Google Scholar) and were performed using the XPLOR 3.1 software package. The overall quality of these refined structures was examined with the program PROCHECK. Except for random-coil sections, all backbone dihedral angles resided in the well defined, acceptable regions of the Ramachandran plot. For structural determination, spin systems were identified through chemical shifts and characteristic TOCSY cross-peak patterns (60 ms for myristoylated p15 and 120 ms for non-myristoylated p15).

Fluorescent liposomes were similarly generated, except 4 mol % of DOPE in each liposome was replaced with 2 mol % each of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (NBD-DOPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (Rho-DOPE).

Non-fluorescent and fluorescent liposomes were mixed in a 9:1 ratio in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) to obtain a final concentration of 100 μm lipid. The peptides were dissolved in DMSO and assayed for lipid mixing in the indicated final concentrations, using the same volume of DMSO as a solvent control.

https://openalex.org/W1997271039,"Activation of very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) results in either pro- or anti-atherogenic effects depending on the ligand. Using reelin and apoE as ligands, we studied the impact of VLDLR- and apoER2-mediated signaling on the expression of ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and cholesterol efflux using RAW264.7 cells. Treatment of these mouse macrophages with reelin or human apoE3 significantly increased ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels, and apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux. In addition, both reelin and apoE3 significantly increased phosphorylated disabled-1 (Dab1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ), and specificity protein 1 (Sp1). This reelin- or apoER2-mediated up-regulation of ABCA1 expression was suppressed by 1) knockdown of Dab1, VLDLR, and apoER2 with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), 2) inhibition of PI3K and PKC with kinase inhibitors, 3) overexpression of kinase-dead PKCζ, and 4) inhibition of Sp1 DNA binding with mithramycin A. Activation of the Dab1-PI3K signaling pathway has been implicated in VLDLR- and apoER2-mediated cellular functions, whereas the PI3K-PKCζ-Sp1 signaling cascade has been implicated in the regulation of ABCA1 expression induced by apoE/apoB-carrying lipoproteins. Taken together, these data support a model in which activation of VLDLR and apoER2 by reelin and apoE induces ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux via a Dab1-PI3K-PKCζ-Sp1 signaling cascade."

We previously documented that the transcription factor late SV40 factor (LSF), also known as TFCP2, is overexpressed in more than 90% of cases of human HCC patients compared with normal liver and a direct correlation exists between LSF expression levels and the stages and grades of the disease (2Yoo B.K.

LSF expression is low in the human HCC cell line HepG3, which do not form tumors in nude mice, while it is highly expressed in the human HCC cell line QGY-7703 that forms aggressive tumors in nude mice (2Yoo B.K. Emdad L. Gredler R. Fuller C. Dumur C.I. Jones K.H. Jackson-Cook C. Su Z.Z. Chen D. Saxena U.H. Hansen U. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D.

Forced overexpression of LSF in HepG3 cells increased proliferation, colony formation, Matrigel invasion and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and resulted in highly aggressive and multi-organ metastatic tumors in nude mice. Conversely, inhibition of LSF by a dominant negative construct (LSFdn) in QGY-7703 cells significantly suppressed in vitro proliferation, colony formation, Matrigel invasion, and anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. LSF transcriptionally up-regulates osteopontin (OPN), a known mediator for tumor progression and metastasis, and inhibition of OPN significantly nullifies the oncogenic functions of LSF (2Yoo B.K. Emdad L. Gredler R. Fuller C. Dumur C.I. Jones K.H. Jackson-Cook C. Su Z.Z. Chen D. Saxena U.H. Hansen U. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D.

OPN, induced by LSF, activates c-Met receptor, via interaction with CD44, and our recent studies document that c-Met activation also plays a crucial role in mediating aggressive properties conferred by LSF (3Yoo B.K.

We also documented that by regulating the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS), LSF contributes to cell survival and cell cycle regulation (4Yoo B.K. Gredler R. Vozhilla N. Su Z.Z. Chen D.

Since TS is the target of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), TS up-regulation as a consequence of LSF overexpression leads to 5-FU resistance (4Yoo B.K. Gredler R. Vozhilla N. Su Z.Z. Chen D. Forcier T. Shah K.

Tumor-induced angiogenesis is important to sustain growth of solid tumors when they become invasive and metastatic and the functional role of MMPs in tumor angiogenesis is well established (15Bergers G. Benjamin L.E. Tumorigenesis and the angiogenic switch.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2858) Google Scholar). MMP-9 is a major contributor to tumor-induced angiogenesis and a crucial factor triggering activation of quiescent vasculature (16Rundhaug J.E. Matrix metalloproteinases and angiogenesis.J. Cell Mol.

Inhibition of MMP-9 results in inhibition of expression of pro-angiogenic genes, such as VEGF and ICAM-1, further establishing the importance of MMP-9 in regulating angiogenesis (19Aalinkeel R.

Accordingly, MMP-9 plays an important role in aggressive progression of cancer. In the present studies we document that LSF transcriptionally up-regulates MMP-9, which plays a fundamental role in mediating the pro-angiogenic properties of LSF. The present results are novel and identify a unique effector of LSF function that might provide a target to counteract HCC. HepG3 clones stably expressing LSF (LSF-1 and LSF-17) and QGY-7703 clones stably expressing LSFdn (QGY-LSFdn-8 and QGY-LSFdn-15) were generated as described (2Yoo B.K. Emdad L. Gredler R. Fuller C.

Human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Lonza and maintained as recommended. The LSF-17 clone of HepG3 cells was transduced with a pool of three to five lentiviral vector plasmids, each encoding target-specific 19–25 nt (plus hairpin) shRNAs designed to knockdown MMP-9 gene expression (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Individual colonies were selected by puromycin for 2 weeks to generate the MMP-9sh-13 and MMP-9sh-15 clones. Control scrambled shRNA was used in a similar manner to generate the Con-11 clone in the LSF-17 background. Cell viability was determined by standard MTT assays as described (2Yoo B.K. Emdad L.

Emdad L. Gredler R. Fuller C. Dumur C.I. Jones K.H. Jackson-Cook C. Su Z.Z. Chen D. Saxena U.H. Hansen U. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D.

Conversely, we established stable cell lines expressing an LSF dominant negative mutant in a QGY-7703 background (LSFdn-8 and LSFdn-15) that resulted in profound inhibition in tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice when compared with control clones (2Yoo B.K. Emdad L. Gredler R. Fuller C. Dumur C.I. Jones K.H. Jackson-Cook C. Su Z.Z. Chen D. Saxena U.H. Hansen U. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D. Transcription factor Late SV40 Factor (LSF) functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 8357-8362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because angiogenesis is an integral component of aggressive and metastatic tumors, we analyzed the angiogenic potential of LSF using these established cell clones. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), cultured in the presence of differentiation media on basement membrane extract, rapidly align, extend processes into the matrix, and finally form capillary-like structures surrounding a central lumen (Fig. 1). HUVEC cultured in conditioned medium (CM) from LSF-17 clone showed significant tube formation compared with Con-8 clone of HepG3 cells (Fig. 1). As a corollary, CM from LSFdn-15 clone induced extremely poor tube formation compared with that from Con-1 clone of QGY-7703 cells, which induced robust HUVEC differentiation (Fig. 1). The pro-angiogenic property of LSF was further characterized by treating CAM of 9-day old chick embryos either with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as positive control or with CM from LSF-overexpressing and LSF-inhibited clones. After 1 week, neovascularization was examined, photographed and quantified. Significantly marked outgrowth of new blood vessels was observed in the presence of VEGF (Fig. 2). CM from the LSF-17 clone resulted in significant neovascularization compared with the Con-8 clone of HepG3 cells (Fig. 2). Conversely, CM from LSFdn-15 clone exhibited little induction of neovascularization compared with that from the Con-1 clone of QGY-7703 cells (Fig. 2). In HepG3 cells, LSF overexpression increased while in QGY-7703 cells LSF inhibition decreased the migration ability as revealed by a wound healing assay (supplemental Fig. S1). The observation that inhibition of LSF resulted in such a profound inhibition of both HUVEC differentiation and neovascularization in CAM suggests that LSF plays a pivotal role in regulating angiogenesis. To determine which angiogenic factors contribute to LSF-induced angiogenesis, we screened a human angiogenesis array using CM from Con-8 and LSF-17 clones of HepG3 cells and CM from Con-1 and LSFdn-15 clones of QGY-7703 cells. We only focused on those factors that showed increase in LSF-17 clone with corresponding decrease in LSFdn-15 clones. A significant increase in angiogenin and placental growth factor (PlGF) and a moderate increase in interleukin-8 (IL-8) were observed in LSF-17 clone compared with Con-8 clone of HepG3 cells (Fig. 3A). Corresponding decreases in angiogenin, PlGF and IL-8 were observed in LSFdn-15 clone compared with Con-1 clone of QGY-7703 cells (Fig. 3A). Although not evident from the array, analysis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level by ELISA revealed modest increase in LSF-17 clone compared with Con-8 clone of HepG3 cells and modest decrease in LSFdn-15 clone compared with Con-1 clone of QGY-7703 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). Analysis of the promoter region of these genes did not reveal any LSF-binding sites indicating that as a transcription factor LSF does not directly induce their expression. To identify a master regulator of angiogenesis that might be transcriptionally regulated by LSF, we performed ChIP-on-chip analysis Using Roche Nimblegen's ChIP-on-chip 2.1 m tiling array that allows identification of promoter regions to which a specific transcription factor binds. The promoter region of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) exhibited the highest statistical significance in terms of LSF binding. MMP-9 mRNA expression was significantly higher in LSF-1 and LSF-17 clones compared with Con-8 clone as well as parental HepG3 cells and was significantly decreased in LSFdn-8 and LSFdn-15 clones compared with Con-1 clone as well as parental QGY-7703 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). As a corollary Pro-MMP-9 and cleaved (active) forms of MMP-9 were significantly increased in LSF-1 and LSF-17 clones compared with Con-8 clone of HepG3 cells and was significantly decreased in LSFdn-8 and LSFdn-15 clones compared with Con-1 clone of QGY-7703 cells when the conditioned media were subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D). An increase in functionally active MMP-9 in LSF-1 and LSF-17 clones over Con-8 clone of HepG3 cells and a corresponding decrease in LSFdn-8 and LSFdn-15 clones over Con-1 clone of QGY-7703 cells were demonstrated by gelatin zymography assay (Fig. 3E). No change in MMP-2 level was detected by gelatin zymography indicating that LSF regulates MMP-9 but not MMP-2. To confirm transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 by LSF, we cloned ∼2 kb region of human MMP-9 gene starting from −1936 to +24 when the translation start site was regarded as +1. A luciferase reporter construct under the control of the MMP-9 promoter was generated in the pGL3-basic vector (MMP-9-Prom-luc). MMP-9-Prom-luc was transfected into the cells along with a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid and firefly luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity. MMP-9 promoter activity was significantly higher in LSF-1 and LSF-17 clones when compared with the Con-8 clone of HepG3 cells while it was significantly decreased in the LSFdn-8 and LSFdn-15 clones versus the Con-1 clone of QGY-7703 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Analysis of MMP-9 promoter region identified six potential LSF-binding sites. We generated two deletion mutants, N1 containing −1306/+24 region with removal of two LSF binding sites and N2 containing −746/+24 with removal of the remaining four LSF binding sites (Fig. 4C). The N1 construct still retained LSF-mediated induction while LSF-responsiveness was completely extinguished in the N2 construct indicating that the four potential LSF binding elements between −1306 and −746 contribute to LSF responsiveness (Fig. 4D). Two of these four elements are closely positioned to each other and as such we designed three sets of PCR primers, the first pair flanking the distal two LSF binding sites (fragment A), while the other two pairs flanked the remaining two LSF binding sites (fragments B and C, respectively), to confirm direct binding of LSF to MMP-9 promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) (Fig. 4E). ChIP assay using the LSF-17 clone of HepG3 cells and QGY-7703 cells demonstrated LSF binding only to the proximal two LSF-binding sites and not to the distal sites (Fig. 4F). These results confirm that LSF transcriptionally up-regulates MMP-9. To confirm the direct role of MMP-9 in regulating angiogenesis, we treated HUVECs with increasing concentration of recombinant active (83 kDa) MMP-9 (0.25 to 1 μg/ml) and subjected to differentiation assay. MMP-9 markedly augmented HUVEC tube formation in a dose-dependent manner and this effect of MMP-9 was completely abolished when MMP-9 was inactivated by boiling (Fig. 4, G and H). To interrogate the role MMP-9 in the oncogenic function of LSF, we generated by puromycin selection stable clones expressing MMP-9 shRNA in the background of LSF-17 clone of HepG3 cells. Two clones, MMP-9sh-13 and MMP-9sh-15 showed >80% reduction in MMP-9 mRNA expression compared with the parental LSF-17 cells as well as control puromycin-resistant clone (Con-11) (Fig. 5A). The decrease in mRNA level was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analysis and by gelatin zymography using conditioned media (Fig. 5, B and C, respectively). Compared with LSF-17 cells and Con-11 clone, both MMP-9sh-13 and MMP-9sh-15 clones showed significant inhibition of cell growth and proliferation as revealed by MTT assay (Fig. 5D) and colony formation assay (Fig. 5E). Correlating with the function of MMP-9, MMP-9sh-13, and MMP-9sh-15 clones demonstrated profound inhibition of Matrigel invasion compared with LSF-17 cells and Con-11 clone (Fig. 5F). More importantly, CM from MMP-9sh-13 and MMP-9sh-15 clones poorly induced HUVEC tube formation (Fig. 5G) as well as neovascularization in CAM (Fig. 5H) when compared with CM from Con-11 clone. The CM from MMP-9sh-13 and MMP-9sh-15 clones contained significantly lower levels of angiogenic factors, such as IL-8 and VEGF, compared with the CM from Con-11 clone (supplemental Fig. S3). The in vitro observations were confirmed by in vivo assays. Con-11 and MMP-9sh-13 clones of LSF-17 cells were subcutaneously implanted in athymic nude mice. While Con-11 clone grew robustly, very small tumors were observed with the MMP-9sh-13 clone (Fig. 6, A–C). Tumors generated from Con-11 clone showed markedly increased angiogenesis when compared with MMP-9sh-13 clone when the sections were stained for the microvessel marker CD31 (Fig. 6D). The metastatic ability of these clones was analyzed by intravenous injection of the clones via tail vein. Analysis of lung sections indicated microscopic nodules throughout the lungs in the Con-11 clone injected animals, but no lung nodules were detected in animals receiving the MMP-9sh-13 clone (Fig. 6E). Angiogenesis is an invasive process that requires proteolysis of the extracellular matrix and proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (23Harper J. Moses M.A. Molecular regulation of tumor angiogenesis: mechanisms and therapeutic implications.EXS. 2006; 96: 223-268PubMed Google Scholar). As such, MMPs play an important role in tumor angiogenesis by facilitating ECM degradation, mainly degradation of collagen in the basement membrane. MMP-9 also induces release of angiogenic factors from the ECM and/or promotes degradation of angiogenesis inhibitors that might reside in the ECM (24Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Matrix metalloproteinases in angiogenesis: a moving target for therapeutic intervention.J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The source of pro-angiogenic MMP-9 might be the tumor cells themselves. Studies from mouse models also suggest bone marrow-derived cells, neutrophils or osteoclasts as potential sources of MMP-9 facilitating tumor angiogenesis (25Bruni-Cardoso A. Johnson L.C. Vessella R.L. Peterson T.E. Lynch C.C. Osteoclast-derived matrix metalloproteinase-9 directly affects angiogenesis in the prostate tumor-bone microenvironment.Mol.

We document that the angiogenic properties of conditioned media (CM) from MMP-9 knockdown HCC cells in an LSF-overexpression background were significantly compromised suggesting that MMP-9 plays a key role in the angiogenic function of LSF. MMP-9 contained in the CM from LSF-overexpressing cells might not only provide ECM degradation in CAM or HUVEC differentiation but also contribute to stimulation of endothelial cells by releasing angiogenic factors. The decrease in VEGF or IL-8 level in the CM of MMP-9 knockdown cells supports this hypothesis. We also observed that knocking down MMP-9 significantly impaired cell growth and proliferation, in addition to inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis, in LSF-overexpressing human HCC cells. Indeed, MMP-9 has been shown to be essential for survival of chronic leukocytic leukemia cells by inducing an anti-apoptotic signaling response and a similar mechanism might also be involved in HCC cells (29Redondo-Muñoz J. Ugarte-Berzal E. Terol M.J. Van den Steen P.E. Hernández del Cerro M. Roderfeld M. Roeb E. Opdenakker G. García-Marco J.A. García-Pardo A. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 promotes chronic lymphocytic leukemia b cell survival through its hemopexin domain.Cancer Cell. 2010; 17: 160-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We previously identified OPN as a transcriptional target of LSF and demonstrated that OPN induction leading to c-Met activation plays a significant role in regulating the aggressive tumorigenic phenotype conferred by LSF (2Yoo B.K. Emdad L. Gredler R. Fuller C. Dumur C.I. Jones K.H. Jackson-Cook C. Su Z.Z. Chen D. Saxena U.H. Hansen U. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D. Transcription factor Late SV40 Factor (LSF) functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 8357-8362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). OPN promotes tumorigenesis via a vast array of mechanisms, one of which is induction of MMP-9 (30Chen Y.J. Wei Y.Y. Chen H.T. Fong Y.C. Hsu C.J. Tsai C.H. Hsu H.C. Liu S.H. Tang C.H. Osteopontin increases migration and MMP-9 up-regulation via αvβ3 integrin, FAK, ERK, and NF-κB-dependent pathway in human chondrosarcoma cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 221: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics analysis identified six potential LSF-binding sites in the human MMP-9 promoter. The combination of deletion mutation and ChIP analyses revealed that only two of these sites are functionally relevant. Cross-talk with other transcription factors regulating MMP-9 expression might determine LSF binding to a specific site. The two most frequent transcription factors regulating MMP-9 transcription are NF-κB and AP-1. We have previously demonstrated that LSF itself can activate NF-κB and it also activates ERK signaling that might lead to AP-1 activation (2Yoo B.K. Emdad L. Gredler R. Fuller C. Dumur C.I. Jones K.H. Jackson-Cook C. Su Z.Z. Chen D. Saxena U.H. Hansen U. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D. Transcription factor Late SV40 Factor (LSF) functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 8357-8362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These properties of LSF might be attributed to OPN, a known activator of NF-κB and AP-1, and OPN-induced c-Met activation. As such there might be multiple mechanisms by which LSF induces MMP-9 expression. On the other hand, MMP-9 is known to cleave OPN into specific fragments, which augment HCC cell invasion (31Takafuji V. Forgues M. Unsworth E. Goldsmith P. Wang X.W. An osteopontin fragment is essential for tumor cell invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6361-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus MMP-9 and OPN work in concert to promote hepatocarcinogenesis. The observation that LSF simultaneously regulates two important determinants of tumor progression, angiogenesis and metastasis, OPN and MMP-9, further strengthens its role in determining aggressive behavior of HCC. Studies from mouse models provide interesting insights into the role of LSF/TFCP2 and LBP-1a/NF2d9, members of grainyhead family of transcription factors, in angiogenesis (32Parekh V. McEwen A. Barbour V. Takahashi Y. Rehg J.E. Jane S.M. Cunningham J.M. Defective extraembryonic angiogenesis in mice lacking LBP-1a, a member of the grainyhead family of transcription factors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7113-7129Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An LSF knock-out mouse is viable and has a normal life expectancy suggesting that LBP1-a might compensate for LSF function. However, LBP-1a knock-out mice die at embryonic day 10.5 due to severe placental insufficiency because of an angiogenic defect in the mesodermal components of the labyrinthine layer and the yolk sac vasculature. These findings strongly suggest that this family of proteins is essential for angiogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism by which LBP-1a regulates angiogenesis is not clear. It is also not clear why LSF cannot compensate for LBP-1a deficiency, whereas LBP1-a can compensate for LSF, even though their tissue distribution is quite similar and they have a high degree of similarity in protein structure. Additionally, angiogenic factors, transcriptionally regulated by LBP-1a, have also not been identified. It might be possible that LSF has acquired more functional importance than LBP-1a in humans. Additionally, acquired tissue- and tumor-specific roles of LSF might also underlie its specialized function in regulating tumor angiogenesis. It should be noted that it is LSF, not LBP-1a, which is overexpressed in human HCC (2Yoo B.K. Emdad L. Gredler R. Fuller C. Dumur C.I. Jones K.H. Jackson-Cook C. Su Z.Z. Chen D. Saxena U.H. Hansen U. Fisher P.B. Sarkar D. Transcription factor Late SV40 Factor (LSF) functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 8357-8362Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The super-abundance of LSF in human HCC cells might allow it to transcriptionally regulate OPN or MMP-9, which may not happen under physiological conditions. Analysis of the role of LSF in regulating MMP-9 in inflammation- and/or wound-associated angiogenesis will provide important insight into the role of this unique transcription factor in biological processes. In summary, our studies identify MMP-9, an important determinant of tumor progression, as a transcriptional target of LSF. It should be noted that ChIP-on-chip analysis did not identify other members of MMP family as LSF target genes establishing the central role of MMP-9 in mediating LSF-induced oncogenesis. An LSF inhibitor will inhibit OPN, c-Met, NF-κB, AP-1 and MMP-9, all intimately involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors of LSF significantly inhibit growth of human HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo 4D.

The two main functions of USP18, i.e. its enzymatic activity and down-regulation of type I interferon signaling, are well characterized.

Usage of this non-canonical initiation site with its weak translation initiation efficiency promotes expression of an N-terminal truncated isoform (USP18-sf). In addition, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5′-coding region of USP18 also contributes to translation of USP18-sf. Functionally, both isoforms exhibit enzymatic activity and interfere with type I interferon signaling. However, USP18-sf shows different subcellular distribution compared with the full-length protein and enhanced deISGylation activity in the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W1996740401,"Bile acid-like molecules named dafachronic acids (DAs) control the dauer formation program in Caenorhabditis elegans through the nuclear receptor DAF-12. This mechanism is conserved in parasitic nematodes to regulate their dauer-like infective larval stage, and as such, the DAF-12 ligand binding domain has been identified as an important therapeutic target in human parasitic hookworm species that infect more than 600 million people worldwide. Here, we report two x-ray crystal structures of the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum DAF-12 ligand binding domain in complex with DA and cholestenoic acid (a bile acid-like metabolite), respectively. Structure analysis and functional studies reveal key residues responsible for species-specific ligand responses of DAF-12. Furthermore, DA binds to DAF-12 mechanistically and is structurally similar to bile acids binding to the mammalian bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor. Activation of DAF-12 by cholestenoic acid and the cholestenoic acid complex structure suggest that bile acid-like signaling pathways have been conserved in nematodes and mammals. Together, these results reveal the molecular mechanism for the interplay between parasite and host, provide a structural framework for DAF-12 as a promising target in treating nematode parasitism, and provide insight into the evolution of gut parasite hormone-signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2033037367,"Ozone depletion increases terrestrial solar ultraviolet B (UV-B; 280-315 nm) radiation, intensifying the risks plants face from DNA damage, especially covalent cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD). Without efficient repair, UV-B destroys genetic integrity, but plant breeding creates rice cultivars with more robust photolyase (PHR) DNA repair activity as an environmental adaptation. So improved strains of Oryza sativa (rice), the staple food for Asia, have expanded rice cultivation worldwide. Efficient light-driven PHR enzymes restore normal pyrimidines to UV-damaged DNA by using blue light via flavin adenine dinucleotide to break pyrimidine dimers. Eukaryotes duplicated the photolyase gene, producing PHRs that gained functions and adopted activities that are distinct from those of prokaryotic PHRs yet are incompletely understood. Many multicellular organisms have two types of PHR: (6-4) PHR, which structurally resembles bacterial CPD PHRs but recognizes different substrates, and Class II CPD PHR, which is remarkably dissimilar in sequence from bacterial PHRs despite their common substrate. To understand the enigmatic DNA repair mechanisms of PHRs in eukaryotic cells, we determined the first crystal structure of a eukaryotic Class II CPD PHR from the rice cultivar Sasanishiki. Our 1.7 Å resolution PHR structure reveals structure-activity relationships in Class II PHRs and tuning for enhanced UV tolerance in plants. Structural comparisons with prokaryotic Class I CPD PHRs identified differences in the binding site for UV-damaged DNA substrate. Convergent evolution of both flavin hydrogen bonding and a Trp electron transfer pathway establish these as critical functional features for PHRs. These results provide a paradigm for light-dependent DNA repair in higher organisms."

MBL circulates in the complex with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs-1, -2, and -3).

The three polypeptide chains each consist of an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, followed by a collagenous region containing 19 Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplet repeats, an α-helical neck region, and a C-terminal calcium-dependent CRD (Fig. 1A) (2Drickamer K.

Biology of animal lectins.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In the rat, MBL forms oligomers, ranging only from monomers to tetramers, where the larger oligomers activate complement more effectively (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. Molecular determinants of oligomer formation and complement fixation in mannose-binding proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The human MBL oligomers include dimers and trimers and extend up to hexamers and octamers; the major forms of human MBL are also trimers and tetramers, whereas pentamers and hexamers occur in much lower amounts. Three naturally occurring mutations in the collagenous region of MBL lead to reduced complement activation through the lectin pathway as a result of low levels of oligomerization of the structural units (5Garred P.

For this to be effective, a better understanding of the MBL structure and oligomerization is required. mannose-binding lectin MBL-associated serine protease carbohydrate-recognition domain Protein Data Bank. The three-dimensional structures of the different forms of polymeric MBL are not well understood. Only the high resolution structures of the CRD and neck region of rat and human MBL have been determined by x-ray crystallography (9Sheriff S. Chang C.Y. Ezekowitz R.A.

The size of MBL, together with its glycosylation, extended collagenous region, and anticipated flexibility, suggests that the crystal structure determination of intact MBL will be difficult to achieve. The overall structure of MBL oligomers has been observed by electron microscopy as either near-planar (termed “sertiform”) or three-dimensional bouquet-like structures, with rod-like collagen stems joined at a base and topped by globular CRDs in proximity to each other (11Lu J.H.

Three sites of potential flexibility have been identified within the MBL structure. Flexibility may arise in the swivel region between the collagenous domain and neck region of MBL (9Sheriff S. Chang C.Y. Ezekowitz R.A. Human mannose-binding protein carbohydrate recognition domain trimerizes through a triple α-helical coiled-coil.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), within the collagenous region at the site of an interruption in the Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplet repeat (13Mohs A. Popiel M. Li Y. Baum J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 17197-17202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and/or at the junction between the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain and collagenous domain (Fig. 1B) (14Jensenius H. Klein D.C. van Hecke M. Oosterkamp T.H. Schmidt T. Jensenius J.C. Mannan-binding lectin. Structure, oligomerization, and flexibility studied by atomic force microscopy.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 246-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Atomic force microscopy images suggest that the N-terminal cysteine-rich regions of the MBL oligomers form a small “hub,” and the structural monomers are splayed apart in near-planar structures from the start of the collagenous regions (14Jensenius H. Klein D.C. van Hecke M. Oosterkamp T.H. Schmidt T. Jensenius J.C. Mannan-binding lectin. Structure, oligomerization, and flexibility studied by atomic force microscopy.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 246-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An angle of around 40° between the monomers was shown to be preferred. These most recent images suggested that the monomers did not extend outward from the central hub of MBL in a symmetric fashion as proposed previously (15Dong M. Xu S. Oliveira C.L. Pedersen J.S. Thiel S. Besenbacher F. Vorup-Jensen T. Conformational changes in mannan-binding lectin bound to ligand surfaces.J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3016-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the use of electron and atomic force microscopy may be affected by the experimental conditions, which may be harsh and may damage the sample or perturb the observed images. The use of solution structural determinations offers a powerful alternative approach. The solution arrangement of the monomers in oligomeric MBL was determined by the combination of x-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation data with their constrained modeling. This is a well established method for the overall solution structural determinations of large multidomain complement proteins and antibodies, where the structures are often verified by subsequent crystal structures. Examples include human complement factors H and I, complement receptor type 2, heparin and heparan sulfate, and the monomer, dimer, and secretory forms of human IgA (16Bonner A. Furtado P.B. Almogren A. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. Implications of the near-planar solution structure of human myeloma dimeric IgA1 for mucosal immunity and IgA nephropathy.J.

Medium resolution molecular models are determined that are deposited in the Protein Data Bank. To yield novel insights into MBL function, we applied this approach here to determine the solution structure of monomeric rat MBL that was defined starting from known crystal structures for the CRD and collagen regions. Based on this monomer structure, we determined mostly sertiform-like near-planar structures for the dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric forms of rat MBL. The resulting structures indicate that the CRD regions are positioned in proximity to each other and that oligomeric MBL in solution presents a multivalent surface to which the MASP proteins bind. These novel MBL structures are discussed in terms of clarifying the molecular mechanism for lectin pathway activation. Recombinant rat MBL-A was produced in a Chinese hamster ovary cell expression system and purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose columns (4Wallis R. Drickamer K.

Asymmetry adjacent to the collagen-like domain in rat liver mannose-binding protein.Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Oligomers were initially resolved by ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.2, containing 10 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 25 °C. Oligomers were eluted from the column using a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer over 45 min. The absorbance was monitored at 280 nm, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. MBL dimers, trimers, and tetramers were eluted as overlapping peaks from the column and were identified based on their migration pattern on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, under nonreducing conditions. The larger oligomers (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (16–60; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2 (without Ca2+ or magnesium; Invitrogen), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. SDS-PAGE was used to ensure the MBL oligomers were suitably pure for structural experiments (4Wallis R. Drickamer K.

The MBL amino acid composition was computed from its sequence (Swiss-Prot accession code P19999). The glycosylation of MBL was represented by four O-linked glucosylgalactosyl disaccharides per MBL polypeptide chain. The molecular mass of the MBL monomer was calculated to be 74.3 kDa (24.8 kDa per polypeptide chain), including these known post-translational modifications (4Wallis R. Drickamer K. Molecular determinants of oligomer formation and complement fixation in mannose-binding proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The unhydrated volume of the MBL monomer was determined to be 94.9 nm3. Its hydrated volume was calculated to be 125.2 nm3, based on a hydration of 0.3 g of H2O/g of glycoprotein and an electrostricted volume of 0.0245 nm3 per bound water molecule (20Perkins S.J. Protein volumes and hydration effects.

The absorbance coefficient at 280 nm (1%, 1 cm path length) was calculated to be 6.16. X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3. The buffer density at 20 °C was measured using an Anton-Paar DMA5000 density meter to be 1.011062 g/ml. X-ray scattering data were obtained on the Beamline ID02 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), operating with a ring energy of 6.0 GeV (21Narayanan T. Diat O. Bösecke P.

Data were collected for MBL oligomers in four-bunch mode using storage ring currents of 22–41 mA. The sample-to-detector distance was set to 2.0 m, which yielded a Q range from 0.04 to 2.4 nm−1 (where Q = 4 π sin θ/λ; 2θ = scattering angle; λ = wavelength). Concentration series for MBL oligomers were prepared in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, with concentrations between 0.31 and 0.46 mg/ml for MBL monomers, 0.29 and 1.15 mg/ml for MBL dimers, 0.23 and 0.92 mg/ml for MBL trimers, and 0.43 and 0.70 mg/ml for MBL tetramers. 100 μl of sample was loaded into a capillary flow cell, with a diameter of 1.7 mm. The sample was moved continuously during beam exposure to minimize radiation damage. Experimental data were collected at 20 °C. Four sets of 10 time frames, each of duration of 0.25 or 0.5 s, were acquired for each sample. Buffers were measured in alternation with the sample to minimize background subtraction errors. Following on-line checks to confirm the absence of radiation damage at low Q, the 10 frames were averaged for data analysis. Other details including the data reduction procedure have been described elsewhere (22Gilbert H.E. Eaton J.T. Hannan J.P. Holers V.M. Perkins S.J.

Biol. 2005; 346: 859-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In a given solute-solvent contrast, the radius of gyration Rg is a measure of structural elongation if the internal inhomogeneity of scattering densities within the protein has no effect. Guinier analysis at low Q gives the Rg, and the forward scattering at zero angle I(0) (23Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1,ln⁡l(Q)=ln⁡l(0)−Rg2Q2/3(Eq. 1) This expression is generally valid in a Q·Rg range up to 1.5. If the structure is elongated, the mean cross-sectional radius of gyration Rxs and the cross-sectional intensity at zero angle (I(Q)Q)Q→0 is obtained from the curve analyzed in a Q range that is larger than and not overlapping with the Q used for the Rg determination as shown in Equation 2,ln⁡(l(Q)⋅Q)=ln⁡(l(Q)⋅Q) Q→0−Rxs2Q2/2(Eq. 2) The Rg and Rxs analyses lead to the triaxial dimensions of the macromolecule if the structure can be represented by an elliptical cylinder, where L = √12(Rg2 − Rxs2) and L is its length (23Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982Google Scholar). The Rg and Rxs analyses were performed using an interactive PERL script program SCTPL7 5J. T. Eaton and S. J. Perkins, unpublished software. on Silicon Graphics OCTANE workstations. Indirect transformation of scattering data I(Q) in reciprocal space into real space to give the distance distribution function P(r) was carried out using the GNOM program (24Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. GNOM–a program package for small-angle scattering data processing.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (573) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 3,P(r)=12π2∫0∞ I(Q)Qrsin⁡(Qr)dQ(Eq. 3) The P(r) curve corresponds to the distribution of distances r between volume elements. For the MBL monomer, the x-ray I(Q) curves utilized 167 points in the Q range between 0.1 and 1.2 nm−1. For the MBL dimer, 174 points were used in the Q range between 0.1 and 2.0 nm−1. For the MBL trimer, 213 points were used in the Q range between 0.0 and 1.5 nm−1. For the MBL tetramer, 143 points were used in the Q range between 0.1 and 1.1 nm−1. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C using two Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuges (Beckman Coulter Inc., Palo, Alto, CA) at rotor speeds of 40,000 and 50,000 rpm. The instrument was equipped with an eight-hole AnTi50 rotor with standard double-sector cells with column heights of 12 mm. Sedimentation was monitored using absorbance optics at 280 nm and interference optics. The MBL dimer and trimer samples were prepared in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, at concentrations of 0.39 and 0.15 mg/ml, respectively. The sedimentation boundaries were analyzed using direct boundary Lamm fits of up to 300 scans using SEDFIT software (version 11.7) (25Schuck P. Sedimentation analysis of noninteracting and self-associating solutes using numerical solutions to the Lamm equation.Biophys.

Size distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and Lamm equation modeling.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). The continuous c(s) size distribution analysis algorithm assumes that all species have the same frictional ratio f/f0 in each fit. The final SEDFIT analyses used a fixed resolution of 200 and optimized the c(s) fit by floating the meniscus, bottom of the cell, the base line, and the frictional ratio f/f0 (initially 1.2) until the overall root mean square deviation and visual appearance of the fits were deemed satisfactory. The percentage of each MBL oligomer in the total loading concentration was derived using the c(s) integration function. The starting model for the rat MBL monomer was created using the unmodified crystal structure of the rat CRD/neck region (PDB code 1RTM) (10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Trimeric structure of a C-type mannose-binding protein.Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of a synthetic collagen triple helix peptide ((Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-Pro-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)5)3 (PDB code 1EI8) (27Bella J. Liu J. Kramer R. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Conformational effects of Gly-X-Gly interruptions in the collagen triple helix.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 298-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The collagen triple helix was manipulated using INSIGHT II 98.0 molecular graphics software (Accelrys, San Diego) on Silicon Graphics OCTANE workstations. Collagen fragments were created that were superimposed upon one another to obtain a structure with the sequence (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)5-Gly-Xaa-(Gly-Xaa-Yaa)12 to correspond to that of rat MBL collagen. The residues of this synthetic collagen triple helix were then substituted with those of rat MBL using the Biopolymer module in INSIGHT II. To join the CRD and collagen structures, 5,000 conformationally randomized linkers 88SRAI91 were created for superimposition onto the C-terminal Ser residue on the collagen domain and the N-terminal Ile residue on the CRD region. This linker peptide was initially created in an extended β-strand conformation. The randomized conformations were generated from this starting β-strand model by molecular dynamics simulation using DISCOVER3 at a temperature of 773 K (28Boehm M.K. Woof J.M. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J.

Implications for function and therapy.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 525-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). First, the peptide structure was subjected to energy minimization for 300 iterations. After a temperature equilibrium step of 5,000 fs, the simulation was run for 500,000 fs, saving this every 100 fs to produce the 5,000 models. A linear model of monomeric MBL was created by defining one vector along the long axis of the collagen triple helix region (Cα atoms of Gly-36 and Gly-86 on chains B and C) and another on that of the CRD region (Cα atoms of Val-93 and Thr-131 on chains B and C) and then measuring the angle between the two vectors. Models with vector angles close to 180° were visually inspected to identify the most satisfactory linear structure. The cysteine-rich N-terminal tails were constructed in extended β-strand conformations using Biopolymer and were superimposed onto the MBL collagen N-terminal peptides. Four glycosylgalactosyl disaccharides were added to residues Lys-44, Lys-47, Lys-79, and Lys-82 in each of the three collagen polypeptide chains to create the starting model for the rat MBL monomer. The starting model for the MBL monomer was optimized using four fit searches to assess the interdomain linker structures. The first search fit optimized the linker between the collagen triple helix and the CRD of chain A of MBL. To enable the search of wider conformational orientations, a longer six-residue linker peptide 87DSRAIE92 was initially created in an extended β-strand conformation and then 5,000 random conformations were generated following the above procedure. Each of the 5,000 MBL models for the MBL monomer was created by superimposition of the N- and C-terminal residues of each linker conformation onto the C- and N-terminal residues of the collagen and CRD regions, respectively. After this, the duplicated superimposed residues were deleted from the MBL monomer model prior to carrying out the scattering calculations. The second, third, and fourth search fits for the MBL monomer optimized the connection between the collagen triple helix and each of the three cysteine-rich N-terminal peptides using the best-fit MBL model from the first cycle of fits. A linker library containing 5,000 different conformations of the arbitrarily selected sequence 35CGRDGRD41 was generated as before. These linkers were used to connect the extended N-terminal peptides to the collagen triple helix in chains A, B, and C. In each search fit, the best-fit model for one N-terminal peptide was identified and retained for the next search fit until all three N-terminal peptides had been positioned. To calculate the modeled x-ray scattering curves for comparison with the experimental curves, each MBL monomer model was converted into Debye spheres. A cube side length of 0.538 nm with a cutoff of four atoms consistently gave models within 3% of their total unhydrated volume of 94.9 nm3 (see above). The hydration shell surrounding glycoproteins is detected by x-ray scattering, and thus the sphere models were accordingly adapted by adding spheres to the surface of the unhydrated models using HYPRO based on a hydrated volume of 125.2 nm3 (see above) (30Ashton A.W. Boehm M.K. Gallimore J.R. Pepys M.B. Perkins S.J. Pentameric and decameric structures in solution of serum amyloid P component by x-ray and neutron scattering and molecular modeling analyses.J. Mol.

A molecular interpretation based on sequence predictions and modeling fits.Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The optimal total of hydrated spheres for the MBL monomer was 828. The scattering curve I(Q) was calculated using the Debye equation adapted to spheres. No instrumental corrections were applied because these are negligible for the pinhole optics of Beamline ID02. Potential steric overlap between the CRD and collagen regions was assessed using the number of spheres N in the models following grid transformation, where models showing less than ∼97% of the required total of 828 spheres were discarded. In all four fit searches, less than half the models met this “absence of steric overlap” criterion. The models were then assessed by calculation of their Rg and Rxs−1 values in the same Q ranges as were used for the experimental Guinier fits. Models that passed the N, Rg, and Rxs−1 filters were then ranked using a goodness-of-fit (R-factor) defined by analogy with protein crystallography using the experimental curves in a Q range extending up to 1.2 nm−1. Sedimentation coefficients s20,w for the best-fit scattering models were calculated directly from the atomic coordinates in the HYDROPRO shell modeling program using the default value of 0.31 nm for the atomic element radius for all atoms to represent the hydration shell (32García De La Torre J.

Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31949-31959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Somatostatin (also known as somatotropin release-inhibiting factor, SRIF) is a peptide, which was initially identified in the hypotalami (2Brazeau P. Vale W. Burgus R. Ling N. Butcher M. Rivier J. Guillemin R. Hypothalamic polypeptide that inhibits the secretion of immunoreactive pituitary growth hormone.Science. 1973; 179: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar). It inhibits the secretion of growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone in the anterior pituitary gland. Additionally, somatostatin is found in a number of other tissues where it generally acts as a negative regulator of a variety of biological functions. Cardiac effects of somatostatin have not been completely elucidated. Exposure of guinea pig papillary muscles to somatostatin inhibits the isoprenaline-induced positive inotropic response without altering the basal contractile tension (3Endou M. Hattori Y. Nakaya H. Kanno M. Differential effects of somatostatin on atrial and ventricular contractile responses in guinea pig heart: influence of pretreatment with islet-activating protein.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 250: 726-733PubMed Google Scholar) and studies with rat ventricular cardiomyocytes have also revealed a negative inotropic effect in the presence of β-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline (4Murray F. Bell D. Kelso E.J. Millar B.C. McDermott B.J. Positive and negative contractile effects of somatostatin-14 on rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 37: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). On the other hand, treatment of acromegalic patients with somatostatin analogues has suggested an improvement in myocardial contractility (5Bogazzi F. Di B. V Palagi C. Donne M.G. Di C.A. Gavioli S. Talini E. Cosci C. Sardella C. Brogioni S. Mariani M. Martino E.

The diversity in cardiac effects of somatostatin may be due to expression and involvement of multiple receptor subtypes in the heart. There are five distinct somatostatin receptor proteins (somatostatin-transfected receptors, SSTRs) discovered so far, and four of those (SSTR1, SSTR2, SSTR4, and SSTR5) are expressed in the adult human atria and ventricle, whereas all subtypes (SSTR1–5) are expressed in adult rat cardiomyocytes (6Bruno J.F.

Somatostatin binding affinity toward different receptor subtypes varies, and therefore it is not surprising that different concentrations of somatostatin have been shown to have distinct biological effects (9Møller L.N. Stidsen C.E. Hartmann B. Holst J.J. Somatostatin receptors.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1616: 1-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). All five somatostatin receptor subtypes belong to G protein-coupled receptor subfamily, and somatostatin has been shown to participate in the regulation of adenylate cyclase, Ca2+-channels, K-channels, phosphoinositide (PI), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (9Møller L.N. Stidsen C.E. Hartmann B. Holst J.J. Somatostatin receptors.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1616: 1-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To date, there are no specific receptors identified for neuronostatin. Samson et al. (1Samson W.K. Zhang J.V. Avsian-Kretchmer O. Cui K. Yosten G.L. Klein C. Lyu R.M. Wang Y.X. Chen X.Q. Yang J.

Existing data of the effects of neuronostatin on the heart are derived from a study carried out in washout experiments in Langendorff-perfused hearts or in isolated cells using chemical inhibitors H89, chelerythrine, and SP600125 (10Hua Y. Ma H. Samson W.K. Ren J. Neuronostatin inhibits cardiac contractile function via a protein kinase A- and JNK-dependent mechanism in murine hearts.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2009; 297: R682-R689Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms regulated by neuronostatin remain unidentified and biological effects of neuronostatin in cardiomyocytes are not known. To address these issues, we performed studies with paced perfused isolated rat hearts and isolated neonatal rat and adult mouse cardiomyocytes, and investigated the effects of neuronostatin on cardiac contractility, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte viability, and regulation intracellular signaling mechanisms. We show that neuronostatin treatment alone has no effect on cardiac contractile function, but it significantly inhibits endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced left ventricular contractility. Neuronostatin treatment induces phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the adult rat heart. Prolonged treatment of isolated cardiomyocytes with neuronostatin compromises cardiomyocyte viability, and inhibition of JNK results in further increase in neuronostatin-induced cell death. Neuronostatin, somatostatin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and endothelin-1 were purchased from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Burlingame, CA). JNK inhibitor peptide (JNK inhibitor I) was from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany) and SB203580 from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Antibodies against phosphoprotein kinase C-α (PKCα) and GAPDH were from Millipore (Billerica, MA) and antibody against phosphorylated JNK was from Promega (Madison WI). All other antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and all other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. All protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Oulu. Male 7-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats from the Center for Experimental Animals at the University of Oulu were used. Rats were decapitated, and hearts were quickly removed and arranged for retrograde perfusion by the Langendorff technique as described previously (12Martini J.S. Raake P. Vinge L.E. DeGeorge Jr., B. Chuprun J.K. Harris D.M. Gao E. Eckhart A.D. Pitcher J.A. Koch W.J. Uncovering G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 as a histone deacetylase kinase in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The hearts were perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.40, equilibrated with 95% O2-5% CO2 at 37 °C. Hearts were perfused at a constant flow rate of 5.5 ml/min with a peristaltic pump (Minipuls 3, model 312, Gilson, Villiers, France). Heart rate was maintained constant (305 ± 1 beats per minute) by atrial pacing using a Grass stimulator (model S88, Grass Instruments, West Warwick, RI) (11 V, 0.5 ms). Contractile force (apicobasal displacement) was obtained by connecting a force displacement transducer (FT03, Grass Instruments, West Warwick, RI) to the apex of the heart at an initial preload stretch of 2 g. Perfusion pressure reflecting coronary vascular resistance was measured by a pressure transducer (model MP-15, Micron Instruments, Los Angeles, CA) situated on a side arm of the aortic cannula. A 40-min equilibration period and a 5-min control period were followed by addition of various drugs to the perfusate at a rate of 0.5 ml/min for 10 min. For analysis of the Frank-Starling response, left ventricular contractility was assessed by measuring isovolumic left ventricular pressure with a fluid-filled balloon placed in the left ventricular chamber as described (13Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Decoy oligonucleotide characterization of GATA-4 transcription factor in hypertrophic agonist induced responses of cardiac myocytes.J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). LVDP (left ventricular developed pressure) and LVEDP (left ventricular end diastolic pressure) were measured using a pressure transducer linked to the balloon cannula (model BP-100 Blood Pressure Transducer, iWorx Systems Inc., Washington). Data were converted to a digital form by iWorx computer interface (IX/228-S Data Acquisition System) and recorded to a computer using iWorx Labscribe 2 software. A 40-min stabilization period was followed by 10 min of pretreatment with the desired drug. Thereafter, the infusion was continued, and the volume of the intraventricular balloon was increased in 15-μl steps. Cardiac function was assessed within 1 min of each volume increment, when a new steady state was reached. The whole assessment of the Frank-Starling response was completed within 15 min. At the end of the experiments, the LVs were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until assayed. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were prepared from 2–4-day-old Spraque-Dawley rats as described (11Kerkelä R. Pikkarainen S. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Ruskoaho H. Distinct roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in GATA-4 transcription factor-mediated regulation of B-type natriuretic peptide gene.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13752-13760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Neuronostatin, somatostatin, hydroxen peroxide, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor were added to culture medium at the third day of culture. The Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Oulu approved the experimental design. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from 8–10-week-old c57BL/6 mice as described (12Martini J.S. Raake P. Vinge L.E. DeGeorge Jr., B. Chuprun J.K. Harris D.M. Gao E. Eckhart A.D. Pitcher J.A. Koch W.J. Uncovering G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 as a histone deacetylase kinase in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mouse was deeply anesthesized, and the heart was excised rapidly. The heart was cannulated through aorta and retrogradily perfused with Hepes-buffered Tyrode's solution supplemented with 0.1% collagenase type II (Worthington) and 2,3-butandione-monoxime until digested. Ventricular tissue was homogenized, and myocytes were collected with low-speed centrifugation. Myocytes were finally plated into laminin-coated multiwell plates in MEM, 5% FBS, insulin-transferrin-selenin (Invitrogen), 10 mm 2,3-butandione-monoxime, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma). After cell attachment, medium was changed, and FBS replaced with 0.01% BSA when starting the experiment. The protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Oulu. Cardiomyocyte protein synthesis was measured by analyzing [3H]leucine incorporation into the cells as previously described (13Pikkarainen S. Kerkelä R. Pöntinen J. Majalahti-Palviainen T. Tokola H. Eskelinen S. Vuolteenaho O. Ruskoaho H. Decoy oligonucleotide characterization of GATA-4 transcription factor in hypertrophic agonist induced responses of cardiac myocytes.J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were cultured in 24-well plates, and on the third day in culture the medium was replaced with complete serum-free medium supplemented with [3H]leucine (5 μCi/ml) and, when appropriate, treated with neuronostatin and other compounds. After 24 h cells were lysed and processed for measurement of incorporated [3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences-Pharmacia) by liquid scintillation counter. Analysis of adenylate kinase release from ruptured cells into the cell culture medium by using a kit from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) as described (14Kerkelä R. Grazette L. Yacobi R. Iliescu C.

Cardiotoxicity of the cancer therapeutic agent imatinib mesylate.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Analysis for apoptotic cell death was performed by using TUNEL kit from Millipore (Billerica, MA). The effect of neuronostatin on the viability of adult cardiomyocytes was determined with resazurin assay which quantifies the reduction of resazurin to a fluorescent compound resorufin within viable cells (15Pollari E. Savchenko E. Jaronen M. Kanninen K. Malm T. Wojciechowski S. Ahtoniemi T. Goldsteins G. Giniatullina R. Giniatullin R. Koistinaho J. Magga J. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor attenuates inflammation in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.J. Neuroinflammation. 2011; 8: 74Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For analysis, 10 μm resazurin (Sigma) was added to the cell culture medium at the end of the experiment. 1 h later, medium samples were collected into 96-well plate and measured by excitation at 544 nm and emission at 595 nm on a multiplate reader (Victor Wallac). Immunoblotting was performed as described (16Kerkela R. Woulfe K.C. Durand J.B. Vagnozzi R. Kramer D. Chu T.F. Beahm C. Chen M.H. Force T. Sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated by off-target inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase.Clin. Transl. Sci. 2009; 2: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Shortly, the samples were homogenized into a buffer, which consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm M EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton-X100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4 (pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein extracts were matched for protein concentration (20–50 μg), loaded on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The membranes were blocked in blocking buffer, incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and amount of protein was detected by Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska). Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed with Student's t test and for analysis of multiple experimental groups, repeated measures- or one way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test was used. Differences were considered statistically significant at the level of p < 0.05. We first analyzed the effect of neuronostatin on auxotonic contractions in an isolated rat heart model (17Szokodi I. Tavi P. Földes G. Voutilainen-Myllylä S. Ilves M. Tokola H. Pikkarainen S. Piuhola J. Rysä J. Tóth M. Ruskoaho H. Apelin, the novel endogenous ligand of the orphan receptor APJ, regulates cardiac contractility.Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Previous data suggest that neuronostatin has a negative inotropic effect that is observed with a dose ranging from 0.3 to 30 nm (10Hua Y. Ma H. Samson W.K. Ren J. Neuronostatin inhibits cardiac contractile function via a protein kinase A- and JNK-dependent mechanism in murine hearts.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2009; 297: R682-R689Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We treated the isolated paced rat hearts with 0.1 nm, 1 nm, and 10 nm doses of neuronostatin and found a modest yet nonsignificant decrease in left ventricular contractile function during the 15-min experiment (Fig. 1A). We also extended the experiment time to 30 min and treated the hearts with 10 nm of neuronostatin, but that had no significant effect on cardiac contractile function (data not shown). We next analyzed the effect of neuronostatin on the Frank-Starling response in isolated perfused rat hearts. In this experimental system (17Szokodi I. Tavi P. Földes G. Voutilainen-Myllylä S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24852-24860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), stepwise increases in the volume of the left ventricular balloon resulted in prominent enhancement of left ventricular systolic function. The maximal point on the Frank-Starling curve was reached at an end-diastolic pressure of 20–25 mmHg with a corresponding left ventricular systolic pressure of 90–120 mmHg. We found that treatment of isolated hearts with either 1 nm (not shown) or 10 nm neuronostatin had no effect on the Frank-Starling response (Fig. 1B). We then exposed the hearts to intracoronary perfusion with potent β1/β2-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline. Infusion of 1 μm isoprenaline induced a rapid increase in developed tension that peaked at 1 min time point (Fig. 1C). At 10 min, the left ventricular develop tension was returned near to the baseline values. Coadministration of neuronostatin (10 nm) had no effect on isoprenaline-induced developed tension. We then assessed the effect of neuronostatin on left ventricular function in paced perfused rat heart during intracoronary infusion of 1 nm ET-1 for 10 min. In agreement with the maximal response in our previous studies (20Szokodi I. Kerkelä R. Kubin A.M. Sármán B. Pikkarainen S. Kónyi A. Horváth I.G. Papp L. Tóth M. Skoumal R. Ruskoaho H. Functionally opposing roles of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in the regulation of cardiac contractility.Circulation. 2008; 118: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), ET-1 increased developed tension by 51 ± 4% (Fig. 2). Administration of neuronostatin (10 nm) together with ET-1 significantly attenuated the ET-1 induced increase in contractility (Fig. 2). Coadministration of neuronostatin at 1 nm dose had a modest but nonsignificant negative effect on ET-1 induced LV contractile function, whereas 0.1 nm concentration of neuronostatin was without effect (data not shown). We next analyzed the effect of neuronostatin on activation of intracellular signaling pathways upon ET-1 stimulation in the perfused rat heart. We found that 10-min ET-1 infusion induced a marked increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and coadministration of 10 nm neuronostatin significantly augmented the effect (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, administration of 10 nm neuronostatin alone also resulted in comparable increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). As noted, 1 nm neuronostatin did not affect ET-1-induced increase in LV contractility. It was, however, sufficient to increase p38 phosphorylation in the adult heart (Fig. 3B). ET-1 treatment had no effect on JNK phosphorylation, whereas treatment with 10 nm neuronostatin alone or in combination with ET-1 resulted in a significant increase in JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). 1 nm neuronostatin induced a modest but non-significant increase in JNK phosphorylation (not shown). ET-1-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), however, was not affected by administration of neuronostatin (data not shown). We also analyzed the effect of neuronostatin on protein kinase A target troponin I. Administration of neuronostatin (10 nm) alone or in combination with ET-1 had no effect on phosphorylation of troponin I (TNI) at Ser-23/24 residue (Fig. 3C). To investigate the effects of a more extended exposure of cardiomyocytes to neuronostatin, cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were treated with various concentrations of neuronostatin and activation of key signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes was investigated. In agreement with our findings in the isolated heart, we found that administration of neuronostatin induced a robust increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which was most evident with 0.1 nm concentration (Fig. 4A). The neuronostatin-induced phosphorylation of p38 was seen already after 1 h of treatment, and was still strongly induced at 24 h. In contrast, exposure of cardiac myocytes to somatostatin had no effect on p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Treatment of cardiomyocytes with 0.1 nm neuronostatin had no effect on phosphorylation of Akt or ERK (Fig. 4B). To assess the effect of neuronostatin on cardiomyocyte viability, cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes were treated with various concentrations of neuronostatin and analyzed for both necrotic and apoptotic cell death. Cardiomyocyte necrosis was analyzed by release of cellular adenylate kinase from ruptured cells into the cell culture medium. Exposure of cardiomyocytes to neuronostatin for 16 h dose-dependently increased necrotic cardiomyocyte death (significant effect only at 100 nm) (Fig. 5A). Moreover, treatment of cells with neuronostatin also resulted in augmented hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced adenylate kinase release (Fig. 5B). However, 24-h treatment with 30 or 100 nm neuronostatin had no effect on cardiomyocyte apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL (Fig. 5C). To analyze the effect of neuronostatin on signaling mechanisms regulating cardiomyocyte viability, phosphorylation of key protective, and detrimental signaling pathways was investigated. We found that 90-min treatment of cultured cardiac myocytes with a high concentration of neuronostatin (100 nm) slightly decreased the amount of phosphorylated Akt, and markedly reduced the Akt phosphorylation upon H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5D). Phosphorylation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), JNK or ERK was not affected by treatment of cardiomyocytes with 10 or 100 nm neuronostatin (data not shown). We next analyzed the effect of neuronostatin on viability of adult cardiomyocytes. Isolated mouse cardiomyocytes were treated with neuronostatin for 24 h and cell death was analyzed by resazurin assay. This method is based on the reduction of resazurin to resorufin, a quantifiable fluorescent dye, within viable cells. We found that adult cardiomyocyte viability was already compromised by treatment of cells with 10 nm neuronostatin and further reduced by treatment with 30 nm neuronostatin (Fig. 5E). As shown in Fig. 3, neuronostatin induced a significant increase in p38 and JNK phosphorylation in the adult heart. To analyze if p38 or JNK played a role in neuronostatin induced cardiomyocyte death, we then cotreated the cardiomyocytes with p38 inhibitor SB203580 (5 μm) or with a cell-permeable JNK inhibitor peptide (2 μm). We found that p38 inhibition did not affect neuronostatin-induced cardiomyocyte death (not shown), while JNK inhibition further reduced the cardiomyocyte viability (Fig. 5E). Treatment of cells with JNK inhibitor alone did not affect cell viability (Fig. 5E). Postnatal cardiomyocytes rarely enter the cell cycle and, in fact, many of the signaling mechanisms promoting cell proliferation in cycling cells actually induce cell growth (i.e. hypertrophy) in cardiomyocytes. To assess the effect of neuronostatin on cell growth, we first analyzed the effects of neuronostatin on regulation of protein synthesis machinery in cardiomyocytes. Mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, is a central regulator of protein synthesis and cell growth. mTor complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates the activity of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2k) and its target, the elongation factor eEF2, which is a central regulator of protein synthesis (21Wang X. Proud C.G. The mTOR pathway in the control of protein synthesis.Physiology. 2006; 21: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We found that 24-hour treatment of cultured cardiomyocytes with 0.1 nm neuronostatin resulted in a significant decrease in phosphorylation of eEF2 (Fig. 6A). However, 1 nm and 10 nm doses of neuronostatin had little or no effect (data not shown). Prior studies have suggested that eEF2 kinase (eEF2k) is regulated by p38 MAPK, which negatively regulates eEF2k activity (22Knebel A. Haydon C.E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Stress-induced regulation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase by SB 203580-sensitive and -insensitive pathways.Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the phosphorylation of eEF2k and found that neuronostatin treatment resulted in increased phosphorylation of eEF2k at serine 359, a putative p38 MAPK target site (Fig. 6B). To then analyze the effect of neuronostatin on protein synthesis in cultured cardiomyocytes, cells were treated with neuronostatin alone or in combination with insulin-like growth"

https://openalex.org/W2113855963,"Calsequestrin (CASQ) serves as a major Ca(2+) storage/buffer protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). When purified from skeletal muscle, CASQ1 is obtained in its glycosylated form. Here, we have confirmed the specific site and degree of glycosylation of native rabbit CASQ1 and have investigated its effect on critical properties of CASQ by comparison with the non-glycosylated recombinant form. Based on our comparative approach utilizing crystal structures, Ca(2+) binding capacities, analytical ultracentrifugation, and light-scattering profiles of the native and recombinant rabbit CASQ1, we propose a novel and dynamic role for glycosylation in CASQ. CASQ undergoes a unique degree of mannose trimming as it is trafficked from the proximal endoplasmic reticulum to the SR. The major glycoform of CASQ (GlcNAc(2)Man(9)) found in the proximal endoplasmic reticulum can severely hinder formation of the back-to-back interface, potentially preventing premature Ca(2+)-dependent polymerization of CASQ and ensuring its continuous mobility to the SR. Only trimmed glycans can stabilize both front-to-front and the back-to-back interfaces of CASQ through extensive hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Therefore, the mature glycoform of CASQ (GlcNAc(2)Man(1-4)) within the SR can be retained upon establishing a functional high capacity Ca(2+) binding polymer. In addition, based on the high resolution structures, we propose a molecular mechanism for the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT2) mutation, K206N."

https://openalex.org/W2001011202,"Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase (SepCysS) catalyzes the sulfhydrylation of tRNA-bound O-phosphoserine (Sep) to form cysteinyl-tRNACys (Cys-tRNACys) in methanogens that lack the canonical cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS). A crystal structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus SepCysS apoenzyme provides information on the binding of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor as well as on amino acid residues that may be involved in substrate binding. However, the mechanism of sulfur transfer to form cysteine was not known. Using an in vivo Escherichia coli complementation assay, we showed that all three highly conserved Cys residues in SepCysS (Cys64, Cys67, and Cys272 in the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii enzyme) are essential for the sulfhydrylation reaction in vivo. Biochemical and mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that Cys64 and Cys67 form a disulfide linkage and carry a sulfane sulfur in a portion of the enzyme. These results suggest that a persulfide group (containing a sulfane sulfur) is the proximal sulfur donor for cysteine biosynthesis. The presence of Cys272 increased the amount of sulfane sulfur in SepCysS by 3-fold, suggesting that this Cys residue facilitates the generation of the persulfide group. Based upon these findings, we propose for SepCysS a sulfur relay mechanism that recruits both disulfide and persulfide intermediates. Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase (SepCysS) catalyzes the sulfhydrylation of tRNA-bound O-phosphoserine (Sep) to form cysteinyl-tRNACys (Cys-tRNACys) in methanogens that lack the canonical cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS). A crystal structure of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus SepCysS apoenzyme provides information on the binding of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor as well as on amino acid residues that may be involved in substrate binding. However, the mechanism of sulfur transfer to form cysteine was not known. Using an in vivo Escherichia coli complementation assay, we showed that all three highly conserved Cys residues in SepCysS (Cys64, Cys67, and Cys272 in the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii enzyme) are essential for the sulfhydrylation reaction in vivo. Biochemical and mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that Cys64 and Cys67 form a disulfide linkage and carry a sulfane sulfur in a portion of the enzyme. These results suggest that a persulfide group (containing a sulfane sulfur) is the proximal sulfur donor for cysteine biosynthesis. The presence of Cys272 increased the amount of sulfane sulfur in SepCysS by 3-fold, suggesting that this Cys residue facilitates the generation of the persulfide group. Based upon these findings, we propose for SepCysS a sulfur relay mechanism that recruits both disulfide and persulfide intermediates. IntroductionAminoacyl-tRNAs are normally synthesized by direct attachment of specific amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. However, at least four aminoacyl-tRNAs (Asn-tRNAAsn, Gln-tRNAGln, Cys-tRNACys, and Sec-tRNASec) can be generated through tRNA-dependent modification reactions (1.Sheppard K. Yuan J. Hohn M.J.

The SepRS/SepCysS pathway is the primary pathway for Cys biosynthesis in methanococci (3.Liu Y. Sieprawska-Lupa M. Whitman W.B. White R.H.

U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14292-14297Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SepRS and SepCysS are conserved in most methanogenic archaea (except the Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera species) and the Archaeoglobus species, which are sulfur-reducing archaea and have many enzymes of the methanogenesis pathway (7.O'Donoghue P. Sethi A. Woese C.R. Luthey-Schulten Z.A. The evolutionary history of Cys-tRNACys formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 19003-19008Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the SepRS/SepCysS pathway is perhaps ancient and was already present at the time of the last universal common ancestor (7.O'Donoghue P. Sethi A. Woese C.R. Luthey-Schulten Z.A. The evolutionary history of Cys-tRNACys formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 19003-19008Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).SepCysS is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme converting the tRNA-bound Sep moiety to cysteine using an undefined sulfur donor (2.Sauerwald A. Zhu W. Major T.A. Roy H. Palioura S. Jahn D. Whitman W.B. Yates 3rd, J.R. Ibba M. Söll D. RNA-dependent cysteine biosynthesis in archaea.Science. 2005; 307: 1969-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Sulfide, cysteine, and thiophosphate were sufficient sulfur donors in in vitro assays. However, all of them support only a very slow formation of cysteine (8.Hauenstein S.I. Perona J.J.

Therefore, the natural sulfur donor and the sulfur delivery mechanism of SepCysS remain unclear. A persulfide group is proposed to be a sulfur donor for cysteine biosynthesis, mainly based upon the fact that SepCysS is most closely related to cysteine desulfurase in terms of primary sequence (7.O'Donoghue P. Sethi A. Woese C.R. Luthey-Schulten Z.A. The evolutionary history of Cys-tRNACys formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 19003-19008Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and overall structure (9.Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Structural insights into the second step of RNA-dependent cysteine biosynthesis in archaea: crystal structure of Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cysteine desulfurase catalyzes sulfur transfer by mobilizing the thiol group of free cysteine, yielding a persulfide enzyme adduct and alanine (10.Kessler D. Enzymatic activation of sulfur for incorporation into biomolecules in prokaryotes.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The persulfidic sulfur (R-S-SH), which is covalently linked to a conserved Cys residue of cysteine desulfurase, is then donated to other sulfur carrier proteins for the biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters, thionucleotides, or sulfur-containing vitamins (11.Mueller E.G. Trafficking in persulfides: delivering sulfur in biosynthetic pathways.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Analogous to cysteine desulfurase, SepCysS may mobilize sulfur from a sulfur source, form a persulfide group on a Cys residue, and then donate the sulfur to Sep-tRNACys to generate Cys-tRNACys.Three Cys residues of SepCysS (Cys39, Cys42, and Cys247 of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus enzyme) have been proposed to be candidates for persulfidation according to two observations (9.Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Structural insights into the second step of RNA-dependent cysteine biosynthesis in archaea: crystal structure of Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). First, the three Cys residues are completely conserved in SepCysS, indicating that they are possibly essential for activity. Second, the crystal structure of A. fulgidus SepCysS showed that, similar to cysteine desulfurase, the enzyme forms a dimer, and the active cleft is located at the dimer interface. Cys247 is located near the active site in the crystal structure. Cys39 and Cys42, although located within a disordered region in the crystal structure, could be modeled proximal to the active site (9.Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Structural insights into the second step of RNA-dependent cysteine biosynthesis in archaea: crystal structure of Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, whether the three Cys residues are involved in sulfur delivery awaits further investigation.Here, we present that three Cys residues (Cys64, Cys67, and Cys272 of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii SepCysS corresponding to Cys39, Cys42, and Cys247 of the A. fulgidus enzyme) are essential for the sulfhydrylation reaction in vivo. More specifically, Cys64 and Cys67 are responsible for forming a disulfide linkage and carrying a sulfane sulfur. Therefore, we propose that through disulfide formation and disulfide-persulfide rearrangement, sulfur from a persulfide sulfur donor is transferred to SepCysS and in turn delivered to the tRNA-bound Sep for Cys-tRNACys formation.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here demonstrate that all three conserved Cys residues of SepCysS (Cys64, Cys67, and Cys272 in M. jannaschii SepCysS) are required for the conversion of the tRNA-bound Sep moiety to Cys. Furthermore, the formation of disulfide and trisulfide (presumably derived from an oxidation of a persulfide and a thiol group or from a reaction between two persulfide group to expel a bisulfide) linkages between Cys64 and Cys67 suggests that SepCysS employs both disulfide and persulfide intermediates for sulfur transfer.The requirement of multiple cysteines for sulfur transfer by SepCysS resembles the sulfur relay enzymes for tRNA thiolation, e.g. ThiI for 4-thiouridine biosynthesis (23.Wright C.M. Christman G.D. Snellinger A.M. Johnston M.V. Mueller E.G. Direct evidence for enzyme persulfide and disulfide intermediates during 4-thiouridine biosynthesis.Chem. Commun. 2006; 29: 3104-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24.Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. The role of the cysteine residues of ThiI in the generation of 4-thiouridine in tRNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33588-33595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and MnmA for 2-thiouridine biosynthesis (25.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. MnmA and IscS are required for in vitro 2-thiouridine biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26.Numata T. Ikeuchi Y. Fukai S. Suzuki T. Nureki O. Snapshots of tRNA sulfuration via an adenylated intermediate.Nature. 2006; 442: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For both ThiI and MnmA, two cysteines are required for catalysis: one cysteine receives a sulfane sulfur from cysteine desulfurase and forms a persulfide enzyme adduct, and the other cysteine attacks the bridging sulfur of the persulfide to liberate the terminal sulfur and consequently forms a disulfide with the first cysteine. Based upon our findings that a disulfide is present in the resting state of SepCysS and both Cys64 and Cys67 are required for the formation of a persulfide, it is conceivable that a sulfur donor (equivalent of S2−) may attack one sulfur of the disulfide linkage to generate a persulfide on either Cys64 or Cys67, leaving the other Cys as a free thiol (Fig. 6). Then, a thiolate derived from deprotonation of the free thiol can attack the bridging sulfur of the persulfide to liberate the terminal sulfur for cysteine biosynthesis and consequently regenerate the disulfide for the next catalytic cycle (Fig. 6). This reaction scheme can also explain the in vitro activity with sulfide, which may directly attack the disulfide of SepCysS or the double bond of the dehydroalanyl moiety (8.Hauenstein S.I. Perona J.J. Redundant synthesis of cysteinyl-tRNACys in Methanosarcina mazei.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22007-22017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Although a S2− equivalent is likely a sulfur donor for the persulfidation of SepCysS (described above), the low in vitro sulfhydrylation activity of SepCysS with sodium sulfide suggested that bisulfide is unlikely to be the physiological sulfur donor (2.Sauerwald A. Zhu W. Major T.A. Roy H. Palioura S. Jahn D. Whitman W.B. Yates 3rd, J.R. Ibba M. Söll D. RNA-dependent cysteine biosynthesis in archaea.Science. 2005; 307: 1969-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8.Hauenstein S.I. Perona J.J.

Because SepCysS was able to receive sulfur from the IscS persulfide, an unidentified protein-carrying persulfide possibly provides the sulfur for the persulfidation of SepCysS. The nature of the protein sulfur carrier is still under investigation. In analogy to the sulfur transfer from IscS to IscU, which forms disulfide-bridged IscS-IscU complex during iron-sulfur cluster assembly (27.Kato S. Mihara H. Kurihara T. Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. Cys-328 of IscS and Cys-63 of IscU are the sites of disulfide bridge formation in a covalently bound IscS/IscU complex: implications for the mechanism of iron-sulfur cluster assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5948-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), if the persulfide of a sulfur carrier protein nucleophilically attacks the disulfide of SepCysS, then an intermolecular disulfide between SepCysS and the sulfur carrier protein would be expected as a result of persulfide group transfer. In this scenario, an exogenous reductant would be required to dissociate the sulfur carrier protein from SepCysS and regenerate free thiol groups.Although a disulfide or sulfane sulfur was not observed on Cys272 in our experiments, the reduced level of persulfide group in the C272A mutant suggested that Cys272 may facilitate the formation of the persulfide enzyme adduct. Moreover, replacement of Cys272 with Ser also abolished the activity of SepCysS (32.Helgadóttir S. Sinapah S. Söll D. Ling J. Mutational analysis of Sep-tRNA: Cys-tRNA synthase reveals critical residues for tRNA-dependent cysteine formation.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 60-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting that a covalent modification on Cys272 is likely required for in vivo sulfur transfer. Scenarios such as that Cys272 serves as an initial nucleophilic group that attacks on a persulfide sulfur donor or as a general acid-base that deprotonates Cys64 or Cys67 can account for the observations, but further investigations are required to clarify its function.This study provides a framework for understanding the sulfur transfer for the formation of Cys-tRNACys by SepCysS. SepCysS is a first example that recruits both persulfide and disulfide intermediates in methanogens. Given the obligately anaerobic lifestyle of methanogens, the mechanism of maintaining the relatively oxidized persulfide and disulfide species in the reducing cytoplasm is unclear. Because methanogens lack glutathione (28.Newton G.L. Javor B. γ-Glutamylcysteine and thiosulfate are the major low-molecular-weight thiols in halobacteria.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 438-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.McFarlan S.C. Terrell C.A. Hogenkamp H.P.

Furthermore, the enzyme that delivers sulfur to SepCysS remains an open question for future research. Because cysteine desulfurase is not encoded in M. jannaschii and many other methanogens (3.Liu Y. Sieprawska-Lupa M. Whitman W.B. White R.H. Cysteine is not the sulfur source for iron-sulfur cluster and methionine biosynthesis in the methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31923-31929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and cysteine should not be the ultimate sulfur donor for Cys-tRNACys biosynthesis, a new type of enzyme that can initiate the generation of persulfide from a noncysteine sulfur source would be responsible for the persulfidation of SepCysS. Identification of this enzyme and its intermediates would more thoroughly elucidate the Cys-tRNACys biosynthetic system and may shed light on a general mechanism of sulfur metabolism in methanogenic archaea.

https://openalex.org/W1970690194,"The protozoan Giardia lamblia parasitizes the human small intestine to cause diseases. It undergoes differentiation into infectious cysts by responding to intestinal stimulation. How the activated signal transduction pathways relate to encystation stimulation remain largely unknown. During encystation, genes encoding cyst wall proteins (CWPs) are coordinately up-regulated by a Myb2 transcription factor. Because cell differentiation is linked to cell cycle regulation, we tried to understand the role of cell cycle regulators, cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), in encystation. We found that the recombinant Myb2 was phosphorylated by Cdk-associated complexes and the levels of phosphorylation increased significantly during encystation. We have identified a putative cdk gene (cdk2) by searching the Giardia genome database. Cdk2 was found to localize in the cytoplasm with higher expression during encystation. Interestingly, overexpression of Cdk2 resulted in a significant increase of the levels of cwp gene expression and cyst formation. In addition, the Cdk2-associated complexes can phosphorylate Myb2 and the levels of phosphorylation increased significantly during encystation. Mutations of important catalytic residues of Cdk2 resulted in a significant decrease of kinase activity and ability of inducing cyst formation. Addition of a Cdk inhibitor, purvalanol A, significantly decreased the Cdk2 kinase activity and the levels of cwp gene expression and cyst formation. Our results suggest that the Cdk2 pathway may be involved in phosphorylation of Myb2, leading to activation of the Myb2 function and up-regulation of cwp genes during encystation. The results provide insights into the use of Cdk inhibitory drugs in disruption of Giardia differentiation into cysts."
https://openalex.org/W1984617221,"Regulation of the assembly and function of G-protein heterotrimers (Gα·GDP/Gβγ) is a complex process involving the participation of many accessory proteins. One of these regulators, GPSM3, is a member of a family of proteins containing one or more copies of a small regulatory motif known as the GoLoco (or GPR) motif. Although GPSM3 is known to bind Gαi·GDP subunits via its GoLoco motifs, here we report that GPSM3 also interacts with the Gβ subunits Gβ1 to Gβ4, independent of Gγ or Gα·GDP subunit interactions. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation studies suggest that the Gβ-GPSM3 complex is formed at, and transits through, the Golgi apparatus and also exists as a soluble complex in the cytoplasm. GPSM3 and Gβ co-localize endogenously in THP-1 cells at the plasma membrane and in a juxtanuclear compartment. We provide evidence that GPSM3 increases Gβ stability until formation of the Gβγ dimer, including association of the Gβ-GPSM3 complex with phosducin-like protein PhLP and T-complex protein 1 subunit eta (CCT7), two known chaperones of neosynthesized Gβ subunits. The Gβ interaction site within GPSM3 was mapped to a leucine-rich region proximal to the N-terminal side of its first GoLoco motif. Both Gβ and Gαi·GDP binding events are required for GPSM3 activity in inhibiting phospholipase-Cβ activation. GPSM3 is also shown in THP-1 cells to be important for Akt activation, a known Gβγ-dependent pathway. Discovery of a Gβ/GPSM3 interaction, independent of Gα·GDP and Gγ involvement, adds to the combinatorial complexity of the role of GPSM3 in heterotrimeric G-protein regulation.

In the standard model of GPCR signaling, ligand binding to the receptor evokes a conformational change that allows it to convert Gα from the inactive GDP-bound form to the active GTP-bound form (7Chung K.Y.

Signal termination occurs via the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of Gα that restores its GDP-bound state and allows re-association with the Gβγ dimer; a family of “regulators of G-protein signaling” (RGS proteins) can dramatically speed this termination by acting as GTPase-accelerating proteins for various Gα subtypes (4McCoy K.L.

This biochemical activity is attributed to the first and third GoLoco motifs (GL1 and GL3) of the GPSM3 sequence; we have shown that the second GoLoco motif is inactive because of degeneracy within a critical (E/D)QR triad normally highly conserved within GoLoco motifs (11Willard F.S.

Beyond in vitro guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity and a recent report that GPSM3-Gαi1 complex formation can be affected by G-protein-coupled receptor activation (21Oner S.S. Maher E.M. Breton B. Bouvier M. Blumer J.B. Receptor-regulated interaction of activator of G-protein signaling-4 and Gαi.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20588-20594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), very little has been reported about the functional relevance of GPSM3 to cellular signal transduction. Here, we report studies stemming from a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified Gβ subunits as GPSM3 interactors. Expanding its known repertoire of interactors and functions, GPSM3 was found to interact with free Gβ subunits (in a manner not dependent on the established GoLoco motif/Gαi interaction) and modulate cellular signal transduction via the Gβγ effector PLCβ. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Anti-β-actin, anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody were purchased from Sigma. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from GE Healthcare. Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) and anti-Akt were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The expression plasmid for HA-tagged LPA1R was purchased from The Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center (Rolla, MO). All other cDNAs used in this study were cloned in the pcDNA3.1 backbone vector (Invitrogen) with HA, Myc, or FLAG epitope tag sequences included in the forward PCR primer to produce N-terminally tagged open reading frames. All mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's recommendations (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The two GPSM3-specific shRNAs used in this study were developed by The RNAi Consortium and acquired from University of North Carolina Lenti-shRNA Core Facility through Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). The pLKO.1 self-inactivating lentiviral vector drives shRNA expression from a human U6 promoter and carries the puromycin-resistance gene under control of a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Lentiviruses were produced by transient transfection of pLKO.1 vector plasmids in human HEK293T cells along with packaging plasmid (pCMVΔ8.9) and envelope plasmid (VSV-G pHCMV-G) provided by The RNAi Consortium. Stable THP-1 cell lines expressing GPSM3-specific shRNA were produced by lentiviral infection following the protocol of The RNAi Consortium. Briefly, exponentially growing THP-1 cell cultures at low passage were infected with a 1:10 dilution of lentivirus in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro, Manassas, VA) and containing 8 μg/ml of Polybrene (Sigma). 48 h following lentiviral infection, puromycin (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and cells were selected for 8 days. Full-length N-terminally His-tagged human GPSM3 protein was produced recombinantly in bacteria from a pET vector-based prokaryotic expression construct using previously described cloning, expression, and purification techniques (22Johnston C.A. Taylor J.P. Gao Y. Kimple A.J. Grigston J.C. Chen J.G. Siderovski D.P. Jones A.M. Willard F.S. GTPase acceleration as the rate-limiting step in Arabidopsis G protein-coupled sugar signaling.Proc.

Briefly, BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli expressing His6-hGPSM3 was grown to an A600 nm of 0.8 at 37 °C before induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After culturing for 14–16 h at 20 °C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C. Bacterial pellets were then purified using HisTrap FF column chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare) and buffer exchanged into PBS by dialysis. Mouse immunization and hybridoma development to produce the mouse monoclonal anti-GPSM3 antibody 35.5.1 were performed under the auspices of the University of North Carolina Immunology Core (director, Dr. Bradley Bone). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293), African green monkey kidney fibroblast (COS-7), and THP-1 cell lines were each obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in DMEM or RPMI 1640 medium (THP-1) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro, Manassas, VA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transient transfections of cell monolayers grown to 75–90% confluence were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C on a rocker platform for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and quantified by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein content assay (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with specific antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by overnight incubation with protein-A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or directly incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody overnight. Pelleted antibody-bead complexes were then washed three times with lysis buffer and proteins eluted in Laemmli buffer. Eluted proteins or lysate samples were resolved on 4–12% precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex/Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose, immunoblotted using primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-GPSM3 after cellular co-transfection of FLAG-GPSM3 and HA-Gβ2 DNA constructs was performed as described above from 6 wells of a 6-well plate with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody overnight and resolved on 4–12% precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gel was fixed and stained with SYPRO Ruby gel stain following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The band of interest was excised and sent to MS Bioworks LLC (Ann Arbor, MI) for processing and analysis by nano-LC/MS/MS. COS-7 and HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 and 6 × 105 cells per well, respectively. The next day, cells were transfected with DNA plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following day, cells were metabolically labeled for 18 h with myo-[3H]inositol at 8 μCi/ml in inositol-free DMEM (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) containing 0.5% BSA and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated in prewarmed DMEM (without inositol) containing 0.5% BSA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 35 mm LiCl for 10 min. Thereafter, cells were stimulated with 10 μm lysophosphatidic acid (or vehicle control) for 60 min. Following stimulation, the medium was removed, and the reactions were terminated by addition of 150 μl of 50 mm formic acid and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Then 50 μl of formic acid supernatant was mixed with 75 μl of 2.67 mg/ml SPA beads diluted in ice-cold water (RNA-binding YSi beads, GE Healthcare) in a 96-well/plate and agitated at 4 °C for 30 min. The radioactivity was counted with a Wallac MicroBeta luminescence counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fusion constructs were made similar to those previously described for Gβγ tracking (23Lambert N.A. Johnston C.A. Cappell S.D. Kuravi S. Kimple A.J. Willard F.S. Siderovski D.P. Regulators of G-protein signaling accelerate GPCR signaling kinetics and govern sensitivity solely by accelerating GTPase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

HEK293 cells were transfected with an equal amount of plasmids encoding the fusion proteins YN-GPSM3 and Gβ2-YC, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Total DNA quantity was normalized using empty pcDNA3.1 vector DNA. To measure fluorescence from formed complexes, transfected cells were washed, harvested, and resuspended in PBS. BiFC signal was acquired using a Mithras LB-940 plate reader (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN) using an excitation/emission filter set of 485 and 510 nm. The level of expression of each fusion protein was quantified by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody directed against the GFP. HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates (3.5 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with a fixed amount of Gβ1-Rluc vector DNA (50 ng) and with increasing amounts of GFP10-GPSM3 vector DNA (0–1500 ng) and corresponding (decreasing) amounts of pcDNA3 empty vector (1500 to 0 ng) to obtain a saturation curve. The competition BRET assay was performed by transfecting cells with 50 ng of Gγ2-RLuc vector, 750 ng of GFP10-Gβ1 vector with 750 ng of FLAG-GPSM3 or pcDNA3 vector, or by transfecting 50 ng of Gβ1-RLuc vector and 750 ng GFP10-GPSM3 vector with 750 ng of HA-Gγ2 or pcDNA3 vector. 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed once, harvested, and resuspended in BRET buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% glucose) and distributed in white 96-wells microplates. BRET was initiated by adding coelenterazine 400a at a final concentration of 5 μm. Measurements of emitted light were collected on a Mithras LB-940 plate-reader (Berthold Technologies) using a BRET2 filter set. HEK293 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate and transfected with 0.4 μg of each DNA, YN-GPSM3 and Gβ2-YC. Then 100 μl of CellLightTM Golgi-RFP Bacman 2.0 (Invitrogen) was added as a Golgi marker. The following day, cells were transferred to a poly-d-lysine-coated coverslip in a 6-well plate and grown overnight. For Golgi disruption, a final concentration of 20 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) was added to the cells 15 min prior to fixation. For endogenous protein labeling, 1.0 × 106 THP-1 cells were grown for 72 h on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in 6-well plates in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde plus PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with GPSM3-specific mouse monoclonal antibody 35.5.1 (1:100 dilution) and with a pan-Gβ-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (M-14; 1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk. Then cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by incubation with a goat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and a goat Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) at dilutions of 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with permeabilization buffer. Finally, coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined by confocal microscopy (Olympus Fluoview FV1000) using a 60× oil immersion objective. Co-localization was assessed by the examination of merged images that showed co-localized regions. In addition to the merged image, an extracted merged pixels picture was generated using Image-Pro software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda). Images were collected and processed with Image-Pro Plus 6.0 and Adobe Photoshop CS4 software. In a pilot experiment to test the effects of GPSM3 on cellular GPCR signaling, we found that ectopic GPSM3 expression in HEK293 cells inhibited signaling of the agonist-activated lysophosphatidic acid receptor LPA1R to endogenous PLCβ activation and the generation of inositol phosphate (Fig. 1A, left panel). Surprisingly, ectopic GPSM3 expression was also found to inhibit PLCβ2 activation by Gβγ dimer stimulation in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1A, right panel). Currently, the only established binding partners for GPSM3 are Gα subunits of the Gi/o family (19Kimple R.J. Willard F.S. Hains M.D. Jones M.B. Nweke G.K. Siderovski D.P.

To help identify additional interacting partner(s) of GPSM3 that might explain its effect on Gβγ-dependent effector activation, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen.

Our screen identified two different clones encoding Gαi2, as expected given the two functional Gαi·GDP-interacting GoLoco motifs (GL1 and GL3) present in GPSM3 (amino acids 63–81 and 133–152, respectively (19Kimple R.J.

Two different clones of the Gβ1 subunit were also identified in the screen. Fig. 1B shows the specific interaction between GPSM3 and Gβ1 in yeast with purified bait and prey clones transfected and yeast grown under auxotrophic selection. Although multiple other GoLoco motif-containing proteins have demonstrated interactions with Gi/o family Gα subunits in yeast two-hybrid screens (e.g. LGN, Pcp2, and Rap1GAP (25Jordan J.D. Carey K.D.

To confirm this novel discovery of an interaction between GPSM3 and Gβ subunits, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in COS-7 cells. All four conventional Gβ subunits were observed to co-immunoprecipitate with GPSM3 (Fig. 2A); given the hematopoietic restricted expression of GPSM3, 3Suggestions of a hematopoietic lineage restriction of GPSM3 expression are derived from unpublished observations of M.

Cell lysates used in these experiments contained no added nucleotide nor aluminum tetrafluoride (i.e. performed without forcing any active Gα nucleotide state that could release Gβ protein from intact heterotrimers). We were surprised to observe that GPSM3 could co-immunoprecipitate with Gβ subunits in the absence of co-immunoprecipitated Gγ subunits; however, there is precedence for this type of interaction, even beyond the Gβ5/R7-RGS protein pairings (28Sondek J.

https://openalex.org/W2044392706,"TGF-β is a pleiotropic cytokine that predominantly exerts inhibitory functions in the immune system. Unexpectedly, the in vitro differentiation of both Th17 and Tc17 cells requires TGF-β. However, animals that are impaired in TGF-β signaling (TGF-βRIIDN mice) display multiorgan autoimmune disorders. Here we show that CD4(+) T cells from TGF-βRIIDN mice are resistant to Th17 cell differentiation and, paradoxically, that CD8(+) T cells from these animals spontaneously acquire an IL-17-producing phenotype. Neutralization of IL-17 or depletion of CD8(+) T cells dramatically inhibited inflammation in TGF-βRIIDN mice. Therefore, the absence of TGF-β triggers spontaneous differentiation of IL-17-producing CD8(+) T cells, suggesting that the in vivo and in vitro conditions that promote the differentiation of IL-17-producing CD8(+) T cells are distinct."

https://openalex.org/W2080306147,"PP2A is the main serine/threonine-specific phosphatase in animal cells. The active phosphatase has been described as a holoenzyme consisting of a catalytic, a scaffolding, and a variable regulatory subunit, all encoded by multiple genes, allowing for the assembly of more than 70 different holoenzymes. The catalytic subunit can also interact with α4, TIPRL (TIP41, TOR signaling pathway regulator-like), the methyl-transferase LCMT-1, and the methyl-esterase PME-1. Here, we report that the gene encoding the catalytic subunit PP2Acα can generate two mRNA types, the standard mRNA and a shorter isoform, lacking exon 5, which we termed PP2Acα2. Higher levels of the PP2Acα2 mRNA, equivalent to the level of the longer PP2Acα mRNA, were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were left to rest for 24 h. After this time, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells are still viable and the PP2Acα2 mRNA decreases soon after they are transferred to culture medium, showing that generation of the shorter isoform depends on the incubation conditions. FLAG-tagged PP2Acα2 expressed in HEK293 is catalytically inactive. It displays a specific interaction profile with enhanced binding to the α4 regulatory subunit, but no binding to the scaffolding subunit and PME-1. Consistently, α4 out-competes PME-1 and LCMT-1 for binding to both PP2Acα isoforms in pulldown assays. Together with molecular modeling studies, this suggests that all three regulators share a common binding surface on the catalytic subunit. Our findings add important new insights into the complex mechanisms of PP2A regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2090689286,"The expression profile of a gene is controlled by DNA sequences called cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). CRMs can function over large genomic distances and can be located many kilobases away from their target promoters. hes1 is a key developmental gene that is overexpressed in certain cancers and is a primary target of NOTCH signaling. Despite this, analysis of hes1 transcriptional control has been limited solely to its promoter. Here, we identify seven conserved DNA sequence blocks, representing the hes1 promoter and six novel CRMs, within 57 kb upstream of the mouse hes1 gene. We identify 12 binding sites for the RBP-Jκ NOTCH effector and a single M-CAT motif within these regions. We validate RBP-Jκ and TEAD family occupancy in cells in culture and test the response of each of these CRMs to active NOTCH. We show that two regions, CRM5 and CRM7, function as enhancers, and four can repress transcription. A pair of RBP-Jκ motifs arranged in a tail-tail configuration in CRM5 and the M-CAT motif in CRM7 are necessary for enhancer function. Furthermore, these enhancers are occupied by transcriptional co-activators and loop onto the hes1 promoter within the endogenous hes1 locus. This work demonstrates the power of combining computational genomics and experimental methodologies to identify novel CRMs and characterize their function."
