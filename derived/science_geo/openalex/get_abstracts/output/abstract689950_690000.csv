https://openalex.org/W4221117452,"Elucidating the wiring diagram of the human cell is a central goal of the postgenomic era. We combined genome engineering, confocal live-cell imaging, mass spectrometry, and data science to systematically map the localization and interactions of human proteins. Our approach provides a data-driven description of the molecular and spatial networks that organize the proteome. Unsupervised clustering of these networks delineates functional communities that facilitate biological discovery. We found that remarkably precise functional information can be derived from protein localization patterns, which often contain enough information to identify molecular interactions, and that RNA binding proteins form a specific subgroup defined by unique interaction and localization properties. Paired with a fully interactive website (opencell.czbiohub.org), our work constitutes a resource for the quantitative cartography of human cellular organization."
https://openalex.org/W4220896689,"We present a unique, extensive, and open synaptic physiology analysis platform and dataset. Through its application, we reveal principles that relate cell type to synaptic properties and intralaminar circuit organization in the mouse and human cortex. The dynamics of excitatory synapses align with the postsynaptic cell subclass, whereas inhibitory synapse dynamics partly align with presynaptic cell subclass but with considerable overlap. Synaptic properties are heterogeneous in most subclass-to-subclass connections. The two main axes of heterogeneity are strength and variability. Cell subclasses divide along the variability axis, whereas the strength axis accounts for substantial heterogeneity within the subclass. In the human cortex, excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic dynamics are distinct from those in the mouse cortex and vary with depth across layers 2 and 3."
https://openalex.org/W4221128536,"Mutations in non-coding regulatory DNA sequences can alter gene expression, organismal phenotype and fitness1-3. Constructing complete fitness landscapes, in which DNA sequences are mapped to fitness, is a long-standing goal in biology, but has remained elusive because it is challenging to generalize reliably to vast sequence spaces4-6. Here we build sequence-to-expression models that capture fitness landscapes and use them to decipher principles of regulatory evolution. Using millions of randomly sampled promoter DNA sequences and their measured expression levels in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we learn deep neural network models that generalize with excellent prediction performance, and enable sequence design for expression engineering. Using our models, we study expression divergence under genetic drift and strong-selection weak-mutation regimes to find that regulatory evolution is rapid and subject to diminishing returns epistasis; that conflicting expression objectives in different environments constrain expression adaptation; and that stabilizing selection on gene expression leads to the moderation of regulatory complexity. We present an approach for using such models to detect signatures of selection on expression from natural variation in regulatory sequences and use it to discover an instance of convergent regulatory evolution. We assess mutational robustness, finding that regulatory mutation effect sizes follow a power law, characterize regulatory evolvability, visualize promoter fitness landscapes, discover evolvability archetypes and illustrate the mutational robustness of natural regulatory sequence populations. Our work provides a general framework for designing regulatory sequences and addressing fundamental questions in regulatory evolution."

We report the 3.6-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of full-length JAK1 complexed with a cytokine receptor intracellular domain Box1 and Box2 regions captured as an activated homodimer bearing the valine→phenylalanine (VF) mutation prevalent in myeloproliferative neoplasms. The seven domains of JAK1 form an extended structural unit, the dimerization of which is mediated by close-packing of the pseudokinase (PK) domains from the monomeric subunits. The oncogenic VF mutation lies within the core of the JAK1 PK interdimer interface, enhancing packing complementarity to facilitate ligand-independent activation. The carboxy-terminal tyrosine kinase domains are poised for transactivation and to phosphorylate the receptor STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)-recruiting motifs projecting from the overhanging FERM (four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin)-SH2 (Src homology 2)-domains. Mapping of constitutively active JAK mutants supports a two-step allosteric activation mechanism and reveals opportunities for selective therapeutic targeting of oncogenic JAK signaling."

https://openalex.org/W4221018567,"Abstract Activated T cells secrete interferon-γ, which triggers intracellular tryptophan shortage by upregulating the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enzyme 1–4 . Here we show that despite tryptophan depletion, in-frame protein synthesis continues across tryptophan codons. We identified tryptophan-to-phenylalanine codon reassignment (W&gt;F) as the major event facilitating this process, and pinpointed tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WARS1) as its source. We call these W&gt;F peptides ‘substitutants’ to distinguish them from genetically encoded mutants. Using large-scale proteomics analyses, we demonstrate W&gt;F substitutants to be highly abundant in multiple cancer types. W&gt;F substitutants were enriched in tumours relative to matching adjacent normal tissues, and were associated with increased IDO1 expression, oncogenic signalling and the tumour-immune microenvironment. Functionally, W&gt;F substitutants can impair protein activity, but also expand the landscape of antigens presented at the cell surface to activate T cell responses. Thus, substitutants are generated by an alternative decoding mechanism with potential effects on gene function and tumour immunoreactivity."

The shock generated when ejected material slams into the companion star's wind can accelerate particles. We report very-high-energy (VHE; [Formula: see text]) gamma rays from the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi, up to 1 month after its 2021 outburst, observed using the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). The temporal profile of VHE emission is similar to that of lower-energy giga-electron volt emission, indicating a common origin, with a 2-day delay in peak flux. These observations constrain models of time-dependent particle energization, favoring a hadronic emission scenario over the leptonic alternative. Shocks in dense winds provide favorable environments for efficient acceleration of cosmic rays to very high energies."
https://openalex.org/W4220942655,"Abstract Birds morph their wing shape to accomplish extraordinary manoeuvres 1–4 , which are governed by avian-specific equations of motion. Solving these equations requires information about a bird’s aerodynamic and inertial characteristics 5 . Avian flight research to date has focused on resolving aerodynamic features, whereas inertial properties including centre of gravity and moment of inertia are seldom addressed. Here we use an analytical method to determine the inertial characteristics of 22 species across the full range of elbow and wrist flexion and extension. We find that wing morphing allows birds to substantially change their roll and yaw inertia but has a minimal effect on the position of the centre of gravity. With the addition of inertial characteristics, we derived a novel metric of pitch agility and estimated the static pitch stability, revealing that the agility and static margin ranges are reduced as body mass increases. These results provide quantitative evidence that evolution selects for both stable and unstable flight, in contrast to the prevailing narrative that birds are evolving away from stability 6 . This comprehensive analysis of avian inertial characteristics provides the key features required to establish a theoretical model of avian manoeuvrability."

Mimicking transport for in vitro applications has been widely studied; however, the inflexibility in track design and control has hindered practical applications. Here, we developed protein-based motors that move on DNA nanotubes by combining a biomolecular motor dynein and DNA binding proteins. The new motors and DNA-based nanoarchitectures enabled us to arrange the binding sites on the track, locally control the direction of movement, and achieve multiplexed cargo transport by different motors. The integration of these technologies realized microscale cargo sorters and integrators that automatically transport molecules as programmed in DNA sequences on a branched DNA nanotube. Our system should provide a versatile, controllable platform for future applications."
https://openalex.org/W4220914908,"On 14 August 2021, the moment magnitude (Mw) 7.2 Nippes earthquake in Haiti occurred within the same fault zone as its devastating 2010 Mw 7.0 predecessor, but struck the country when field access was limited by insecurity and conventional seismometers from the national network were inoperative. A network of citizen seismometers installed in 2019 provided near-field data critical to rapidly understand the mechanism of the mainshock and monitor its aftershock sequence. Their real-time data defined two aftershock clusters that coincide with two areas of coseismic slip derived from inversions of conventional seismological and geodetic data. Machine learning applied to data from the citizen seismometer closest to the mainshock allows us to forecast aftershocks as accurately as with the network-derived catalog. This shows the utility of citizen science contributing to our understanding of a major earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W4220935010,"Vanguard efforts in forecasting volcanic eruptions are turning to physics-based models, which require quantitative estimates of magma conditions during pre-eruptive storage. Below active arc volcanoes, observed magma storage depths vary widely (~0 to 20 kilometers) and are commonly assumed to represent levels of neutral buoyancy. Here we show that geophysically observed magma depths (6 ± 3 kilometers) are greater than depths of neutral buoyancy, ruling out this commonly assumed control. Observed depths are instead consistent with predicted depths of water degassing. Intrinsically wetter magmas degas water and crystallize deeper than dry magmas, resulting in viscosity increases that lead to deeper stalling of ascending magma. The water-depth relationship provides a critical constraint for forecasting models by connecting depth of eruption initiation to its volatile fuel."
https://openalex.org/W4220963421,"Apoptosis of cells and their subsequent removal through efferocytosis occurs in nearly all tissues during development, homeostasis, and disease. However, it has been difficult to track cell death and subsequent corpse removal in vivo. We developed a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, CharON (Caspase and pH Activated Reporter, Fluorescence ON), that could track emerging apoptotic cells and their efferocytic clearance by phagocytes. Using Drosophila expressing CharON, we uncovered multiple qualitative and quantitative features of coordinated clearance of apoptotic corpses during embryonic development. When confronted with high rates of emerging apoptotic corpses, the macrophages displayed heterogeneity in engulfment behaviors, leading to some efferocytic macrophages carrying high corpse burden. Overburdened macrophages were compromised in clearing wound debris. These findings reveal known and unexpected features of apoptosis and macrophage efferocytosis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W4221014560,"Polyethylene production through catalytic ethylene polymerization is one of the most common processes in the chemical industry. The popular Cossee-Arlman mechanism hypothesizes that the ethylene be directly inserted into the metal-carbon bond during chain growth, which has been awaiting microscopic and spatiotemporal experimental confirmation. Here, we report an in situ visualization of ethylene polymerization by scanning tunneling microscopy on a carburized iron single-crystal surface. We observed that ethylene polymerization proceeds on a specific triangular iron site at the boundary between two carbide domains. Without an activator, an intermediate, attributed to surface-anchored ethylidene (CHCH3), serves as the chain initiator (self-initiation), which subsequently grows by ethylene insertion. Our finding provides direct experimental evidence of the ethylene polymerization pathway at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W4220786771,"Frequency multiplication is a process in modern electronics in which harmonics of the input frequency are generated in nonlinear electronic circuits. Devices based on the propagation and interaction of spin waves are a promising alternative to conventional electronics. The characteristic frequency of these excitations is in the gigahertz (GHz) range and devices are not readily interfaced with conventional electronics. Here, we locally probe the magnetic excitations in a soft magnetic material by optical methods and show that megahertz-range excitation frequencies cause switching effects on the micrometer scale, leading to phase-locked spin-wave emission in the GHz range. Indeed, the frequency multiplication process inside the magnetic medium covers six octaves and opens exciting perspectives for spintronic applications, such as all-magnetic mixers or on-chip GHz sources."
https://openalex.org/W4220950319,"Environmental abiotic stresses limit plant growth, development, and reproduction. This study aims to reveal the response of Brassica napus to salt stress. Here, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics analysis were performed on 15 Brassica napus leave samples treated with salt at different times. Through functional enrichment analyzing the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differential metabolites (DMs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), the key factors that dominate Brassica napus response to salt stress were identified. The results showed that the two key hormones responding to salt stress were Abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Salt stress for 24h is an important milestone. Brassica napus adjusted multiple pathways at 24h to avoid over-response to salt stress and cause energy consumption. The increased expression in BnPP2C is tangible evidence. In response to salt stress, JA and ABA work together to reduce the damage caused by salt stress in Brassica napus. The increased expression of all BnJAZs after salt stress highlighted the function of JA that cannot be ignored responding to salt stress. In addition, some metabolites, such as N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, L-Cysteine and L-(+)-Arginine, play a critical role in maintaining the balance of ROS. Proteins like catalase-3, cysteine desulfurase, HSP90 and P450_97A3 were the most critical differential proteins in response to salt stress. These findings of this study provide data support for Brassica napus breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4220720746,"As an emerging digital asset, Bitcoin has been traded for more than a decade, reaching an impressively high market capitalization and continuing to expand its volume of trading at a rapid pace. Many countries have legalized or are considering legalizing a trading platform for this asset, and a set of companies worldwide accept it as a medium of exchange. As a result of this expansion, many studies in finance literature have focused on studying the efficiency of this cryptocurrency. In line with this literature, this paper investigates, using the abnormal returns and abnormal trading volumes methodologies, the dynamics of investors’ reaction to the arrival of unexpected favorable and unfavorable information regarding the Bitcoin market in the context of the three famous hypotheses: the overreaction, the uncertain information, and the efficient market hypotheses. Overall, we find evidence confirming that the Bitcoin market tends to mature over time. More precisely, over the entire analyzed period, investors behave in accordance with the predictions of the uncertain information hypothesis when positive and negative events occur. However, splitting the timespan into sub-periods provides interesting insights. Remarkably in this respect is the fact that starting with the second sub-period, the response of investors in the Bitcoin market supports, in a moderate manner, the postulate of the efficient market hypothesis when favorable events are addressed. Moreover, our findings reveal that during the pandemic period, the efficiency of Bitcoin has increased, thus turning this stressful period into an advantage for this cryptocurrency. This improved market efficiency is also supported by the abnormal trading volume analysis."

https://openalex.org/W4220833981,"Better socioeconomic status and well-being in households decrease malnutrition and health risks in children. The objective of the present study is to assess the current nutritional status of pre-school children and to correlate the prevalence of malnutrition with Household Deprivation Status (HDS) in one of the deprived districts of the Punjab province in Pakistan. Using primary data collected from 384 households through a proportional purposive random sampling technique, this study calculates the z-scores of weight-for-age (WAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ), and height-for-age (HAZ). The study has used a cut-off point which is -2 standard deviations below the median of the WHO/NCHS reference population for each anthropometric indicator. The results indicate that the underweight, stunting, and wasting prevalence rates are 46.1%, 34.83%, and 15.49% respectively in district Rahimyar Khan. Also, the expected tendency of malnutrition is worst for HDS-1 and HDS-2 which are the most deprived segments of the population. As the household shifts from HDS-1 to HDS-2 and further to HDS-3, the rates of stunting (HAZ) and underweight (WAZ) decreases but wasting (WHZ) does not. The study concludes that the high prevalence of malnutrition in the district is correlated with overall socio-economic deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W4221017041,"As an important financial means for governments to improve the quality of economic development, government debt greatly affects the quality of local environmental governance. Based on a theoretical mechanism analysis that uses the pollutant emissions panel data and new caliber urban investment bond data of 273 cities in China, this paper empirically tests the impact of local government debt on urban emission reduction and the mechanism that drives this impact. We find that local government debt significantly promotes urban emissions reduction, and as urban pollution becomes more aggravated, this promoting effect has a dynamic path, first strengthening and then weakening. The role of local government debt in promoting urban emission reduction is characterized by both temporal and spatial heterogeneity. A mechanistic analysis shows that local government debt can promote urban emission reduction by promoting urban environmental innovation, with green invention patents demonstrating a stronger intermediary role than green utility model patents."
https://openalex.org/W4220681903,"Weather and land use can significantly impact mosquito abundance and presence, and by consequence, mosquito-borne disease (MBD) dynamics. Knowledge of vector ecology and mosquito species response to these drivers will help us better predict risk from MBD. In this study, we evaluated and compared the independent and combined effects of weather and land use on mosquito species occurrence and abundance in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Data on occurrence and abundance (245,591 individuals) of 30 mosquito species were obtained from mosquito capture at 85 field sites in 2017 and 2018. Environmental variables were extracted from weather and land use datasets in a 1-km buffer around trapping sites. The relative importance of weather and land use on mosquito abundance (for common species) or occurrence (for all species) was evaluated using multivariate hierarchical statistical models. Models incorporating both weather and land use performed better than models that include weather only for approximately half of species (59% for occurrence model and 50% for abundance model). Mosquito occurrence was mainly associated with temperature whereas abundance was associated with precipitation and temperature combined. Land use was more often associated with abundance than occurrence. For most species, occurrence and abundance were positively associated with forest cover but for some there was a negative association. Occurrence and abundance of some species (47% for occurrence model and 88% for abundance model) were positively associated with wetlands, but negatively associated with urban (Culiseta melanura and Anopheles walkeri) and agriculture (An. quadrimaculatus, Cs. minnesotae and An. walkeri) environments. This study provides predictive relationships between weather, land use and mosquito occurrence and abundance for a wide range of species including those that are currently uncommon, yet known as arboviruses vectors. Elucidation of these relationships has the potential to contribute to better prediction of MBD risk, and thus more efficiently targeted prevention and control measures."

Maintaining records helps businesses in making better judgments and developing appropriate policies, resulting in enhanced effectiveness and efficiency. This will leverage means for tracking business progress and making appropriate decisions to expand the productive component of the economy. SMEs Business growth will help generate tax revenue for the government while also encouraging poverty reduction through tax transfers. We conducted a thorough investigation to determine the impact of each variable on business growth. For statistical analysis, a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) methodology was applied. The results suggest that business records management and training have a positive indirect effect on business growth. However, the indirect effect of business records management policies insignificantly influences SMEs' adoption of adequate record-keeping procedures, which harms business growth in Ghana. On the other hand, the total effect of the variables such as business records management training, business records management policies, and business records management positively impact business growth. Findings make a significant contribution to existing knowledge in the areas of record-keeping, management, and business growth. Business records management is an issue that requires more policy attention. This will business owners and managers strategically plan for new business directions based on data acquired. Proper record-keeping is necessary to satisfy end-users such as company directors, shareholders, external auditors, investors, creditors, and other interested parties. SMEs place a high value on business records management because of the impact it has on their long-term viability. The research outcomes provide a means for, and data on, business appraisal and management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4220686050,"Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that a high dietary fiber intake is associated inversely with the incidence of asthma in the population. There have been many studies on the role of soluble dietary fiber, but the mechanism of action for insoluble dietary fiber, such as cellulose-the most widely existing dietary fiber, in asthma is still unclear. The current study investigated the outcomes of a high-cellulose diet in a mouse model of asthma and detected pathological manifestations within the lungs, changes in the intestinal microbiome, and changes in intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in mice. A high-cellulose diet can reduce lung inflammation and asthma symptoms in asthmatic mice. Furthermore, it dramatically changes the composition of the intestinal microbiome. At the family level, a new dominant fungus family Peptostreptococcaceae is produced, and at the genus level, the unique genus Romboutsla, [Ruminococcus]_torques_group was generated. These genera and families of bacteria are closely correlated with lipid metabolism in vivo. Many studies have proposed that the mechanism of dietary fiber regulating asthma may involve the intestinal microbiome producing SCFAs, but the current research shows that a high-cellulose diet cannot increase the content of SCFAs in the intestine. These data suggest that a high-cellulose diet decreases asthma symptoms by altering the composition of the intestinal microbiome, however, this mechanism is thought to be independent of SCFAs and may involve the regulation of lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4220923106,"Queer identities are often ignored in diversity initiatives, yet there is a growing body of research that describes notable heterosexist and gender-normative expectations in STEM that lead to unsupportive and discriminatory environments and to the lower persistence of queer individuals. Research on the experiences of queer-spectrum individuals is limited by current demographic practices. In surveys that are queer-inclusive there is no consensus on best practices, and individuals with queer genders and queer sexual, romantic, and related orientations are often lumped together in a general category (e.g. LGBTQ+). We developed two queer-inclusive demographics questions and administered them as part of a larger study in undergraduate engineering and computer science classes (n = 3698), to determine which of three survey types for gender (conventional, queered, open-ended) provided the most robust data and compared responses to national data to determine if students with queer genders and/or queer sexual, romantic, and related orientations were underrepresented in engineering and computer science programs. The gender survey with queer-identity options provided the most robust data, as measured by higher response rates and relatively high rates of disclosing queer identities. The conventional survey (male, female, other) had significantly fewer students disclose queer identities, and the open-ended survey had a significantly higher non-response rate. Allowing for multiple responses on the survey was important: 78% of those with queer gender identities and 9% of those with queer sexual, romantic and related orientations selected multiple identities within the same survey question. Queer students in our study were underrepresented relative to national data. Students who disclosed queer gender identities were 7/100ths of the expected number, and those with queer orientations were under-represented by one-quarter. Further work developing a research-based queered demographics instrument is needed for larger-scale changes in demographics practices, which will help others identify and address barriers that queer-spectrum individuals face in STEM."

However, global estimation of biosphere productivity remains a challenge. Using the ancient air enclosed in polar ice cores, we present the first 800,000-year record of triple isotopic ratios of atmospheric oxygen, which reflects past global biosphere productivity. We observe that global biosphere productivity in the past eight glacial intervals was lower than that in the preindustrial era and that, in most cases, it starts to increase millennia before deglaciations. Both variations occur concomitantly with CO2 changes, implying a dominant control of CO2 on global biosphere productivity that supports a pervasive negative feedback under the glacial climate."
https://openalex.org/W4220851799,"Recent studies have revealed that the composition of human gut microbiota varies according to region, race, age, diet, living environment, and sampling and DNA extraction method. The purpose of this study was to broaden our understanding of the intestinal microbial composition of Koreans by conducting a 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on 78 Korean samples composed of adults, children, normal and obese groups. We compared the microbiome composition and diversity of these groups at different levels including the phylum and genus level using two different stool DNA extraction kits of QIAamp® PowerFecal® DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and CT Max Fecal DNA Kit (Ct bio, Korea). We found that Ct bio (Ct) kit recovered higher DNA yields and OTUs than QIAamp® PowerFecal® DNA Kit (Qia). The Ct kit, which adopted more rigorous bead beating method, detected the most Gram-positive (G+) bacteria, Firmicutes, at the Phylum level, whereas the Qia kit, which used a less rigorous cell lysis method, found the most Gram-negative (G-) bacteria, Bacteroidetes. The Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio showed no significant difference between the obese and the normal groups of same kit; however, they were significantly different with two different kits. There was a difference in the intestinal flora between healthy Korean adults and children. The taxa that differed significantly between the adults and children were Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Subdoligranulum. There was no significant difference in the intestinal flora between the normal weight group and the obese group in adults and children, respectively. This is probably because the difference in body mass index (BMI) between the sample groups collected in this study is statistically significant, but it is not large enough to show a clear difference in the flora. Therefore, these results should be interpreted with caution while considering the BMI values and Korean obesity criterion together."
https://openalex.org/W4220894977,"DNA metabarcoding was employed to identify plant-derived food resources for the Japanese rock ptarmigan ( Lagopus muta japonica ), which is registered as a natural living monument in Japan, in the Northern Japanese Alps in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, in July to October, 2015–2018. DNA metabarcoding using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of rbcL and ITS2 sequences from alpine plants found in ptarmigan fecal samples collected in the study area. The obtained sequences were analyzed using a combination of a constructed local database and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, revealed that a total of 53 plant taxa were food plant resources for ptarmigans. Of these plant taxa, 49 could be assigned to species (92.5%), three to genus (5.7%), and one to family (1.9%). Of the 23 plant families identified from the 105 fecal samples collected, the dominant families throughout all collection periods were Ericaceae (99.0% of 105 fecal samples), followed by Rosaceae (42.9%), Apiaceae (35.2%), and Poaceae (21.0%). In all of the fecal samples examined, the most frequently encountered plant species were Vaccinium ovalifolium var. ovalifolium (69.5%), followed by Empetrum nigrum var. japonicum (68.6%), Kalmia procumbens (42.9%), Tilingia ajanensis (34.3%) and V . uliginosum var. japonicum (34.3%). A rarefaction analysis for each collection period in the study revealed that the food plant resources found in the study area ranged from a minimum of 87.0% in July to a maximum of 97.5% in September, and that 96.4% of the food plant taxa were found throughout the study period. The findings showed that DNA metabarcoding using HTS to construct a local database of rbcL and ITS2 sequences in conjunction with rbcL and ITS2 sequences deposited at the NCBI, as well as rarefaction analysis, are well suited to identifying the dominant food plants in the diet of Japanese rock ptarmigans. In the windswept alpine dwarf shrub community found in the study area, dominant taxa in the Ericaceae family were the major food plant s for Japanese rock ptarmigans from July to October. This plant community therefore needs to be conserved in order to protect the food resources of Japanese rock ptarmigans in the region."

Periinterventional DSA was used to assess treatment success and to stratify patients according to the site of embolization. Liver function was assessed using following laboratory values: bilirubin, albumin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, glutamat-pyruvat-transaminase (GPT), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), aPTT, prothrombin time and thrombocyte count. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Median laboratory values of pre, 1- and 3-days, as well as 1-week and 1-month post-embolization were compared between the respective embolization sites using linear mixed model regression analysis.All procedures were technically successful and showed an improved blood flow in the hepatic artery post-embolization. Ten Patients were excluded due to re -intervention or inconsistent image documentation. Pairwise comparison using linear mixed model regression analysis showed a significant difference between proximal and distal embolization for GPT (57.0 (IQR 107.5) vs. 118.0 (IQR 254.0) U/l, p = 0.002) and GOT (48.0 (IQR 48.0) vs. 81.0 (IQR 115.0) U/l, p = 0.008) 3-days after embolization as well as median thrombocyte counts 7-days after embolization (122 (IQR 108) vs. 83 (IQR 74) in thousands, p = 0.014). For all other laboratory values, no statistically significant difference could be shown with respect to the embolization site.We conclude that long-term outcomes after embolization of the SA in the scenario of SAS after OLT are irrespective of the site of embolization of the SA, whereas a proximal embolization potentially facilitates earlier normalization of liver function. Choice of technique should therefore be informed by anatomical conditions, safety considerations and preferences of the interventionalist."

However, the mechanism fails to address the heterogeneous nature of data packets traversing the network, as these packets may carry different classes of data with different priority statuses, some real-time (time-sensitive) while others non-real-time (delay-tolerant). The standard Objective Functions (OFs), used by RPL to create routing paths, treat all classes of data as the same, this practice is not only inefficient but results in poor network performance. In this article, the Prioritized Shortest Path Computation Mechanism (PSPCM) is proposed to resolve the data prioritization of heterogeneous data and inefficient power management issues. The mechanism prioritizes heterogeneous data streaming through the network into various priority classes, based on the priority conveyed by the data. The PSPCM mechanism routes the data through the shortest and power-efficient path from the source to the destination node. PSPCM generates routing paths that exactly meet the need of the prioritized data. It outperformed related mechanisms with an average of 91.49% PDR, and average power consumption of 1.37mW which translates to better battery saving and prolonged operational lifetime while accommodating data with varying priorities."

However, till date, whether topical estrogen application can promote cutaneous wound healing in diabetes remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to validate the effect of topical estrogen application on cutaneous wound healing in a type 2 diabetes db/db mice model. In total, 22 db/db female mice with type 2 diabetes and eight C57BL/6J female mice were subjected to two full-thickness wound injuries. The mice were divided into the db/db, db/db + estrogen, db/db + vehicle, and wild type (WT) groups. Wound healing was assessed until day 14. The db/db group had a significantly high wound area ratio (wound area/initial wound area) on days 3–14 and a significantly low re-epithelialization ratio on days 7 and 14. Moreover, their angiogenesis ratio was significantly low on day 7 and high on day 14. In contrast, compared with the db/db group, the db/db + estrogen group had a significantly lower wound area ratio on days 1–14 and angiogenesis ratio on day 14, thereby indicating early withdrawal of new blood vessels, as well as a significantly higher re-epithelialization ratio on days 7 and 14 and Ym1 + M2 macrophage/macrophage ratio on day 7. Moreover, microarray analysis showed that the top 10 upregulated or downregulated genes in the db/db group were reversed by estrogen treatment, particularly on day 14, in comparison with the WT group. Thus, topical estrogen application reduced the wound area, promoted re-epithelialization and angiogenesis, and increased the number of M2 macrophages in mice with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, it improved the differential regulation of genes in db/db mice. Therefore, such treatment can enhance cutaneous wound healing in female mice with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4220880554,"Objectives Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus) infection is one of the most commonly reported nationally notifiable conditions in the United States. Gonococcus has developed antimicrobial resistance to each previously used antibiotic for gonorrhea therapy. However, some isolates may be still susceptible to no longer recommended, yet still effective antibiotics. This in turn suggests that targeted therapy could slow resistance development to currently recommended empirical treatments. We curated a gonococcal Ciprofloxacin Antibiotic Resistance Isolate Bank panel (Cipro-panel) as a tool for validating or developing new tests to determine ciprofloxacin susceptibility. Method The Cipro-panel was selected using whole genome sequencing, bioinformatic tools, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data. Isolates were further selected based on nucleotide variations in gyrA and parC genes. Results We selected 14 unique N . gonorrhoeae isolates from the 2006–2012 Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) collection. They represented a wide range of antimicrobial susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and commonly observed nucleotide variations of gyrA and parC genes. This Cipro-panel consists of 5 isolates with resistant phenotypes (MIC &gt; = 1 μg/mL), 8 isolates with susceptible phenotypes (MIC &lt; = 0.06 μg/mL), and 1 isolate falling in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute defined intermediate range. Among the gyrA variations we observed a total of 18 SNPs. Four positions had nonsynonymous changes (nucleotide positions 272, 284, 1093, and 1783). The first two positions (272 and 284) have been linked previously with resistance to ciprofloxacin (i.e. amino acid positions 91 and 95). For the parC gene, we observed a total of 21 possible SNPs. Eight of those SNPs resulted in non-synonymous amino acid changes. One location (amino acid 87) has been previously reported to be associated with ciprofloxacin resistance. Conclusions This Cipro-Panel is useful for researchers interested in developing clinical tests related to ciprofloxacin. It could also provide additional choices for validation, quality assurance purposes and improve antibiotic usage."
https://openalex.org/W4220941491,"Shared latrines and other shared sanitation facilities are vital for communities that lack private latrines. However, the cleanliness of shared latrines continues to be a problem in sub-Saharan Africa, including slums of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Investigating the barriers to cleaning of shared latrines may inform the future strengthening of comprehensive sanitation programs in slums of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Thus, a community-based unmatched case-control study was conducted among 100 case and 200 control households that were users of shared latrines from September to November 2017 in a slum district in Addis Ababa. Cases were those who had not cleaned their shared latrines and controls were those who had cleaned their shared latrines at least once during the week prior to data collection. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and an on-the-spot-observational checklist and analyzed using bivariate (crude odds ratio [COD]) and multivariable (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) unconditional logistic regression model. Variables having a p-value of less than 0.25 from the bivariate logistic regression analysis were retained into multivariable analysis. From the multivariable analysis, variables with p<0.05 were declared as factors significantly associated with barriers to cleaning of shared latrines. We found that about half 99 (49.5%) of shared latrines used by cases and almost one-third 32 (32.0%) of the shared latrines used by controls had visible cracks and spaces in the floor and slabs. The barriers to cleaning of shared latrines were found to be monthly household income of less than $55.60 USD (AOR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.2-3.10), users feeling a lack of privacy during latrine use (AOR = 2.95; 95% CI: 1.60-5.43), no locking latch on the latrine door (AOR = 4.60; 95% CI: 2.43-8.79), inadequate ventilation of latrine (AOR: 4.88; 95% CI: 2.44-9.63), lack of regular monitoring of latrine by health extension workers (AOR = 2.86; 95%CI: 1.32-6.21) and a lack of enough water at home for cleaning the latrine (AOR = 4.91; 95% CI: 1.07-9.48). This study found several barriers to cleaning of shared latrines in slums of Addis Ababa. We recommend that stakeholders promote cleaning of shared latrines by designing programs to improve latrine privacy by adding or modifying the superstructure and including a door with locking latch, to make adjustments to the structure for better ventilation, to ensure regular monitoring of latrines by health extension workers and to make enough water consistently available for regular latrine cleaning."
https://openalex.org/W4220976845,"Birdsong is an important communication signal used in mate choice. In some songbird species, only the males produce songs. While the females of those species do not sing, they are sensitive to inter- and intra-species song variations, and the song preferences of females depend on their developmental experiences and/or genetic predispositions. For example, in Bengalese finches and zebra finches, adult females prefer the song to which they were exposed early in life, such as the father's song. In the current study, we aimed to test whether the preference for the father's song, as reported in previous Bengalese finch studies, can be interpreted as a mating preference. For this purpose, the subjects were raised exclusively with their family until they became sexually mature and then tested as adults. We measured copulation solicitation displays during playbacks of the father's song vs. unfamiliar conspecific songs and found that across individuals, the father's song elicited more displays than other songs. In addition, we analyzed if a bird's response to a given song could be predicted by the level of similarity of that song to the father's song. Although the birds expressed more displays to songs with greater similarity to the father's song, the effect was not statistically significant. These results suggest that female Bengalese finches can develop a strong mating preference for the father's song if they are exclusively exposed to the father's song early in life. However, it is not clear if such a preference generalizes to other cases in which birds are exposed to multiple male songs during development. In order to fully elucidate the possible contribution of experience and genetic factors in the development of female song preference in this species, future studies will need more detailed manipulation and control of the rearing conditions, including cross-fostering."
https://openalex.org/W4220977549,"Apocynum venetum L. (Apocynaceae) is valuable for its medicinal compounds and fiber content. Native A. venetum populations are threatened and require protection. Wild A. venetum resources are limited relative to market demand and a poor understanding of the composition of A. venetum at the molecular level. The chloroplast genome contains genetic markers for phylogenetic analysis, genetic diversity evaluation, and molecular identification. In this study, the entire genome of the A. venetum chloroplast was sequenced and analyzed. The A. venetum cp genome is 150,878 bp, with a pair of inverted repeat regions (IRA and IRB). Each inverted repeat region is 25,810 bp, which consist of large (LSC, 81,951 bp) and small (SSC, 17,307 bp) single copy areas. The genome-wide GC content was 38.35%, LSC made up 36.49%, SSC made up 32.41%, and IR made up 43.3%. The A. venetum chloroplast genome encodes 131 genes, including 86 protein-coding genes, eight ribosomal RNA genes, and 37 transfer RNA genes. This study identified the unique characteristics of the A. venetum chloroplast genome, which will help formulate effective conservation and management strategies as well as molecular identification approaches for this important medicinal plant."
https://openalex.org/W4220685807,"We ask how state empathy, trait empathy, and role awareness influence dictator game giving in a monetarily incentivized experiment. We manipulated two factors: role awareness (role certainty vs. role uncertainty) and state empathy induction (no empathy induction vs. empathy induction). Under role uncertainty, participants did not know their role as a dictator or a recipient when making their choices. State empathy was induced by asking the dictators to consider what the recipient would feel when learning about the decision. Each participant was randomly assigned into one of the four conditions, and in each condition, participants were randomly assigned into dictator and receiver roles. The role assignment took place before or after decisions were made, depending on the condition. We also studied the direct influence of trait empathy on dictator game giving as well as its interaction with the experimental manipulations. Trait empathy was measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE) before the experiment. Of our experimental manipulations, role awareness had an effect on dictator game giving; participants donated more under role uncertainty than under role certainty. Instead, we did not observe an effect of state empathy induction. Of trait empathy subscales, only affective empathy was positively associated with dictator game giving. Finally, role awareness did not influence all participants similarly but had a larger impact on those with low scores on trait empathic concern or trait affective empathy. Our results indicate that specific measures to induce altruistic sharing can be effective but their effect may vary depending on certain personal characteristics."

https://openalex.org/W4220826069,"Understanding reproductive biology and performance of fish is essential to formulate effective conservation and management programs. Here, we studied reproductive strategies of female Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, an endangered fish species in the State of California, the United States, focusing on (1) better understanding their distribution pattern during the winter and spring spawning season at very fine scale to predict their possible spawning grounds and (2) assessing impacts of a recent, severe drought on their reproductive performance. We formulated our hypotheses as follows; (1) female Delta Smelt migrate to particular locations for spawning so that mature females can be frequently found in those locations throughout the spawning season and (2) reproductive performance of individual female fish declined during the drought. To test the first hypotheses, we analyzed relationships between water quality parameters and maturity/distribution pattern of Delta Smelt. Salinity better explained the distribution pattern of Delta Smelt at subadult and adult stages compared with water temperature or turbidity. Although there are some freshwater locations where mature Delta Smelt can frequently be found during the spawning season, Delta Smelt at the final maturation stage (Stage 5: hydration) and post spawners appeared to be widespread in the area where salinity was below 1.0 during the spawning season. Therefore, Delta Smelt could theoretically spawn in any freshwater locations, with more specific spawning requirements in the wild (e.g., substrate type and depth) still unknown. Delta Smelt, which experienced dry and critically dry conditions (the 2013 and 2014 year-classes), showed smaller oocytes, and lower clutch size and gonadosomatic index compared with the fish caught in a wet year (2011 year-class) at the late vitellogenic stage (Stage 4 Late), suggesting reproductive performance was negatively affected by environmental conditions during the drought."
https://openalex.org/W4220942586,"The fatty acid component of commodity soybean seeds typically consists of approximately 12-15% saturated fatty acids in the form of palmitic acid and stearic acid. An important goal in soybean breeding is the reduction of saturated fats, in order to produce healthier vegetable oils for food applications. Genetic approaches have been instrumental in reducing levels of palmitic acid, which is the most abundant saturated fat in soybean seeds. In this study we describe a new mutant allele of the FATB1a gene that encodes a palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase. The mutation is expected to result in early termination of the FATB1A protein and mutant seeds carrying this allele contain 5.5% palmitic acid. This new allele can be introduced into conventional soybean lines, alone or in combination with other modifications to generate soybean lines with improved oil composition."
https://openalex.org/W4220970337,"Poor sleep and psychological stress are obesity determinants that are rarely included in obesity prevention programs. The aim was to report the effects of the Healthy Start randomized intervention on the secondary outcomes psychological stress and sleep duration and onset latency. Data was obtained from the Healthy Start randomized intervention conducted in 2009-2012 among Danish healthy weight children aged 2-6 years, who had either a high birth weight (>4,000 g), high maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (>28 kg/m2), or low maternal educational level (≤10 years of schooling) and their parents. The intervention was designed to deliver improvements in diet and physical activity habits, optimization of sleep habits, and reduction of psychological family stress. The average intervention period was 15 months. Children with information on a 7-day sleep record, sleep onset latency, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and a modified version of Parenting Stress Index (PSI) were included. The effects of the intervention on sleep habits, PSI scores, SDQ Total Difficulties (SDQ-TD) and Pro-social Behavior scores, and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) were analyzed using linear regression intention-to-treat (n = 543 (intervention group n = 271, control group n = 272)) analyses. No statistically significant effects on sleep duration, sleep onset latency, PSI score, or SDQ Pro-social Behavior score were observed. Values both before and after the intervention were within the normal range both for children in the intervention and children in the control group. Mean change in SDQ-TD was 0.09 points (95% CI -0.57;0.59) in the intervention group, and -0.69 points (95% CI -1.16; -0.23) in the control group (p = 0.06). In conclusion, there were no intervention effects in relation to sleep duration, sleep onset latency, PSI score, or SDQ Pro-social behavior. There was an indication that children in the intervention group had slightly more behavioral problems than the control group after the intervention, but values were within normal range both before and after the intervention, and the difference is not considered to be clinically meaningful."
https://openalex.org/W4221007045,"The Animated Triangles Task (AT) is commonly used to measure Theory of Mind (ToM). AT can be scored by clinicians based on participants’ verbal responses (AT-verbal) or using a multiple-choice paradigm (AT-MCQ). This study aimed to evaluate the validity of the less time-consuming AT-MCQ. To do this, we examined agreement and correlations between the AT-MCQ and the original AT-verbal scores in 1546 adolescents from a population-based sample. As a supplementary analysis of known-groups validity, we examined if AT-MCQ was as sensitive as AT-verbal in detecting ToM-limitations in 54 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), using register-data. The agreement between AT-verbal and AT-MCQ varied markedly across test items. Scores on the two scoring methods were weakly correlated. Both scoring methods weakly detected differences between adolescents with and without ASD in this population-based sample. Most participants had appropriate responses on both AT-MCQ and AT-verbal, which yielded overall acceptable agreement. However, the feasibility of using either scoring methods to measure ToM-limitations in adolescents from the general population is questionable."
https://openalex.org/W4220679265,"Lyme disease is the most widely reported vector-borne disease in the United States. 95% of confirmed human cases are reported in the Northeast and upper Midwest (25,778 total confirmed cases from Northeast and upper Midwest / 27,203 total US confirmed cases). Human cases typically occur in the spring and summer months when an infected nymph Ixodid tick takes a blood meal. Current federal surveillance strategies report data on an annual basis, leading to nearly a year lag in national data reporting. These lags in reporting make it difficult for public health agencies to assess and plan for the current burden of Lyme disease. Implementation of a nowcasting model, using historical data to predict current trends, provides a means for public health agencies to evaluate current Lyme disease burden and make timely priority-based budgeting decisions. The objective of the study was to develop and compare the performance of nowcasting models using free data from Google Trends and Centers of Disease Control and Prevention surveillance reports. We developed two sets of elastic net models for five regions of the United States: 1. Using only monthly proportional hit data from the 21 disease symptoms and tick related terms, and 2. Using monthly proportional hit data from terms identified via Google correlate and the disease symptom and vector terms. Elastic net models using the full-term list were highly accurate (Root Mean Square Error: 0.74, Mean Absolute Error: 0.52, R 2 : 0.97) for four of the five regions of the United States and improved accuracy 1.33-fold while reducing error 0.5-fold compared to predictions from models using disease symptom and vector terms alone. Many of the terms included and found to be important for model performance were environmentally related. These models can be implemented to help local and state public health agencies accurately monitor Lyme disease burden during times of reporting lag from federal public health reporting agencies."

https://openalex.org/W4220756913,"Epidemiological data are frequently recorded at coarse spatio-temporal resolutions to protect confidential information or to summarize it in a compact manner. However, the detailed patterns followed by the source data, which may be of interest to researchers and public health officials, are overlooked. We propose to use the penalized composite link model (Eilers PCH (2007)), combined with spatio-temporal P-splines methodology (Lee D.-J., Durban M (2011)) to estimate the underlying trend within data that have been aggregated not only in space, but also in time. Model estimation is carried out within a generalized linear mixed model framework, and sophisticated algorithms are used to speed up computations that otherwise would be unfeasible. The model is then used to analyze data obtained during the largest outbreak of Q-fever in the Netherlands."

https://openalex.org/W4220971457,"After recovery, children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remain vulnerable to sub-optimal growth and malnutrition relapse. Although there is an increased interest in understanding these problems, data are scarce, and contextual factors can cause variability. We prospectively followed a cohort of Ethiopian children (215 post-SAM cases and 215 non-wasted controls), monthly for one year. The post-SAM cases were: age 6–59 months at admission into the community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) program and being successfully discharged from CMAM (MUAC&gt;11.0cm, weight gain of 20%, absence of oedema and clinically stable for two consecutive weeks). The controls were apparently healthy children from same village who had no history of an episode of AM and were matched 1:1 to a post-SAM child by age and sex. The primary outcomes were: cumulative incidence of acute malnutrition; growth trajectory; cumulative incidence of reported common morbidities, and cumulative proportion and incidence of deaths. The burden of common morbidities was higher among post-SAM than controls; post-SAM children had more frequent illness episodes (Incidence Rate Ratio of any illness 1.39, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.71; p&lt;0.001). The prevalence of SAM was consistently higher among post-SAM cases than the control group, having a 14 times higher risk of developing SAM (Incidence Rate Ratio: 14.1; 95% CI: 3.5, 122.5; p&lt;0.001). The divergence in weight and growth trajectory remained the same during the study period. Our results advocate for the design of post-discharge interventions that aim to prevent the reoccurrence of acute malnutrition, reduce morbidity and promote catch-up growth. Research is needed to define the appropriate package of post-discharge interventions."

The impact of this form of maternal intermittent fasting (IF) on fetal development and offspring health is not well defined. Using a rat model, we have shown previously that maternal IF results in fetal growth restriction accompanied by changes in placental nutrient transport function. The aim of this study was to assess cardiovascular, metabolic and renal function in adult offspring of IF-exposed dams. Food was withheld from Wistar rats from 17:00 to 09:00 daily throughout pregnancy; controls had ad libitum access to food. Birth weight was unaffected; however male IF pups grew more slowly up to 10 weeks of age ( P &lt; 0.01) whereas IF females matched their control counterparts. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), glucose tolerance and basal renal function at 14 weeks were not affected by IF exposure. When offered saline solutions (0.9–2.1%) to drink, females showed a greater salt preference than males ( P &lt; 0.01); however there were no differences between dietary groups. A separate group of pups was weaned onto a 4% NaCl diet. SBP increased in IF pups sooner, at 7 weeks ( P &lt; 0.01), than controls which became hypertensive from 10 weeks. Renal function did not appear to differ; however markers of renal injury were elevated in IF males ( P &lt; 0.05). Maternal IF does not affect resting cardiovascular, metabolic and renal function; but when challenged by dietary salt load male IF offspring are more prone to renal injury."

Pain and functional disability are the main problems that people with these conditions suffer. Neural mobilization has been shown to be an effective intervention in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain within individual trials, also contributing to improved functionality. Some systematic reviews have been carried out during the last years with the aim of synthesizing the scientific evidence on the use of neural mobilization techniques in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. However, they varied a lot in the methodological approaches and, consequently, in the findings and conclusions. Thus, this document is a planned protocol of a comprehensive systematic review with meta-analysis that we intend to carry out to review the scientific literature regarding up-to-date evidence on the use of neural mobilization in the management of people suffering from musculoskeletal pain disorders. The study designs that we will consider as inclusion criteria will be randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials. The target population will be adults and older adults with musculoskeletal pain. Any controlled trial using any neural mobilization technique as an intervention in one of the trial groups will be included. The main outcomes of interest will be pain, functional status, and physical performance tests (muscle strength, flexibility, and balance). There will be no restrictions on follow-up time or type of setting. The risk of bias of the included studies will be assessed by the RoB 2 tool and the certainty of the evidence will be evaluated using the comprehensive Assessment, Development and Assessment of Assessment Recommendation (GRADE) approach.

https://openalex.org/W4221081167,"In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), village health volunteers play an important role in providing health services including those to reduce the burden of malaria. Over the last two decades, the volunteer network has expanded to bring malaria services closer to communities and contributed to the reduction of malaria cases. However, as malaria test positivity rates decreased, many volunteers have lost motivation to continue providing routine malaria services, and other services they provide may not reflect growing healthcare demands for common diseases in the community. This study explored the perspectives, knowledge and inputs of key health stakeholders and community members in southern Lao PDR on community-delivered models in order to refine the volunteer model in the context of Lao PDR's primary health care sector and malaria elimination goals. Semi-structured interviews with multi-level health stakeholders, participatory workshops with community leaders, and focus group discussions with community members and current village health volunteers were conducted. Deductive followed by inductive thematic analysis was used to explore and categorise stakeholders' perspectives on community-delivered models for malaria elimination. Both stakeholders and community members agreed that village health volunteers are essential providers of malaria services in rural communities. Apart from malaria, community members identified dengue, diarrhoea, influenza, skin infections and tuberculosis as priorities (in descending order of importance) and requested community-based primary health care for these diseases. Stakeholders and community members suggested integrating prevention, diagnosis, and treatment services for the five priority diseases into the current malaria volunteer model. A divergence was identified between community members' expectations of health services and the services currently provided by village health volunteers. Stakeholders proposed an integrated model of healthcare to meet the needs of the community and help to maintain volunteers' motivation and the long-term sustainability of the role. An evidence-based, integrated community-delivered model of healthcare should be developed to balance the needs of both community members and stakeholders, with consideration of available resources and current health policies in Lao PDR."
