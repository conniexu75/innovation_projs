We recently found that disruption of the Fut8 gene induces severe growth retardation and early postnatal death. To investigate the molecular mechanism involved, we have established embryonic fibroblasts of Fut8+/+ and Fut8–/–, derived from wild-type and Fut8-null mice, respectively. Interestingly, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation levels of the EGF receptor (EGFR) were substantially blocked in Fut8–/– cells, compared with Fut8+/+ cells, while there are no significant changes in the total activities of tyrosine phosphatase for phosphorylated EGFR between two cells. The inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation was completely restored by re-introduction of the Fut8 gene to Fut8–/– cells. Consistent with this, EGFR-mediated JNK or ERK activation was significantly suppressed in Fut8–/– cells. Finally, we found that the core fucosylation of N-glycans is required for the binding of the EGF to its receptor, whereas no effect was observed for the expression levels of EGFR on the cell surface. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that core fucosylation is essential for EGF receptor-mediated biological functions. α1,6-Fucosyltransferase (Fut8) catalyzes the transfer of a fucose residue to N-linked oligosaccharides on glycoproteins via an α1,6-linkage to form core fucosylation in mammals.

The remodeling of cell surface growth factor receptors by modification of their oligosaccharide structures is associated with certain functions and biological events (1Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S.

The enzymatic products, core fucosylated N-glycans are widely distributed in a variety of glycoproteins (11Shimizu H. Ochiai K. Ikenaka K. Mikoshiba K. Hase S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and are altered under some pathological conditions. For example, the level of core fucosylation is elevated in both liver and serum during the process of hepatocarcinogenesis (12Hutchinson W.L. Du M.Q. Johnson P.J. Williams R. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The presence of core fucosylation of α-fetoprotein, a well known tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is known to distinguish patients with HCC from those with chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis (13Sato Y.

The binding of these ligands to the extracellular domain of EGFR induces activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, leading to the receptor autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in various cellular substrates, many of which serve as intracellular signal molecules (17Schlessinger J.

The extracellular domain of EGFR contains 12 potential N-glycosylation sites (20Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J.

It has been reported that the binding of EGF to EGFR was significantly reduced by treatment with some N-glycosylation inhibitors (21Soderquist A.M. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12586-12594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, EGF binding as well as its tyrosine kinase activity was reduced by addition of certain lectins (22Zeng F.Y.

On the other hand, the overexpression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), a pivotal glycosyltransferase that plays a major role in the biosynthesis of hybrid and complex types of N-linked oligosaccharides (27Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), significantly reduces the ability of EGF to bind to its receptor, EGFR autophosphorylation, and subsequently blocks EGFR-mediated ERK phosphorylation in U373 MG glioma cells (25Rebbaa A.

Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, N-linked oligosaccharides on EGFR appear to be important factors for receptor function. However, to date the roles of core fucosylation in EGFR-mediating functions have not been identified yet.To investigate the physiological functions of the core fucose, we generated Fut8-null mice. Disruption of Fut8 induces severe growth retardation, early death during postnatal development, and emphysema-like changes in the lung (28Wang X. Inoue S. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Li W. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Nakano M. Asahi M. Takahashi M. Uozumi N. Ihara S. Lee S.H. Ikeda Y. Yamaguchi Y. Aze Y. Tomiyama Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kondo A. Shapiro S.D. Lopez-Otin C. Kuwaki T. Okabe M. Honke K. Taniguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15791-15796Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We found that, in mice, a lack of core fucose leads to abnormal lung development and a marked down-regulation of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. This signaling dysregulation induces the expression and activation of several matrix metalloproteinases, which contributes to the destructive emphysema-like phenotype observed in core fucose-deficient mice. In the present study, we demonstrated that EGF as well as PDGF receptors are plausible factors that may be responsible for the growth retardation, since a down-regulation in EGF receptor-mediated signaling could be observed in both Fut8-null cells and mice. Furthermore, reintroduction of the Fut8 gene to Fut8-null cells potentially rescued EGF and the PDGF receptor-mediated signaling impaired in null cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—The embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild-type and Fut8-null mice were described (28Wang X. Inoue S. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Li W. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Nakano M. Asahi M. Takahashi M. Uozumi N. Ihara S. Lee S.H. Ikeda Y. Yamaguchi Y. Aze Y. Tomiyama Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kondo A.

A. 2005; 102: 15791-15796Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).Fut8 Activity Assay—The specific activity of Fut8 was determined using a synthetic substrate, 4-(2-pyridylamino)butylamine (PABA)-labeled oligosaccharide as a substrate. Cells grown to subconfluence were washed with PBS(–) once, and the cell pellet was suspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysate was then assayed for Fut8 activity as described previously (29Uozumi N. Teshima T. Yamamoto T. Nishikawa A. Gao Y.E. Miyoshi E. Gao C.X. Noda K. Islam K.N. Ihara Y. Fujii S. Shiba T. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 60 mm β-glycerophasphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using a protein assay BCA kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were run on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp.). The blots were probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 or anti-phospho-JNK1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). These membranes were stripped and reprobed with an antibody against the corresponding total protein ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling) and JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to confirm equal loading.Lectin Blotting Analysis—Whole cell lysate or immunoprecipitated EGFR was subjected to 10% or 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, and the membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml biotinylated aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL) (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan), which preferentially recognizes Fucα1,6GlcNAc structure, in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST four times, lectin-reactive proteins were detected using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and ECL kit.Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysate (∼1 mg of protein), prepared as described above, was incubated with the anti-EGFR antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking and then added to 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) (Amersham Biosciences) for another incubation of 2 h at 4 °C. For homogenate, whole 18.5-day embryos were homogenized in lysis buffer as described above and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (∼3 mg) was precleared by 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry) and then incubated with anti-EGFR antibody. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with lysis buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE for Western blot and lectin blot as described above. Band intensity was quantified by using the NIH Image 1.63 software.Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously (30Isaji T. Gu J. Nishiuchi R. Zhao Y. Takahashi M. Miyoshi E. Honke K. Sekiguchi K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19747-19754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) for 1 h at 4°C. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer, and the resulting cell lysate was then immunoprecipitated with the anti-EGFR antibody as described above. The biotinylated proteins were visualized using Vectastain ABC kit and ECL kit.In-blot Phosphatase Assay—Dephosphorylation of EGFR was examined by an In-blot phosphatase assay described previously (31Tamura M. Gu J. Matsumoto K. Aota S. Parsons R. Yamada K.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1614-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (∼20 μg) of A431 cells treated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 5 min were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred on PVDF membrane. Each membrane slice was incubated with or without 0.5 ml of Fut8+/+ or Fut8–/– cell lysates at the indicated concentrations in 30 °C for 1 h. Phosphorylated EGFR was detected with anti-phosphotyrosine.Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cells in subconfluent condition were harvested using 0.2% EDTA and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were suspended in PBS(–) (5 × 106 cells) and incubated with lens culinaris lectin (LCA)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Seikagaku Corp.) on ice for 30 min. After washing with ice-cold PBS(–) twice, the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS(–). A flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACScan instrument (BD Biosciences) operating with CELLQuest software.EGF Binding Assay—The cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cell/well in 24-well plates and incubated overnight. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, which contained 0.1% BSA (M-BSA), and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After replacing the medium with ice-cold M-BSA, 125I-EGF mixture was added, followed by incubation for 2 h at 4°C, as described previously (32Sato Y. Takahashi M. Shibukawa Y. Jain S.K. Hamaoka R.

The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and hydrolyzed on 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH. The radioactivity was counted with a γ counter.RESULTSThe major phenotypes of Fut8 knock-out mice are: (i) early death during postnatal development (about 70% Fut8-null mice), (ii) emphysema-like changes in the lung, and (iii) growth retardation. We have been attempting to clarify the underlying mechanisms for these phenotypes and found that down-regulation of TGF-β receptor is closely related with the emphysema-like changes (28Wang X. Inoue S. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Li W. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Nakano M. Asahi M. Takahashi M. Uozumi N. Ihara S. Lee S.H. Ikeda Y. Yamaguchi Y. Aze Y. Tomiyama Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kondo A.

To better understand the molecular mechanism of induction of retardation in Fut8–/– mice, we have established embryonic fibroblast at 18.5 post-coitus from Fut8+/+ and Fut8–/– mice (28Wang X. Inoue S. Gu J. Miyoshi E. Noda K. Li W. Mizuno-Horikawa Y. Nakano M. Asahi M. Takahashi M. Uozumi N. Ihara S. Lee S.H. Ikeda Y. Yamaguchi Y. Aze Y. Tomiyama Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kondo A.

A. 2005; 102: 15791-15796Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).Loss of Core Fucosylation in Fut8–/– Cells Is Rescued by Re-introduction of Fut8 Gene—To clarify whether the loss of function of core fucosylation can be restored, the Fut8 gene was re-introduced into Fut8–/– cells immortalized by the introduction of a zeocine resistant vector (pcDNA3.1) containing the SV40 large T gene. As expected, Fut8 activities could not be detected in Fut8–/– cells, even with a six times longer incubation as that used for Fut8+/+ cells (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Re-introduction of Fut8 gene into Fut8–/– cells resulted in recovery of Fut8 activities, the levels of which were comparable with those in Fut8+/+ cells.FIGURE 2Analyses of Fut8 activity. Fut8 activities were examined using a fluorescence-labeled sugar chain, GnGn-Asn-PABA, as an acceptor substrate, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The substrate (S) and Fut8 product (P) were eluted at ∼10 and 18 min respectively in Fut8+/+ and restored cells but not in Fut8–/– cells.

Restored, re-introduction of Fut8 gene into Fut8–/– cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On the other hand, the reaction products of Fut8, core fucosylated N-glycans were analyzed by means of the AAL lectin, which preferentially recognizes the core fucose in these cells. Under reducing conditions, several bands migrating at around 80–220 kDa in molecular mass were strongly stained with AAL in Fut8+/+ cells but only faintly stained in Fut8–/– cells (Fig. 3A). The reactive staining lost in Fut8–/– cells was completely rescued by restoring the Fut8 gene to Fut8–/– cells, suggesting that the post-translational modification by core fucosylation on N-glycans is only catalyzed by the Fut8 gene.FIGURE 3Expression of fucosylated glycans on Fut8–/– cells. A, lectin blot analyses. 5 μg of cell lysate from Fut8+/+, Fut8–/–, and restored cells were subjected to a lectin blot analysis using AAL as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of gels shows comparable amounts of proteins in each lane.

The binding ability of the LCA lectin was significantly decreased in Fut8–/– cells, compared with Fut8+/+ cells and the cells in which the Fut8 gene had been restored (Fig. 3C).Tyrosine Phosphorylation Level of EGFR Was Decreased in Fut8–/– Mice and Cells—EGF is a major multifunctional mitogen, which plays important roles in cell growth, cell differentiation, and cell migration. Several studies have shown that the remodeling of N-glycans on EGFR can modulate EGF-mediated intracellular signaling. Therefore, the issue of whether core fucosylation is required for the biological functions of EGFR was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4A, core fucosylation was expressed on EGFR in Fut8+/+ cells but abolished on EGFR from Fut8–/– cells. The re-introduction of the Fut8 gene restored the core fucosylation that was lost in Fut8–/– cells. No significant differences in the expression levels of EGFR on cell surface were found as confirmed by biotin labeling between the cells (Fig. 4B). The binding of EGF to the extracellular domain of the EGFR induces the activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, leading to the phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine residues (18Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar). The phosphorylaition levels of EGFR stimulated with EGF were increased in a dose-dependent manner in Fut8+/+ cells. Interestingly, the stimulation was significantly suppressed in Fut8–/– cells, whereas the responsiveness was rescued in the restored cells (Fig. 4C). The cellular tyrosine phosphorylation levels are regulated by tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases. To determine whether or not tyrosine phosphatases affect the levels of phosphorylation of EGFR, we performed an In-blot phosphatase assay in vitro and found that there are no significant changes in the total activities of tyrosine phosphatase for phosphorylated EGFR between Fut8-null and wild-type cells (Fig. 4E). Moreover, we found that tyrosine-phosphorylated levels of EGFR in Fut8-null embryos were lower than that in wild-type embryos (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the core fucosylation of EGFR can modulate its biological functions.FIGURE 4Tyrosine phosphorylation levels of EGFR upon EGF stimulation.

To determine whether core fucosylation is also important for EGFR-mediated intracellular signaling, downstream signaling molecules such as JNK and ERK1/2 were examined by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-JNK and ERK antibodies. JNK and ERK phosphorylation levels, as induced by EGF, were greatly enhanced in Fu8+/+ cells, whereas marginal activation of JNK or ERK was detected in Fu8–/– cells after 5 min of incubation with EGF (Fig. 5, A and B). Consistent with the phosphorylation levels of EGFR as described in Fig. 5, the down-regulation of JNK and ERK activation in Fu8–/– cells was rescued in the restored cells. Furthermore, these differences in responsiveness to EGF stimulation between Fut8+/+ and Fut8–/– cells were much more obvious at low concentrations of EGF stimulation (∼0.05 ng/ml) rather than higher concentrations (0.1∼ ng/ml), indicating the high binding affinity of EGF to its receptor is mainly down-regulated by a lack of core fucosylation. In fact, it has been reported that EGFR kinase activation occurs exclusively through the high affinity subclasss (33Bellot F. Moolenaar W. Kris R. Mirakhur B. Verlaan I. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Felder S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that down-regulation of phosphorylation of ERK induced by PDGF was also observed in Fu8–/– cells (Fig. 5C). Although we did not find significant changes in fibroblast growth factor-mediated signaling (Fig. 5D), the possibility that other growth factor receptor-mediated signaling may also affect cell growth cannot be excluded.FIGURE 5Down-regulation of phosphorylated JNK and ERK in Fut8–/– cells.

https://openalex.org/W2138913967,"Double fertilization of the egg cell and the central cell by one sperm cell each produces the diploid embryo and the typically triploid endosperm and is one of the defining characteristics of flowering plants (angiosperms). Endosperm and embryo develop in parallel to form the mature seed, but little is known about the coordination between these two organisms. We characterized a mutation of the Arabidopsis thaliana Cdc2 homolog CDC2A (also called CDKA;1), which has a paternal effect. In cdc2a mutant pollen, only one sperm cell, instead of two, is produced. Mutant pollen is viable but can fertilize only one cell in the embryo sac, allowing for a genetic dissection of the double fertilization process. We observed exclusive fertilization of the egg cell by cdc2a sperm cells. Moreover, we found that unfertilized endosperm developed, suggesting that a previously unrecognized positive signal from the fertilization of the egg cell initiates proliferation of the central cell."

Targeted screening of nucleoside analogs identified R1479 (4′-azidocytidine) as a specific inhibitor of HCV replication in the HCV subgenomic replicon system (IC50 = 1.28 μm) with similar potency compared with 2′-C-methylcytidine (IC50 = 1.13 μm). R1479 showed no effect on cell viability or proliferation of HCV replicon or Huh-7 cells at concentrations up to 2 mm. HCV replicon RNA could be fully cleared from replicon cells after prolonged incubation with R1479.

R1479-TP inhibited RNA synthesis as a CTP-competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 40 nm. On an HCV RNA-derived template substrate (complementary internal ribosome entry site), R1479-TP showed similar potency of NS5B inhibition compared with 3′-dCTP. R1479-TP was incorporated into nascent RNA by HCV polymerase and reduced further elongation with similar efficiency compared with 3′-dCTP under the reaction conditions.

Urgently required improvements in anti-HCV therapy will depend on the development of novel therapeutic approaches, especially in difficult to treat populations. HCV is an enveloped (+)-strand RNA virus that enters host cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and replicates in the host cell cytoplasm. A membrane-associated replicase complex containing HCV genome-encoded nonstructural proteins and HCV genomic RNA in a tight complex is responsible for the formation of viral RNA for packaging into new virus particles during the HCV replication process. The viral NS5B protein contains the HCV polymerase active site within the replicase complex, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The concept of polymerase inhibition to attain antiviral efficacy has been successfully established in other viral infections (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and herpes viruses). Polymerase inhibitors are the largest class of approved antiviral drugs, and nucleosides are the largest chemical class therein. The majority of antiviral nucleoside analogs are further metabolized to the corresponding nucleoside 5′-triphosphate analogs by cellular enzymes. Nucleoside 5′-triphosphate analogs then function as alternative substrates for the viral polymerase, competitively inhibit viral nucleic acid synthesis, and can terminate nucleic acid synthesis after incorporation. A novel ribonucleoside analog, 2′-C-methylcytidine (NM107), has entered clinical development as a 3′-valinate prodrug (NM283). 3Zhou, X.

Targeted screening of a nucleoside analog library combined with rational lead optimization at Roche identified R1479 (4′-azidocytidine) as a specific inhibitor of HCV replication in the HCV subgenomic replicon system. This study describes the profile of potency and selectivity of 4′-azidocytidine as an antiviral agent in cell culture and the characterization of 4′-azidocytidine triphosphate as an inhibitor of native HCV replicase and recombinant HCV polymerase (NS5B). Based on its promising preclinical profile, R1479 is currently under evaluation in clinical trials as a drug candidate for the treatment of HCV infection. HCV Replicon Assays—The 2209-23 cell line was established from Huh-7 cells by stable transfection with a bicistronic replicon (genotype 1b), of which the first open reading frame (driven by the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES)) contains the Renilla luciferase gene fused with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (nptII) and the second open reading frame (driven by the encephalomyocarditis virus IRES) contains the HCV nonstructural genes NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5A, and NS5B derived from the NK5.1 replicon backbone, originally described by Krieger et al. (12.Krieger N. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4614-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Thus, the replicon cell line 2209-23 is resistant to Geneticin (G418) and expresses the Renilla luciferase reporter gene as a marker of HCV RNA replication. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with Glutamax and 100 mg/ml sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). The medium was further supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml G418. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere. The selection and characterization of replicon clones carrying the point mutation S282T in the NS5B coding sequence will be described elsewhere. 4I. Nájera, S. Rajyaguru, S. Le Pogam, V.

Nucleoside analogs were synthesized at Roche, dissolved in 100% Me2SO, and then diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum before addition to cells. The final concentration of Me2SO was 1% (v/v) in all experiments. Quantification of Renilla luciferase activity was performed using the Renilla luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The WST-1 cell proliferation assay (Roche Diagnostics) was used to measure cell viability. Direct quantification of HCV RNA levels was performed by quantitative kinetic reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (TaqMan) using endogenous β-actin mRNA as a control. The primers used were 5′-GCTGCTATTGGGCGAAGTG-3′ (forward), 5′-GCCGCCGCATTGCA-3′ (reverse), and 5′-TCCTGCCGAGAAAGTATCCATCATGGCT-3′ (probe).

Replicon Cell Proliferation Assay—The effect of compounds on the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into cellular DNA was measured using the [3H]thymidine incorporation scintillation proximity assay system from Amersham Biosciences. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and WST-1 assay systems (Roche Diagnostics) were used to measure cell viability. The ATP bioluminescence assay kit HSII (Roche Diagnostics) was used to measure intracellular ATP levels. HCV RNA Clearance Assay—HCV replicon cells were cultured with 6 and 12 μm R1479 in the absence of neomycin selection for 15 days (replicon clearance phase). Cells were passaged at a 1:2 ratio when they reached confluency, and samples were taken for HCV replicon RNA level determination. After 15 days, the inhibitor was removed, and cells were cultured for an additional 15 days in culture medium containing 0.25 mg/ml neomycin to allow replication of residual replicon RNA molecules remaining after treatment. The levels of HCV RNA were determined by quantitative kinetic RT-PCR using TaqMan technology as described above and are expressed as log change compared with the HCV replicon RNA level in untreated cells at day 0. HCV Replicase Assay—The membrane-associated, native HCV replicase complex was isolated from 2209-23 HCV replicon cells and a derived cell line carrying HCV replicon RNA with a S282T mutation in the NS5B coding sequence according to previously published procedures (14.Ma H. Leveque V. De Witte A. Li W. Hendricks T. Clausen S.M. Cammack N. Klumpp K. Virology. 2005; 332: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The in vitro replicase assay contained 10 μl of cytoplasmic membrane fraction, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml actinomycin D, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm UTP, 30 μCi of [α-33P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml), 1 unit/μl SUPERase·In (Ambion, Inc.), 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 200 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase in a final volume of 25 μl. Inhibition by nucleotide analogs was determined as described (14.Ma H. Leveque V. De Witte A. Li W. Hendricks T. Clausen S.M. Cammack N. Klumpp K.

HCV Polymerase Assay—The enzyme activities of NS5B570-BK, NS5B570-Con1, and NS5B570-S282T-Con1 proteins was measured as incorporation of radiolabeled NMP into acid-insoluble RNA products as described previously (14.Ma H.

Briefly, HCV polymerase reactions contained 10 μg/ml complementary IRES (cIRES) or 3′-untranslated region (UTR) RNA template, 8.4 μg/ml poly(A)·oligo(U) template-primer or 1.6 μg/ml poly(I)·oligo(C) template-primer, 1 μm tritiated UTP or CTP (1–5 μCi), 1 μm ATP, 1 μm CTP, 1 μm GTP (with cIRES and 3′-UTR RNA templates), 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 mm MgCl2. NS5B570 proteins contain a C-terminal deletion of 21 amino acids, which removes a transmembrane domain and increases solubility of the protein (14.Ma H. Leveque V. De Witte A. Li W. Hendricks T.

Virol. 1999; 73: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HCV RNA templates used were as follows: cIRES RNA, corresponding to 377 nucleotides from the 3′-end of HCV (–)-strand RNA (14.Ma H. Leveque V. De Witte A. Li W. Hendricks T. Clausen S.M. Cammack N. Klumpp K. Virology. 2005; 332: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), with a base content of 21% Ade, 23% Ura, 28% Cyt, and 28% Gua; and 3′-UTR RNA, corresponding to 389 nucleotides from the 3′-end of HCV (+)-strand RNA, with a base content of 15% Ade, 38% Ura, 26% Cyt, and 21% Gua. RNA was transcribed in vitro using a T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Inc.) and purified either by phenol-chloroform extraction or using the Qiagen RNeasy maxi kit, with similar results. Poly(A) RNA was from Amersham Biosciences, and poly(I) RNA was from Yamasa Corp. Data were analyzed with GraphPad® Prism® and/or Microsoft® Excel®. The apparent Michaelis constant (Km(app)) of CTP for NS5B570-BK was calculated by nonlinear fitting using Equation 1, Y=(Vmax(app))XKm(app)+X (Eq. 1) where Y corresponds to the rate of RNA synthesis by NS5B570-BK (in cpm/min), Vmax(app) is the maximum rate at saturating substrate concentration, and X corresponds to CTP concentration. The compound concentration at which the enzyme-catalyzed rate was reduced by 50% (IC50) was calculated by fitting the data to Equation 2, Y=% Min+(% Max-% Min)(1+X(IC50)) (Eq. 2) where Y corresponds to the percent relative enzyme activity, % Min is the residual relative activity at saturating compound concentration, % Max is the relative maximum enzyme activity, and X corresponds to the compound concentration. The mean IC50 value was derived from the mean of several independent experiments. The S.D. was calculated from the nonbiased method using Equation 3. S.D.=n∑(IC50) 2-(∑IC50) 2n(n-1) (Eq. 3) The Ki(CTP) for Ro10482975 ′-triphosphate was derived by fitting the data to the Cheng-Prusoff equation, assuming competitive inhibition relative to CMP incorporation (Equation 4), Ki(CTP)=IC50(1+[CTP]Km(app)) (Eq. 4) where [CTP] is the initial concentration of CTP and Km(app) is the apparent Km for CTP. Gel-based Nucleotide Incorporation Assay—The RNA template-directed incorporation and extension of the nucleotide and nucleotide analogs by HCV NS5B were performed with a 19-nucleotide RNA oligonucleotide (5′-AUGUAUAAUUAUUGUAGCC-3′) and a 5′-end-labeled GG primer (Dharmacon, Inc.). The RNA template is predicted to form a single stem-loop structure with an unpaired 3-nucleotide sequence at the 3′-end. The 5′-end labeling of the GG primer was performed with [γ-33P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science). The nucleotide incorporation reactions contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm NS5B570-BK, 5 μm RNA template, 0.15 μm end-labeled GG primer, and nucleoside triphosphates at the indicated concentrations in a volume of 10 μl. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of formamide gel loading buffer II (Ambion, Inc.). After denaturing at 95 °C for 3 min, the RNA template, primer, and extended primer were separated on a Tris borate/EDTA-urea-20% acrylamide gel. The dried gel was exposed to a storage phosphor screen and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Nucleoside analogs have proven to be highly successful agents for the treatment of viral infections, including HIV, hepatitis B virus, and herpes viruses. In most cases, the nucleoside triphosphates are the biologically active metabolites, and nucleoside analogs are converted to their active triphosphate forms by cellular enzymes. The nucleoside triphosphate analogs then function as competitive substrate analogs of the viral polymerase and inhibit the synthesis of viral DNA and/or RNA molecules. The HCV subgenomic replicon provides a convenient cellular system for the assessment of nucleoside analogs as inhibitors of HCV replication (9.Carroll S.S. Tomassini J.E. Bosserman M. Getty K.

A bicistronic HCV replicon was developed that contains the HCV 5′-UTR directing translation of Renilla luciferase and the selectable marker neomycin phosphotransferase. The encephalomyocarditis virus IRES directs the translation of HCV proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (12.Krieger N. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. J.

The Renilla replicon system was validated using a range of different types of HCV replication inhibitors, including interferon-α, and established that the level of Renilla luciferase activity correlated with the level of HCV replicon RNA as determined by quantitative kinetic RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. Screening of a nucleoside library identified a series of compounds that inhibited HCV subgenomic RNA replication without interfering with cell viability and cell proliferation. After further optimization, R1479 (4′-azidocytidine) (Fig. 1) was selected for further characterization based on an exceptionally high therapeutic window in HCV replicon cells. Inhibition of HCV RNA Replication by R1479—R1479 inhibited HCV RNA replication with a mean IC50 value of 1.28 μm when measured as dose-dependent reduction of Renilla luciferase activity after a 72-h incubation of proliferating replicon cells (Table 1). The potency of R1479 in this cell line was similar to that obtained for 2′-C-methylcytidine with a mean IC50 value of 1.13 μm. Similar potencies for both compounds were also obtained from the measurement of the dose-dependent reduction of HCV replicon RNA by quantitative kinetic RT-PCR (Table 1). In contrast, the structurally related cytidine analog 3′-deoxycytidine did not inhibit HCV RNA replication in replicon cells at concentrations up to 100 μm. R1479 showed only low cytotoxicity in human hepatoma-derived replicon cells. Cell viability was monitored by measuring intracellular ATP concentration or cellular 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide or succinate-tetrazolium reductase activities. No reduction in cell viability was observed with R1479 at concentrations up to 2 mm using any of the three methods (Table 1).TABLE 1Inhibition of HCV RNA replication in HCV replicon cellsCompoundIC50LauaInhibition of HCV replicon-encoded Renilla luciferase reporter activity; mean IC50 value ± S.E. determined from 101 (R1479) and 354 (2′-C-methylcytidine) experiments.TaqbInhibition of HCV RNA determined by quantitative kinetic RT-PCR; mean IC50 value ± S.E. calculated from at least four experiments.WST-1cCell viability determined from at least four experiments.[3H]ThddInhibition of tritiated thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA determined from at least four experiments.ATPeReduction of cellular ATP levels determined from four experiments.μm4′-Azidocytidine (R1479)1.28 ± 0.080.67 ± 0.13>2000>100>20002′-C-Methylcytidine1.13 ± 0.030.76 ± 0.01>100>100NDfND, not determined.3′-Deoxycytidine>100ND>100NDNDMycophenolic acid0.32 ± 0.07ND>1000.60 ± 0.02NDa Inhibition of HCV replicon-encoded Renilla luciferase reporter activity; mean IC50 value ± S.E. determined from 101 (R1479) and 354 (2′-C-methylcytidine) experiments.b Inhibition of HCV RNA determined by quantitative kinetic RT-PCR; mean IC50 value ± S.E. calculated from at least four experiments.c Cell viability determined from at least four experiments.d Inhibition of tritiated thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA determined from at least four experiments.e Reduction of cellular ATP levels determined from four experiments.f ND, not determined.

Lohmann V. Rutter G. Kurpanek K. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1252-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Cytostatic compounds therefore reduce HCV RNA levels in replicon cells in a nonspecific manner, as exemplified by the IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor mycophenolic acid. Mycophenolic acid is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation, as measured by the inhibition of tritiated thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA (IC50 = 0.6 μm) without affecting cell viability over a 72-h incubation period at concentrations up to 100 μm (Table 1). The apparent IC50 value for the inhibition of HCV replicon RNA replication by mycophenolic acid was similar to the IC50 value for thymidine incorporation into cellular DNA, suggesting an indirect cell culture-specific effect of HCV replicon RNA reduction by mycophenolic acid. In contrast, R1479 was not cytostatic and did not inhibit tritiated thymidine incorporation at concentrations up to 1 mm, suggesting that R1479 inhibits HCV replication by a direct antiviral mechanism. The point mutation S282T in the NS5B coding sequence has been previously associated with resistance to nucleoside analogs carrying a 2′-β-methyl moiety, as shown using wild-type and mutant S282T transient replicons (10.Olsen D.B.

In contrast, the S282T mutation did not confer resistance to HCV replication inhibition by R1479. Both stable and transient mutant replicons carrying mutation S282T in the NS5B coding region were sensitive to inhibition by R1479, suggesting absence of cross-resistance between 2′-methyl-nucleosides and R1479 (Table 2).TABLE 2Inhibition of genotype 1b wild-type Con1 and Con1-S282T stable and transient replicon replicationCompoundIC50Stable repliconsTransient repliconsWild typeaInhibition of HCV RNA replication of the genotype 1b wild-type Con1 stable replicon.S282TbInhibition of HCV RNA determined by quantitative kinetic RT-PCR; IC50 value determined from two different stable replicon cell lines containing the S282T mutation (cell lines 16 and C).Wild typecInhibition of HCV RNA replication; mean IC50 value ± S.E. determined from at least five independent experiments by quantification of replicon-encoded luciferase activity.S282TcInhibition of HCV RNA replication; mean IC50 value ± S.E. determined from at least five independent experiments by quantification of replicon-encoded luciferase activity.Cell line 16Cell line CμmμmR14790.67 ± 0.130.30.271.9 ± 0.260.53 ± 0.1a Inhibition of HCV RNA replication of the genotype 1b wild-type Con1 stable replicon.b Inhibition of HCV RNA determined by quantitative kinetic RT-PCR; IC50 value determined from two different stable replicon cell lines containing the S282T mutation (cell lines 16 and C).c Inhibition of HCV RNA replication; mean IC50 value ± S.E. determined from at least five independent experiments by quantification of replicon-encoded luciferase activity. Open table in a new tab Clearance of HCV RNA from Replicon Cells—Prolonged incubation of replicon cells with HCV polymerase inhibitors can result in the selection of inhibitor-resistant replicon variants with point mutations in the NS5B protein coding sequence.4 In contrast, prolonged incubation of HCV replicon cells with R1479 resulted in a continued decrease in HCV RNA to undetectable levels (Fig. 2). To determine the kinetics of the HCV subgenomic replicon inhibition by R1479, HCV replicon cells were cultured in the presence of inhibitor at 6 and 12 μm and in the absence of neomycin selection for 15 days (replicon clearance phase). During this phase in the absence of neomycin, cells were able to proliferate even in the absence of active replicon replication. After this time and during the rebound phase, the inhibitor was removed, and cells were cultured for an additional 30 days in culture medium containing 0.25 mg/ml neomycin (15 days for the untreated control). In the presence of neomycin, only cells harboring active replicating replicons are able to proliferate. HCV RNA levels were monitored every 3 days by quantitative kinetic RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HCV RNA levels remained constant throughout the viral clearance and the rebound phases in the untreated cells. In the presence of R1479 at 6 and 12 μm (approximately 5 × IC50 and 10 × IC50, respectively), the HCV RNA was reduced by >5 log units and became undetectable by RT-PCR after the 15-day incubation period. In addition, cells had lost the ability to grow in the presence of neomycin during the rebound phase (Fig. 2). Therefore, R1479 at concentrations of approximately its IC90 was able to completely clear the HCV subgenomic replicon RNA from the replicon cells within a 15-day incubation period. R1479 5′-Triphosphate (TP) Inhibits Native HCV Replicase in Vitro—The highly specific inhibition of HCV RNA replication by R1479 suggested HCV polymerase NS5B as a possible target of the corresponding R1479-TP. NS5B likely forms large multiprotein-RNA complexes with the other HCV-encoded nonstructural proteins and the HCV genomic RNA during the assembly of the functional HCV replicase (20.Moradpour D. Gosert R. Egger D. Penin F. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Antiviral Res. 2003; 60: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated, native HCV replicase complexes were isolated from HCV replicon cells according to published procedures (14.Ma H. Leveque V. De"

We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to delay the output of motor commands from the motor cortex during voluntary movement. We show attenuation of sensation during this delay, in the absence of movement.

Here we report the results of a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster cells for new components of the Hh signaling pathway. The screen identified hundreds of potential new regulators of Hh signaling, including many large protein complexes with pleiotropic effects, such as the coat protein complex I (COPI) complex, the ribosome and the proteasome. We identified the multimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and two new kinases, the D. melanogaster orthologs of the vertebrate PITSLRE and cyclin-dependent kinase-9 (CDK9) kinases, as Hh regulators. We also identified a large group of constitutive and alternative splicing factors, two nucleoporins involved in mRNA export and several RNA-regulatory proteins as potent regulators of Hh signal transduction, indicating that splicing regulation and mRNA transport have a previously unrecognized role in Hh signaling. Finally, we showed that several of these genes have conserved roles in mammalian Hh signaling."

The transcript profiles were first analysed by a modified protocol for representational difference analysis (RDA) of cDNAs between MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The majority of genes identified by RDA showed nearly complete concordance with microarray results, and also led to the identification of some differentially expressed genes such as lysyl oxidase, copper transporter ATP7A, EphB6, RUNX2 and a variant of RUNX2. The altered transcripts identified by microarray analysis were involved in cell–cell or cell–matrix interaction, Rho signaling, calcium homeostasis and copper-binding/sensitive activities. A set of nine genes that included GPCR11, cadherin 11, annexin A1, vimentin, lactate dehydrogenase B (upregulated in MDA-MB-231) and GREB1, S100A8, amyloid β precursor protein, claudin 3 and cadherin 1 (downregulated in MDA-MB-231) were sufficient to distinguish MDA-MB-231 from MCF7 cells. The downregulation of a set of transcripts for proteins involved in cell–cell interaction indicated these transcripts as potential markers for invasiveness that can be detected by methylation-specific PCR. The proteomic profiles indicated altered abundance of fewer proteins as compared to transcript profiles. Antisense knockdown of selected transcripts led to inhibition of cell proliferation that was accompanied by altered proteomic profiles. The proteomic profiles of antisense transfectants suggest the involvement of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Raf kinase inhibitor and 80 kDa protein kinase C substrate in mediating the inhibition of cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2039213842,"We have established previously that the 67-kDa elastin-binding protein (EBP), identical to the spliced variant of beta-galactosidase, acts as a recyclable chaperone that facilitates secretion of tropoelastin. (Hinek, A., Keeley, F. W., and Callahan, J. W. (1995) Exp. Cell Res. 220, 312-324). We now demonstrate that EBP also forms a cell surface-targeted molecular complex with protective protein/cathepsin A and sialidase (neuraminidase-1), and provide evidence that this sialidase activity is a prerequisite for the subsequent release of tropoelastin. We found that treatment with sialidase inhibitors repressed assembly of elastic fibers in cultures of human skin fibroblasts, aortic smooth muscle cells, and ear cartilage chondrocytes and caused impaired elastogenesis in developing chick embryos. Fibroblasts derived from patients with congenital sialidosis (primary deficiency of neuraminidase-1) and galactosialidosis (secondary deficiency of neuraminidase-1) demonstrated impaired elastogenesis, which could be reversed after their transduction with neuraminidase-1 cDNA or after treatment with bacterial sialidase, which has a similar substrate specificity to human neuraminidase-1. We postulate that neuraminidase-1 catalyzes removal of the terminal sialic acids from carbohydrate chains of microfibrillar glycoproteins and other adjacent matrix glycoconjugates, unmasking their penultimate galactosugars. In turn, the exposed galactosugars interact with the galectin domain of EBP, thereby inducing the release of transported tropoelastin molecules and facilitating their subsequent assembly into elastic fibers."

BCC species were initially described as plant pathogens (1Burkholder W.H. Phytopathology. 1950; 40: 115-117Google Scholar), but all species have the ability to cause serious infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (2Speert D.P. Paediatr. Respir. Rev. 2002; 3: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These two disease conditions are quite disparate, CF being caused by dysfunctional chloride transport in the lung epithelium (3Rommens J.M. Iannuzzi M.C. Kerem B. Drumm M.L. Melmer G. Dean M. Rozmahel R. Cole J.L. Kennedy D. Hidaka N. Zsiga M. Buchwald M. Riordan J.R. Tsui L.-C. Collins F.S. Science. 1989; 245: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar) and CGD being caused by an inability of phagocytes to generate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) important for microbial killing (4Bylund J. Goldblatt D. Speert D.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2005; 568: 67-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, they may share features explaining the virulence of BCC in these particular patient groups. In CF, B. cenocepacia and Burkholderia multivorans (formerly known as genomovar III and II, respectively) are the predominant BCC pathogens; infection in some is characterized by overwhelming pulmonary disease with an excessive accumulation of inflammatory cells, in particular neutrophils (5Isles A. Maclusky I. Corey M. Gold R. Prober C. Fleming P. Levison H. J. Pediatr. 1984; 104: 206-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Neutrophils are very potent effector cells of the innate immune system and the first line of defense against infecting bacteria. To accomplish bacterial killing, they utilize their powerful antibacterial arsenal consisting of toxic ROS and antibacterial peptides/proteins. BCC are largely resistant to the action of antibacterial peptides/proteins (6Speert D.P. Bond M. Woodman R.C. Curnutte J.T. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 170: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which may explain the virulence of BCC in CGD patients, the phagocytes of which rely solely on these non-oxidative means of microbial killing. We have previously shown that CGD neutrophils fail to kill ingested BCC (6Speert D.P. Bond M. Woodman R.C. Curnutte J.T. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 170: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and subsequently undergo necrotic cell death (7Bylund J. Campsall P.A. Ma R.C. Conway B.A. Speert D.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3562-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, ROS appear to be critical for defense against infections with these bacteria. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests that a redox imbalance is present in the CF lung (8Hudson V.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1440-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), despite the fact that CF neutrophils are fully competent to produce ROS in vitro. Neutrophil-derived ROS are produced by the action of the NADPH-oxidase, a membrane-bound enzyme complex that ferries electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH across the membrane to molecular oxygen that is converted to superoxide anion (O2⋅¯) (9Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: S309-S317Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The NADPH-oxidase is present both in the cell membrane and in membranes of intracellular granules, and O2⋅¯ is released outside of the cells or within granular compartments, e.g. a phagosome (10Karlsson A. Dahlgren C. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The O2⋅¯ rapidly dismutates to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is a more stable radical of relatively low reactivity, rendering it freely diffusible through biological membranes and fluids. The most highly bactericidal ROS are formed when H2O2 reacts with myeloperoxidase, an enzyme located in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, to form hypochlorous acid (HOCl, also known as bleach), which is very toxic to almost all microbes (11Roos D. van Bruggen R. Meischl C. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). H2O2 can also react with a number of other compounds (sometimes catalyzed by myeloperoxidase), resulting in a wide variety of ROS differing in stability and/or reactivity. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are more common than BCC infections in CF, the latter are associated with worse clinical prognosis (2Speert D.P. Paediatr. Respir. Rev. 2002; 3: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Chronic P. aeruginosa infections are often associated with a mucoid bacterial phenotype, and the mucoid substance is a hydrophilic exopolysaccharide (EPS) called alginate (12Govan J.R. Deretic V. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 539-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alginate interferes with the function of neutrophils by inhibiting chemotactic migration and scavenging ROS (13Konig B. Friedl P. Pedersen S.S. Konig W. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1992; 99: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Pedersen S.S. Kharazmi A. Espersen F. Hoiby N. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3363-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); thus, alginate appears to be an important virulence determinant for P. aeruginosa in CF. EPS production in BCC also occurs (15Cerantola S. Bounery J. Segonds C. Marty N. Montrozier H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 185: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although the chemical composition of the BCC EPS is very different from alginate. The mucoid material from P. aeruginosa (alginate) is an acetylated copolymer of 1–4 linked β-d-mannuronic acid and α-l-guluronic acid (16Sherbrock-Cox V. Russell N.J. Gacesa P. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 135: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas the mucoid material from BCC consists of several different polysaccharides distinct from alginate. For example, the mucoid material produced by the B. cenocepacia strain, C9343, used in this study is a mixture of three different polysaccharides (17Conway B.A. Chu K.K. Bylund J. Altman E. Speert D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar): polysaccharide-I (18Cerantola S. Marty N. Montrozier H. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 285: 59-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (constituted of a disaccharide repeating unit consisting of glucose and galactose, with the galactose residue substituted on C-4 and C-6 with a pyruvic acid); cepacian (19Sist P. Cescutti P. Skerlavaj S. Urbani R. Leitao J.H. Sa-Correia I. Rizzo R. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 1861-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (previously known as polysaccharide-II (20Cerantola S. Lemassu-Jacquier A. Montrozier H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), composed of an acetylated heptasaccharide repeating unit containing galactose, mannose, rhamnose, glucose, and glucuronic acid); and dextran (α-1,6 glucan). We have previously shown that this EPS, produced by a mucoid B. cenocepacia isolate, interfered with phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils and facilitated bacterial persistence in a mouse model (17Conway B.A. Chu K.K. Bylund J. Altman E. Speert D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to expand on these observations and investigate whether B. cenocepacia EPS affects other functions of neutrophils. We showed that B. cenocepacia EPS inhibited chemotactic migration of human neutrophils and also scavenged ROS generated from activated cells. We concluded that despite the biochemical differences between alginate and B. cenocepacia EPS, these substances share functional properties that could be of relevance for CF. B. cenocepacia EPS could contribute to the inability of neutrophils to clear offending bacteria and may constitute an important virulence factor of relevance in the CF lung. Bacterial Strains and Purification of EPS—B. cenocepacia strain C9343 is a mucoid isolate from a CF patient. The isolate is deposited in the Canadian BCC Research and Referral Repository (Vancouver, BC) and has been previously described (17Conway B.A. Chu K.K. Bylund J. Altman E. Speert D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa strain P1 is a mucoid CF isolate previously described (21Hancock R.E. Mutharia L.M. Chan L. Darveau R.P. Speert D.P. Pier G.B. Infect. Immun. 1983; 42: 170-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both strains were routinely stored at –80 °C or maintained on Columbia Agar containing 5% sheep's blood (PML Microbiologicals, Wilsonville, OR) for a maximum of two passages. For EPS purification, bacteria were grown on modified yeast extractmannitol agar consisting of 0.05% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.4% (w/v) mannitol, and 1.5% (w/v) yeast extract-mannitol agar at 37 °C for 64 h. EPS was recovered in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, and liquefied phenol was added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v). This mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 8 h and then centrifuged to remove cells. The EPS was precipitated with 4 volumes of cold 95% ethanol, recovered by centrifugation for 10 min at 9600 × g, dialyzed against distilled water with a molecular mass cut-off of 12 kDa at 4 °C for 48 h, lyophilized, and resuspended in assay buffer. Endotoxin Purification—Endotoxin was purified by suspending a freeze-dried pellet of B. cenocepacia strain C9343 in extraction mixture consisting of phenol (90%):chloroform:petroleum spirit in the proportions 2:5:8. The mixture was stirred on ice for 10 min and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min), after which the supernatant was filtered. The filtrate was air-dried and repurified (22Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), washed in ice-cold ethanol, and resuspended in endotoxin-free water + 0.2% triethylamine after drying. Determination of Endotoxin Content in the EPS Preparation—The amount of endotoxin was determined through direct transmethylation of the fatty acids (FA) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the FA methyl ester derivatives obtained. A sample of C9343 EPS (10 mg) was placed in a Teflon-lined screw-capped tube. One ml of methanolic HCl, 1 ml of methanol, and 0.5 ml of hexane were added and heated at 100 °C for 1 h, with frequent shaking. After cooling, 2 ml of hexane and 2 ml of water were added, and the content was mixed by vortexing. The hexane layer was collected, and a known amount of C19:0 methyl ester (internal standard), previously treated in the same way, was added to the solution before drying it under nitrogen. The sample was dissolved in 30 μl of hexane and subjected to gas chromatography using a PerkinElmer Autosystem XL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and an SP2330 capillary column (Supelco, 30 m), using helium as the carrier gas. The temperature program used was at 140 °C for 5 min, from 140 to 240 °C at 4 °C/min, at 240 °C for 10 min. GC-MS analyses were carried out on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5971 mass selective detector. The determination of the endotoxin molecular weight was accomplished by separate analysis of the lipid A and the core oligosaccharide components. The lipid A was extracted from strain C9343, and its molecular weight determination was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-MS and GC analysis. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrum showed two major negative ions at 1670 and 1801 atomic mass units. The molecular weight of the core oligosaccharide was calculated from electrospray ionization-MS data obtained in our laboratory on the core extracted from a clinical strain of B. cepacia. 4A. Silipo, A. Molinaro, D. Comegna, R. Lanzetta, P. Cescutti, and R. Rizzo, unpublished results. Since both lipid A and core moieties showed a certain degree of structural variability, the mean molecular weight was evaluated, taking into account all the molecular masses obtained by MS analyses for both species. The mass spectra exhibited a single peak for each species present; the peak intensity was taken as the relative occurrence of each molecular species. The molecular mass of the endotoxin was then evaluated by summing the mass of each species multiplied by its relative occurrence, to give a value of 3380. Isolation of Neutrophils—Collection of blood from healthy adult volunteers was performed in accordance with University of British Columbia Research Ethics Board protocol C04-0193. Human neutrophils were purified using dextran sedimentation and Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation (23Boyum A. Lovhaug D. Tresland L. Nordlie E.M. Scand. J. Immunol. 1991; 34: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The cells were washed and resuspended (107/ml) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (KRG, pH 7.3) containing glucose (10 mm), Ca2+ (1 mm), and Mg2+ (1.5 mm) and stored on melting ice until use. This protocol routinely produced a neutrophil population of ∼95% purity as judged by visual inspection of Giemsa-stained slides. Neutrophil Chemotaxis—Neutrophils were resuspended in KRG supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (to prevent adhesion to the plastic), and varying concentrations of EPS (or endotoxin) and 106 cells in 100 μl were placed in the upper compartment of a transwell system (Costar, Acton, MA) with a pore size of 3 μm. In the lower compartment were placed 600 μl of buffer with appropriate additions of EPS or (endotoxin) and/or chemoattractant (formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF) at 10–8 m). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min, after which the upper compartments were removed, and the transmigrated cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton and quantified on the basis of lactate dehydrogenase content in the lysates using a lactate dehydrogenase kit (Roche Diagnostics). The data were expressed as the percentage of 106 cells that were lysed directly. Neither fMLF nor EPS affected the lactate dehydrogenase assay per se (not shown). Production of ROS—Details about the various ROS detection systems are given in Ref. 24Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, and brief descriptions are given below. For cell-free systems, the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system was employed to generate ROS as described previously (25Simpson J.A. Smith S.E. Dean R.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture without cells (in the presence or absence of EPS) was supplemented with xanthine (2.5 mm), and ROS production was started by the addition of xanthine oxidase (12.5 milliunits/ml). Chemiluminescence (CL)—An isoluminol-enhanced CL system was used with a Victor3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) plate reader and disposable 96-well plates containing 220-μl reaction mixtures. Each well contained 106 neutrophils, horseradish peroxidase (4 units/ml), and isoluminol (a cell-impermeable CL substrate; 2 × 10–5 m) in KRG. The cells were equilibrated in the Victor3 for 10 min at 37 °C, in the presence or absence of EPS, after which the stimulus (15–30 μl) was added using an automated internal injector (fMLF 10–7 m or PMA 100 ng/ml). The light emission was recorded continuously, and data are expressed as counts/s. Cytochrome c Reduction—Neutrophils (5 × 105/sample) were mixed with cytochrome c (1.5 mg/ml) and diluted in KRG (in the presence or absence of EPS) to 0.99 ml in a cuvette that was equilibrated at 37 °C for 10 min. The cuvette was then transferred to a spectrophotometer (Lambda 2; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and absorbance measurements at 550 nm were started after the addition of 10 μl of PMA (100 ng/ml final) and continued for 30 min. PHPA Oxidation—Neutrophils (5 × 105/sample) were mixed with horseradish peroxidase (4 units/ml), p-hydroxyphenylacetate (PHPA; 0.5 mg/ml), and superoxide dismutase (50 units/ml) to ensure full conversion of O2⋅¯ to H2O2. The cuvettes were equilibrated at 37° for 10 min in the presence or absence of EPS before stimulation with PMA (100 ng/ml final). Emission was measured continuously at 400 nm with an excitation wavelength of 317 nm using a luminescence spectrometer (LS50B; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Intracellular Calcium Measurements—Freshly isolated neutrophils (107/ml) in KRG buffer without calcium, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, were labeled with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 AM (2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark with occasional shaking. The labeled cells were then washed twice and resuspended in KRG with calcium in the presence or absence of EPS. In a black 96-well plate, 2 × 106 cells were equilibrated at 37 °C for 10 min before the addition of fMLF (10–7 m) using the internal injector. Fluorescence was followed kinetically (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 535 nm) using the Victor3 plate reader, and the values were normalized to 100% fluorescence (obtained after lysing the cells with 1% Triton). Wavelength Absorption Scanning—Wavelength absorbance scans, ranging from 200 to 900 nm, were performed on EPS solutions (1 mg/ml in KRG) with KRG in the reference cuvette on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 2; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Production of Uric Acid—Cell-free systems, consisting of xanthine (2.5 mm) in KRG buffer in the presence or absence of EPS, were activated by the addition of xanthine oxidase (12.5 milliunits/ml), and the accumulation of uric acid was followed at 293 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 2; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). B. cenocepacia EPS Inhibits Neutrophil Chemotaxis—We investigated whether B. cenocepacia EPS inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro as has been described for alginate from various P. aeruginosa strains (14Pedersen S.S. Kharazmi A. Espersen F. Hoiby N. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3363-3368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formylated peptide fMLF is a potent chemoattractant, with maximal effect at a concentration of 10–8 m. Chemotaxis toward fMLF was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by B. cenocepacia EPS (Fig. 1A). At high concentrations of EPS (>1 mg/ml), spontaneous (random cell movement in the absence of fMLF) neutrophil migration was also inhibited (not shown). This could probably be attributed to the viscous nature of the EPS. However, significant inhibition of fMLF-directed chemotaxis was observed with EPS concentrations in the μg/ml range (at which random migration was not affected), indicating that the inhibition of directed migration was not simply based on viscosity. Endotoxin can affect neutrophil chemotaxis, although both inhibitory and enhancing effects have been reported (26Fan J. Malik A.B. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 27Bignold L.P. Rogers S.D. Siaw T.M. Bahnisch J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4255-4258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that contaminating endotoxin was responsible for the inhibition of chemotaxis, we analyzed the endotoxin content of the purified EPS preparations. The endotoxin produced by strain C9343 is rough, lacking the O side chain (17Conway B.A. Chu K.K. Bylund J. Altman E. Speert D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 190: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the contaminating amount was calculated indirectly, through transmethylation of the FA present in the C9343 EPS sample using C19:0 as an internal standard. Two independent derivatizations and measurements were performed and were consistent with one another. Four different FA were identified by comparison with retention times of standards in the GLC chromatogram and by electron impact mass spectrometry (Table 1). Three additional peaks in the GLC chromatogram did not correspond to any of the available standards, whereas their e.i mass spectra suggested the presence of two unsaturated FA and one 3-hydroxyl FA, all in lesser amounts than C18:1 (9Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: S309-S317Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The estimation of the amount of endotoxin was achieved considering the presence of an equimolar ratio of C14:0 and endotoxin, which gives the highest amount of contamination possibly present. In this way, the predicted contamination level of 0.23% (w/w) endotoxin with respect to the EPS sample was obtained. Using this calculation, we performed chemotaxis experiments in the presence of endotoxin purified from B. cenocepacia C9343. At concentrations up to 2 μg/ml (corresponding to the highest possible endotoxin contamination in EPS samples of roughly 0.85 mg/ml), endotoxin did not affect fMLF driven chemotaxis (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that endotoxin contamination of the EPS preparation was not responsible for the inhibition of chemotaxis.TABLE 1FA content of EPS from B. cenocepacia C9343Fatty acidAverage % (w/w)C14:00.0161C16:00.0120C18:00.0056C18:1(9)0.0029 Open table in a new tab EPS Inhibits fMLF-induced ROS Production—Apart from chemotaxis, fMLF also governs a number of other neutrophil effector functions, such as activation of the NADPH-oxidase that results in the production of ROS. When cells were stimulated with fMLF, a robust production of ROS ensued. This response was abrogated in the presence of B. cenocepacia EPS (Fig. 2). The inhibition of ROS production was probably not due to contaminating endotoxin since purified B. cenocepacia endotoxin enhanced (rather than diminished) the levels of ROS produced after fMLF stimulation (Fig. 2, inset). B. cenocepacia EPS Does Not Interfere with Cell Signaling and/or Viability—Binding of fMLF to its receptor, the formyl peptide receptor, induces various intracellular signaling events, of which a transient increase in the cytosolic calcium concentration is one of the most prominent (28Lew P.D. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: S127-S131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We measured fMLF-induced calcium flux in the presence or absence of EPS to investigate whether the inhibitory effects of EPS on fMLF-induced activities were due to inactivation/immobilization of the agonist or interference with intracellular signaling events. Even in the presence of EPS concentrations as high as 2.5 mg/ml, fMLF induced a swift and transient increase in cytosolic calcium concentrations (Fig. 3), indistinguishable from the calcium response in the absence of EPS (Fig. 3, inset). Furthermore, incubation of neutrophils in the presence of EPS (at concentrations ranging from 100 ng/ml to 2 mg/ml) for up to 18 h was not cytotoxic, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase release or trypan blue exclusion experiments (not shown). EPS Inhibits PMA-induced ROS Production—EPS also inhibited neutrophil ROS production in response to the phorbol ester PMA, a very powerful activator of the NADPH-oxidase. The inhibitory effect of EPS was dose-dependent, and near complete inhibition of ROS production was obtained at an EPS concentration of 1 mg/ml (Fig. 4). When EPS was added to cells after PMA stimulation, an abrupt decline in ROS production was observed (Fig. 4B). To determine whether the EPS inhibition of ROS production was due to interference with the CL system, such as interference with the luminescence (light quenching), we evaluated the EPS by an optical scan spanning the visible spectrum. EPS did not show any significant absorbance at wavelengths greater than 300 nm (not shown); we therefore concluded that it was highly unlikely that any light quenching properties of the EPS were responsible for the decreased CL signals observed in its presence. We also performed ROS measurements using the cytochrome c reduction assay (24Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) to rule out the possibility of EPS interference with the components of the CL system, e.g. the peroxidase used (horseradish peroxidase). Using this assay, B. cenocepacia EPS markedly inhibited ROS production in response to PMA (Fig. 5A). Both the CL and the cytochrome c reduction assays detect O2⋅¯, which is the ROS primarily produced by the activated NADPH-oxidase. O2⋅¯ is rapidly converted to H2O2, which can be detected using the PHPA oxidation assay in the presence of superoxide dismutase (to ensure a full conversion of O2⋅¯ to H2O2). EPS markedly decreased the ROS response of PMA stimulated neutrophils (Fig. 5B), as observed with this assay. Inhibition of ROS by B. cenocepacia EPS was similar in dose dependence to that of alginate from P. aeruginosa, regardless of which technique was used to measure ROS production (CL results are shown in Fig. 4A). EPS Scavenge ROS in Cell-free Systems—Since we ruled out likely artifactual effects of EPS on the ROS measuring systems employed (such as light quenching/absorption) and inhibition of cell signaling upstream of the NADPH-oxidase (such as calcium flux), we reasoned that the inhibitory effect on ROS production could be based on two different mechanisms. Either the effect could be explained by scavenging/quenching of the ROS once formed, or the effect could be due to interference with the activation/assembly of the NADPH-oxidase. The former model has been presented as an explanation for the effect of alginate since this polysaccharide could effectively neutralize ROS generated in the absence of cells by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system (25Simpson J.A. Smith S.E. Dean R.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 29Pasquier C. Marty N. Dournes J.L. Chabanon G. Pipy B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 147: 195-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The xanthine oxidase catalyzes transfer of electrons from xanthine to molecular oxygen-generating superoxide anions. This simple chemical reaction is often used to mimic the generation of phagocyte-derived ROS in the absence of phagocytes (25Simpson J.A. Smith S.E. Dean R.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 29Pasquier C. Marty N. Dournes J.L. Chabanon G. Pipy B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 147: 195-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. cenocepacia EPS inhibited the ROS production obtained by adding xanthine oxidase to xanthine in the absence of cells, as assessed by CL (not shown) and reduction of cytochrome c (Fig. 6). The complete inhibition of ROS production in this cell-free system was apparent at EPS concentrations around 1 mg/ml, concentrations similar to those required in the cell-based systems. The enzymatic action of xanthine oxidase on xanthine resul"

We have now demonstrated that overexpression of ADAMTS-1 promotes pulmonary metastasis of TA3 mammary carcinoma and Lewis lung carcinoma cells and that a proteinase-dead mutant of ADAMTS-1 (ADAMTS-1E/Q) inhibits their metastasis, indicating that the prometastatic activity of ADAMTS-1 requires its metalloproteinase activity. Overexpression of ADAMTS-1 in these cells promoted tumor angiogenesis and invasion, shedding of the transmembrane precursors of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF) and amphiregulin (AR), and activation of the EGF receptor and ErbB-2, while overexpression of ADAMTS-1E/Q inhibited these events. Furthermore, we found that ADAMTS-1 undergoes auto-proteolytic cleavage to generate the NH2- and COOH-terminal cleavage fragments containing at least one thrombospondin-type-I-like motif and that overexpression of the NH2-terminal ADAMTS-1 fragment and the COOH-terminal ADAMTS-1 fragment can inhibit pulmonary tumor metastasis. These fragments also inhibited Erk1/2 kinase activation induced by soluble heparin-binding EGF and AR. Taken together, our results suggest that the proteolytic status of ADAMTS-1 determines its effect on tumor metastasis, and that the ADAMTS-1E/Q and the ADAMTS-1 fragments likely inhibit tumor metastasis by negatively regulating the availability and activity of soluble heparin-binding EGF and AR."

The expression of the protein N-myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is regulated during cell proliferation, differentiation, and in response to stress. Nevertheless, the function of this protein in humans remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that NDRG1 is up-regulated in hypoxic primary human trophoblasts and that NDRG1 modulates trophoblast response to hypoxia. We initially demonstrated that the expression of NDRG1 is enhanced in primary human trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia. Importantly, we found a similar increase in NDRG1 expression in placental samples derived from either singleton gestations complicated by intrauterine growth restriction or from dizygotic twin gestation where one twin exhibited growth restriction. Having established efficient lentivirus-mediated transfection of primary human trophoblasts, we overexpressed NDRG1 in trophoblasts, which resulted in enhanced trophoblast differentiation. In contrast, lentivirus-driven short interfering RNA-mediated silencing of NDRG1 diminished trophoblast viability and differentiation. Consistent with these results, NDRG1 reduced the expression level of p53 in trophoblasts cultured in standard or hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, NDRG1 expression was regulated by the activity of SIRT1 (Sir2-like protein 1), which promotes cell survival.

Placenta. 2004; 25: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that NDRG1 plays a role in trophoblast injury. In the present study we sought to investigate the role of NDRG1 in primary human placental trophoblasts. We hypothesized that NDRG1 is up-regulated in hypoxic primary human trophoblasts and that NDRG1 modulates trophoblast response to hypoxia. We initially examined the expression of NDRG1 in trophoblasts that were exposed to hypoxia and other cellular insults. To analyze the function of NDRG1 we established the use of a lentivirus system for gene delivery into primary human trophoblasts, taking advantage of the nuclear import machinery of the virus that enables effective infection even in non-dividing cells (30Lewis P. Hensel M. Emerman M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 31Lewis P.F. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 510-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using overexpression of NDRG1 as well as short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated repression of NDRG1 expression, we determined that NDRG1 attenuates hypoxic cell injury. This process is modulated by a p53-mediated pro-apoptotic effect and SIRT1 survival signals. Tissue Procurement—The study was approved by the institutional review board of Washington University in St. Louis. Human placental tissues for cell dispersal and culture as well as for RNA analysis were obtained from normal pregnancies after a vaginal or abdominal delivery (n = 20). All pregnancies were completed between 35-40 weeks by reliable obstetrical dates. Placental biopsy samples (∼1 cm3 each) included singleton pregnancies complicated by IUGR (n = 5) and gestational age-matched controls. IUGR in these singleton pregnancies was defined as fetal weight below the 10th percentile, associated with characteristic Doppler flow studies and placental pathology that corroborated changes consistent with villous hypoperfusion, including fibrin deposits, syncytial knots, and enhanced villous maturation (32Benirschke K. Kaufmann P. Pathology of the Human Placenta. 4th Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2000: 452-456Google Scholar). Samples were also obtained from twin pairs (n = 4) where one twin exhibited normal growth and the other exhibited IUGR. All twins were dizygotic and had two separate placentas. Pregnancies complicated by known chromosomal or non-chromosomal anomalies, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, chronic perinatal infection, acute intrauterine infection, and acute intrapartum hypoxia were excluded. Culture of Primary Trophoblasts—Primary human cytotrophoblasts were prepared from normal term placenta using the trypsin-deoxyribo-nuclease-dispase/Percoll method as described by Kliman with previously published modifications (33Kliman H.J. Nestler J.E. Sermasi E. Sanger J.M. Strauss J.M. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1567-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar, 34Nelson D.M. Johnson R.D. Smith S.D. Anteby E.Y. Sadovsky Y. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 180: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cultures were plated at a density of 300,000 cells/cm2 and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 20 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4) (Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (0.25 μg/ml) (all from Washington University tissue culture support center) at 37 °C in a 5% carbon dioxide/air atmosphere. After 4 h, designed to allow cell attachment, the culture plates were divided to standard or hypoxic growth conditions. Cultures at hypoxic conditions were maintained in an incubator (Thermo Electron, Marietta, OH) that provided hypoxic atmosphere defined as ∼1% O2 (5% CO2, 10% H2, 85% N2), with a monitor indicating ≤15 mm Hg pO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed every 24 h. Where indicated, cultures were supplemented with staurosporine (Tocris, Ellisville, MO), cobalt chloride (Sigma), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ1, -2, or -3, Sigma), epidermal growth factor (EGF, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), EGF receptor inhibitor (AG 1478, Calbiochem), zVAD.fmk (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA), or sirtinol (Calbiochem). These reagents were added either after 4 h in culture or at the time points indicated. Construction of Lentiviral NDRG1 Expression Vectors and Lentiviral siRNA and Infection of Cultured 293T Cells and Primary Term Human Trophoblasts—Lentiviral vectors FCIV, FCY-si, and FSP-si were kindly provided by Dr. Jeff Milbrandt (Washington University) and described previously (35Araki T. Sasaki Y. Milbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). FCIV, with a human ubiquitin promoter and a Venus green fluorescent protein reporter gene, was used to express the NDRG1 gene. Both FCY-si and FSP-si contain a U6 promoter upstream from the cloning site and express either a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter gene (FCY-si) or puromycin resistance gene (FSP-si). For overexpression experiments NDRG1 was PCR-amplified and cloned at the BamHI site in FCIV lentiviral vector. Successful cloning was confirmed using sequencing. Target sites for NDRG1 siRNA were searched based on GenBank™ cDNA sequence (NM_006096, 3074 bp). Only oligonucleotides with GC content ranging from 45 to 55% were selected, avoiding repetitive sequences and secondary structures. Using this strategy we tested four different potential siRNA targets. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). To generate siRNA duplexes, we annealed the oligonucleotides by mixing 2 μl of each oligonucleotide with 46 μl of annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), and 2 mm magnesium acetate). The mixture was incubated at 90 °C for 3 min and then at 37 °C for 1 h. Duplex siRNA formation was verified using gel electrophoresis. Each NDRG1 siRNA was cloned into both FCY-si and FSP-si siRNA vectors at the AgeI/BamHI site and sequenced. The most efficient siRNA construct (5′-GGAGTCCTTCAACAGTTTG-3′) was selected based on suppressed NDRG1 expression in 293T cells (data not shown). For control in silencing experiments we initially used an empty vector and subsequently confirmed all results using a scrambled sequence (5′-GGGTCTTAGAACTAGTTCC-3′) which was checked against BLAST sequences to verify a lack of homology to other genes. Lentivirus vectors were produced by transient transfection into 293T cells using calcium phosphate co-precipitation with the following modifications. A total of 1 × 107 293T cells were seeded in 15-cm dishes 24 h before transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 incubator. The culture medium was changed 4 h before transfection. A total of 45 μg of plasmid DNA was used for the transfection of each dish, including 20 μg of the transfer vector plasmid (FCIV, FSP-si, or FCY-si), 10 μg of the envelope plasmid pMD.G, and 15 μg of the packaging plasmid delta 8.9.1. The medium was changed 16 h after transfection, and the culture medium was serially collected every 24 h for a total of 72 h. All media were combined, filtered through a 0.22-μm vacuum filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 2 h. The lentivirus was resuspended in cold PBS using an orbital shaker at 4 °C overnight and stored at -80 °C. We used two methods for determining virus titer. (a) We added 1 ml of serially diluted virus particle (by a factor of 104-106) to freshly plated 293T cells (1 × 105 cells per 6-well plate) along with 8 μg/ml Polybrene and determined the fraction of green fluorescent protein-positive cells 48 h after infection. Fluorescence was determined by fluorescent microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U) and expressed in transducing units/ml). (b) We used quantitative real-time PCR (Gene-Amp 5700 Sequence Detector, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to determine the relative titer of the concentrated virus compared with known titer virus. Before infection, the trophoblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 3 washes with PBS, the lentiviruses were added to the culture medium at the time points in the figures along with 8 μg/ml Polybrene. After incubation for 4-16 h, the medium was changed, and the transduced trophoblasts were cultured until harvest. Quantitative Real-time PCR for Transcript Expression—RNA was purified from tissue biopsies or primary trophoblasts using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA was treated for 1 h at 37°C with DNase I (DNA-free, Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove contaminating DNA. Reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents kit (Applied Biosystems) in a 50-μl reaction mix that contained 1 μg of total RNA, 1× RT buffer, 5.5 mm MgCl2, deoxy-NTP mixture (500 μm of each dNTP), 2.5 μm random hexamers, 0.4 units/μl RNase inhibitor, and 1.25 units/μl Multi-Scribe reverse transcriptase at 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 30 min, and 95 °C for 5 min. 2 μl of the RT product was used for PCR using 300 nm concentrations each of forward and reverse gene-specific primers and SYBRgreen PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. The mixture was incubated before PCR at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min. The reaction was then performed at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Reactions were run in duplicate and analyzed using an Applied Biosystems Geneamp 5700 Sequence Detection System. Dissociation curves were run on all reactions to ensure amplification of a single product with the appropriate melting temperature. Samples were normalized to parallel reactions using primers specific for 18 S RNA. The fold increase relative to control cultures was determined by the 2-ΔΔCT method (36Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). All PCR primer pairs are listed in Table 1. All sequences were checked for specificity using BLAST analysis (37Altschul S.F.

The plates were scraped, and the lysate was sonicated 3 times for 10 s each time on ice with a Sonic Dismembrator 50 (Fisher). The lysates were centrifuged, and 20-30 μg of protein/lane were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE at 80 V for 3 h. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for 3 h at 4 °C at 400 mA. The blot was blocked by incubating in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (1× PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST with either an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-NDRG1 antibody (kindly provided by Koichi Kokame, Osaka, Japan), mouse monoclonal anti-p53 (RDI, Flanders NJ), goat polyclonal anti-syncytin, mouse monoclonal anti-Mdm2, mouse monoclonal anti-SIRT1 or goat polyclonal anti-actin (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 18 (Roche Diagnostics), rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase 9 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or rabbit polyclonal anti-poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Subsequently, the blot was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, rabbit anti-goat IgG, or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature, washed, and processed for luminescence using Amersham Biosciences ECL kit. Chemiluminescence was densitometrically analyzed using Epichemi-3 software (UVP BioImaging System, Upland, CA). For immunocytochemistry, trophoblasts were methanol-fixed at -20 °C. The caspase cleavage product cytokeratin 18, a reliable marker of apoptosis, was detected after bovine serum albumin blocking using a mouse primary antibody (1:50, M30 Cytodeath mouse monoclonal antibody, Roche Diagnostics) incubated for 2 h at room temperature followed by an AlexaFluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) The nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) at 100 ng/ml in PBS for 3 min. Cell Viability Assay—Cultured primary trophoblasts were evaluated for viability within 48-72 h after infection with lentivirus vectors using the MTS Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, primary trophoblasts were infected with lentiviral vectors as described above, and the cells were placed in hypoxia for 48 h. MTS substrate was added to the medium in a ratio of 20 μl of MTS for every 100 μl of culture medium. After 1.5 h of incubation, 50 μl of medium from each well was analyzed in triplicate on a colorimetric plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 490 nm. Cell viability was estimated based on a control curve where a range of primary trophoblasts (2, 4, 6, 12 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate) were assayed with MTS to generate a viability curve (data now shown), which was consistent with the manufacturer's assessment that absorbance at 490 nm was linear with cell number. Hormone Assays—Culture supernatants were assayed for hCG and hPL in duplicates by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DRG International, Mountainside, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Values represent mean hormone levels released to the media per 24-h interval normalized to total cellular RNA and expressed as the mean ± S.D. of duplicate samples. The Influence of Hypoxia on the Expression of NDRG1 in Trophoblasts—Using application of our novel T-score software to a series of microarray data, we previously determined that NDRG1 is one of the transcripts that was markedly up-regulated in hypoxic trophoblasts (7Budhraja V. Spitznagel E. Schaiff W.T. Sadovsky Y. BMC Biol. 2003; 1: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Roh C.R. Budhraja V. Kim H.S. Nelson D.M. Sadovsky Y. Placenta. 2005; 26: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We initially sought to confirm these results and determine the expression of NDRG1 mRNA and protein in primary term human trophoblasts. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we demonstrated that under standard conditions the expression of NDRG1 decreased immediately after plating and then increased in a time-dependent manner between 24-72 h (Fig. 1A). This effect cannot be solely attributed to cell differentiation, as trophoblasts cultured in Ham's-Waymouth medium, which hinders differentiation (38Douglas G.C. King B.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar), express a higher level of NDRG1 (data not shown). In vitro exposure of trophoblasts to hypoxia, a common insult in placentas from pregnancies complicated by IUGR, resulted in marked up-regulation of NDRG1 mRNA and protein expression throughout the culture period (Fig. 1A). To assess whether or not the expression of NDRG1 exhibits an increase in hypoxia, in vivo we determined the expression of NDRG1 in placental villi derived from either pregnancies complicated by IUGR attributed to placenta hypoperfusion or healthy controls. Using quantitative RT-PCR and Western immunoblotting, we found that the expression of NDRG1 was up-regulated in placental villi from pregnancies complicated by IUGR compared with placental samples from appropriately grown fetuses (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we examined NDRG1 expression in pairs of dizygotic twins where one twin was appropriately grown and the other exhibited IUGR attributed to placental hypoperfusion. We found that the expression of NDRG1 was up-regulated in placental villi derived from the fetus with IUGR compared with its twin control (Fig. 1C). The expression level of NDRG1 in the appropriately grown twin was similar to that of twin pairs where both twins exhibited concordant, normal growth (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that cellular hypoxia, either in vitro or in vivo, is associated with up-regulation of NDRG1 expression in cultured primary human trophoblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2116354283,"Many G protein-coupled receptors possess carboxyl-terminal motifs ideal for interaction with PDZ scaffold proteins, which can control receptor trafficking and signaling in a cell-specific manner. To gain a panoramic view of β1-adrenergic receptor (β AR) interactions with PDZ scaffolds, the β1AR carboxyl terminus was screened against a newly developed proteomic array of PDZ domains. These screens confirmed β1AR associations with several previously identified PDZ partners, such as PSD-95, MAGI-2, GIPC, and CAL. Moreover, two novel β1AR-interacting proteins, SAP97 and MAGI-3, were also identified. The β1AR carboxyl terminus was found to bind specifically to the first PDZ domain of MAGI-3, with the last four amino acids (E-S-K-V) of β1AR being the key determinants of the interaction. Full-length β1AR robustly associated with full-length MAGI-3 in cells, and this association was abolished by mutation of the β1AR terminal valine residue to alanine (V477A), as determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunofluorescence co-localization studies. MAGI-3 co-expression with β1AR profoundly impaired β1AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation but had no apparent effect on β1AR-mediated cyclic AMP generation or agonist-promoted β1AR internalization. These findings revealed that the interaction of MAGI-3 with β1AR can selectively regulate specific aspects of receptor signaling.

Cellular responses to a given hormone or neurotransmitter can vary markedly between different types of cells. In many cases, such cellular differences are because of differential expression of receptor subtypes. However, even cells expressing exactly the same receptor subtypes can exhibit distinct responses to a given ligand, because receptors often behave quite differently in distinct cellular environments. The trafficking and signaling properties of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PDZ, PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 homology; PSD-95, postsynaptic density protein of 95 kDa; βAR, β-adrenergic receptor; MAGI, membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like protein with an inverted domain structure; CNrasGEF, cAMP-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GIPC, GAIP-interacting protein, carboxyl terminus; CAL, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-associated ligand; NHERF, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CT, carboxyl terminus; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase. which comprise the largest family of cell surface receptors, are known to be especially influenced by cellular context. The activity of a GPCR depends not only on the complement of downstream effectors expressed in a given cell but also on the set of expressed G proteins, kinases, and scaffold proteins that directly interact with the receptor to shape its signaling capability. PDZ scaffolds comprise a key class of GPCR-interacting proteins that can strongly influence receptor trafficking and signaling. The term PDZ is derived from the names of the first three proteins in which these domains were first identified: the post-synaptic density protein PSD-95, the Drosophila protein Discs-large, and the tight junction protein ZO-1. PDZ domains are ∼90 amino acids in length and bind to specific carboxyl-terminal motifs on their target proteins. There are three general classes of PDZ domain: Class I domains, which recognize the carboxyl-terminal motif S/T-X-ϕ (where “ϕ” indicates a hydrophobic amino acid and “X” indicates any amino acid), Class II domains, which recognize the carboxyl-terminal motif ϕ-X-ϕ, and Class III domains, which recognize D/E-X-ϕ as their preferred carboxyl-terminal motif (1Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Many GPCRs possess carboxyl-terminal motifs appropriate for interaction with PDZ domains. One subfamily of GPCRs for which there are already several reports of PDZ interactions is the subfamily of β-adrenergic receptors (βARs). This subfamily includes the closely related subtypes β1AR, β2AR, and β3AR and mediates physiological responses to epinephrine and norepinephrine (2Hall R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, despite the high degree of overall sequence similarity between β1AR and β2AR, none of the aforementioned β1AR-associated PDZ proteins interact with β2AR.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Such differences in β1AR behavior in distinct cells may be explained in large part by the differential expression of β1AR-interacting proteins such as PDZ scaffolds, which as described above can strongly regulate β1AR trafficking and activity. Thus, it is a point of clear physiological interest to determine the full set of PDZ scaffolds that can associate with β1AR. There are ∼440 PDZ domains in the human proteome, with ∼25% of these being probable Class I PDZ domains (1Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). We have recently prepared the majority of known or probable Class I PDZ domains as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins and arranged them on a proteomic array to facilitate the rapid analysis of PDZ domain-mediated interactions (16Fam S.R. Paquet M. Castleberry A.M. Oller H. Lee C.J. Traynelis S.F. Smith Y. Yun C.C. Hall R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here, we screened this PDZ domain array with the β1AR-CT resulting in the confirmation of several known β1AR/PDZ interactions as well as the elucidation of several novel interactions. Furthermore, one of the novel interactions, the association between β1AR and MAGI-3, was found to occur in a cellular context and to also regulate β1AR signaling activity. Preparation of Plasmids and Fusion Proteins—The β1AR and β2AR carboxyl termini (the last 30 amino acids of the human β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors) were amplified via PCR and subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 for expression as GST fusion proteins. Point mutations of both β1AR-CT and full-length Flag-β1AR construct (V477A) were introduced via PCR and verified by ABI sequencing. The full-length V5/His-MAGI-3 construct in pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Rich Laura (Genentech). The individual PDZ domains of MAGI-3, and all of the other PDZ domains utilized on the PDZ array, were amplified via PCR and inserted into pET30A for expression as His/S-tagged fusion proteins, as described (16Fam S.R. Paquet M. Castleberry A.M. Oller H. Lee C.J. Traynelis S.F. Smith Y. Yun C.C. Hall R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PDZ Array Overlay Assay—Gridded nylon membranes were spotted with His/S-tagged PDZ domain fusion proteins (1 μg/bin), as described (16Fam S.R. Paquet M. Castleberry A.M. Oller H. Lee C.J. Traynelis S.F. Smith Y. Yun C.C. Hall R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The membranes were placed at room temperature for 24 h to dry and then stored at 4 °C for later use. Prior to experiments, membranes were blocked in blot buffer for 30 min at room temperature then overlaid with 100 nm GST fusion proteins in blot buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The arrays were washed three times with blot buffer, and incubated with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST antibody (1:3000, Amersham Biosciences). Interactions of the GST fusion proteins with the various PDZ domains were then visualized via chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Pierce). Blot Overlay Assay—The binding of receptor carboxyl terminus-GST fusion proteins to His/S-tagged PDZ domain fusion proteins was assayed via a blot overlay technique. The receptor CT-GST fusion proteins (1 μg/lane) were run on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA), blotted, and overlaid with the His/S-tagged PDZ domains (50 nm final concentration) in blot buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with blot buffer and incubated with S-protein horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Novagen, 1:4000) for 1 h at room temperature and were visualized via chemiluminescence as described above. GST Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins were purified from bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins (conjugated on beads) were incubated with 1 ml of clarified whole cell extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with His/V5-MAGI-3. After incubation at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 4 h, the beads were extensively washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. MAGI-3 was then detected via Western blotting with the monoclonal anti-V5 antibody followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:2000). Cell Culture and Transfection—All tissue culture medium and related reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator. For transfections, 1 μg of total DNA was mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (15 μl) (Invitrogen) and added to 5 ml of complete medium in 10-cm tissue culture plates containing cells at ∼50-80% confluency. Following a 4-h incubation, fetal bovine serum was added to the medium to 10%, and cells were then harvested after 48 h. Western Blotting and Antibodies—Samples were run on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 150 V and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked in “blot buffer” (2% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for at least 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody in blot buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with 10 ml of blot buffer each and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in blot buffer. Finally, the blots were washed three more times with 10 ml of blot buffer each and visualized via enzyme-linked chemiluminescence as described above. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST, polyclonal anti-His, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal anti-V5 was from Invitrogen, and monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) 12CA5 antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Polyclonal anti-MAGI-3, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel were from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-β1AR (V-19) was purchased from Santa Cruz. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested in ice-cold solubilization buffer (10 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated end-over-end at 4 °C for 1 h to achieve solubilization. Particulate matter was removed via centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g (4 °C). The solubilizates were then incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (for transfected cells) or 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose plus 5 μl of polyclonal anti-β1AR antibody (for brain lysates) for 2 h with end-over-end rotation at 4 °C. After five washes with 1.0 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads via incubation with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and visualized via Western blot using appropriate antibodies. Cell Surface Expression Assay—Receptor expression in the plasma membrane was quantified as described (17Balasubramanian S. Teissere J.A. Raju D.V. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18840-18850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 35-mm dishes and incubated in the absence and presence of agonist. The cells were then rinsed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and then rinsed three more times in PBS and blocked with blocking buffer (2% nonfat dry milk in PBS) for at least 30 min. The fixed cells were incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The dishes were subsequently washed three times with 2 ml of block buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer. Finally, the dishes were washed three times with 2 ml of blocking buffer and one time with 2 ml of PBS and incubated with 2 ml of ECL reagent for exactly 15 s. The luminescence, which corresponds to the amount of receptor on the cell surface, was determined by using a TD 20/20 luminometer. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with combinations of Flag-β1AR, Flag-V477A, and/or V5/His-MAGI-3. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. To visualize the sub-cellular localization of β1AR and MAGI-3, cells were blocked and permeabilized with a buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.04% saponin in PBS (“saponin buffer”) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG and rabbit polyclonal anti-His antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (1 min) with saponin buffer, the cells were incubated with a rhodamine red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at 1:200 dilution and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at 1:200 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (1 min) with saponin buffer and one wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted and rhodamine red-labeled β1AR and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled MAGI-3 were visualized with a Zeiss LSM-410 laser confocal microscope. Multiple control experiments, utilizing either transfected cells in the absence of primary antibody or untransfected cells in the presence of primary antibody, revealed a very low level of background staining, indicating that the primary antibody-dependent immunostaining observed in the transfected cells was specific. Phospho-ERK Assay—Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split into 6-well dishes and incubated in serum-free medium overnight prior to experiments. Agonist stimulation was performed at 37 °C in serum-free media for 5 min. The medium was removed, and cells were then harvested in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were sonicated briefly and analyzed via SDS-PAGE. The levels of p42/44 ERK phosphorylation were visualized by Western blot using an anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), whereas the levels of total ERK in the same lysates were assessed using an anti-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactive bands were visualized via chemiluminescence and quantified using NIH Image 1.62. For each sample, the level of phospho-ERK immunoreactivity was normalized to total ERK immunoreactivity. Variation in total ERK immunoreactivity between samples was typically very small (<10%), so only a small amount of normalization was required in each experiment. Proteomic Analysis of β1AR/PDZ Interactions—To obtain a panoramic view of the set of PDZ domains that bind to β1AR, a GST fusion protein corresponding to the β1AR-CT was purified and subsequently used in overlay experiments. Individual His/S-tagged fusion proteins of 96 distinct PDZ domains were purified and spotted on a gridded nylon membrane (1 μg of fusion protein/bin) and then overlaid with purified β1AR-CT-GST (100 nm). As shown in Fig. 1, β1AR-CT did not bind to the majority of PDZ domains on the array but rather bound strongly to a handful of specific PDZ domains. These included MAGI-1 PDZ1 (bin A1), MAGI-2 PDZ1 and PDZ2 (A5-A6), PSD-95 PDZ3 (B8), CAL PDZ (B10), and GIPC PDZ (D8), which are PDZ domains that have previously been reported to bind to β1AR-CT (3Hu L.A.

The overlays of the PDZ array also revealed β1AR-CT interactions with MAGI-3 PDZ1 (A10) and SAP97 PDZ3 (C3), which have not previously been shown to interact with β1AR. In matching control membranes where GST alone was overlaid onto the array, no binding of GST was detectable (data not shown), demonstrating the low amount of nonspecific binding in these assays. Because the interaction of β1AR-CT with MAGI-3 PDZ1 was consistently the most robust association observed, we decided to characterize this interaction further and assess its functional significance. Structural Determinants of the β1AR-CT Interaction with MAGI-3 PDZ1—The binding of MAGI-3 PDZ1 to various point-mutated versions of the β1AR-CT was examined in overlay experiments (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-6). The wild-type amino acid sequence of β1AR is SESKV. The mutation to Ala of the terminal Val residue, as well as Ser at the -2 position, completely blocked binding to MAGI-3 PDZ1. In addition, the mutation of Glu at the -3 position also impaired the interaction. However, mutation to Ala at the -1 and -4 positions had little effect. To further characterize the structural determinants of this interaction, we mutated the wild-type SESKV to SESRV, SETKV, and STSKV and examined the binding of these mutant fusion proteins to MAGI-3 PDZ1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 7-9). The mutation to Thr at the -3 position and Arg at -1 strongly inhibited binding, but the mutation to Thr at the -2 position had little effect on the interaction. These findings revealed a selective inhibition of binding to MAGI-3 PDZ1 by specific point mutations to three of the last five amino acids of the β1AR-CT. To examine the binding of the β1AR-CT to full-length MAGI-3 rather than simply the isolated PDZ1 domain, HEK-293 cells were transfected with full-length V5/His-tagged MAGI-3, and pull-down assays were performed using purified GST fusion proteins corresponding to β1AR-CT with the terminal Val residue mutated to either Ala, Ile, Met, or Leu (Fig. 2B). Each of these mutations completely abolished the interaction between MAGI-3 and β1AR-CT, revealing a critical importance of the terminal Val residue in mediating the β1AR/MAGI-3 interaction. β1AR and MAGI-3 Associate in Cells—We next examined the interaction between full-length β1AR and full-length MAGI-3 in a cellular context. HEK-293 cells were transfected with V5/His-MAGI-3 and either Flag-β1AR or Flag-V477A, a mutant receptor with the terminal Val changed to Ala. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in the presence and absence of stimulation with the βAR-selective agonist isoproterenol (Fig. 3A). MAGI-3 co-immunoprecipitated with β1AR, and the amount of co-immunoprecipitation did not significantly change when β1AR was stimulated with agonist for 15 min. No co-immunoprecipitation was observed, however, between the V477A mutant receptor and MAGI-3, revealing the importance of the terminal Val residue for the cellular interaction of β1AR and MAGI-3. In addition to the transfection experiments, we also studied the interactions of full-length endogenous β1AR and MAGI-3 in various native tissues, including brain, heart, and kidney. Solubilized lysates derived from these tissues were incubated with an anti-β1AR antibody linked to protein A/G-agarose beads, and the resultant immunoprecipitates were probed via Western blot for MAGI-3 co-immunoprecipitation using an anti-MAGI-3 antibody. Robust co-immunoprecipitation of MAGI-3 with β1AR was observed from all three tissues (Fig. 3B). These data reveal the existence of a physical complex between β1AR and MAGI-3 in native tissues where neither protein is overexpressed. The potential co-localization of β1AR and MAGI-3 in cultured cells was examined via immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). HEK-293 cells were transfected with V5/His-MAGI-3 and/or Flag-β1AR or Flag-V477A. When expressed alone, β1AR and the V477A mutant receptor were both predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A), whereas MAGI-3 expressed alone was found predominantly in the nucleus, with light cytoplasmic staining also evident (Fig. 4B). Strikingly, when co-expressed with wild-type β1AR, MAGI-3 was found almost exclusively at the plasma membrane where it co-localized well with β1AR (Fig. 4, C-E). In contrast, no co-localization was observed when MAGI-3 was co-expressed with V477A (Fig. 4, F-H), as MAGI-3 remained predominantly targeted to the nucleus and exhibited little if any co-localization with the mutant receptor. Stimulation of the cells with isoproterenol (15 min) had no significant effect of the extent of β1AR/MAGI-3 co-localization (data not shown). These data confirm the findings from the co-immunoprecipitation experiments that β1AR and MAGI-3 can interact in cells and, furthermore, reveal that this interaction results in a striking redistribution of MAGI-3 from the nucleus to the plasma membrane. MAGI-3 Modulates β1AR-mediated ERK Activation—We next explored the potential functional significance of the β1AR/MAGI-3 interaction. Because it has previously been reported that PSD-95 and MAGI-2 strongly regulate β1AR agonist-promoted internalization, we studied β1AR endocytosis from the cell surface in the absence and presence of MAGI-3 co-expression. However, β1AR internalization in response to a 15-min stimulation with isoproterenol (10 μm) was not found to be significantly different when β1AR was expressed alone (18 ± 4%) versus when β1AR/MAGI-3 were expressed together (16 ± 5%, n = 4). In further functional studies, no differences were observed in cyclic AMP generation following isoproterenol stimulation of β1AR expressed alone (5.6 ± 1.2-fold over untransfected cells) versus β1AR/MAGI-3 co-expressed (5.1 ± 1.0-fold over untransfected cells, n = 3). However, as shown in Fig. 5, co-expression with MAGI-3 had a substantial effect on β1AR-mediated activation of ERK. Isoproterenol-stimulated ERK activation was more than 6-fold for β1AR expressed alone but less than 4-fold when β1AR and MAGI-3 were co-expressed (Fig. 5A). In contrast, no significant effect of MAGI-3 co-transfection was observed on the ability of the V477A m"
https://openalex.org/W2134465386,"Enzyme systems that attack the plant cell wall contain noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that mediate attachment to this composite structure and play a pivotal role in maximizing the hydrolytic process. Although xyloglucan, which includes a backbone of beta-1,4-glucan decorated primarily with xylose residues, is a key component of the plant cell wall, CBMs that bind to this polymer have not been identified. Here we showed that the C-terminal domain of the modular Clostridium thermocellum enzyme CtCel9D-Cel44A (formerly known as CelJ) comprises a novel CBM (designated CBM44) that binds with equal affinity to cellulose and xyloglucan. We also showed that accommodation of xyloglucan side chains is a general feature of CBMs that bind to single cellulose chains. The crystal structures of CBM44 and the other CBM (CBM30) in CtCel9D-Cel44A display a beta-sandwich fold. The concave face of both CBMs contains a hydrophobic platform comprising three tryptophan residues that can accommodate up to five glucose residues. The orientation of these aromatic residues is such that the bound ligand would adopt the twisted conformation displayed by cello-oligosaccharides in solution. Mutagenesis studies confirmed that the hydrophobic platform located on the concave face of both CBMs mediates ligand recognition. In contrast to other CBMs that bind to single polysaccharide chains, the polar residues in the binding cleft of CBM44 play only a minor role in ligand recognition. The mechanism by which these proteins are able to recognize linear and decorated beta-1,4-glucans is discussed based on the structures of CBM44 and the other CBMs that bind single cellulose chains."
https://openalex.org/W2080662424,"The molecular genetic events underlying thyroid carcinogenesis are poorly understood. Mice harboring a knock-in dominantly negative mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbetaPV/PV mouse) spontaneously develop follicular thyroid carcinoma similar to human thyroid cancer. Using this mutant mouse, we tested the hypothesis that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) could function as a tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer in vivo. Using the offspring from the cross of TRbetaPV/+ and PPARgamma+/- mice, we found that thyroid carcinogenesis progressed significantly faster in TRbetaPV/PV mice with PPARgamma insufficiency from increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Reduced PPARgamma protein abundance led to the activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway, resulting in the activation of cyclin D1 and repression of critical genes involved in apoptosis. Treatment of TRbetaPV/PV mice with a PPARgamma agonist, rosiglitazone, delayed the progression of thyroid carcinogenesis by decreasing cell proliferation and activation of apoptosis. These results suggest that PPARgamma is a critical modifier in thyroid carcinogenesis and could be tested as a therapeutic target in thyroid follicular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2077365769,"Activating mutations of RAS are prevalent in thyroid follicular neoplasms, which commonly have chromosomal losses and gains. In thyroid cells, acute expression of HRASV12 increases the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities within one or two cell cycles, suggesting that RAS oncoproteins may interfere with cell cycle checkpoints required for maintenance of a stable genome. To explore this, PCCL3 thyroid cells with conditional expression of HRASV12 or HRASV12 effector mutants were presynchronized at the G1/S boundary, followed by activation of expression of RAS mutants and release from the cell cycle block. Expression of HRASV12 accelerated the G2/M phase by ∼4 h and promoted bypass of the G2 DNA damage and mitotic spindle checkpoints. Accelerated passage through G2/M and bypass of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, but not bypass of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, required activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, selective activation of the MAPK pathway was not sufficient to disrupt the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, because cells arrested appropriately in G2 despite conditional expression of HRASV12,S35 or BRAFV600E. By contrast to the MAPK requirement for radiation-induced G2 arrest, RAS-induced bypass of the mitotic spindle checkpoint was not prevented by pretreatment with MEK inhibitors. These data support a direct role for the MAPK pathway in control of G2 progression and regulation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. We propose that oncogenic RAS activation may predispose cells to genomic instability through both MAPK-dependent and independent pathways that affect critical checkpoints in G2/M.

Despite their clonal origin, cells from advanced carcinomas are often genetically heterogeneous. Tumor cell variability is thought to result from genomic instability. Clonal heterogeneity in turn tends to predict a poor outcome and resistance to therapy. This is also the case in thyroid cancer. In thyroid tumors, the nature of the oncogenic events involved in the initiation of the neoplastic clone may determine the likelihood of genomic instability occurring at a later stage. Among the various forms of thyroid neoplasia, follicular adenomas and carcinomas are commonly aneuploid, whereas abnormalities in chromosome number are comparatively less frequent in papillary thyroid carcinomas. Mutations of all three RAS genes are found in benign and malignant follicular neoplasms and in follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinomas and are believed to be one of the early steps in thyroid tumor formation (4.Lemoine N.R.

By contrast, rearrangements of the tyrosine kinase receptor gene RET (rearranged by transfection; RET/PTC) are only found in papillary thyroid carcinomas, which are commonly diploid and less aggressive. A possible explanation for this is that activating mutations of RAS, but not of RET, promote tumor progression in part by decreasing genomic stability. Consistent with this is the observation that acute expression of HRASV12 increases the frequency of micronuclei, an accepted indicator of chromosomal instability, whereas expression RET/PTC does not (10.Norppa H. Falck G.C. Mutagenesis. 2003; 18: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).The rate of spontaneous mutations acquired during the natural life span of a cell is exceedingly low (11.Oller A.R.

Res. 1985; 150: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests that one of the early genetic disruptions involved in tumor development may confer cells with a “mutator” phenotype (13.Loeb L.A. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 25-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Loeb L.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3075-3079PubMed Google Scholar) and hence a predisposition to the accumulation of additional abnormalities. Indeed, germ line mutations in genes such at p53, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), and BRCA1/2 that are involved in DNA damage repair and regulation of cell cycle checkpoints are found in cancer susceptibility syndromes. Although proteins encoded by p53, ATM, and BRCA1/2 have numerous functions, progression to the malignant state in these cancer syndromes is likely to be at least caused in part by genomic instability. Although not as widely appreciated, oncoproteins such as RAS have also been proposed to promote tumor progression through induction of genomic instability. For example, Finney and Bishop (15.Finney R.E. Bishop J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1524-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that replacement of a normal Hras gene with an activated mutant Hras by homologous recombination in rat1 fibroblasts is not in itself sufficient to induce transformation but rather requires secondary changes such as gene amplification events, including amplification of the mutant Ras allele. This study supports the concept that RAS may serve as a mutator gene under physiological conditions, because the mutant HRAS protein in these experiments was expressed under the control of its own promoter. The ability of activated RAS to promote chromosomal instability is also supported by studies demonstrating that expression of the human HRAS oncogene in p53-null cells leads to premature entry of cells into the S phase, increased permissivity for gene amplification, and generation of aberrant chromosomes within a single cell cycle (16.Denko N.

The effectors downstream of RAS that are required for this effect have not been fully elucidated. Activation by RAS of the RAL guanine nucleotide exchange factor is responsible for dampening the G2 arrest induced by ethyl methanesulfonate in p53-deficient MDAH041 fibroblasts (24.Agapova L.S.

ERK was also reported to associate with kinetochores during early prophase, but this association was not apparent at later stages of mitosis. Both ERK and its activator MEK localize to the mitotic spindle from prophase through anaphase and to the midbody during cytokinesis. Furthermore, activated ERK was found to associate with the spindle microtubule motor CENP-E during mitosis (29.Zecevic M. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Renzi L. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. Gorbsky G.J. Weber M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and is capable of regulating microtubule dynamics during mitosis (30.Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Matsuda S. Shiina N. Kosako H. Shiokawa K. Akiyama T. Ohta K. Sakai H. Nature. 1991; 349: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). These results strongly support a role for MEK and ERK in regulating the progression of cells through G2 and mitosis, suggesting that inappropriate activation of these RAS effectors in cells expressing oncogenic RAS could potentially disrupt the orderly transition of these cells through these latter cell cycle stages, which are critical for maintaining genomic integrity.We previously showed that acute expression of HRASV12 increases the frequency of chromosome misalignment, multiple spindle formation, centrosome amplification, and generation of micronuclei within the first few cell cycles after activation in rat thyroid PCCL3 cells (31.Saavedra H.I. Knauf J.A. Shirokawa J.M. Wang J. Ouyang B. Elisei R. Stambrook P.J. Fagin J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3948-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These cells are not transformed and have wild type p53 genes. Rapid induction of these chromosomal abnormalities by RAS is consistent with a disruption of progression of cells through G2/M and/or alteration of the integrity of critical checkpoints needed to ensure genomic stability. Here we investigated this possibility by presynchronizing PCCL3 thyroid cells with conditional expression of HRASV12 or HRASV12 effector mutants at the G1/S boundary, followed by activation of expression of RAS mutants and release from the G1 block into a radiation-induced G2 arrest or a nocodazole-activated mitotic checkpoint. This allowed us to follow the progression of cells through G2/M as well as the G2 DNA damage and mitotic spindle checkpoints and explore the contribution of RAS effectors to this effect.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines—The well differentiated rat thyroid cell line PCCL3 was propagated in H4 complete medium, which consisted of Coon's modification of Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, glutamine (286 μg/ml), apo-transferrin (5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (10 nm), insulin (10 μg/ml), thyrotropin (10 mIU/ml), penicillin, and streptomycin.

Using the same approach, we created PCCL3 cells with dox-inducible expression of the previously described RAS effector mutants (35.Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Briefly, we subcloned the HRASV12,S35, HRASV12,G37, or HRASV12,C40 cDNAs (gifts from Kenji Fukasawa, University of Cincinnati) into pUHG10-3, downstream of seven repeats of a tet operator sequence and a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter. These constructs were co-transfected into rtTA cells with pTK-hygro using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and clones were selected based on the absence of expression under basal conditions and strong induction by dox.Reagents—FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd IgG was purchased from Pharmigen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies to phospho-MEK1/2 (sc-7995), MEK2 (sc-524), ERK1 (sc-94), phospho-ERK1/2 (sc-7383), HRAS (SC-520), cyclin B1 (SC-245), HDAC1 (SC-6298), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (SC-20357) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti phospho-MEK1/2 (9121S) goat polyclonal IgG was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Thymidine, nocodazole, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), propidium iodide, thyrotropin, insulin, apo-transferrin, and hydrocortisone were purchased from Sigma, and PD98059 and wortmannin were from Calbiochem. Coon's modification of Ham's F-12 medium was from Irvine Scientific (Irvine, CA). Fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin, and glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen.Monitoring Cell Cycle Progression by FACS Cell Synchronization—To synchronize cells in G1/S, cells were plated into 60-mm tissue culture dishes at ∼50% confluence in H4 medium and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh H4 medium containing 4 mm thymidine, and the cells were incubated for 14 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, H4 medium was added, and the cells were incubated for 9 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh H4 medium containing 4 mm thymidine, and the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml dox for 14 h. The cells were released by washing twice with PBS and then adding fresh H4 medium containing 10 μm BrdUrd with or without 1 μg/ml dox. After 2 h the cells were washed with PBS to remove BrdUrd, and fresh H4 medium with or without 1 μg/ml dox was added. To induce the G2 DNA damage checkpoint cells were irradiated 4 h after release cells with 10 Gy of x-rays or 15 Gy of γ-rays (Faxitron cabinet x-ray irradiator or Cesium irradiator, respectively). To induce the mitotic spindle checkpoint, nocodazole was added 5 h after release from the G1/S block to a final concentration of 0.4 μg/ml. At the indicated times after release, the cells were washed with PBS, harvested by trypsinization, fixed in 5 ml of cold (–20 °C) 70% ethanol, and incubated overnight at 4 °C.Cell Cycle Analysis—The fixed cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 μl of 0.85% NaCl. To denature DNA, 2 ml of 2 m HCl was added, and the cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.6), and washed one time with PBS. The cells were then resuspended in 10 μl of FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd IgG (Pharmigen, San Diego, CA) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mixing. Five hundred microliters of propidium iodide (PI) staining solution (50 μg/ml PI, 50 μg/ml RNase A) was added, and the number of BrdUrd-positive cells in S, G2/M, and G1 was determined by FACS analysis using a Coulter EPICS XL flow cytometer (Miami, FL) at an excitation range of 488 nm (argon laser) and a 525 BP filter for FITC and 620 BP for propidium iodide.Monitoring Cell Cycle Progression by Manually Counting Mitotic Cells—The cells were synchronized in G1/S with thymidine as described above, except BrdUrd was not added to the releasing medium. Where indicated nocodazole was added 5 h after release to a final concentration of 0.4 μg/ml to induce the mitotic spindle checkpoint. At the indicated times the cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS, spotted onto a microscope slide, and fixed by incubating with ethanol/acetic acid (19:1) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 5 min with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, PBS, and then PBS containing 2 μg/ml DAPI. The slides were washed and mounted in Vectorshield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The number of mitotic cells (characterized by condensed chromosome structures observed in prophase through telophase) and nonmitotic cells was determined by manually counting using a fluorescent microscope from a sufficient number of randomly selected fields to obtain at least 5,000 cells.Western Blotting—The cells were synchronized in G1/S with thymidine as described above. At the indicated times the cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml E-64), and incubated for 20 min on ice. The cells were lysed by repeatedly passing through a 16-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged, the supernatant was collected, and protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie protein assay as directed by manufacturer (Pierce).Nuclear Fractionation—The cells were collected, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml E-64). The cells were incubated for 15 min on ice, passed through a 16-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected (cytosolic fraction), and the protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie. The pellets were washed twice with buffer B, suspended in SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer (10% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.75 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8), incubated for 5 min at 95 °C, and loaded on to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (36.Knauf J.A. Elisei R. Mochly-Rosen D. Liron T. Chen X.N. Gonsky R. Korenberg J.R. Fagin J.A. J. Biol.

The anti-cyclin B1/A/G plus agarose solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 400 μg of total cell lysate prepared in buffer A. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with buffer A and then once with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 2 μg/μl of histone H1; Calbiochem). The immunoprecipitate was resuspended in kinase buffer and 32PγATP (0.25 μCi) was added. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer at 98 °C for 5 min. The agarose conjugate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded on to a SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was exposed to x-ray film, and the band intensity was determined by densitometry using a Kodak image station.RESULTSHRASV12 Expression Accelerates Transition through G2/M—To examine the effects of activated RAS on progression through G2/M, we used Ras-25 cells, PCCL3 cells with dox-inducible expression of HRASV12. Effects of HRASV12 on G2/M were determined by first synchronizing cells at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine treatment and then inducing expression of HRASV12 by the addition of dox for 14 h prior to release. Cell cycle progression was then monitored as described under “Material and Methods.” PCCL3 cells expressing HRASV12 had an ∼2-h delay in progression through S phase (Fig. 1) but had an accelerated transition through G2/M because they entered the next G1 ∼2 h sooner. Thus, expression of HRASV12 resulted in a net acceleration of G2/M of ∼4 h. The abnormal duration of G2/M is illustrated by the flattened G2/M peak seen between 8–12 h after release (Fig. 1A, upper panels). Treatment of the parental line, rtTA (PCCL3 cells that only express the reverse tetracycline transactivator), with dox did not significantly affect the progression of cells through S or G2/M (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Acute expression of HRASV12 did not affect the ability of cells to synchronize at the G1/S border or to release from the double thymidine block (data not shown), indicating that the differences were not due to the effects of HRASV12 on cell synchronization. To confirm the accelerated transition through G2/M, the cells were collected, and the mitotic cells were quantified after release from the double thymidine block by staining with DAPI and visual counting of cells with condensed chromosomes (Fig. 1C). The decreased number of cells in mitosis after RAS activation points to an asynchronous passage of cells through mitosis, consistent with an abbreviated G2 and/or less likely, of the mitotic phase (Fig. 1C). A time course of cyclin B1 kinase activity in cells treated as described for Fig. 1C demonstrates lower levels of kinase activity between 8 and 12 h after release in cells expressing HRASV12 (Fig. 1D). The decrease in kinase activity corresponded closely with cyclin B1 immunoreactivity, indicating no intrinsic effect of HRASV12 on kinase activity (Fig. 1E). These results are consistent with a reduced number of cells in G2/M at any of the sampled time points, presumably because of a more rapid transit through these stages in cells expressing HRASV12. Acute HRASV12 Expression Promotes Exit from the DNA Damage and Mitotic Spindle Checkpoints—Next we determined whether inappropriate activation of HRAS resulted in abnormalities of either the DNA damage or mitotic spindle checkpoints, which could also contribute to the chromosomal abnormalities we observed after acute expression of HRASV12. To determine the effects of HRASV12 expression on the G2 DNA damage checkpoint Ras-25 cells were synchronized and released as in Fig. 1A, except that 4 h after release they were exposed to 15 Gy of ionizing radiation. The cells were harvested at the indicated times, and the cell cycle stage of the BrdUrd-positive cells was determined by FACS analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, irradiated cells that did not express HRASV12 remained in G2/M for ∼4 h longer than unirradiated cells. In the presence of dox there was a more rapid entry of BrdUrd-positive cells into the next G1, indicating that the irradiation-induced G2 arrest was partially overcome by expression of HRASV12 (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Acute RAS activation promotes exit from the DNA damage checkpoint. Ras-25 cells were synchronized in G1/S and released as described for Fig. 1A. Four hours after release, the cells were exposed to 15 Gy of x-ray radiation (Faxitron cabinet irradiator) and maintained in culture until harvested for FACS analysis of BrdUrd-positive cells at the indicated times. A, in the absence of dox, radiated cells were delayed in G2. Expression of HRASV12 (+dox) resulted in more rapid exit from the G2 block (see 14-h FACS profile). B, impact of oncogenic RAS expression on the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells entering the next G1 following radiation-induced DNA damage. A greater number of irradiated cells entered G1 compared with those not expressing the oncoprotein. The data points represent the means of a single experiment performed in duplicate. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next explored the effects of HRASV12 expression on the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Nocodazole, a microtubule disruptor that arrests cells in metaphase, was added 5 h after release from the double thymidine block (a time point when most cells were in S phase) to activate the mitotic checkpoint. The cells were harvested at the indicated times, smeared on glass slides, and stained with DAPI, and mitotic cells were counted manually. In the absence of dox, nocodazole induced an accumulation of Ras-25 cells in mitosis that peaked 15 h after release and then declined slightly over the next 15 h. In cells expressing HRASV12, nocodazole induced a peak of mitotic cells at 13 h, which rapidly declined over the next 10 h (Fig. 3A). Cyclin B1, which is rapidly degraded as cells exit mitosis, had reduced activity (not shown) and was expressed at lower levels and declined earlier in HRASV12-expressing cells despite the continued presence of nocodazole (Fig. 3B). In parental rtTA cells, nocodazole produced an accumulation of cells in mitosis that"
https://openalex.org/W2057159037,"The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is activated in many human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). We tried to identify the genes involved in carcinogenesis and progression of HCC with beta-catenin mutations. We used PCR-based subtractive hybridization to compare gene expression between malignant and benign components of a human HCC occurring in pre-existing adenoma activated for beta-catenin. Two of the genes identified belong to the Regenerating gene (REG) family. They encode the Regenerating islet-derived 3 alpha (REG3A/HIP/PAP/REG-III) and 1 alpha (REG1A) proteins, both involved in liver and pancreatic regeneration and proliferation. Using siRNA directed against beta-catenin, we demonstrated that REG3A is a target of beta-catenin signaling in Huh7 hepatoma cells. The upregulation of REG3A and REG1A expression is significantly correlated to the beta-catenin status in 42 HCC and 28 hepatoblastomas characterized for their beta-catenin status. Thus, we report strong evidence that both genes are downstream targets of the Wnt pathway during liver tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2118539151,"In eukaryotes, newly synthesized proteins interact co-translationally with a multitude of different ribosome-bound factors and chaperones including the conserved heterodimeric nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) and a Hsp40/70-based chaperone system.

This study describes the ribosomal localization of NAC and the molecular details by which NAC is able to contact the ribosome and gain access to nascent polypeptides. We identified a conserved RRK(X)nKK ribosome binding motif within the β-subunit of NAC that is essential for the entire NAC complex to attach to ribosomes and allow for its interaction with nascent polypeptide chains. The motif localizes within a potential loop region between two predicted α-helices in the N terminus of βNAC. This N-terminal βNAC ribosome-binding domain was completely portable and sufficient to target an otherwise cytosolic protein to the ribosome. NAC modified with a UV-activatable cross-linker within its ribosome binding motif specifically cross-linked to L23 ribosomal protein family members at the exit site of the ribosome, providing the first evidence of NAC-L23 interaction in the context of the ribosome. Mutations of L23 reduced NAC ribosome binding in vivo and in vitro, whereas other eukaryotic ribosome-associated factors such as the Hsp70/40 chaperones Ssb or Zuotin were unaffected.

This binding to L23 is crucial for the function of TF as a molecular chaperone for nascent polypeptides. The early access of TF to nascent polypeptide chains allows for the controlled entry into the protein folding pathway during ongoing bio-synthesis. Whereas TF is only present in eubacteria and chloroplasts, eukaryotes possess other ribosome-associated factors belonging to protein families unrelated to TF (6Wegrzyn R.D. Deuerling E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2727-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Bukau B. Deuerling E. Pfund C. Craig E.A.

In yeast and metazoans, the Hsp70-type chaperone Ssz and its DnaJ co-chaperone Zuotin (Zuo) form a ribosome-associated complex (RAC) that is tethered to the ribosome via Zuo (9Gautschi M. Lilie H.

Bairstow S. Craig E.A. Science. 2005; 308: 1032-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In yeast, RAC together with another ribosome-bound Hsp70 homolog, Ssb, forms a functional ribosomal chaperone triad (9Gautschi M. Lilie H. Fünfschilling U. Mun A. Ross S. Lithgow T. Rucknagel P. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3762-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Hundley H. Eisenman H. Walter W. Evans T. Hotokezaka Y. Wiedmann M. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4203-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this triad, only Ssb is in direct association with nascent chains. Deletion of either one or all triad members leads to similar phenotypes including poor growth during osmotic stress, cold-sensitivity, and hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides. So far, the molecular basis of these phenotypes remains enigmatic. In addition to the Hsp70-RAC machinery, a protein complex termed nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) associates with ribosomes and nascent chains in an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry (13Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 14Fünfschilling U. Rospert S. Mol. Biol.

NAC is highly conserved among eukaryotes and consists of two subunits (α- and βNAC) that are both in direct contact with nascent polypeptide chains (13Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar); yet, βNAC alone is responsible for binding to the ribosome (16Beatrix B. Sakai H. Wiedmann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37838-37845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The yeast genome encodes three known NAC homologs consisting of a single α-subunit (encoded by EGD2) and two β subunits (encoded by EGD1 and BTT1). Both β subunits can form heterodimeric complexes with αNAC, although Btt1 is significantly less abundant than Egd1 (17Reimann B. Bradsher J. Franke J. Hartmann E. Wiedmann M. Prehn S. Wiedmann B. Yeast. 1999; 15: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18George R. Beddoe T. Landl K. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2296-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The general significance of NAC is emphasized by the embryonic lethality of NAC mutants in mice, nematodes, and fruit flies (19Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. Transgenic Res. 1995; 4: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Markesich D.C. Gajewski K.M. Nazimiec M.E. Beckingham K.

In contrast, deletion of NAC in yeast is not lethal and growth defects at high temperature are strain dependent (17Reimann B. Bradsher J. Franke J. Hartmann E. Wiedmann M. Prehn S. Wiedmann B. Yeast. 1999; 15: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 3R. D. Wegrzyn and E. Deuerling, unpublished results. 3R. D. Wegrzyn and E. Deuerling, unpublished results. It was proposed that NAC has a role in controlling the correct translocation of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum by regulating the accessibility of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the translocation pore to ribosome-nascent chain complexes (22Möller I. Beatrix B. Kreibich G. Sakai H. Lauring B. Wiedmann M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Lauring B. Sakai H. Kreibich G. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5411-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), yet in vivo data to support this finding is still lacking. The observations that NAC associates with ribosomes and cross-links to short nascent polypeptides (13Wiedmann B. Sakai H. Davis T.A. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1994; 370: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) triggered the speculation that NAC might play a role in the folding of newly synthesized proteins, however, direct evidence to support this hypothesis has not yet been presented. An important step toward understanding the function of NAC at the ribosome is to define the specific strategy that is used to bind to the ribosome and subsequently interact with nascent chains. Therefore, we set out to gain insights into the molecular details and mechanism of the ribosomal association of NAC. The goals therein included (i) the mapping of a specific binding site of the NAC on the ribosomal surface; (ii) the identification of amino acid residues and structural components that are critical for NAC ribosome binding; and (iii) to determine whether nature has developed similar strategies to mediate the binding of factors that act co-translationally to the ribosome. Surprisingly, we found that despite the lack of any sequence homology, an intriguing resemblance exists between the bacterial TF and eukaryotic NAC with regard to their ribosomal interplay. Our findings characterize the ribosomal protein L23 as a universally conserved docking platform in different kingdoms of life and show that unrelated ribosome-associated factors share a common strategy for their prime access to nascent polypeptide chains. Strains and Plasmid Constructions—Escherichia coli strains were grown at 30 °C in Luria broth supplemented with antibiotics and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside if appropriate. P1 transduction of MC4100-derived E. coli strains to disrupt the rplW (codes for L23) and rpmC (codes for L29) genes was performed according to the procedure used by Kramer et al. (1Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwülbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The protease-depleted MH1 strain (ΔfhuA Δptr ΔompT ΔhhoAB shh Δprc::kan degP::Tn10) was a kind gift of M. Ehrmann. Standard yeast growth, spore analysis, and strain construction procedures were used (24Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology: Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego, CA2004Google Scholar). The yeast egd1Δ strain used in this study is from the EUROSCARF collection and is isogenic to BY4741 (MATa, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0). The heterozygous yeast rpl25Δ diploid strain, lacking ribosomal protein L25, was generated in a DS10 self-diploid background using direct PCR-mediated gene transplacement (25Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar). This resulting rpl25Δ/RPL25 strain was transformed with plasmids expressing either wild-type RPL25 or RPL25-GFP, sporulated, and rpl25Δ haploids expressing these proteins were obtained by random spore analysis. The plasmid pL23 (1Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwülbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to generate the pL23-SEKAS/AAKAA mutant plasmid, where the TF binding site residues have been mutated (see Fig. 3C and text for details). The Rosetta plasmid was purchased from Novagen. For expression and purification of NAC (WT or mutant variants) we constructed the plasmid pQE-NAC expressing N-terminal His6-tagged EGD2 and untagged EGD1 as an operon. To this end, the EGD1 open reading frame was PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA and sub-cloned into the pTrc-His6 (1Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwülbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A. Ban N. Deuerling E. Bukau B. Nature. 2002; 419: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) plasmid to make pTrc-His6-EGD1. Using primers that remove the His6 tag and introduce an upstream ribosome binding sequence, EGD1 was PCR-amplified and inserted into the plasmid pQE31-EGD2 (18George R. Beddoe T. Landl K. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2296-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) immediately 3′ to the end of the His6-EGD2 open reading frame, resulting in plasmid pQE-NAC, which expresses His6-EGD2 and EGD1 as an operon. To create the pQE-NAC-FUS plasmid, an insert encoding the His-tagged Egd2 protein was PCR amplified from plasmid pQE31-EGD2 using primers that omit the terminal EGD2 codon and add a flexible Ser-Gly-rich linker (-AGSSGENLYFQSGAGASGS-) such that it is in-frame with the EGD1 open reading frame when inserted into the pQE30-EGD1 (18George R. Beddoe T. Landl K. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2296-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) plasmid. Plasmids pQE-NAC and pQE-NAC-FUS were used as templates for site-directed mutagenesis to generate the Cys mutants (N18C, G22C, L28C, A32C, and A36C) used for cross-linking experiments (the number of the corresponding Egd1 residue is indicated). EGD1 (including endogenous promoter and terminator) was PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into pRS316 (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pRS316-EGD1. pRS316-EGD1 was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to generate plasmids expressing mutant forms of EGD1 including the EKL/AAA (E7A/K8A/L9A), KL/AA (K14A/L15A), RRK/AAA (R25A/R26A/K27A), and KK/AA (K30A/K31A) mutations. To construct the pRS413-RPL25 plasmid, RPL25 (including endogenous promoter and terminator) was PCR amplified from yeast genomic DNA and was first cloned into the pBlue-script vector and then inserted into the yeast pRS413 (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) vector. The plasmid expressing RPL25-GFP (27Hurt E. Hannus S. Schmelzl B. Lau D. Tollervey D. Simos G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of E. Hurt. Plasmids containing His5-CHIP (pGM10-His5-CHIP) and untagged hCHIP (pUHE21-hCHIP) were described (28Nikolay R. Wiederkehr T. Rist W. Kramer G. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The plasmid pHLH-CHIP was created by annealing primers that coded for the N-terminal 55 residues of Egd1 and ligating them in-frame into a pTrc99B vector (29Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) that contained the CHIP coding sequence. The plasmid pET-ICDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) was used to generate an arrested nascent chain of 173 aa in the in vitro transcription/translation system as described (30Deuerling E. Patzelt H.

To generate arrested nascent chains containing the lepB leader peptidase, the plasmid pET-STREP-lepB1-30-Arrest was constructed that fused an N-terminal STREP tag to aa 1-30 of lepB, followed by the SecM arrest sequence (32Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) to stall translating ribosomes. All plasmids constructed in this study were verified by sequencing and production of target proteins was confirmed. Protein Purification—The yeast NAC complex, NAC-FUS, CHIP, HLH-CHIP proteins, and corresponding mutants were expressed under an isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter and purified under native conditions from E. coli strain MH1. High level expression of the NAC complex was achieved by co-expressing rare tRNAs encoded by the Rosetta plasmid, resulting in the predominantly soluble NAC complex, which could be purified in high quantities via a His6 tag present at the N terminus of the α-subunit. Initial purification of all proteins was achieved using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The purification of all NAC complex and fusion protein variants included an additional purification step using POROS 20 SP material (PE Biosystems/GE Healthcare-Pharmacia) and dialysis of the highly pure protein-containing fractions against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The structural integrity of purified NAC was assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy according to the described protocol (33Hesterkamp T. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21865-21871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 4R. D. Wegrzyn, A. Koplin, and E. Deuerling, manuscript in preparation.

Previously published procedures were used for the ex vivo isolation of ribosomes and associated complexes from E. coli cells (33Hesterkamp T. Deuerling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21865-21871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Yeast lysates were prepared by growing 25 ml of cells to logarithmic growth phase, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete® tablet (Roche), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl). Acid-washed glass beads were added to the samples and lysis was achieved via standard protocols (24Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology: Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Elsevier Academic Press, San Diego, CA2004Google Scholar). Lysates were cleared for 10 min at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm, and the resultant supernatant was divided into 3 parts: total lysate, a “low salt” sample that was loaded onto a 100 mm KCl 20% sucrose cushion, and a “high salt” sample that was adjusted to a 600 mm final salt concentration and was loaded onto a 600 mm KCl, 20% sucrose cushion. Ribosomes were separated from the rest of the lysate by centrifuging the samples in a TLA100.2 rotor for 90 min, 200,000 × g, and the samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The precise identity of the faster migrating βNAC-derived band that appeared after prolonged incubation with ribosomes (Fig. 1C) was achieved by mass determination using microflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (35Rist W.

Generation and Identification of NAC-Ribosome and NAC-Nascent Chain (NC) Cross-links—The UV-activatable cross-linker BPIA (benzophenone-4-iodoacetamide, Molecular Probes) was coupled to the engineered Cys residues of the purified NAC complex or fusion protein (NAC-FUS) according to the described protocol (1Kramer G.

The labeled proteins were incubated with either E. coli or yeast ribosomes for 30 min, then were exposed on ice to UV light (365 nm, 100 W; model B-100AP, Ultraviolet Products) at 5 cm for 20 (E. coli ribosome-containing samples) or 60 min (yeast ribosome-containing samples) before loading the reactions onto 20% sucrose cushions to separate soluble material (supernatant, S) from ribosome-bound material (pellet, P) by centrifugation at 200,000 × g in a TLA 100 rotor. Identification of cross-linked NAC-ribosome products by mass spectrometry was performed according to described protocols (1Kramer G. Rauch T. Rist W. Vorderwülbecke S. Patzelt H. Schulze-Specking A.

Biochem. 2005; 342: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We followed previously described protocols (31Kramer G. Rutkowska A. Wegrzyn R.D. Patzelt H. Kurz T.A. Merz F. Rauch T.

Antibodies and Miscellaneous—Antibodies against Ssb and Zuotin were kindly provided by E. A. Craig, and T. Lithgow generously provided antibodies against the Egd1, Egd2, and the NAC complex.

Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). NAC Binds to Yeast and E. coli Ribosomes in Vitro—To characterize the binding of NAC to ribosomes in vitro, we incubated recombinantly purified yeast NAC with high salt-washed ribosomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a 3:1 molar ratio, the mixture was loaded onto a sucrose cushion whereby unbound NAC (supernatant) was separated from ribosome-associated NAC protein in the pellet by centrifugation. We monitored NAC association with 80 S ribosomes by Western blotting against the βNAC subunit throughout all experiments. Approximately 30% of NAC was recovered in the ribosomal pellet confirming a 1:1 binding stoichiometry to yeast ribosomes in vitro. NAC incubated without ribosomes was exclusively found in the supernatant (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The addition of other purified yeast ribosome-associated factors to the reactions, namely Zuotin and Ssb, did not interfere with the stoichiometric binding of NAC to these ribosomes (data not shown), indicating that NAC and the components of the yeast chaperone triad occupy distinct non-overlapping positions on the eukaryotic ribosome. To determine whether NAC binds to a conserved ribosomal element, we additionally tested NAC binding to purified E. coli 70 S ribosomes. Interestingly, NAC also efficiently associated with E. coli ribosomes in an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that NAC binds to a region on the ribosomes that is conserved among bacteria and eukaryotes. We observed that occasionally during the incubation of NAC with ribosomes, the β-subunit, which normally migrates at ∼20 kDa, was partially degraded resulting in a faster migrating β-fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa (Fig. 1C). This degradation was most likely caused by a co-purifying proteolytic activity present in our ribosome preparation, which could be eliminated by adding protease inhibitors during the reaction or by purifying E. coli ribosomes from a strain that lacks multiple proteases. Importantly, the degraded βNAC fragment was not detected in the ribosomal pellet fraction indicating that the proteolytic cleavage affects a region of βNAC that is involved in ribosome binding. By mass spectrometry we identified that the degraded fragment represents a βNAC fragment lacking the N-terminal 30 aa. A similar βNAC fragment (Δ1-31) deficient in ribosome binding had been identified by tryptic digest of βNAC (41Grallath S. Schwarz J.P. Böttcher U.M.K. Bracher A. Hartl F. Siegers K. EMBO Reports. 2005; doi:10.1038/sj.embor.7400551Google Scholar). A Conserved Motif in the N Terminus of βNAC Is Involved in Ribosome Binding—To further investigate the contribution of the N terminus of βNAC in ribosome binding, we aligned the N termini of βNAC from different species and searched for conserved aa residues (Fig. 2A). A predicted unstructured loop region consisting of residues 15-40 of the yeast βNAC contained an entirely conserved RRK(X)nKK motif of positively charged aa side chains. This prediction, in combination with our observation that the loop region is proteolytically sensitive (Fig. 1C and data not shown), supported our hypothesis that this N-terminal region of βNAC might be involved in ribosome binding using an exposed and positively charged motif to contact the ribosomal surface. To test our assumption, we replaced the RRK as well as the KK residues within the βNAC motif with alanine residues, resulting in the NACRRK/AAA and NACKK/AA mutants of NAC, respectively (Fig. 2A). Because it was previously reported that deletion of the first 11 N-terminal aa of βNAC abolished ribosome binding (42Franke J. Reimann B. Hartmann E. Kohlerl M. Wiedmann B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also mutated conserved residues within the 11 N-terminal aa and exchanged the conserved residues EKL and KL to alanines resulting in NACEKL/AAA and NACKL/AA (Fig. 2A). Importantly, none of these purified βNAC variants were impaired in their ability to form a stable complex with αNAC, and their structural integrity was similar to wild-type NAC as judged by solubility, circular dichroism measurements, and partial proteinase K digest (data not shown) 4R. D. Wegrzyn, A. Koplin, and E. Deuerling, manuscript in preparation.. To test whether the NAC mutants could associate with ribosomes in vitro, we performed a ribosomal rebinding experiment as described above to separate ribosome-NAC complexes from unbound NAC. The purified NAC complexes alone could only be found in the supernatant (S, unbound) fraction (Fig. 1A and data not shown). When the NACRRK/AAA and NACKK/AA loop mutants were incubated in the presence of yeast 80 S ribosomes, a severe reduction in the ability to bind to ribosomes in vitro was observed as shown by the presence of the majority of the βNAC in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5). In the same experiment, the NACEKL/AAA and NACKL/AA helix mutants were not severely reduced in ribosome binding (Fig. 2B, lanes 7-10). Very similar results were obtained when NAC binding to purified E. coli ribosomes wa"
https://openalex.org/W2068344246,"Phospholipase Cϵ (PLCϵ) is one of the newest members of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) family. Previous studies have suggested that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis by activating PLCβ isoforms through Gq family G proteins and Gβγ subunits. Using RNA interference to knock down PLC isoforms, we demonstrate that the GPCR agonists endothelin (ET-1), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and thrombin, acting through endogenous receptors, couple to both endogenous PLCϵ and the PLCβ isoform, PLCβ3, in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Examination of the temporal activation of these PLC isoforms, however, reveals agonist- and isoform-specific profiles. PLCβ3 is activated acutely within the first minute of ET-1, LPA, or thrombin stimulation but does not contribute to sustained PI hydrolysis induced by LPA or thrombin and accounts for only part of ET-1 sustained stimulation. PLCϵ, on the other hand, predominantly accounts for sustained PI hydrolysis. Consistent with this observation, reconstitution of PLCϵ in knockdown cells dose-dependently increases sustained, but not acute, agonist-stimulated PI hydrolysis. Furthermore, combined knockdown of both PLCϵ and PLCβ3 additively inhibits PI hydrolysis, suggesting independent regulation of each isoform. Importantly, ubiquitination of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors correlates with sustained, but not acute, activation of PLCϵ or PLCβ3. In conclusion, GPCR agonists ET-1, LPA, and thrombin activate endogenous PLCϵ and PLCβ3 in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Activation of these PLC isoforms displays agonist-specific temporal profiles; however, PLCβ3 is predominantly involved in acute and PLCϵ in sustained PI hydrolysis. Phospholipase Cϵ (PLCϵ) is one of the newest members of the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) family. Previous studies have suggested that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis by activating PLCβ isoforms through Gq family G proteins and Gβγ subunits. Using RNA interference to knock down PLC isoforms, we demonstrate that the GPCR agonists endothelin (ET-1), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and thrombin, acting through endogenous receptors, couple to both endogenous PLCϵ and the PLCβ isoform, PLCβ3, in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Examination of the temporal activation of these PLC isoforms, however, reveals agonist- and isoform-specific profiles.

Eleven isoforms of PLC, representing five distinct, differentially regulated classes, have been identified: PLCβ1 to β4; PLCγ1 and γ2; PLCδ1, δ3, and δ4; and PLCϵ and PLCζ. PLCβ is regulated by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation of heterotrimeric Gq family G-proteins and Gβγ subunits. PLCγ is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation by receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor) and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. Src) activated by immunoglobulin and cytokines. Regulation of PLCδ is less well understood but is probably regulated by changes in [Ca2+]i, possibly downstream from activation of other PLC isoforms, and by high molecular weight G-protein, Gh. PLCζ is also regulated by [Ca2+]i (3Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). PLCϵ was discovered only recently and is the largest member of the PLC family (4Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V.

Consistent with its diverse regulation by G-proteins, studies utilizing overexpressed PLCϵ suggest that this isoform is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases and GPCRs. Receptor tyrosine kinase agonists, epidermal growth factor (9Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Smrcka A.V. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and platelet-derived growth factor (8Song C. Satoh T. Edamatsu H. Wu D. Tadano M. Gao X. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8105-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have been shown to stimulate PLCϵ through Ras and Rap. GPCR-mediated activation of PLCϵ can be subdivided into two groups. One group, β2 adrenergic, prostanoid, and muscarinic M3 receptor agonists, has been proposed to stimulate PLCϵ through Rap 2B mediated by cAMP-dependent activation of the Rap GTP exchange factor EPAC (12Evellin S. Nolte J. Tysack K. vom Dorp F. Thiel M. Weernink P.A. Jakobs K.H. Webb E.J. Lomasney J.W. Schmidt M. J. Biol.

The second group, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and thrombin receptor agonists, activate PLCϵ through Gα12/13 and Rap (9Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Smrcka A.V. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that activation of PLC by hormones is more complex than a simple linear activation from receptor to one PLC isoform (1Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 2Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). For example, GPCR receptor activation of PLCβ isoforms may lead to activation of PLCδ isoforms through increased levels of [Ca2+]i (14Banno Y. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15846-15852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kim Y.H. Park T.J. Lee Y.H. Baek K.J. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26127-26134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Alternatively, α1B-adrenergic receptor activation has been shown to stimulate PLCβ through Gαq/11 and to a lesser extent PLCδ1 through Gh (16Zhang J. Tucholski J. Lesort M. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 541-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPCRs have been shown to transactivate receptor tyrosine kinases (17Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 18Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1540-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) with potential activation of PLCβ and PLCγ, respectively. In addition, angiotensin II activation of the GPCR AT1 has been proposed to activate PLCγ1 (19Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and possibly temporally activate PLCβ1 (<30 s) followed by PLCγ1 (>30 s) (20Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Akers M. Lyons P.R. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19772-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 exist as a heterodimer that sequesters and inhibits PLCδ1 activity (21Guo Y. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar). Upon Gβγ activation of PLCβ2, PLCδ1 is released, allowing the enzyme to hydrolyze its substrate. Thus, receptor activation of cellular PLC activity is probably the composite of a complex signaling network that involves the activation of multiple PLC isoforms. Since similar receptor agonists have been postulated to stimulate PLCϵ and the classic isoforms, PLCβ and PLCγ, it is possible that novel signaling pathways, that redefine current PLC dogma, participate in this network. In the present studies, we used RNA interference to elucidate the physiologic regulation of PLCϵ and the PLC network regulated by GPCR agonists in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Rat-1 fibroblasts are a classic model for examining hormonal regulation of downstream effectors, and we show that these cells are easily manipulated by RNA interference using retrovirally transduced short interfering hairpin RNAs to generate stable and almost complete knockdown of signaling proteins. The GPCR agonists, endothelin, LPA, and thrombin, have been shown to stimulate PLC in Rat-1 fibroblasts through endogenous receptors (22Muldoon L.L. Rodland K.D. Forsythe M.L. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8529-8536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23MacNulty E.E. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Plevin R. MacNulty E.E. Palmer S. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and previous studies suggest that these agonists couple to PLCβ isoforms (25Sugden P.H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 871-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Chun J. Goetzl E.J. Hla T. Igarashi Y. Lynch K.R. Moolenaar W. Pyne S. Tigyi G.

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that these GPCR agonists activate both endogenous PLCϵ and PLCβ3 through endogenous receptors in Rat-1 fibroblasts. Activation of these isoforms, however, exhibits distinct agonist- and isoform-specific temporal profiles whereby PLCβ3 predominantly participates in acute and PLCϵ sustained PLC activity. In addition, sustained activation of PLCϵ is functionally correlated with IP3 receptor ubiquitination, a protective process associated with sustained activation of PLC. Materials—PLCβ1 and PLCγ1 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). PLCβ2, PLCβ3, PLCβ4, PLCγ2, PLCδ1, PLCδ2, and PLCδ3 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). LPA was from Sigma, α-thrombin was from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT), and endothelin-1 was from Calbiochem. Anti-ubiquitin, FK2, was from Biomol International L.P. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The PLCϵ antibody used in these studies was a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated from the RA1 domain. The type 1 IP3 receptor antibody was a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated to a C-terminal peptide (28Wojcikiewicz R.J. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue Culture—Rat-1 fibroblasts and all HEK293 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For reconstitution studies, Rat-1 clonal cell lines were seeded into 24-well dishes at 8 × 104 6 h prior to adenoviral transduction. Medium was then removed, and adenoviruses at the appropriate concentrations were applied in 250 μl of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Cells were then labeled for 18–24 h in inositol-free, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For all other PLC assays, Rat-1 cells were seeded into 24-well dishes at 4 × 104, grown overnight, and labeled the following day for 18–24 h in inositol-free, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Plasmid Constructs—Short interfering hairpin RNAs (siRNAs) were designed for PLCϵ and PLCβ3 targeting rat (r), mouse (m), or human (h) sequences: siRNAPLCϵ#1, GCCGGCATTCCTAAGACAC (r); siRNAPLCϵ#3, GGCACCAAGGCAAAGCAGC (rmh); siRNAPLCϵ#5, GCCAAATATTCCTACAGCA (rmh); siRNAPLCβ3#2, CATGGAGGTGGACACACTG (rmh); siRNAPLCβ3#3, GGTCTGGTCAGAGGAGTTG (rm); siRNAPLCβ3#5, GCTTCTGACTACATCCCAG (rm); siRNARan#5, GTAACATCGCCACGCGTCA (scrambled siRNAPLCϵ#1); siRNARan#6, CAGACACCGCAGCAGGAGA (scrambled siRNAPLCϵ#3); siRNARan#3, ACTGTCACAAGTACCTACA (scrambled siRNAPLCϵ#5). Sense (5′-gatcccc(siRNA)ttcaagaga(antisense siRNA)tttttggaaa and antisense (5′-agcttttccaaaaa(siRNA)tctcttgaa(antisense siRNA)ggg) oligonucleotides incorporating these siRNAs were synthesized (Sigma) and cloned into pSUPER and/or pSUPER-Retro (29Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar), generous gifts of Dr. R. Agami. Silent mutations were introduced into rat PLCϵ, pcDNA-PLCϵ-FLAG, to generate pcDNA-PLCϵSI#5. Mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the sense primer, 5′-CAAAGCCAAATAcagtTACAGCATCC, to mutate TTCC to cagt (shown in lowercase type) (Quick Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated region was sequenced and subcloned into the original plasmid. The cDNA for PLCϵSI#5 was subcloned into the pShuttle-CMV vector, and recombinant adenovirus was generated following the manufacturer's protocol for the Stratagene AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene). Similarly, the lipase-inactive mutant (5Lopez I. Mak E.C. Ding J. Hamm H.E. Lomasney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), H1433L PLCϵ, was created by site-directed mutagenesis. The region encompassing this mutation was subcloned into PLCϵSI#5, which was subsequently subcloned into pShuttle-CMV, and recombinant adenovirus, Adsi#5/H1433L PLCϵ, was produced. All constructs were sequenced (DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility, Iowa State University, Ames, IA). Stable Retroviral Knockdown—To generate retroviruses, HEK293T cells were seeded into T75 flasks at 8 × 106 the previous day. Cells were transfected with pSUPER-Retro siRNA constructs, pVPackECO, and pVPackGP plasmids by Ca2PO4 precipitation. Viruses were harvested after 48 h by filtering medium and quick freezing on dry ice. Stocks were stored at -80 °C. Viruses were titered by transducing Rat-1 cells with serial dilutions, killing untransduced cells with 3 μg/ml puromycin, and counting remaining colonies. Rat-1 fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates at 4 × 104. The following day, the conditioned medium was aspirated off, and 1 ml of viral supernatant and 8 μg/ml Polybrene were applied to each well for 6–8 h. The virus was replaced with complete medium after incubation. Cells were expanded to T75 flasks the next day, and 3 μg/ml puromycin was added to medium 48 h after transduction. Adenovirus Production—Generation of primary adenovirus was performed according to the AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System (Stratagene) protocol, except that the transfected cultures were incubated for 18 days or until a visible cytopathic effect was observed. Viruses were amplified by several rounds of infection in AD293 cells. Viral titers were calculated by an immunoreactivity spot assay (30Duale H. Kasparov S. Paton J.F. Teschemacher A.G. Exp. Physiol. 2005; 90: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C Assay—The PLC assay was performed under two different conditions, 20 and 100 mm LiCl. Experiments using 20 mm Li+ were performed as previously described (4Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Smrcka A.V. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Basically, agonists were added to the conditioned labeling medium brought to a final concentration of 20 mm LiCl, and the cells were incubated for 60 min unless indicated otherwise. Agonists were dissolved as follows: LPA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline; thrombin, 0.1% PEG, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline; and endothelin-1 (ET-1), double-distilled H2O. To increase trapping of inositol phosphates (IPs), 100 mm LiCl has been used in Rat-1 cells (22Muldoon L.L. Rodland K.D. Forsythe M.L. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8529-8536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Muldoon L.L. Rodland K.D. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18834-18841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments performed in 100 mm LiCl (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), conditioned labeling medium was replaced with Krebs Buffer 1 (4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 118 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, aerated with 5% CO2/95% O2 for 10 min), and the Rat-1 cells were allowed to equilibrate for 60 min in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Prior to the addition of agonists, cells were preincubated in Krebs Buffer 2 (4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 18 mm NaCl, 100 mm LiCl, pH 7.4, aerated with 5% CO2/95% O2 for 10 min) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by aspirating off the incubation medium and adding 375 μl of ice-cold 50 mm formic acid. After 30 min of incubation on ice, samples were removed, neutralized with 125 μl of 150 mm ammonium hydroxide, and diluted with 5 ml of ice-cold water. Total inositol phosphates were separated by column chromatography using AG 1-X8 200–400 mesh, formate form, and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Protein determination (Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit) and expression by Western blot analysis were determined in parallel wells carried through the PLC assay but without radioactivity. Steady state labeling of phosphatidylinositol was not significantly different between conditions.FIGURE 4Acute activation of PLCβ3 but not PLCϵ. A, acute regulation of inositol phosphate production. Control and knockdown Rat-1 fibroblasts described in the legend to Fig. 3 were stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm), LPA (3 μm), thrombin (Thr; 10 nm), or vehicle for the indicated times, and acute regulation of total inositol phosphate accumulation in the presence of 100 mm Li+ was determined.

Stable cell populations were then stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (3 μm), thrombin (10 nm), or vehicle, and PLC activity was determined as in Fig. 3.

Webster J.M. Zhu C.C. Luo S.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Rat-1 cells were seeded at a density of 1.9 × 105/6-well plate and then incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24 h and then serum-starved for an additional 24 h. Incubations were initiated by the addition of agonist and were terminated by removing medium and adding 250 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid. After 2 h at 4 °C,the 250 μl was removed and mixed with 50 μl of 10 mm EDTA and 250 μlof Freon/N-trioctylamine (1:1), vortexed, incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, and centrifuged (16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). A portion of the aqueous phase (150 μl) was then removed and neutralized with 75 μl of 25 mm NaHCO3, and IP3 concentration was determined with a radioreceptor assay as described (33Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IP3 Receptor Ubiquitination—IP3 receptor ubiquitination was measured essentially as previously described (34Wojcikiewicz R.J. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rat-1 cells were grown to near confluence in 15-cm diameter dishes and were serum-starved for 15 h. For reconstitution studies, cells were transduced 6 h after seeding for 24 h with the indicated adenoviruses prior to serum starvation. Cells were then preincubated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and exposed to stimuli. After removing culture medium, cells were solubilized by adding lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-base, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8) directly to the monolayers, followed by vigorous scraping. After 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and IP3R1 was immunoprecipitated by incubating overnight with anti-IP3R1 and Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. Immunocomplexes were washed thoroughly with lysis buffer, resuspended in gel loading buffer, electrophoresed, and probed in immunoblots with anti-ubiquitin and anti-IP3R1. Calculations and Statistical Analysis—Percentage change induced by knockdown of PLCϵ or PLCβ3 compared with random control cell lines (percentage change of siRNARan) was determined to summarize effects of PLC isoform knockdown. To calculate this value, basal levels (activity without added GPCR agonist) were subtracted from stimulated levels. Activity in PLCϵ or PLCβ3 cell lines was then divided by the activity in random siRNA-treated control cells, and from this value percentage change was calculated. Paired or unpaired Student's t test, Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test, and one sample t test were performed where appropriate. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Serum and G-protein-coupled Receptor Agonists Are Coupled to Endogenous PLCϵ in Rat-1 Fibroblasts—To find a cell line in which GPCR agonists couple to endogenous PLCϵ, various cell lines were screened by Western blotting, and Rat-1 fibroblasts were determined to express high levels of PLCϵ. Rat-1 fibroblasts are a classic cell line to study hormonal regulation of PLC, and the GPCR agonists endothelin (ET-1) and thrombin have been shown to stimulate PLC in this cell line (22Muldoon L.L. Rodland K.D. Forsythe M.L. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8529-8536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23MacNulty E.E. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J. Biochem.

To determine whether these agonists activate PLCϵ, RNA interference was used to knock down endogenous PLCϵ. Eight siRNAs targeting PLCϵ were generated, which knocked down PLCϵ with different efficiencies. Of these, three (siRNAPLCϵ#1, siRNAPLCϵ#3, and siRNAPLCϵ#5) were used to generate stable cell populations that knock down PLCϵ in Rat-1 fibroblasts by 53–97% (Fig. 1B). Random sequences of these siRNAs were used as controls. Knockdown of PLCϵ did not affect the expression of the other PLC isoforms present in this cell line, PLCβ3, PLCγ1, or PLCδ1 (Fig. 1B); expression of G-proteins, G12, G13, Rho, Ras, or Rap (data not shown); or cell growth (data not shown). Fig. 1A shows the effect of knocking down PLCϵ on fetal bovine serum (FBS), ET-1, and thrombin-stimulated PLC activity. With increasing knockdown, agonist-stimulated PLC activity was increasingly inhibited compared with three different random siRNA control cell populations. The two most effective siRNAs, siRNAPLCϵ#1 and siRNAPLCϵ#5, significantly inhibited FBS-stimulated PI hydrolysis by 39 and 74%, respectively, ET-1 by 30 and 69%, and thrombin by 69 and 94%. Similar results were obtained in an independently generated set of stable cell lines (data not shown). Significant inhibition by at least two distinct siRNAs suggests that the observed inhibition was not due to off-target effects. Moreover, uncoupling was not due to siRNA-induced nonspecific activation of interferon, sin"
https://openalex.org/W2063064538,"Estrogen promotes the proliferation of human breast epithelial cells by interacting with the estrogen receptor (ER). Physiological responses of cells to estrogen are regulated in part by degradation of the ER. Previous studies revealed that calmodulin binds directly to the ER, thereby enhancing its stability. Consistent with these findings, cell-permeable calmodulin antagonists dramatically reduced the number of ER in MCF-7 human breast epithelial cells. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism by which calmodulin attenuates ER degradation. MG132 and lactacystin, inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, prevented the calmodulin antagonist CGS9343B from reducing the amount of ER in MCF-7 cells. In contrast, protease inhibitors afforded no protection. Moreover, CGS9343B enhanced ER ubiquitination. A point mutant ER construct that is unable to bind calmodulin, termed ERΔCaM, is ubiquitinated to a greater extent than wild type ER. The ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP) associated with and promoted the degradation of ER. The possible convergence of calmodulin and E6AP on ER degradation was examined. ERΔCaM bound E6AP with higher affinity than that of wild type ER. Moreover, calmodulin attenuated the in vitro interaction between ER and E6AP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Collectively, our data reveal that E6AP is a component of ER degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that Ca2+/calmodulin modulates this degradation mechanism. These results have potential implications for the development of selectively targeted therapeutic agents for breast cancer.

Like the other members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, the classical mode of action of ER involves binding of the ligand-receptor complex to specific DNA response elements within the promoters of target genes. Transcriptional activation is subsequently activated or repressed as a result of DNA-bound receptors recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes, coactivator and corepressor proteins, and the transcriptional initiation machinery (4McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). It has been known for some time that estradiol (E2) significantly decreases the concentration of ER in cultured breast epithelial cells (5Horigome T. Ogata F. Golding T.S. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2540-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). More recent evidence from several investigators revealed that E2-induced degradation of ER is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (6Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W.

Most interestingly, the mechanism underlying ER destruction produced by E2 is distinct from that produced by the selective ER modulators fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) or GW5638 (10Shao W. Keeton E.K. McDonnell D.P. Brown M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11599-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence strongly supports a role for Ca2+ and calmodulin in several aspects of ER function (11Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (and references therein): 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Initial findings indicated that ER isolated from rat uterus cystol bound calmodulin-Sepharose in vitro in the presence of Ca2+ (12Castoria G. Migliaccio A. Nola E. Auricchio F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we documented by coimmunoprecipitation that endogenous ER binds endogenous calmodulin in human breast epithelial cells (11Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (and references therein): 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, calmodulin was shown to increase the affinity of ER for the estrogen-response element (ERE) (14Bouhoute A. Leclercq G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Biswas D.K. Reddy P.V. Pickard M. Makkad B. Pettit N. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33817-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory documented that nuclear calmodulin is required for E2 to stimulate transcription by ER (16Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1195-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated that calmodulin binds directly to ER, thereby stabilizing ER (11Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (and references therein): 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to identify the molecular mechanism by which calmodulin promotes ER stability. We observed that inhibitors of the proteasome pathway, but not protease inhibitors, prevented the cell-permeable calmodulin antagonist CGS9343B from reducing the amount of ER in cell lysates. Consistent with these findings, ubiquitination of ER was enhanced when the interaction between ER and calmodulin was attenuated either with CGS9343B or with a point mutant ER construct that is unable to bind calmodulin. Moreover, reduction of binding to calmodulin enhanced the binding of ER to the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6-associated protein (E6AP). Thus, calmodulin modulates ER degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, at least in part by regulating the interaction between ER and E6AP. Materials—Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from BioWhittaker. Charcoal-treated FBS was from Cocalico Biologicals Inc. MCF-7 and T47D breast epithelial cells and COS-7 green monkey kidney cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. CGS9343B was generously donated by Drs. E. Moret and B. Schmid (Novartis, Switzerland). Lactacystin, MG132, calpeptin, and the calpain inhibitor II N-acetyl-leucine-leucine-methioninal (ALLM) were purchased from Calbiochem.

Plasmids—The plasmids for wild type and mutant E6AP have been described previously (17Talis A.L. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. J. Biol.

The mutant E6AP (named E6AP C833A) has a cysteine to alanine (Cys → Ala) mutation at amino acid 833, which eliminates the catalytic activity of the protein. The Nedd4 mutant (named Nedd4 C744A) was generated by a Cys → Ala mutation at amino acid 744 (19Magnifico A. Ettenberg S. Yang C. Mariano J. Tiwari S. Fang S. Lipkowitz S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43169-43177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) of pcDNA-myc-Nedd4, which similarly eliminated catalytic activity. pGEX-2T-E6AP (20Oda H. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and pMT107 (21Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) were described previously. A deletion mutant and a point mutant ER unable to bind calmodulin were developed. These constructs are described in detail elsewhere (22Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13097-13104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, ERΔ298–317 was generated by deleting amino acid residues 298–317 from pcDNA3-myc-ER by using PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA3-myc-ER was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutant cDNA was amplified by PCR with Pfu turbo DNA polymerase using the oligonucleotides 5′-CCAAGCCCGCTCATGGACGAACGCTCTAAGAAGA-3′ (mutated residues are underlined). These changes result in replacement of Ile-298 with Glu and Lys-299 with Asp. The construct is termed ERΔCaM. The sequence of both constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—MCF-7 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. T47D cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and 24 h later, 4–8 μg of DNA was transiently introduced into cells using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. When cells were incubated with E2, the culture medium was replaced 24 h prior to the treatment with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-treated FBS (11Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (and references therein): 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed between 24 and 48 h post-transfection in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7. 5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) containing 1 mm CaCl2. Lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min and sonicated. Debris was cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C. Treatment with Cell-permeable Agents—Where indicated, cells were incubated with 40 μm CGS9343B, 10 μm TFP, 20 μm ALLM, or 10 μm calpeptin for 16 h. When proteasome inhibitors were used, cells were preincubated for 2 h with 10 μm lactacystin or 10 μm MG132 prior to other treatments. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm PMSF), and immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously (23Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, after pre-clearing with protein A-Sepharose beads, equal amounts of protein lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-ER or anti-E6AP antibodies for 2 h at 4°C. NIRS was used as a control. Immune complexes were collected for 2 h with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose and washed five times with buffer B, and samples were processed by Western blotting as described below. Western Blotting—Equal amounts of protein lysate and immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk in TBS-T buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8. 0, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and probed with the antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Complexes were visualized with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. In Vivo Ubiquitination—COS-7 cells were cotransfected with pMPT107 (His6-tagged ubiquitin) and pcDNA3-ER or pcDNA3-ERΔCaM. Forty eight hours post-transfection, cells were treated for 2 h with 10 μm MG132 or vehicle, followed by further incubation with 40 μm CGS9343B or an equal volume of vehicle (ethanol) for 16 h. Lysates were harvested in 1 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 7. 5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm PMSF). After preclearing with 20 μl each of protein G- and protein A-Sepharose beads, equal amounts of protein lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-His or anti-ER antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected and washed five times with buffer C, and the samples were processed by Western blotting. In Vitro Ubiquitination—GST-E6AP, E1-His (a kind gift from Jeff Parvin), and UbcH5c-His (a kind gift from Richard Baer) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). GST-E6AP was purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. E1-His and UbcH5c-His were purified by nickel affinity chromatography using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Purified proteins were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 48 h. Reaction mixtures contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7. 9, 0. 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm ATP, 60 mm KCl, 10 μm biotin-tagged ubiquitin (BostonBiochem), 200 nm E1-His, 5 μm UbcH5c-His, 1 μg of GST-E6AP, and 1 μg of ER. Where indicated, ER was preincubated with 100 ng of calmodulin in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the assays were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE solubilization buffer. Samples were processed by Western blotting, and ubiquitinated proteins were visualized with streptavidin fused to horseradish peroxidase, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion constructs of wild type E6AP (20Oda H. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were expressed in E. coli and isolated with glutathione-Sepharose. For pull-down from cell lysates, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-ER or pcDNA3-ERΔCaM and 48 h later were lysed in buffer B. Equal amounts of lysate were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 500 ng of GST-E6AP on glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST alone (10 μg) was used as control. After sedimentation by centrifugation, samples were washed with buffer B and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 5.2% (w/v) SDS, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0. 25 m sucrose, and 2 mm EDTA). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and processed by immunoblotting. For competition analysis with pure proteins, 1. 5 μg of ER was preincubated for 1 h at 4 °Cwith0, 0.25, or 1.25 μg of calmodulin or 5 μg of bovine serum albumin in buffer A in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. GST-E6AP (5 μg) on glutathione-Sepharose beads was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 1 h (10 μg of GST alone was used as control). Samples were processed by Western blotting as described above. Miscellaneous—Densitometry of enhanced chemiluminescence signals was analyzed with UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific Corp.). Statistical analysis was performed by Students's t test, using InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined with the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Calmodulin Antagonists Reduced the Amount of ER Protein in Breast Epithelial Cells—We have documented previously (11Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (and references therein): 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that incubation of MCF-7 cells with calmodulin antagonists significantly reduced the amount of ERα protein. This reduction was due to enhanced degradation of ERα; gene expression was unaltered (11Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (and references therein): 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The effect is specific for ERα. The stability of ERβ, which does not bind calmodulin (24Garcia Pedrero J.M. Del Rio B. Martinez-Campa C. Muramatsu M. Lazo P.S. Ramos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 947-960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is unaffected by calmodulin antagonists (16Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1195-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, all further analyses were confined to ERα. Here we examined the effect of two structurally distinct, cell-permeable calmodulin antagonists, CGS9343B and TFP, in another ER-positive breast epithelial cell line. Exposure to 40 μm CGS9343B reduced the total amount of ER in T47D cells (Fig. 1A). The reduction was not altered by E2. Note that E2 alone decreased ER concentration (Fig. 1A), consistent with prior observations (11Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (and references therein): 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Incubation with TFP similarly reduced the amount of ER (Fig. 1), indicating that calmodulin stabilizes ER in diverse breast epithelial cell lines. Inhibition of the interaction between ER and calmodulin by calmodulin antagonists results in degradation of ER (11Li Z. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (and references therein): 17354-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that mutant ER constructs that cannot bind to calmodulin would be unaffected by CGS9343B. To test this hypothesis, we examined degradation of ERΔ298–317 and ERΔCaM. Neither ERΔ298–317, which lacks the calmodulin-binding region of ER, nor the point mutant construct ERΔCaM binds calmodulin (22Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13097-13104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells, which lack endogenous ER, were transfected with wild type ER, ERΔ298–317, or ERΔCaM and incubated with CGS9343B. Analogous to the observation with endogenous ER, CGS9343B substantially reduced the amount of transfected full-length ER (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the levels of ERΔ298–317 and ERΔCaM were not significantly altered by antagonism of calmodulin with CGS9343B. These data confirm that the effect of CGS9343B on ER stability is specific and is mediated by disrupting the interaction of calmodulin with ER. Effect of Proteasome and Protease Inhibitors on ER Degradation Induced by Antagonism of Calmodulin—In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which calmodulin stabilizes ER, we used a panel of inhibitors. The ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway is the major system for degradation of short lived proteins (25Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 26Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possible involvement of this pathway was evaluated with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin. MCF-7 cells were preincubated with lactacystin or MG132 for 2 h prior to treatment with CGS9343B. Analysis by Western blotting revealed that lactacystin prevented CGS9342B from reducing the amount of ER (Fig. 2A). Lactacystin alone, without CGS9343B, had no significant effect on the ER content of the cells. Essentially identical results were obtained with MG132 (Fig. 2A). Similar analysis was conducted with protease inhibitors. In contrast to the protective effect of the proteasome inhibitors, neither the calpain inhibitor II ALLM nor calpeptin had any effect on the reduction of ER produced by incubating cells with CGS9343B (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these data imply that calmodulin protects the ER from degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The Calmodulin Antagonist CGS9343B Enhanced Ubiquitination of ER—The data in Fig. 2 suggested that calmodulin may inhibit ER ubiquitination. To test this hypothesis, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with ER and His-tagged ubiquitin, and the extent of ER ubiquitination was examined by probing anti-His immunoprecipitates for ER. Ubiquitin is conjugated to multiple lysine residues of target proteins and forms polyubiquitin chains (27Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, ubiquitin-tagged proteins can sometimes be seen as a ladder of higher molecular weight species on SDS-PAGE (6Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with MG132 enhanced ER ubiquitination (Fig. 3; ubiquitinated forms of ER are visible as a smear of higher molecular weight bands). Similarly, incubation with CGS9343B alone slightly increased ER ubiquitination but to a lesser extent than MG132 (Fig. 3A). When cells were treated with both MG132 and CGS9343B, ER ubiquitination was further enhanced. Essentially identical results were obtained when ubiquitinated proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitating with anti-ER antibodies and identified by probing blots for His-ubiquitin (data not shown). These observations suggest that CGS9343B promotes ER degradation by enhancing ER ubiquitination. Ubiquitination of Wild Type ER and ERΔCaM—The role of calmodulin in ER ubiquitination was explored further with ERΔCaM, a point mutant ER construct that cannot bind calmodulin (22Li L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13097-13104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild type ER or ERΔCaM, and the extent of ubiquitination of the two ER proteins was compared. When cells were incubated with MG132, ubiquitination of ERΔCaM was substantially greater than that of wild type ER (Fig. 3B). The expression levels of wild type ER and ERΔCaM were comparable as shown in the Western blot of cellular lysates (Fig. 3B, lower panel). ER Is a Substrate of E6AP—Ubiquitination is a three-step process in which ubiquitin is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and then transferred to the target by a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) (26Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar, 28Adams J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S49-S54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). E6AP was initially identified as a ubiquitin ligase that cooperates with the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein to degrade the tumor suppressor p53 (18Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). A few years ago, the human progesterone receptor was shown to directly interact with E6AP (29Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Smith C.L. Lev-Lehman E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1182-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered whether E6AP participates in regulation of ER. Initial analysis was to determine whether the E3 ligase activity of E6AP is capable of degrading endogenous ER. Transient transfection of MCF-7 cells with wild type E6AP decreased endogenous ER levels by 21 ± 3.3% (mean ± S.E., n = 3; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). Further analysis was performed with a catalytically inactive mutant form of E6AP (termed E6AP C833A), which has a cysteine to alanine substitution at amino acid 833 in the active site, rendering it incapable of forming a thiol ester with ubiquitin (17Talis A.L. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6439-6445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild type enzyme, E6AP C833A did not significantly reduce the amount of ER in the cells (Fig. 4). Note that the expression levels of E6AP and C833A were comparable. These data reveal that the E3 ligase activity of E6AP contributes to degradation of ER. E6AP Associates Specifically with ER—The possible interaction of ER with E6AP was examined by two approaches, namely immunoprecipitation and pull-down with GST fusion proteins. In the first approach, endogenous E6AP was immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells expressing ER. ER coimmunoprecipitated with E6AP (Fig. 5A). Specificity was confirmed by the absence of ER from samples precipitated in parallel with NIRS. Analogous experiments were conducted with MCF-7 cells from which endogenous ER was immunoprecipitated. This analysis revealed that both wild type and mutant E6AP coimmunoprecipitated with ER (Fig. 5B). Although the expression levels of wild type and mutant E6AP were equivalent (see lysate in Fig. 5B), the amount of E6AP C833A that coimmunoprecipitated with ER was substantially more than the amount of wild type E6AP. Similar observations were made in COS-7 cells, which were cotransfected with ER and HA-tagged E6AP (Fig. 5C). Both wild type E6AP and E6AP C833A coimmunoprecipitated with transfected ER. Analogous to the findings with MCF-7 cells, the amount of E6AP C833A that coimmunoprecipitated with ER from COS-7 cells was greater than that of wild type E6AP (Fig. 5C). The specificity of the interaction between ER and E6AP was evaluated by examining the possible association of ER with Nedd4, another HECT domain E3 ligase (30Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ER was immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells, which had been cotransfected with ER and Nedd4. In contrast to the findings with E6AP, no Nedd4 was detected in immunoprecipitates, despite the presence of abundant ER (Fig. 5D). Note that Nedd4 expressed well in the cells but did not induce ER degradation. A catalytically inactive Nedd4 construct also failed to bind ER (Fig. 5D). When Nedd4 was immunoprecipitated from cells under similar conditions, no ER was detected in the precipitates (data not shown). Collectively, these findings reveal that ER binding to E6AP is specific because ER did not bind another related HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligase. Effect of Calmodulin on the Binding of ER to E6AP—In the second approach, GST-E6AP was incubated with lysates derived from COS cells transfected with ER. GST-E6AP bound ER in COS cell lysates (Fig. 6A). Binding was specific as no ER was detected in lysates incubated with GST alone. The enhanced ubiquitination of ER in the absence of calmodulin binding, coupled with the association between E6AP and ER, led to the hypothesis that calmodulin may modulate the ER-E6AP interaction. Three interrelated experimental methods were used to test this hypothesis. In the first strategy, the binding of ERΔCaM to GST-E6AP was compared with that of wild type ER. Binding of ERΔCaM to E6AP was substantially greater than that of wild type ER (Fig. 6A). The second strategy was to perform direct in vitro competition assays to assess ER binding to E6AP in the presence of calmodulin. Pure ER bound to GST-E6AP"
https://openalex.org/W2039752032,"Children with neurofibromatosis (NF1) typically develop central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, including aberrant proliferation of astrocytes and formation of benign astrocytomas. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a Ras-GAP, highly expressed in developing neural cells; the mechanism of regulation of neurofibromin as a Ras-GAP, remains however unknown. We now show that, in response to EGF, neurofibromin is in vivo phosphorylated on serine residues by PKC-alpha, in human, rat, and avian CNS cells and cell lines. EGF-induced PKC phosphorylation was prominent in the cysteine/serine-rich domain (CSRD) of neurofibromin, which lies in the N-terminus and upstream of the Ras-GAP domain (GRD), and this modification significantly increased the association of neurofibromin with actin in co-immunoprecipitations. In addition, we show that Ras activation in response to EGF was significantly lowered when C62B cells overexpressed a construct encoding both CSRD + GRD. Moreover, when PKC-alpha was downregulated, the Ras-GAP activity of CSRD + GRD was significantly diminished, whereas overexpressed GRD alone acted as a weaker GAP and in a PKC-independent manner. Most importantly, functional Ras inhibition and EGF signaling shifts were established at the single cell level in C6-derived cell lines stably overexpressing CSRD + GRD, when transient co-overexpression of Ras and PKC-depletion prior to stimulation with EGF-induced mitosis. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence of a functional, allosteric regulation of GRD by CSRD, which requires neurofibromin phosphorylation by PKC and association with the actin cytoskeleton. Our data may suggest a novel mechanism for regulating biological responses to EGF and provide a new aspect for the understanding of the aberrant proliferation seen in the CNS of children with NF1."
https://openalex.org/W2077893826,"It is projected that in 2005, approximately 220 900 men will be newly diagnosed with carcinoma of the prostate (CaP). Men who are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease undergo androgen ablation therapy and most will relapse and progress within 18 months. Metastasis to bone is the major clinical concern during CaP progression, as it is associated with intractable pain, bone fracture and paralysis resulting from spinal cord compression. Therefore, an understanding of the key mechanisms involved in CaP cell bone metastasis is vital to development of novel treatments. The Rho GTPases are molecular switches involved in cell survival, motility and invasion. Increased expression of RhoC GTPase is linked to enhanced metastatic potential in multiple cancers; however, the role of RhoC GTPase in CaP metastasis has not been addressed. In the current study, we demonstrate that RhoC GTPase is expressed and active in PC-3 CaP cells. RhoC inhibition, either pharmacologically with C3 exotransferase or molecularly through expression of a dominant-negative RhoC, promotes IGF-I stimulated random motility but decreases in vitro invasion and experimental metastases. Inhibition of RhoC activity results in drastic morphologic changes and alterations in the expression and distribution of focal adhesion-related proteins. These data suggest that RhoC inhibition leads to activation of other GTPases involved in nondirected motility and that expression of active RhoC is required for the invasive phenotype of PC-3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1982396527,"Selective cell death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is the major cause of Parkinson disease. Current evidence suggests that this cell death could be mediated by nitric oxide by-products such as nitrate and peroxynitrite. Because protein kinase C (PKC)-δ is implicated in apoptosis of various cell types, we studied its roles and activation mechanisms in nitric oxide (NO)-induced apoptosis of SN4741 dopaminergic cells. When cells were treated with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, endogenous PKC-δ was nitrated and activated. Immunoprecipitation revealed that p53 co-immunoprecipitated with PKC-δ and was phosphorylated at the 15th serine residue in SNP-treated cells. An in vitro kinase assay revealed that p53 was directly phosphorylated by SNP-activated PKC-δ. The p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation was suppressed in SNP-treated cells when the NO-mediated activation of PKC-δ was inhibited by rottlerin or (-)-epigallocatechin gallate. Within 3 h of p53 phosphorylation, its protein levels increased because of decreased ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal proteolysis, whereas the protein levels of MDM2, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, were down-regulated in a p53 phosphorylation-dependent fashion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that nitration-mediated activation of PKC-δ induces the phosphorylation of the Ser-15 residue in p53, which increases its protein stability, thereby contributing to the nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis-like cell death pathway. These findings may be expanded to provide new insight into the cellular mechanisms of Parkinson disease.

Although the etiological causes of PD have not been fully elucidated, studies have identified major risk factors that include aging, exposure to environmental hazards, and genetic predisposition (1Polymeropoulos M.H.

Under these pathological conditions, the expression of inducible NO synthase may be induced in glia (especially astrocytes and microglia) by inflammatory mediators (7Murphy S. Glia. 2000; 29: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This glial NO production may influence surrounding neurons, especially dopaminergic cells (8Choi S.H. Joe E.H. Kim S.U. Jin B.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5877-5886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because NO produces reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a known cause of neuronal cell death. For example, peroxynitrite has been shown to trigger a cell death pathway in which intracellular zinc release leads to activation of 12-lipoxygenase, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and activation of caspase-3 in rat cerebral cortical neurons and human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (9Zhang Y.

During cell death, kinases such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, and the PKCs are regulated in a cell type- and context-dependent manner (12Li L. Feng Z. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13de Bernardo S. Canals S. Casarejos M.J. Solano R.M. Menendez J. Mena M.A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 667-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Of these kinases, the PKC family is composed of 11 subtypes divided into three categories as follows: conventional PKCs (i.e. PKC-α and -β) are responsive to both diacylglycerol and calcium (Ca2+); novel PKCs (i.e. PKC-δ and -ϵ) are responsive to diacylglycerol only; and atypical PKCs (i.e. PKC-ξ and -ι) do not respond to either diacylglycerol or Ca2+. Consistent with the other PKC isoforms, PKC-δ is composed of an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain flanking a variable region, V3 (14Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PKC-δ may be activated in one of the three common ways: 1) priming by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation on the activation loop (15Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar); 2) diacylglycerol-mediated activation via translocation from the cytosol to membrane; and 3) cleavage in the V3 region to generate an active catalytic fragment that is no longer inhibited by the regulatory domain (16Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Manome Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Blood. 1996; 87: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three activation modes of PKC-δ are governed by different apoptotic stimuli, and a number of downstream targets for each have been described in different systems. For instance, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling induces PKC-δ to translocate from the cytosol to the membrane, where it mediates ultraviolet-induced signal transduction and apoptosis in JB6 cells (17Chen N. Ma W. Huang C. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15389-15394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Under other circumstances, PKC-δ is proteolytically cleaved and activated by an interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like protease in human U-937 cells treated with ionizing radiation (18Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), whereas ceramide-induced translation of PKC-δ to the Golgi complex results in PKC-δ activation through tyrosine phosphorylation (19Kajimoto T. Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1769-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we identify and investigate a fourth possible activation mechanism for PKC-δ, nitration. This novel activation mechanism of PKC-δ appears to play an important role in apoptotic cell death via phosphorylation of p53 and degradation of MDM2. These effects were observed in SN4741 cells, which are derived from mouse substantia nigra dopaminergic cells, suggesting that nitration-induced PKC-δ activation could be a novel mode of cell death in Parkinson disease. Materials—Greiss reagent, Ponceau S, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), rottlerin, histone H1, diethylenetriamine-NONOate (DETA-NONOate), and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma. The CaspACE™ assay system (colorimetric) and the DeadEnd™ Fluorometric TUNEL system were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The polyclonal anti-active caspase-3 antibody (Ab), the mono- and polyclonal anti-p53 Abs, and the polyclonal anti-phospho-p53 (Ser-15) Ab were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The polyclonal anti-PKC-δ, the monoclonal anti-ubiquitin Ab, the rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit Ab, the GST-p53 protein, and the protein A-agarose beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal and monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine Abs were obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), and the monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Ab was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The anti-mouse and -rabbit secondary Abs were purchased from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratory (Gaithersburg, MD). MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. Sodium nitroprusside was obtained from Alexis® Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland), and the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit I was from BD Biosciences. The SUPEX ECL solution was obtained from Neuronex (Pohang, Korea). The inactive mutant PKC-δ plasmid and the constitutively active catalytic subunit of PKC-δ plasmid were kindly supplied by Dr. Yun-sil Lee (Laboratory of Radiation Effect, Korea Cancer Center Hospital; Seoul, Korea) and Dr. Jang-Soo Chun (Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology; Gwangju, Korea). Cell Culture—SN4741, a mouse embryonic substantia nigra-derived cell line, was grown at 33 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (Hyclone; Logan, UT) and 1% (v/v) antibiotics (Invitrogen). The medium was changed every 2 days, and cells were subcultured about twice a week. SN4741 cells were also co-cultured with BV2 microglial cells. 24 h after plating the SN4741 cells, BV2 cells were added and co-cultured for another 12 or 24 h. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—PKC-δ activity was determined by an immune complex kinase assay. Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) and then incubated for 2 h with polyclonal anti-PKC-δ. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose beads and washed four times with lysis buffer. The beads were then resuspended in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2, and [γ-32P]ATP), followed by a 30-min incubation at 30 °C with histone H1 and GST-p53 as substrates. Substrate phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted as described previously (20Choi B.H. Chae H.D. Park T.J. Oh J. Lim J. Kang S.S. Ha H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized with the ECL detection system. Immunocytochemical Analysis—SN4741 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with blocking solution (2.5% bovine serum albumin and 2.5% equine serum in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-active caspase-3, anti-phospho-p53, anti-GFAP, and monoclonal anti-MDM2 Abs, followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs. Slides were mounted and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan2, Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Cell Viability and Apoptosis Detection—Cellular viability was measured by MTT assay. Briefly, cells were exposed to MTT (0.05% in HEPES/saline) for 3 h (37 °C); mitochondrial dehydrogenases converted the MTT into purple formazan by cleaving the tetrazolium ring. The purple formazan was dissolved in 20% SDS and 50% N,N-dimethylformamide in H2O, and the optical density was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (λ = 570 nm) (21Liu Y. Peterson D.A. Kimura H. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). For examination of apoptosis, SN4741 cells were treated SNP (1 mm) with or without rottlerin (5 μm) and EGCG (20 μm) for up to 24 h. Floating cells were collected; adherent cells were trypsinized, and the combined cells were analyzed for apoptosis using the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit, which detects phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the cell membrane. Cells were counter-stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. For detection viabilities of SN4741 cells in co-culture conditions with BV2 cells, bright microscopy was used, and the viability alteration was visualized. Nitrite Generation Detection—After cells were treated with sodium nitroprusside, the production of NO was estimated by measuring the accumulation of nitrite (NO2−; the metabolic end product of NO metabolism) in the medium using the Greiss reagent, as described previously (22Tang Y. Han C. Wang X. Immunology. 1999; 96: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal volumes (100 μl) of sample and Greiss reagent (1:1 mixture of 1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid, and 0.1% α-naphthylamine in distilled water) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and absorbance was measured at 532 nm on a spectrophotometer. Nitric Oxide Induces Apoptotic Cell Death in SN4741 Cells—Treatment of the mouse substantia nigra-derived cell line, SN4741, with SNP induced time-dependent production of NO (Fig. 1A), as estimated from accumulation of nitrite, the metabolic end product of NO. As recent studies showed that NO can induce both necrosis-like (24Leist M. Single B. Naumann H. Fava E. Simon B. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. Exp.

Propidium iodide and annexin V staining followed by flow cytometry (FACS) using a FACSorter revealed that SNP-induced NO-mediated cell death showed a typical apoptosis-like pattern. In untreated cultures, most cells (88.96%) were PI-/annexin V-. Following treatment with 1 mm SNP, the cells shifted first to PI-/annexin V+, then moved to PI+/annexin V+, which is characteristic of apoptotic cells. Cells treated with SNP for 24 h were 32.67% PI-/annexin V+ and 53.33% PI+/annexin V+ (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained in a TUNEL assay, which showed TUNEL-positive cells in cultures treated with SNP for 6 h (Fig. 1C). Because caspase-3 activation is involved in apoptotic cell death (28Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Whyte M. Evan G. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we examined whether this enzyme is affected by SNP treatment. We found that SNP-treated cells exhibited caspase-3 cleavage and an ∼7.5-fold increase in caspase-3 activity, as compared with untreated control cells (data not shown). We also used another type of NO donor, DETA-NONOate, because of ruling out the possibilities of the unexpected potential mechanism of SNP that influences cell death. SN4741 cells were incubated with 1 mm DETA-NONOate and 1 mm SNP for indicated time, and then the decreases of their viabilities were checked by MTT assay. There were no significant differences in the cell death between the SNP-treated group and the DETA-NONOate-treated group (Fig. 1D). It means that NO production by either SNP or DETA-NONOate is a major cause of the apoptosis. These results collectively demonstrate that SNP leads to NO production, and it induces apoptotic death in SN4741 dopaminergic cells. PKC-δ Activation by Nitric Oxide Causes the Observed Cell Death—Because previous studies have suggested that PKC-δ is involved in apoptotic signaling (54Murriel C.L. Churchill E. Inagaki K.

PKC was indirectly monitored by measurement of radiolabeled phospho-histone H1 accumulation in SNP-treated cells. Consistent with the previous findings in articular chondrocytes (31Kim S.J. Kim H.G. Oh C.D. Hwang S.G. Song W.K. Yoo Y.J. Kang S.S. Chun J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30375-30381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we observed decreased PKC-α and -ϵ activity during NO-induced apoptosis of SN4741 cells. In contrast, our results revealed that PKC-δ was activated by nitric oxide treatment (Fig. 2A). In order to examine whether PKC-δ was involved in SNP-induced NO-mediated cell death, cells were treated with SNP and rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKC-δ, and cell viability was monitored. Viability decreased time-dependently in cells treated with SNP alone, whereas co-treatment with rottlerin substantially and significantly protected the cells from apoptosis, as shown by FACS analysis and MTT assay (Fig. 2, B and C). These results suggest that activation of PKC-δ participates in NO-mediated cell death. To assess the mode of activation of PKC-δ during NO-mediated cell death, we first examined whether SNP treatment induced translocation of cytosolic PKC-δ to the membrane. In untreated cells, PKC-δ was predominantly located in the membrane fraction, whereas PKC-α and -ι were evenly distributed between the cytosolic and membrane fractions. No significant translocation of PKC-δ, -α, or -ι was observed following SNP treatment, suggesting that SNP-induced PKC-δ activation is mediated by one or more mechanisms other than membrane translocation (Fig. 3A). Most interestingly, we found that the gel mobility of PKC-δ was slightly retarded after 3 h of SNP treatment (Fig. 3B). Because PKC-δ can be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (19Kajimoto T. Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1769-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we examined whether this shift indicated that PKC-δ was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to SNP treatment. Consistent with previous reports (19Kajimoto T. Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1769-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we did detect tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC-δ. However, there was no difference in the phosphorylation levels of SNP-treated and control cells. Previous studies had demonstrated that ONOO(-) inhibits PKC activity via tyrosine nitration in neurons (32Knapp L.T. Kanterewicz B.I. Hayes E.L. Klann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and NO donors promote translocation and activation of PKC-ϵ in an NO- and peroxynitrite-dependent fashion in rabbit cardiomyocytes (30Balafanova Z. Bolli R. Zhang J. Zheng Y. Pass J.M. Bhatnagar A. Tang X.L. Wang O. Cardwell E. Ping P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15021-15027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether tyrosine nitration of PKC-δ was involved in SNP-induced PKC-δ activation. As shown in Fig. 3B, tyrosine nitration of PKC-δ was substantially increased in SNP-treated cells compared with controls. Moreover, when cells were treated with EGCG, a nitration inhibitor (33Bashir M. Galiñanes M. Galiñanes M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2330-2335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the SNP-induced gel mobility shift and tyrosine nitration of PKC-δ were partially eliminated, as were the increased activity of this PKC (Fig. 3, B and C). Taken together, these results suggest that PKC-δ is activated at least in part by tyrosine nitration during the SNP-mediated apoptosis. SNP Induces p53 Phosphorylation at Ser-15—Phosphorylation of p53 plays important roles in apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including oxidative stress (34Ito K. Nakazato T. Yamato K. Miyakawa Y. Yamada T. Hozumi N. Segawa K. Ikeda Y. Kizaki M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 53Wang X. Zalcenstein A. Oren M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether SNP treatment induced p53 phosphorylation in SN4741 cells. Cells treated with SNP showed phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 beginning 1 h post-treatment and increasing in a time-dependent manner thereafter (Fig. 4A). Consistent with these findings, immunofluorescence staining revealed increased levels of phospho-p53 in SNP-treated cells versus controls (Fig. 4B). In contrast, there was no evidence of SNP-induced phosphorylation at other p53 phosphorylation sites, such as Ser-6, Ser-9, Ser-20, Ser-37, and Ser-392 (data not shown). To determine the subcellular localization of the observed phospho-p53, SNP-treated cells were divided into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and the phospho-p53 levels were observed in each fraction. Most interestingly, phospho-p53 was detected in both the nucleus and the cytosol, with no observable distribution differences in SNP-treated and control cells (Fig. 4C). These results collectively suggest that SNP treatment increases the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 but does not change the cellular distribution of this molecule. PKC-δ Binds to p53 and Induces Its Phosphorylation in SNP-treated Cells—To elucidate the role of PKC-δ in the SNP-induced phosphorylation of p53, cells were transfected with the constitutively active catalytic subunit of PKC-δ (PKC-δ CAT), and p53 phosphorylation was monitored. Our results revealed that ectopic expression of PKC-δ CAT induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 regardless of SNP treatment (Fig. 5A), indicating that PKC-δ plays an important role in SNP-induced p53 phosphorylation. To confirm this, we tested cells with rottlerin and a dominant negative mutant of PKC-δ (PKC-δ DN). As shown in Fig. 5B, rottlerin suppressed SNP-induced p53 phosphorylation, as did overexpression of PKC-δ DN and treatment with EGCG, suggesting that SNP-induced phosphorylation of p53 is regulated by NO-induced PKC-δ activation (Fig. 5C). In control experiments, rottlerin or EGCG alone had no significant effect on cellular phospho-p53 levels (data not shown). We then examined whether SNP treatment induced binding between p53 and PKC-δ. We found that p53 co-immunoprecipitated with PKC-δ in SNP-treated cells but not in untreated control cells (Fig. 5D). To identify whether the bound PKC-δ was able to phosphorylate p53, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. Although p53 was positively radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP in both control and SNP-treated cells, likely due to basal levels of PKC-δ activation, a significantly higher level of radioactivity was seen in treated cultures (Fig. 5E). Taken together, these results indicate that SNP-induced PKC-δ activation elicits binding with p53 and increases the level of phospho-p53. Ser-15-phosphorylated p53 Has Increased Stability—Phosphorylation of p53 within or close to the N-terminal MDM2 binding domain (i.e. at Ser-15) increases the stability of p53 by interfering with its ability to bind MDM2 (35Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) and by decreasing ubiquitin-dependent degradation. We thus used Western blotting to investigate whether the SNP-induced phosphorylation of p53 increased its protein stability. In cells treated with SNP for 3 h, the pp53 levels were higher in treated cells, but the total p53 protein levels were similar in treated and control cells. In contrast, cells treated with SNP for 6 h showed increased levels of both p53 and pp53, compared with controls (Fig. 6A). We further verified this effect by examining p53 ubiquitination in SNP-treated and control cells. Cells treated with SNP showed significantly lower levels of p53 ubiquitination versus controls, whereas those treated with SNP and rottlerin or EGCG showed recovery of near-control ubiquitination levels (Fig. 6B). These results collectively show that SNP-induced phosphorylation of p53 on the Ser-15 residue leads to decreased ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53 and subsequent p53 protein accumulation. NO-mediated MDM2 Degradation Increases the Stability of p53—A previous study demonstrated that NO triggered degradation of MDM2 (34Ito K. Nakazato T. Yamato K. Miyakawa Y. Yamada T. Hozumi N. Segawa K. Ikeda Y. Kizaki M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), providing a second possible mechanism for the noted stabilization of p53 levels. Our results revealed that MDM2 was barely observable in cells treated with SNP for 3 h, as compared with the detectable basal levels found in control cells (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, MDM2 ubiquitination was very high at this time point even though its protein level was barely detectable by Western blotting (Fig. 7B). This indicates that ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal proteolysis actively occurred to MDM2 when SNP was treated; we then examined the time courses of the various effects in an effort to determine which was more important for stabilization of p53 in SNP-treated cells, dissociation of MDM2 from p53 or direct down-regulation of MDM2. We found that increased phosphorylation of p53 was first observed 1 h post-treatment; down-regulation of MDM2 was observed beginning at 2 h post-treatment, and p53 protein levels began to increase 5 or 6 h post-treatment (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that increased phosphorylation of p53 may trigger down-regulation of MDM2, leading to increased stability of p53. To confirm this model, we examined whether phosphorylation of p53 is required for MDM2 degradation. Cells were transiently transfected with a mimetic form of phospho-p53 containing an aspartate at residue 15 (p53S15D). Most interestingly, our results revealed that MDM2 levels were decreased in cells transfecte"

Myc is profoundly involved in the genesis of many human and animal cancers, and the abrogation of Myc-induced apoptosis is a critical event in cancer progression. Because the mechanisms that mediate Myc-induced apoptosis are largely unknown, we analyzed protein expression during Myc-induced apoptosis using an isotope-coded affinity tag quantitative proteomics approach and identified that a proapoptotic mitochondrial chloride ion channel, mtCLIC/CLIC4, is induced by Myc. Myc binds to the mtCLIC gene promoter and activates its transcription. Suppression of mtCLIC expression by RNA interference inhibited Myc-induced apoptosis in response to different stress conditions and abolished the cooperative induction of apoptosis by Myc and Bax. We also found that Myc reduces the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and that the apoptosis-inducing stimuli up-regulate Bax expression. These results suggest that up-regulation of mtCLIC, together with a reduction in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, sensitizes Myc-expressing cells to the proapoptotic action of Bax.

Through heterodimerization with Max, Myc binds E-box sequences in DNA and activates transcription of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation. Max can also heterodimerize with the Mad family of transcriptional repressors, and the opposing transcriptional activities of Myc and Mad have been proposed to maintain the normal balance of cell proliferation. Furthermore, Myc can also repress transcription of some genes by directly binding and inhibiting activators such as Miz-1. Myc regulates diverse cellular functions such as proliferation, cell mass increase, apoptosis, differentiation, and tumorigenesis (2Oster S.K. Ho C.S. Soucie E.L. Penn L.Z. Adv.

Myc-induced apoptosis requires Myc DNA-binding function, dimerization with Max, and its N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (17Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5083-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the notion that Myc induces apoptosis by modulation of target gene expression. Nevertheless, only a small number of Myc target genes have been implicated in apoptosis, and the precise mechanism of how Myc induces apoptosis still largely remains an enigma. Apoptosis involves changes in the expression levels, subcellular locations, and modifications of key regulatory proteins. We therefore under-took a quantitative proteomic analysis of Myc-induced apoptosis. This analysis demonstrated the induction of a mitochondrial chloride ion channel, mtCLIC/CLIC4, 3The abbreviations used are: mtCLIC, mitochondrial chloride ion channel; ICAT, isotope-coded affinity tag; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNAi, RNA interference; PARP, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase; EMAPII, endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II. by Myc in addition to protein changes already known to occur during apoptosis. mtCLIC has been previously identified as a key player in p53-induced apoptosis, and we show here that mtCLIC is also a mediator of Myc-induced apoptosis.

As summarized in Fig. 1, we have identified a number of protein changes known to occur during apoptosis such as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis pathways, nuclear translocation of death effector domain containing DNA-binding protein (DEDD), and increased pro-endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II (EMAPII). In addition, novel protein changes such as the induction of mtCLIC in mitochondria and increase of NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1) were also observed. (A complete listing of the proteins identified and their fold change is deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and is accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE3159.) Expression of pro-EMAP II is induced upon tissue apoptosis (32Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U. Risau W. Drexler H.C. Clauss M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and the cleaved C-terminal fragment (EMAP II) is secreted from the apoptosing cells, resulting in phagocyte chemotaxis and cell engulfment (33Weiner A.M. Maizels N. Science. 1999; 284: 63-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The CD95 apoptosis pathway is required for Myc-induced apoptosis upon serum withdrawal (34Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Upon CD95-mediated apoptosis, DEDD translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (35Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), where it activates caspase-6 and inhibits RNA polymerase I transcription (36Schickling O. Stegh A.H. Byrd J. Peter M.E. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Myc was shown to increase the synthesis of ROS in mouse fibroblasts, a process proposed to mediate Myc-induced apoptosis (37Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh Y. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Machii T. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our proteomic analysis also detected protein changes that result in increased ROS synthesis or that occur as a consequence of increased ROS. For example, reduced expression of a mitochondrion-specific H2O2 scavenging enzyme, PRDX3 (Fig. 1), would cause increased ROS synthesis and sensitize cells to apoptosis (38Chang T.S. Cho C.S. Park S.

NQO1 (Fig. 1) is induced by reactive oxygen species, stabilizes p53, and mediates apoptosis (41Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), although its involvement in Myc-induced apoptosis has not been described. Molecular chaperones (Fig. 1) are induced by a diverse array of stresses, including ROS, and protect cells from apoptosis (42Beere H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2641-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). These protein changes can in principle contribute to Myc-induced apoptosis or be the consequences of Myc-induced apoptotic changes. Identification of a number of protein changes known to be associated with apoptosis validates our proteomics approach. We also observed up-regulation of mtCLIC in mitochondria of apoptosing Rat1/Myc cells. mtCLIC is a member of the CLIC family of intracellular chloride ion channels and was recently implicated in the apoptotic response to p53 (27Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3610-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). mtCLIC associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane, and its overexpression reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, releases cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, activates caspases, and induces apoptosis (27Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 4632-4641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). mtCLIC expression is induced by p53 and tumor necrosis factor α (27Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36488-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Induction of mtCLIC by p53 is thought to occur through binding of p53 to its cognate binding sites in the mtCLIC promoter (see Fig. 3A). The proapoptotic activity of mtCLIC and its connection to p53 suggested that mtCLIC may be a novel mediator of Myc-induced apoptosis. Induction of mtCLIC Expression by Myc—We have confirmed the up-regulation of mtCLIC as a consequence of Myc expression in Rat1 cells by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). We observed 2.6-fold up-regulation in our ICAT analysis and 2.2-fold up-regulation in our immunoblots. We have found that the induction of mtCLIC by Myc is independent of serum. Myc also induced mtCLIC protein expression in REF52 and Balb/c3T3 cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we detected elevated mtCLIC protein expression in colon Colo320 and lung N417 cancer cell lines with amplified c-myc (Fig. 2C). These cancer cell lines harbor p53 mutations, which may abrogate Myc-induced apoptosis. As expected, a Myc antagonist, Mad, reduced mtCLIC protein expression (Fig. 2D). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that Myc induces mtCLIC mRNA expression in Rat1 cells (Fig. 2E), indicating that up-regulation of mtCLIC by Myc occurs at least in part at the transcriptional level. Since mtCLIC is known to be induced by p53 (27Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3610-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 44Fernandez-Salas E. Sagar M. Cheng C. Yuspa S.H. Weinberg W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36488-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), it was of interest to test whether Myc can induce mtCLIC expression independently of p53. We thus introduced Myc or empty vector to p53-null Saos-2 cells and analyzed the level of mtCLIC. As shown in Fig. 2F, Myc induced mtCLIC expression in p53-null Saos-2 cells. We next analyzed the mtCLIC gene promoter and found two possible Myc-binding sites, one canonical (CACGTG) site at -1000 and one non-canonical site at -3340 relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 3A). Employing a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we detected the binding of Myc to the downstream canonical Myc site but not the upstream non-canonical site (Fig. 3B). To determine whether Myc activates the mtCLIC promoter, we used the mtCLIC promoter linked to luciferase in transient transfection assays and found that Myc activates the mtCLIC promoter transcription (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, activation of mtCLIC by Myc requires its heterodimerization/DNA-binding domain (basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper domain) (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that mtCLIC is a direct transcriptional target of Myc. Importantly, although Myc or p53 each activates the mtCLIC promoter modestly, when Myc and p53 are coexpressed, they display synergistic activation of the mtCLIC promoter (Fig. 3D). Role of mtCLIC in Myc-induced Apoptosis—To assess the role of mtCLIC in Myc-induced apoptosis, we used several RNAi constructs to suppress the expression of mtCLIC in Rat1/Myc cells and analyzed apoptosis induction upon serum withdrawal. Retrovirus-mediated RNAi against mtCLIC (si-1) inhibited mtCLIC expression but did not affect Myc expression (Fig. 4A). The introduction of Myc or RNAi constructs did not affect p53 expression in Rat1 cells (Fig. 4A). si-1 did not affect the expression of other CLIC family members such as CLIC1. 4K. Suh and S. Yuspa, unpublished data Upon serum withdrawal, Rat1/Myc cells underwent robust apoptosis. However, RNAi inhibition of mtCLIC prevented cell death by 60% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the cleavage of PARP was also inhibited (Fig. 4C). (Note that the PARP protein level is increased in apoptosing Rat1/Myc cells when compared with Rat1/vector cells (Fig. 1).) Introduction of an mtCLIC mismatch RNAi construct, si-1-mut, which did not inhibit mtCLIC expression (Fig. 4A), failed to prevent apoptosis (Fig. 4, B and C). The second mtCLIC RNAi construct (si-2), targeting a distinct region of mtCLIC, also prevented PARP cleavage upon serum withdrawal, indicating the specificity of RNAi (Fig. 4D). Myc also sensitizes cells to apoptosis upon DNA damage or glucose deprivation (45Malde P. Collins M.K. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 46Shim H.C.Y. Lewis BC Dang CV Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and we were interested in whether mtCLIC plays a role in these types of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5, mtCLIC RNAi also prevented Myc-induced apoptosis upon DNA damage caused by mitomycin C treatment or glucose deprivation, suggesting that mtCLIC plays a general role in mediating Myc-induced apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that Myc induces an activity that cooperates with Bax in apoptosis (31Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 47Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), but the nature of this activity remains unknown. Thus, we examined whether induction of mtCLIC by Myc is required for cooperation with Bax in apoptosis. Rat1/vector cells and Rat1/Myc cells do not display any sign of apoptosis under normal culture conditions without any treatment. Transfection of FLAG-Bax induced modest cell death in Rat1/vector cells, and Rat1/Myc cells were hypersensitive to Bax-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6, A–C). mtCLIC RNAi inhibited this cooperative apoptosis induction by Myc and Bax, suggesting that mtCLIC supplies the Bax-cooperating activity induced by Myc. Based on these observations, we propose that mtCLIC is a critical mediator of Myc-induced apoptosis, which cooperates with Bax in apoptosis induction. Since mtCLIC RNAi did not completely prevent Myc-induced apoptosis, it is likely that Myc has other effector(s) for apoptosis. To gain insight into this, we analyzed the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax upon serum withdrawal, DNA damage, or glucose deprivation. As shown in Fig. 7, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein expression was significantly lower in Rat1/Myc cells than in Rat1/vector cells, and their expression remained lower in Rat1/Myc cells upon three different stimuli. Furthermore, these three stimuli induced the expression of Bax. Therefore, we propose that Myc sensitizes cells to apoptosis by several pathways (see “Discussion”). Our ICAT proteomic analysis identified mtCLIC as a protein, the expression of which is induced by Myc, and further analyses demonstrated that mtCLIC is a direct transcriptional target of Myc and is a critical mediator of Myc-induced apoptosis. There is evidence that mtCLIC expression is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (27Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3610-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and it is possible that Myc contributes to both levels of regulation, perhaps explaining why we readily detected mtCLIC in our proteomic analysis, whereas it was not identified in earlier expression studies. The identification of mtCLIC as a critical Myc target mediating apoptosis induction is noteworthy because there has been only scant evidence concerning the nature of Myc targets involved in apoptosis. One important pathway of Myc-induced apoptosis appears to involve the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (20Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), but how Myc causes cytochrome c release remains a mystery. A previous mRNA microarray analysis identified induction of several genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, including cyclophilin and a heat shock protein, by Myc, but their functions in the context of apoptosis have not been explored (48Coller H.A. Grandori C. Tamayo P. Colbert T. Lander E.S. Eisenman R.N. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3260-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Other Myc targets such as ornithine decarboxylase, CDC25A, and lactate dehydrogenase A have also been implicated in Myc-induced apoptosis (46Shim H.C.Y. Lewis BC Dang CV Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 49Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5741-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 50Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), but no direct link to mitochondrial function has been demonstrated under apoptotic conditions. mtCLIC associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane, and its overexpression reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, activation of caspases, and induction of apoptosis (27Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol.

Cheng C. Garfield S. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4632-4641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). mtCLIC was previously shown to cooperate with Bax in apoptosis induction, although direct physical interaction of mtCLIC and Bax was not detected (27Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3610-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The location to mitochondrial inner membrane and the putative pore-forming and ion transport activities of mtCLIC (51Ashley R.H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) are consistent with a role for the opening of mitochondrial membrane channels in the apoptotic response. It was also reported that mtCLIC levels are elevated in mitochondria isolated from mtDNA-depleted cells and that these mitochondria incorporate more 36Cl- than parental mitochondria (52Arnould T. Mercy L. Houbion A. Vankoningsloo S. Renard P. Pascal T. Ninane N. Demazy C. Raes M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2145-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). mtCLIC may mediate apoptosis by modulating chloride ion transport through the mitochondrial membrane. The results presented here placed mtCLIC at an intersection of the two apoptosis pathways induced by Myc and p53. The p53 pathway was shown to be an important mediator of Myc-induced apoptosis (5Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 53Hermeking H. Eick D. Science. 1994; 265: 2091-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 54Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). It was presumed that Myc is upstream of p53 in apoptotic signaling, activating p53 through p19ARF. Downstream mediators of p53-dependent apoptosis such as Bax (15Eischen C.M. Roussel M.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7653-7662Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 47Juin P. Hunt A. Littlewood T. Griffiths B. Swigart L.B. Korsmeyer S. Evan G. Mol.

Nilsson J.A. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7256-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were shown to play roles in Myc-induced apoptosis. However, Myc is also known to induce p53-independent apoptosis by some unknown mechanism (56Amanullah A. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2967-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 57Sakamuro D. Eviner V. Elliott K.J. Showe L. White E. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2411-2418PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of the mtCLIC promoter by Myc and p53 suggests a new mechanism in which these two apoptosis inducers work together to modulate the expression of a proapoptotic mitochondrial chloride ion channel. Activation of p53 by DNA damage induces either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, and Myc was shown to be a principal determinant of the outcome of p53 response (58Seoane J. Le H.V. Massague J. Nature. 2002; 419: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 59Herold S. Wanzel M. Beuger V. Frohme C. Beul D. Hillukkala T. Syvaoja J. Saluz H.P. Haenel F. Eilers M. Mol.

Myc shifts the p53 response from cell cycle arrest to apoptosis. Although the inhibition of p21 expression through Myc-Miz-1 interaction was proposed as an underlying mechanism (58Seoane J. Le H.V. Massague J. Nature. 2002; 419: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 59Herold S. Wanzel M. Beuger V. Frohme C. Beul D. Hillukkala T. Syvaoja J. Saluz H.P. Haenel F. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), cooperative activation of mtCLIC transcription by Myc and p53 may also contribute to the switch from arrest to apoptosis. The effect of Myc and p53 on mtCLIC expression may vary depending on the cell types or culture conditions. p53 expression is not induced in Rat1/Myc cells when compared with Rat1/vector cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that p53 does not account for the sensitization to apoptosis in Rat1/Myc cells. Time course immunoblotting analysis indicated that in Rat1/Myc cells, whereas p53 displayed a robust increase upon mitomycin C treatment, modest increase upon serum withdrawal, and slight decrease upon glucose deprivation, mtCLIC expression did not change during apoptosis. 5Y. Shiio, unpublished data. Thus, p53 does not appear to play a role in modulating mtCLIC expression during apoptosis of Rat1/Myc cells. However, in cells induced to apoptose by overexpression of p53, there was a robust induction of mtCLIC expression and antisense inhibition of mtCLIC expression prevented p53-induced apoptosis (27Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3610-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of Myc and p53 to the regulation of mtCLIC expression seems to be context-dependent. We have found that in Rat1 cells, mtCLIC is induced by Myc regardless of the presence of serum, DNA damage, or glucose. We presume that mtCLIC up-regulation sensitizes cells to apoptosis and that serum withdrawal as well as DNA damage or glucose deprivation triggers the execution of apoptosis. Since mtCLIC RNAi did not completely prevent Myc-induced apoptosis, we analyzed the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax in Rat1/vector and Rat1/Myc cells upon different stimuli (Fig. 7). We found that Myc reduces the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL regardless of the stimuli. These findings are consistent with a previous report demonstrating that Myc reduces Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and B cells (64Maclean K.H. Keller U.B. Rodriguez-Galindo C. Nilsson J.A. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7256-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that the apoptosis-inducing stimuli such as serum withdrawal, DNA damage, and glucose deprivation up-regulate Bax expression. Based on these observations, we propose that 1) up-regulation of mtCLIC and 2) down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL sensitize Myc-expressing cells to apoptosis and that up-regulation of Bax by apoptosis-inducing stimuli triggers the execution of apoptosis. The human mtCLIC gene maps to chromosome 1p36.11, which displays loss of heterozygosity in 90% of N-myc-amplified neuroblastomas (i.e. one mtCLIC allele is deleted) (61Spieker N. Beitsma M. Van Sluis P. Chan A. Caron H. Versteeg R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001; 31: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Introduction of intact chromosome 1 or 1p into N-myc-amplified neuroblastomas resulted in cessation of proliferation and cell death (62Bader S.A. Fasching C. Brodeur G.M. Stanbridge E.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 245-255PubMed Google Scholar, 63Cheng N.C. Van Roy N. Chan A. Beitsma M. Westerveld A. Speleman F. Versteeg R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 291-297PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of a proapoptotic tumor suppressor in 1p36. mtCLIC may function as a tumor suppressor, which is inactivated by genetic alteration (deletion and possibly point mutation) in 1p36.11 region. Indeed, mtCLIC transcript levels are significantly reduced in human tumors from multiple different tissues.4 Our findings suggest that mtCLIC may be a key element in the apoptotic response to multiple signals.

https://openalex.org/W1988707129,"Amyloids are highly ordered, rigid β-sheet-rich structures that appear to have minimal dynamic flexibility in individual polypeptide chains. Here, we demonstrate that substantial conformational rearrangements occur within mature amyloid fibrils produced from full-length mammalian prion protein. The rearrangement results in a substantial extension of a proteinase K-resistant core and is accompanied by an increase in the β-sheet-rich conformation. The conformational rearrangement was induced in the presence of low concentrations of Triton X-100 either by brief exposure to 80 °C or, with less efficacy, by prolonged incubation at 37 °C at pH 7.5 and is referred to here as “annealing.” Upon annealing, amyloid fibrils acquired a proteinase K-resistant core identical to that found in bovine spongiform encephalopathy-specific scrapie-associated prion protein. Annealing was also observed when amyloid fibrils were exposed to high temperatures in the absence of detergent but in the presence of brain homogenate. These findings suggest that the amyloid fibrils exist in two conformationally distinct states that are separated by a high energy barrier and that yet unknown cellular cofactors may facilitate transition of the fibrils into thermodynamically more stable state. Our studies provide new insight into the complex behavior of prion polymerization and highlight the annealing process, a previously unknown step in the evolution of amyloid structures. Amyloids are highly ordered, rigid β-sheet-rich structures that appear to have minimal dynamic flexibility in individual polypeptide chains. Here, we demonstrate that substantial conformational rearrangements occur within mature amyloid fibrils produced from full-length mammalian prion protein. The rearrangement results in a substantial extension of a proteinase K-resistant core and is accompanied by an increase in the β-sheet-rich conformation. The conformational rearrangement was induced in the presence of low concentrations of Triton X-100 either by brief exposure to 80 °C or, with less efficacy, by prolonged incubation at 37 °C at pH 7.5 and is referred to here as “annealing.” Upon annealing, amyloid fibrils acquired a proteinase K-resistant core identical to that found in bovine spongiform encephalopathy-specific scrapie-associated prion protein. Annealing was also observed when amyloid fibrils were exposed to high temperatures in the absence of detergent but in the presence of brain homogenate. These findings suggest that the amyloid fibrils exist in two conformationally distinct states that are separated by a high energy barrier and that yet unknown cellular cofactors may facilitate transition of the fibrils into thermodynamically more stable state. Our studies provide new insight into the complex behavior of prion polymerization and highlight the annealing process, a previously unknown step in the evolution of amyloid structures. More than 15 severe maladies, including prion, Alzheimer, and Parkinson diseases, are related to the formation of specific β-sheet-rich protein aggregates known as amyloid fibrils (1Carrell R.W.

Recent studies demonstrated that a broad range of proteins unrelated to any known conformational disease are capable of forming β-sheet-rich amyloid forms both in vitro and in vivo (3Chiti F.

This finding has led to the proposition that the ability to fold into amyloid structures is not a unique property of certain proteins associated with degenerative maladies; rather, it may well be a feature of polypeptides in general (7Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Naturally produced amyloid structures are now found in a variety of organisms, including prokaryotes, insects, fish, and mammals (8Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M.

Self-assembly of polypeptides into amyloid structures has been implicated in diverse biological functions, including colonization and biofilm formation of Escherichia coli (8Chapman M.R.

Furthermore, amyloid fibrils are utilized as natural biomaterials, e.g. oocyte eggshells in insects and fish (9Iconomidou V.A. Vriend G. Hamodrakas K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The self-propagating conversion of several prion proteins into amyloid forms underlies a non-mendelian type of inheritance in yeast and fungi (12Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In additions, the unique physical properties of amyloid structures generated from synthetic peptides have been exploited for creating novel biomaterials and nanodevices (13Reches M. Gazit E. Science. 2003; 300: 625-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Conversion from a native fold into an amyloid state is a complex process that involves several consecutive steps (14Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev.

Because small oligomeric aggregates have been shown to be inherently toxic and have been implicated in a number of conformational diseases (15Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L.

When the conversion from a native to amyloid state is completed, mature amyloid structures are believed to represent the most conformationally rigid and thermodynamically stable folds (22Cohen F.E. Kelly J.W. Nature. 2003; 426: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Using amyloid fibrils generated from full-length mammalian recombinant prion protein (rPrP), 5The abbreviations used are: rPrP, recombinant prion protein; PK, proteinase K; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; AFM, atomic force microscopy; PrPSc, scrapie-associated prion protein; α-rPrP, α-helical recombinant prion protein. 5The abbreviations used are: rPrP, recombinant prion protein; PK, proteinase K; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; AFM, atomic force microscopy; PrPSc, scrapie-associated prion protein; α-rPrP, α-helical recombinant prion protein. we show that substantial conformational rearrangement may take place within an apparently mature amyloid structure. This conformational rearrangement can be induced by brief exposure to 80 °C (or a longer incubation at 37 °C) and consists of a substantial extension of the proteolytically resistant core and an increase in the amount of β-sheet-rich structure. We postulate that the amyloid structure can exist in two states that are separated by a high energy barrier. The two amyloid states differ in the conformation of the central region (residues 97–140), which can adopt either a proteinase K-sensitive or proteinase K-resistant conformation. To describe the transition between the two states, we propose a model similar to domain swapping. Our studies provide a novel insight into the maturation and evolution of amyloid structures. Protein Expression and Purification—Mouse and Syrian hamster full-length rPrPs were expressed and purified as described (23Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Purified rPrP was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry to be single species with an intact disulfide bond. In vitro refolding of rPrP to the α-helical form, β-oligomeric form, or amyloid fibrils was performed as described previously (23Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The β-oligomers and amyloid fibrils were dialyzed in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0) and kept in a stock solution at +4 °C. N-terminal sequencing was performed by the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA). Annealing Procedure—Preformed rPrP fibrils (in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0)) were supplemented with Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 100 mm, and then Triton X-100 (Fisher) was added to a final concentration of 0.01–1% as specified. Samples were heated in a water bath at 80 °C for 5–60 min and spun down for 2 s on microcentrifuge to restore the initial volume. In an alternative format, the amyloid fibrils were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Samples were treated with proteinase K (PK) at 37 °C for 1 h in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at a 1:50 PK/rPrP ratio. Digestion was stopped by quenching with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by addition of 4× sample buffer and 9 m urea to a final urea concentration of 2.25 m. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 15 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on precast 12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), followed by silver staining. Total RNA and mRNA were purified from healthy mouse brains using the RNeasy lipid tissue kit and the Oligotex direct mRNA kit (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The concentration and purity of RNA samples were determined by measurement of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm (A260/A280 > 2.0). The mixture of tRNAs was from bovine liver (Calbiochem), and heparan sulfate (fast-moving fraction) was from porcine intestinal mucosa (Sigma catalog no. H 9902). 5% normal brain homogenates were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) in the absence of detergents using a Potter-Elvehjem polytetrafluoroethylene/glass tissue grinder. Syrian hamster brains and antibody 3F4 were kindly provided by Dr. Rohwer. Partial Unfolding of Am*-rPrP (Amyloid Fibrils with an Extended PK-resistant Core)—Am*-rPrP fibrils were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2, 3, or 4 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). One-half of each sample was diluted 4-fold into 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), incubated for 6 h at 37°C to allow renaturation, and diluted 4-fold further into 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) prior to PK digestion. To assay PK resistance of partially denatured fibrils, the second half of each sample was diluted 8-fold into 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2, 3, or 4 m GdnHCl, respectively, to maintain the initial concentrations of GdnHCl. The control sample was not subjected to denaturation and was diluted and treated with PK as described for the other samples. To compensate for a loss of PK activity in the assays carried out under partially denaturing conditions, PK concentrations in the samples containing GdnHCl was adjusted accordingly (PK/rPrP ratios of 1:29 and 1:3.4 for the assays carried out in the absence and presence of GdnHCl, respectively). The PK concentration in these samples was optimized in preliminary experiments. PK digestion (1 h at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) was stopped by quenching with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by addition of 4× sample buffer and 9 m urea to a final urea concentration of 2.25 m. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 15 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on precast 12% NuPAGE gels, followed by Western blotting with Fab fragments P and R1. Electron Microscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy— Electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were performed as described previously (24Breydo L. Bocharova O.V. Makarava N. Salnikov V.V. Anderson M. Baskakov I.V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15534-15543Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)—Fibrils were imaged with a Pico-SPM LE atomic force microscope (Molecular Imaging Corp., Phoenix, AZ) operating in MAC (alternating magnetic field) mode using a MAC II silicon cantilever (tip radius of <7 nm and spring constant of 2.8 newtons/m) and a liquid cell (Molecular Imaging Corp.). Each sample was diluted to 0.25 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), deposited on a Fisherbrand glass coverslip (22-mm circumference), left to adhere for 30–40 min, and then washed three times with filtered ultrapure H2O. The slide was placed in the fluid cell and immersed in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). All imaging was performed at a scan rate of 0.5 lines/s at a drive frequency of 25–30 kHz. Previously, we reported that amyloid fibrils produced from full-length rPrP in vitro have abnormally short PK-resistant cores (residues 138–230, 152–230, and 162–230; 12-, 10-, and 8-kDa bands, respectively) (Fig. 1a, lanes 4 and 5) compared with that of classical scrapie-associated prion protein (PrPSc) (residues ∼90–230) (25Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Gill A.C. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Despite substantially shorter PK-resistant cores, the fibrils of rPrP retain the physical properties typical of amyloid structures and display remarkable resistance to thermal denaturation (23Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Specifically, the β-sheet component of amyloid structures (the band at 1618–1622 cm-1) remains stable even upon heating to 80 °C, whereas the loop, β-turns, and α-helical components (the band at 1661 cm-1) undergo reversible melting at 80 °C (23Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Parfenov A.S. Salnikov V.V. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 645-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As judged by electron microscopy, the amyloid form maintained fibrillar morphology even after heating to 80 °C (see Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Electron microscopy images of Am-rPrP and Am*-rPrP fibrils. a, Am-rPrP fibrils; b, fibrils heated at 80 °C for 15 min in 0.05% Triton X-100 and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).

In an attempt to detect any conformational changes, we employed an array of biophysical techniques, including a PK digestion assay. After screening a variety of experimental conditions, we found that the PK-resistant core elongated substantially upon brief exposure of the fibrils to 80 °C in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 1a, compare lanes 2 and 3). Specifically, we observed a gradual decrease in the amounts of 10- and 12-kDa PK-resistant bands accompanied by a parallel increase in the amount of a new band at 16 kDa (Fig. 1b). When 1% Triton X-100 was used in the absence of heat treatment, the 8-kDa band was no longer produced in the PK digestion assay, suggesting that Triton X-100 on its own stabilized the amyloid form to a certain extent (Fig. 1a, compare lanes 2 and 4). However, no 16-kDa band was detected in the absence of heat treatment. The new PK-resistant fragment of 16 kDa could be stained with Fab fragments P and R1, specific to residues 96–105 and 225–230, respectively, but not with polyclonal antibody specific to residues 79–97 (data not shown). To ascertain the new location of the PK cleavage site, the 16-kDa fragment was subjected to N-terminal sequencing, which revealed that the new PK-resistant core starts at Gln97. By analogy to the annealing of nucleic acids, this heat-induced transformation of amyloid fibrils will be henceforth referred to as annealing; the amyloid fibrils with short PK-resistant cores (residues 138–230 and 152–230) will be referred to as Am-rPrP, and the fibrils with an extended PK-resistant core (residues 97–230) will be referred to as Am*-rPrP (Fig. 1d). Heating above 80 °C reduced the efficacy of annealing, probably due to temperature-induced denaturation of the amyloid fibrils (Fig. 1b). Temperature-induced extension of the PK-resistant core was strictly limited to the amyloid fibrils; rPrP converted into other forms, such as α-helical monomers (α-rPrP) or β-sheet-rich oligomers, failed to display annealing (Fig. 1a). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the annealing of fibrils was accompanied by an increase in the amount of β-sheet structure (bands at 1618 and 1626 cm-1) (Fig. 2), which occurred at the expense of turns and loops, with contributions from α-helices and random coils (the band at 1661 cm-1). Heating in the presence of Triton X-100 changed, to a certain extent, the appearance of fibrils by electron microscopy (Fig. 3). In addition to fragmentation, as a result of annealing, fibrils displayed partial disassembly of laterally associated filaments and the appearance of segments with irregular morphologies (Fig. 3b). Next, we were interested to test whether annealing could be achieved at physiologically more relevant temperatures. We found that extension of the PK-resistant core occurred even at 37 °C (in 1% Triton X-100), but with a lower efficacy and only after a prolonged incubation time (>24 h) (Fig. 1c). To optimize experimental conditions, different concentrations of Triton X-100 were tested at 80 °C. At a fixed concentration of rPrP, the yield of annealing increased with a decrease in detergent concentration to as low as 0.01%, at which the molar ratio of Triton X-100 to rPrP was 25:1 (supplemental Fig. 1). The optimal concentration of detergent was found to be 0.05%, which was used in subsequent experiments. Several biophysical mechanisms, including high order assembly of fibrils into more complex supramolecular structures, may account for the annealing effect. To test whether heating can induce the assembly of fibrils into higher order structures, we employed AFM performed in a liquid cell. As judged by AFM, brief heating to 80 °C caused substantial fragmentation of fibrils into shorter pieces, which was also evident from the electron microscopy imaging, and spatial regrouping of fibrils into small clusters (Fig. 4, a and b). However, separate fibrils were clearly visible (Fig. 4b, inset). Detailed analyses of single fibrils by AFM revealed a slight increase in fibril width and height (Fig. 4c). A rearrangement of the fibrillar substructure and/or binding of Triton X-100 molecules may account for these minor changes in fibrillar shape. However, no signs indicating additional assembly of fibrils were found. Taken together, our data illustrate that brief exposure of amyloid fibrils to high temperatures induces conformational rearrangements within the fibrillar substructure rather than higher order assembly into more complex amyloid structures. To test whether the annealing is reversible and whether the Am*-rPrP fibrils are able to transform back into the initial Am-rPrP conformation after partial denaturation, we conducted a partial unfolding experiment. In this experiment, the Am*-rPrP fibrils were subjected to denaturation with 2, 3, or 4 m GdnHCl, followed by PK analysis of the partially denatured and renatured samples. In Am*-rPrP fibrils exposed to 2, 3, or 4 m GdnHCl, the 16-kDa band disappeared upon treatment with PK, whereas the original PK-resistant core (12-kDa band) remained intact (Fig. 5). When diluted out of GndHCl, the fibrils were able to refold back to the Am*-rPrP state as judged by the appearance of the 16-kDa band. The renaturation into the Am*-rPrP form was efficient only if the denaturation took place at 2 or 3 (but not 4) m GndHCl. Therefore, 4 m GdnHCl seems to be critical for reversibility of refolding to the Am*-rPrP state. Notably, the Am-rPrP fibrils did not adopt the Am*-rPrP conformation upon dilution under partially denaturing conditions (supplemental Fig. 2) unless they were treated using the annealing procedure. This experiment illustrates that, under partially denaturing conditions, the central region (residues ∼97–140) “opens up” and becomes accessible to PK; however, it still “remembers” the Am*-rPrP conformation and refolds back upon dilution out of GndHCl. Most important, these findings illustrate that the PK-sensitive conformation that the central region adopts under partially denaturing conditions in the Am*-rPrP state is not equivalent to the PK-sensitive conformation of the same region in the Am-rPrP fibrils. Taken together, these results indicate that region 97–140 is partially exposed to the solvent in the Am-rPrP state and that this region plays a key role in the transformation of fibrils from the Am-rPrP to Am*-rPrP state. Thereafter, we were interested in whether the interaction of the Am-rPrP fibrils with other macromolecules interferes with the transition from the Am-rPrP to Am*-rPrP state. Several classes of polyanions, including heparan sulfate and RNA, have been shown to bind selectively to the binding sites within the N-terminal region of PrP (residues 23–140) (26Gabus C. Derrington E. Leblanc P. Chnaiderman J. Dormont D. Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Surewicz W.K. Marc D. Nandi P. Darlix J.L. J. Biol.

Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of both heparan sulfate and RNA on the efficacy of annealing. As judged by a decrease in the intensity of the 16-kDa band, the presence of either heparan sulfate (heparan sulfate/rPrP molar ratios of 0.26 and 2.6) or mouse brain total RNA (RNA/rPrP ratios of 2 × 10-3 to 2 × 10-5) significantly attenuated the annealing process (Fig. 6, a and b). Inhibition of the annealing process was accompanied by aggregation of Am-rPrP fibrils into clumps (data not shown). mRNA from mouse brain or a mixture of tRNAs from bovine liver also inhibited formation of the Am*-rPrP state (data not shown). The attenuation by heparan sulfate and RNA was observed regardless of the temperature (80 or 37 °C) used for the annealing reaction (Fig. 6, a and b). Considering that polyanions have negative effects on the transition from the Am-rPrP to Am*-rPrP state, we wanted to determine whether fibrils are able to undergo annealing in the complex mixture of brain homogenate. To take advantage of the highly sensitive antibody 3F4 (specific to epitope 109–112 of hamster PrP) for detection of the Am*-rPrP form, we first demonstrated that the annealing phenomenon was not limited only to the fibrils produced from mouse rPrP, but was also observed for fibrils generated from Syrian hamster rPrP (data not shown). Furthermore, using Syrian hamster rPrP fibrils, we found that annealing occurred upon brief heating of Am-rPrP fibrils in a mixture with 5% brain homogenate (Fig. 7a). No 16-kDa band was detected if α-rPrP was used instead of Am-rPrP fibrils in a mixture with brain homogenate (Fig. 7a). The 16-kDa band was also not visible when Am-rPrP fibrils were mixed with brain homogenate that had been preheated and cooled down; however, the 16-kDa band appeared when the brain homogenate was heated again in a mixture with Am-rPrP fibrils (data not shown). Remarkably, the annealing was also observed in the absence of Triton X-100 or any other detergent when Am-rPrP fibrils were exposed to 80 °C in a mixture with brain homogenate (Fig. 7b). However, in the absence of Triton X-100, the efficacy of annealing decreased. The amount of the 16-kDa band was reduced further when Am-rPrP fibrils and brain homogenate where heated separately (Fig. 7b, third and fourth lanes). Notably, the 16-kDa band appeared upon long-term incubation of Am-rPrP fibrils in a mixture with brain homogenate at 37 °C in the absence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 7c). The 10- and 12-kDa bands were still visible; however, their intensities were reduced upon incubation at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. 3). Taken together, these data indicate that brain homogenate may contain a cofactor that stimulates transition from the Am-rPrP to Am*-rPrP state, that the effect of the cofactor is specific with respect to the amyloid fibrils (but not α-rPrP), and that the cofactor should be present at the moment of heating. We have reported that substantial conformational rearrangements occur within the apparently mature amyloid structure of rPrP amyloid fibrils even after the conversion from the native α-helical to amyloid state is completed. Such rearrangements are facilitated by brief exposure to high temperatures and result in the extension of the PK-resistant core within the amyloid state. Amyloid structures are known to resist heating up to 100 °C (28Baxa U. Ross P.D. Wickner R.B. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Exposure to high temperatures is also known to facilitate the complex processes that involve complementary inter- or intramolecular interactions, such as annealing of nucleic acids and protein domain swapping (29Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the ability of polypeptides to undergo substantial conformational rearrangements within mature amyloid structures at high temperatures has never been demonstrated before. In previous studies, large conformational changes were observed in fibrils produced from the yeast prion protein Ure2p (30Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ure2p fibrils are different from rPrP fibrils in one key aspect: in the fibrillar form, Ure2p retains its native α-helical structures that are devoid of a cross-β-core (30Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Heat treatment results in a substantial conformational change consisting of formation of a cross-β-core and a decrease in α-helicity (30Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct.

In this respect, the heat-induced transition of Ure2p fibrils is similar to the transitions from a native α-helical to β-sheet-rich state described previously for other proteins, including rPrP (31Lee A.S.

On the other hand, our finding emphasizes that substantial conformational rearrangements may occur even after the conversion of α-rPrP into mature amyloid structures is completed. The annealing of amyloid fibrils consisted of an extension of the PK-resistant core, an increase in the amount of β-sheet-rich structure, and some minor changes in fibrillar shape. We have not found any evidence of higher order assembly of fibrils into more complex supramolecular structures. Therefore, transition from the Am-rPrP to Am*-rPrP state appears to involve only conformational rearrangements within the fibrillar substructure rather than high order assem"
https://openalex.org/W2023424725,"The enzyme responsible for iodide salvage in the thyroid, iodotyrosine deiodinase, was solubilized from porcine thyroid microsomes by limited proteolysis with trypsin. The resulting protein retained deiodinase activity and was purified using anion exchange, dye, and hydrophobic chromatography successively. Peptide sequencing of the final isolate identified the gene responsible for the deiodinase. The amino acid sequence of the porcine enzyme is highly homologous to corresponding genes in a variety of mammals including humans, and the mouse gene was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells to confirm its identity. The amino acid sequence of the deiodinase suggests the presence of three domains. The N-terminal domain provides a membrane anchor. The intermediate domain contains the highest sequence variability and lacks homology to structural motifs available in the common databases. The C-terminal domain is highly conserved and resembles bacterial enzymes of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily. A three-dimensional model of the deiodinase based on the coordinates of the minor nitroreductase of Escherichia coli indicates that a Cys common to all of the mammal sequences is located adjacent to bound FMN. However, the deiodinase is not structurally related to other known flavoproteins containing redox-active cysteines or the iodothyronine deiodinases containing an active site selenocysteine.

Iodotyrosine deiodinase (IYD) 4The abbreviations used are: IYD, iodotyrosine deiodinase; CHAPS, (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; DIT, diiodotyrosine; HEK, human embryonic kidney; ID, iodothyronine deiodinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. 4The abbreviations used are: IYD, iodotyrosine deiodinase; CHAPS, (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; DIT, diiodotyrosine; HEK, human embryonic kidney; ID, iodothyronine deiodinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. facilitates iodide salvage in thyroid tissue by catalyzing deiodination of mono- and diiodotyrosine (DIT), the halogenated byproducts of thyroid hormone production (Scheme 1) (1Stanbury J.B.

Metab. 1956; 16: 848-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). IYD has remained poorly characterized for more than 50 years despite its significant role in intrathyroidal iodine metabolism (3Dunn J.T. Dunn A.D. Thyroid. 2001; 11: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Cavalieri R.R. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Patients with deficient IYD suffer from goiter, enlarged thyroid, and other symptoms associated with hypothyroidism because iodotyrosine cannot be directly reutilized for thyroid hormone synthesis (5Taurog A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. Werner & Ingbar's The thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2000: 61-84Google Scholar).The dehalogenation reaction catalyzed by IYD is unusual for aerobic organisms since the carbon-iodine bond is broken through a reductive process. More commonly, dehalogenation is accomplished by hydrolytic or oxidative pathways (Scheme 2). Considerable effort has been directed at these latter reactions in particular due to their potential utility in bioremediation of organohalides that persist in the environment (6Janssen D.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 163-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 7Fetzner S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 633-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 8Copley S.D. Poulter C.D. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 5. Elsevier, Oxford1999: 401-422Crossref Google Scholar). Many of the bacterial enzymes responsible for dehalogenation seem to have emerged from existing enzyme superfamilies soon after widespread dispersal of halogenated compounds (9Copley S.D. Curr. Opin.

Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Both enzymes catalyze reduction via similar chemical strategies. Tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase appears to promote tautomerization of tetrachlorohydroquinone and transient oxidation of an active-site cysteine to yield the reduced product, trichlorohydroquinone (13Kiefer P.M. McCarthy D.L. Copley S.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Kiefer P.M. Copley S.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, ID appears to act through an analogous tautomerization of thyroxin (3-[4-(4-hydroxy-3,5-diiodophenoxy)-3,5-diiodophenylalanine) and transient oxidation of an active-site selenocysteine to yield the reduced product, triiodothyronine (16Berry M.J.

Both of these enzymes use the reducing power of exogenous thiols, and both contain a nucleophilic and redox-active residue in their active sites. Despite these similarities, the enzymes are unrelated structurally. The bacterial dehalogenase belongs to the glutathione S-transferase superfamily (19McCarthy D.L. Navarette S. Willett W.S. Babbitt P.C. Copley S.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14634-14642Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the mammalian ID belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily (20Callebaut I. Curcio-Morelli C. Mornon J.-P. Gereben B. Buettner C. Huang S. Castro B. Fonseca T.L. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. J. Biol.

Friedman J.E. Rokita S.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4722-4723Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Tautomerization of iodotyrosine to its keto form is followed by transfer of an iodonium equivalent to an active-site Cys generating the reduced tyrosine (Scheme 3). Delivery of reducing equivalents to the proposed cysteinyl iodide via FMN results in regeneration of the reduced Cys residue. Currently, the ability of IYD to bind tightly to stable analogs of the keto intermediate provides the primary support for this mechanism (21Kunishima M. Friedman J.E. Rokita S.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4722-4723Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Further details on the mechanism await ready access to both the protein and its gene. We now report purification of IYD after its proteolytic release from porcine microsomes and expression of a homologous protein from mouse in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Database analysis identifies IYD as the first mammalian representative of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase superfamily, and quite distinct from mammalian iodothyronine dehalogenases (20Callebaut I.

Igepal, Triton X-100, octylglucoside, octylthioglucoside, cholate, deoxycholate, trypsin, trypsin inhibitor, lactate dehydrogenase (rabbit muscle), pyruvate, oxamate, phenyl-Sepharose, DNase I, and Cibacron blue 3GA were obtained from Sigma. Hydroxyapatite was obtained from Bio-Rad. CHAPS, GelCode glycoprotein staining kit, and BCA assay protein reagents were purchased from Pierce-Endogen. Q fast flow anion exchange resin was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Oligodeoxynucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA technologies, Inc. All restriction enzymes, Vent polymerase, and DNA T4 ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs unless specified otherwise. All other reagents were molecular biology grade or the highest grade available and were used without further purification. [125I]DIT was prepared from DIT as described in the literature (24Rosenberg I.N. Goswami A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).General Methods—Protein concentration was measured with a BCA assay according to the manufacturer's (Pierce) instructions (25Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Discontinuous Laemmli gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) were used to monitor protein purification employing a Bio-Rad Mini Protean 3 gel electrophoresis system (8 cm (length) × 0.75 mm (width) × 8.5 cm (height)). The resulting distribution of proteins was detected alternatively by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver (Silver Stain Plus kit, Bio-Rad).Preparation of Microsomes from Porcine Thyroids—Frozen thyroids (300 g) stored at -20 °C were thawed at 4 °C for 1 h and then minced, washed, and homogenized as described previously for bovine thyroids (24Rosenberg I.N. Goswami A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The homogenate was transferred to 2 × 500-ml polypropylene centrifuge bottles, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 1800 × g in a Beckman 10.500 rotor in a Beckman Avanti J-25I centrifuge. The supernatant was filtered through 16 layers of cheese-cloth, poured into 60-ml polycarbonate centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged in a type 35 rotor in a L8-80 M Beckman ultracentrifuge for 1.5 h at 100,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended and combined in 60 ml of soaking solution (24Rosenberg I.N. Goswami A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), divided into two 60-ml centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was decanted, and the mitochondrial/microsomal pellets (10 g) were stored at -20 °C.Solubilization of IYD—Microsomes (1 g) were suspended in the appropriate detergent in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4, 5 ml) gently agitated overnight (4 °C) on a shaker and then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. For proteolytic digestion, trypsin (0.1 mg) was added to an equivalent microsome (1 g) suspension and gently agitated at 4 °C. After 30 min trypsin inhibitor (0.063 mg, 1.0 mg of trypsin inhibitor/1.6 mg of trypsin, according to the manufacturer's instructions) was added from a freshly prepared stock solution (2 mg/ml) in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), and the suspension was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to remove the remaining microsomes. The supernatant containing solubilized IYD was stored at 4 °C.Purification of the Soluble Fragment of IYD Generated by Trypsin Proteolysis—Microsomes from three pounds of thyroids were prepared and digested as described above. The resulting soluble protein was loaded by gravity on a Q fast flow anion exchange column (50 ml, 1.5 × 30 cm, 0.5 ml/min) previously equilibrated with 10 column volumes of 150 mm NaCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of this initial buffer (1 ml/min) and eluted with a 4-column-volume linear gradient of 150 mm NaCl to 500 mm NaCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min as controlled by a peristaltic pump. Fractions containing IYD activity were pooled and loaded directly onto a 14-ml Cibacron blue 3GA column (1.5 × 8 cm) previously equilibrated with 10 column volumes of 600 mm NaCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). After washing the column with 5 column volumes of this buffer, IYD was eluted with 5 column volumes of 1.5 m NaCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (gravity). The NaCl concentration of the eluate containing IYD was increased from 1.5 to 3 m by the addition of solid NaCl and then loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose column (0.8 × 4 cm, 2 ml) previously equilibrated with 10 column volumes of 3 m NaCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). The column was successively washed with 5 column volumes of each 2 m NaCl and 1 m NaCl in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4). Finally, IYD was eluted at low ionic strength with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4).Assay of IYD Activity—Release of 125I- (nmol/h) from [125I]DIT was used to assay catalytic activity according to the literature (24Rosenberg I.N. Goswami A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein fractions (100 μl) were added to 300 μl of a solution containing (1.66 mm methimazole, 0.1 mm FAD, 666 mm KCl, 333 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), and 166 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), 100 μl of 100 μm DIT, 300 μl of deionized water, and 100 μl of [125I]DIT (50 μCi/μmol). The reaction was initiated by addition of 100 μl of 10% sodium dithionite (w/v) in 5% sodium bicarbonate (w/v). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and then quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1% unlabeled DIT (w/v) in 0.1 n NaOH. The final volume of each assay was 1.1 ml, and 250 μl of this was used to determine the total amount of 125I- in each assay. The remaining 850 μl was loaded onto Bio-Rad cation exchange AG 50W-X8 resin (4 ml) eluted in two fractions (4.15 and 5.00 ml) with 10% acetic acid and used to determine the amount of 125I- released from DIT. The rate of catalysis was then calculated by the fraction of iodide released above background levels, the mol of DIT present initially (multiplied by two to account for the two sites for deiodination), and the duration of the assay (24Rosenberg I.N. Goswami A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An additional factor of 1.3 included in the original calculations (24Rosenberg I.N. Goswami A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was not included in our analysis since it is redundant when determining the fractional iodide released. One unit of enzyme has been defined historically as the amount necessary to catalyze release of 10 nmol of iodide per h (24Rosenberg I.N. Goswami A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Native Gel Electrophoresis and Subsequent Analysis for Catalytic Activity and Protein Composition—Native gel electrophoresis was performed using a Mini Protean 3 electrophoresis system and precast Ready Gels containing an acrylamide gradient of 8-16% (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were diluted with an equal volume of buffer (0.12 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) before loading, and gels were run at 150 V (4 °C) using pre-chilled electrode buffer containing 0.025 m Tris (pH 8.3) and 0.19 m glycine for 70 min. A vertical strip of gel (2.5 × 7.5 cm) was excised and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. This strip in turn guided fractionation of a second strip (2.5 × 7.5 cm) into 6 pieces (1 × 2.5, 1.5 × 2.5, 0.5 × 2.5, 1 × 2.5, 2 × 2.5, 1.5 × 2.5 cm). Each piece was then added to a standard activity assay for detecting the presence of IYD. The remaining 2 × 7.5-cm strip was soaked in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.35 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue for 15 min. A 12% denaturing gel was cast with dimensions of 8 cm (length) × 1.5 mm (width) × 8.5 cm (height). A 5% stacking gel was then cast using a comb containing a single well (2 × 7.5 cm). The gel piece from the native gel was placed directly in this well, and electrophoresis was performed (150 V) for 1 h. Proteins were then visualized by silver staining.Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay—The presence of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was detected by its catalytic activity as described previously (27Novoa W.B. Winer A.D. Glaid A.J. Schwert G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1143-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pesce A. Fondy T.P. Stolzenbach F. Castillo F. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2151-2167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Sequencing—Fragments of the denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing protein were sequenced by the Molecular Structure Facility at the University of California, Davis, CA. Samples were digested in situ by trypsin. The resulting peptides were then separated by high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced by either tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) or Edman degradation.Subcloning of Mus musculus IYD—The IYD gene (I.M.A.G.E. clone 5064638 from ATCC) was amplified by PCR using oligodeoxynucleotide primers 5′-AAGCTTAAGCTTCGATCCGCCACCATGTTTCTCCTCACCCCA-3′ and 5′-GCCGCGGCGGCCGCCTATACTGTCACCATGAT-3′ to generate blunt-ended DNA with BamHI and NotI restriction sites at its termini. The PCR product and (+)-pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen) were digested with BamHI and NotI, and the vector was dephosphorylated with Antarctic alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs). The insert and vector were then ligated using T4 DNA ligase and transformed into One Shot TOP10 cells (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was isolated from ampicillin-resistant colonies using a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) and characterized by digestion with EcoRI, PstI, or StyI. Plasmids exhibiting the expected digestion pattern after gel electrophoresis (1% agarose, 125 V, 30 min) were sent for DNA sequencing (Gene Gateway).Expression of M. musculus IYD in HEK293—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Invitrogen). The plasmid containing IYD (12 μg) was mixed with 30 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and then added to cells (∼90% confluent) in 10-cm dishes. After 6 h, the media were exchanged to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and harvested into the same solution. After centrifugation (300 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C, the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) supplemented with 0.25 m sucrose and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were lysed by 3 cycles of freezing (liquid N2) and thawing (37 °C) followed by 3 passages through a 20-gauge needle. The lysate was used in IYD assays without further purification. Catalytic constants for IYD were determined by plotting the initial rate of iodide release versus DIT concentration, and the resulting data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation with Origin 7.0 (Microcal).Homology Model of Iodotyrosine Deiodinase Structure—The three-dimensional model of mouse IYD was calculated using the crystal structure coordinate set of the minor oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase of Escherichia coli (PDB code 1ICR). All steps of homology model building were performed by the program MODWEB, available at alto.comp-bio.ucsf.edu/modweb-cgi/submit/form.cgi (29Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10384) Google Scholar, 30Sali A. Blundell T.L. Bohr H. Brunak S. Protein Structure by Distance Analysis. IOS Press, Amsterdam1994: 64-84Google Scholar). The IYD sequence was submitted to the fully automated server using default values. The output contained the three-dimensional model including all nonhydrogen main-chain and side-chain atoms. The model was used without further refinement. The predicted homology model of IYD was evaluated by the Structure Analysis and Verification Server at nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVS (31Laskowski R.A. Mc Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Richelle J. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar).RESULTSExtraction of IYD from Porcine Microsomes Using Detergents—Previous isolation of native IYD from calf thyroid microsomes began with solubilization by cholate, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and ion exchange chromatography (36Rosenberg I.N. Goswami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12318-12325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent solubilization was not successful in our laboratory when applied to porcine thyroid microsomes. IYD lost activity when treated with cholate or deoxycholate. Consequently, a series of alternative detergents representative of zwitterionic bile salts, polyoxyethylene derivatives, and alkyl glucosides was tested for an ability to (i) solubilize IYD preferentially, (ii) maintain its catalytic activity, and (iii) support chromatographic purification. CHAPS (0.1%) was capable of extracting 30% of IYD from the microsomes, as detected by deiodinase activity. This activity persisted for at least 1 week of storage at 4 °C, but use of higher concentrations of CHAPS (0.5-3.0%) led to enzyme inactivation.Equivalent evaluation of Triton X-100 was not pursued despite its ability to stabilize and solubilize IYD (21Kunishima M. Friedman J.E. Rokita S.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4722-4723Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Preliminary attempts to separate the Triton-solubilized enzyme with various ion exchange resins indicated that IYD was associated with heterogeneous aggregates of protein. Tween 20 and Igepal also efficiently solubilized IYD, and Igepal maintained activity without loss for more than 1 week (4 °C). Fractionation of Igepal-solubilized IYD using Q fast flow anion exchange, hydroxyapatite, phenyl-Sepharose, and various dye columns provided modest increases in specific activity, but protein aggregation still limited isolation of homogeneous enzyme. Finally, alkyl glucosides such as octyl glucoside and its thiol analog seemed promising due to their ability to extract IYD in high yields (90%) from microsomes while retaining specific activities close to the other detergents. Enzyme stability under these conditions could not be maintained after even a single anion exchange column.Purification of a Trypsin-solubilized Fragment of IYD—A previous approach to purifying IYD was based on initial solubilization with steapsin, a crude pancreatic preparation of lipases that may have also contained proteases (36Rosenberg I.N.

Because the catalytic activity of IYD survived such treatment, a more formal investigation of proteases was conducted to test whether a soluble and active domain of IYD could be released from microsomes. Limited exposure to trypsin (0.1 mg of trypsin/mg of microsomal protein) successfully solubilized more than 70% of the IYD activity and only 16% of the total protein. The soluble fraction was then subjected to various chromatographic procedures.Large scale digestion of microsomes containing IYD was not as efficient as the small scale digestion, but this treatment still provided sufficient material for enzyme purification. Proteolyzed samples were first fractionated by Q fast flow anion exchange (Table 1). Further purification was achieved using Cibacron blue and phenyl-Sepharose columns. Cibacron blue was chosen for its ability to bind enzymes that utilize cofactors such as NADH (37Mohammad J. Zeerak A. Hjerten S. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1995; 9: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, IYD likely bound to this column in an adventitious manner since neither NADH (1 mm) nor ATP (10 mm) could elute IYD from this dye column. Similarly, binding was not based on interactions with the active site because a competitive and tight binding inhibitor of IYD, 3,5-dinitrotyrosine (1 mm) (38Green W.L. Endocrinology. 1968; 83: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), also did not elute the enzyme. Although the phenyl-Sepharose provided only a small increase in purity of IYD, this procedure was successful in diminishing the sample heterogeneity as shown by the decrease in low level smear of proteins distributed throughout a polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1). The major protein isolated from these sequential procedures had an estimated molecular mass of ∼30 kDa and was 70% pure by scanning densitometry. This protein did not stain using a GelCode glycoprotein staining kit and, thus is not likely glycosylated in vivo.TABLE 1Purification of IYD from porcine thyroidsSampleTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activity-Fold purificationUnits (nmol/h)mgunits/mgMicrosomal suspensionaTypical values obtained from 3 lbs of porcine thyroids.12,6002,0306.2Trypsin supernatant10,400960111.8QFF anion exchange8,460959215Cibacron blue7,4604.21,800290Phenyl-Sepharose1,9200.623,100500a Typical values obtained from 3 lbs of porcine thyroids.

Hox genes encode transcription factors, which are supposed to control the expression of a series of downstream target genes, whose nature has remained largely elusive. Several genes were identified that are differentially expressed in relation to Hox gene activity; few studies, however, explored their direct regulation by Hox proteins. Ephrin tyrosine kinase receptors and ephrins have been proposed as Hox targets, and recently, evidence was gained for their role in limb development. The expression of the EphA7 gene in developing limbs was shown to correlate with the expression of Hoxa13 and Hoxd13; however, its direct regulation by these genes has never been assessed. We have characterized the EphA7 promoter region and show that it contains multiple binding sites for paralog group 13 Hox proteins. We found that one of these sites is bound in vivo by HOXA13 and HOXD13 and by endogenous Hoxd13 in developing mouse limbs. Moreover, we show that HOXD13 and HOXA13 activate transcription from the EphA7 promoter and that a mutation of the HOXA13/HOXD13 binding site was sufficient to abolish activation. Conversely, the HOXD13(147L) mutation, identified in patients displaying a novel brachydactyly-polydactyly syndrome, does not bind to in vivo, and fails to transactivate the EphA7 promoter. These results establish that EphA7 is a direct downstream target of Hoxd13 and Hoxa13 during limb development, thus providing further insight into the regulatory networks that control limb patterning.

Transcription factors belonging to the HOX family of homeodomain-containing proteins control cell fates and regional identities along the primary body and limb axes (1Favier B. Dolle P. Mol. Hum.

Hox genes that are related to the Drosophila Abd-B gene and are located at the 5′-end of the Hoxa and Hoxd clusters (paralogous groups 9–13) display regionally restricted expression patterns in the developing limbs (3Duboule D.

Targeted mutagenesis and overexpression of Abd-B-related Hoxa and Hoxd genes showed that their function in limb development is to control the size, shape, and number of specific bones by regulating processes such as mesenchymal cell aggregation, chondrification, and ossification (6Yokouchi Y.

The genetic pathways in which they act, however, are still poorly characterized. In particular, the identity of their downstream effector genes remains still elusive (10Graba Y. Aragnol D. Pradel J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, whereas HOX proteins have been shown to bind specific DNA sequences and are supposed to regulate overlapping sets of target genes, only a few of them have been isolated. Target genes for HOX proteins have been identified using various approaches, including microarray hybridization screenings and candidate gene analysis (11Lei H. Wang H. Juan A.H. Ruddle F. Proc.

Eph and ephrins are expressed in various regions of the vertebrate embryo in dynamic patterns, and they were found to play crucial roles in the control of cell shape, cell migration, cell sorting, wiring of neurons in the nervous system, and the formation of boundaries between structures (reviewed in Refs. 20Palmer A. Klein R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1429-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and 21Poliakov A. Cotrina M. Wilkinson D.G. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 465-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Recently, experimental evidence has been gained for a role of Eph-ephrin signaling in limb development. Overexpression in developing chick limbs of ephrin A2 has been shown to disrupt limb cartilage morphogenesis causing digit bifurcations and syndactyly (22Wada N. Tanaka H. Ide H. Nohno T. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, heterozygous ephrin B1 null female mice have been reported to display preaxial polydactyly and syndactyly (23Compagni A. Logan M. Klein R. Adams R.H. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 217-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Finally, the EphA7 gene, which is expressed at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) in the perichondrium of the mesenchymal condensations of the phalanges, was shown to be significantly down-regulated in the forelimbs of Hoxa13–/– mice. Its expression, however, was not completely absent, suggesting that the transcription of this ephrin receptor gene might be under the control of more than one paralogous group 13 Hox protein (19Stadler H.S. Higgins K.M. Capecchi M.R. Development. 2001; 128: 4177-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we could show that the misexpression of Hoxd13 by retroviral infection of developing chick limbs leads to a marked increase of EphA7 expression in the phalangeal mesenchymal condensations, indicating that Hoxd13 might regulate EphA7 transcription as well. Interestingly, in the same set of experiments, we found that the misexpression of a mutant HOXD13 protein, HOXD13(I47L), did not result in an increase of EphA7 expression (24Caronia G. Goodman F.R. McKeown C.M. Scambler P.J. Zappavigna V. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The HOXD13(I47L) mutation, identified in patients showing a novel brachydactyly-polydactyly syndrome, represents a single amino acid substitution, involving residue 47 of the homeodomain that is located within the recognition helix. This substitution was found to alter rather than abolish DNA binding, since it selectively impaired the ability of HOXD13 to recognize one of its two different classes of consensus binding sequences (24Caronia G. Goodman F.R. McKeown C.M. Scambler P.J. Zappavigna V. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to speculate that the I47L mutation, via a reduction of the repertoire of potential sites recognized by the HOXD13 protein, would cause a partial or complete failure to regulate a subset of the genes normally controlled by HOXD13. Since EphA7 turned out to be one of these genes, we decided to further investigate its regulation by HOXD13. In particular, we wanted to ascertain whether EphA7 is indeed a direct target of HOXD13 and/or HOXA13 and whether the nature of the regulatory sequences mediating HOXD13 regulation would explain the lack of control by the mutated HOXD13(I47L) protein.In this report, we show that the EphA7 promoter region contains multiple potential binding sites for HOX paralog group 13 proteins. We found, however, that only one of these sites is bound in vivo by the HOXA13 and HOXD13 proteins. A mutation of this evolutionarily conserved site was sufficient to abolish the transcriptional activation of the EphA7 promoter by HOXA13 and HOXD13. We moreover found that this EphA7 Hox group 13 site is not bound by the HOXD13(I47L) mutated protein both in vivo and in vitro, thus providing a molecular basis for the lack of up-regulation of EphA7 expression by HOXD13(I47L) in developing limbs. Our results thus establish that EphA7 is a direct downstream target of the Hoxd13 and Hoxa13 proteins during limb development, providing additional evidence that Hox gene products directly control the aggregation properties of limb mesenchymal cells by regulating the ephrin receptorephrin signaling system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—The EphA7–497 and –2000 bp promoter sequences were obtained by PCR amplification from genomic NIH-3T3 DNA using the following primers: EphA7(–497) for, 5′-GTTATCCGACCTGCTGAGGCTGCTAAC-3′; EphA7(–2000) for, 5′-GTGGCAATCTAGGATGTTGAGACCTCA-3′; EphA7rev, 5′-GCTGCCTGCAAGTCTCCGACTGC-3′. Amplified fragments were verified by sequencing, digested with XhoI and HindIII, and cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pXP-luciferase vector. A 552-bp fragment was PCR-amplified from the cloned template to generate a reporter construct (EphA7–497m), carrying a mutation in HOXD13 binding site 3, by using a reverse mutated primer, EphA7revm (5′-CGACTGCAGACCGGCCGCTTGCTCCACACACTCCACGCCTATCAATTAG-3′). The retroviral construct expressing HOXD13 was generated cloning a HOXD13 Klenow-filled XhoI-HindIII cDNA fragment in frame with the HA tag into the Klenow-filled EcoRI site of the LXIΔN retroviral vector. The pSGHA-HOXA13 expression construct was generated by cloning a Klenow-filled HindIII cDNA fragment into the Klenow-filled EcoRI site of the pSG5 expression vector (Stratagene). The expression vectors for HA-HOXD13, HA-HOXD13(I47L), and the GST-homeodomain fusion proteins (HOXD13HD and HOXD13(I47L)HD) were generated as described previously (24Caronia G. Goodman F.R. McKeown C.M. Scambler P.J. Zappavigna V. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The GST-HOXD13HD and GST-HOXD13(I47L)HD fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli, purified according to established methods, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The purified proteins were diluted in 13 μl of δ-buffer (20% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and preincubated with 100 ng poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 20 μl of 1× binding buffer (0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm spermidine, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min on ice. 32P-Labeled fragments containing a consensus binding site for HOXD13 or the EphA7 HOXD13 binding site 3 were obtained by annealing of the following oligonucleotides: HOXBSA/B (24Caronia G. Goodman F.R. McKeown C.M. Scambler P.J. Zappavigna V. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); EphA7BSA, 5′-TCGACCCTAATTGATATTATTGGAGTGTGGAGCAC-3′; EphA7BSB, 5′-TCGCGTGCTCCACACTCCAATATCAATTAGGG-3′.30,000 cpm of the labeled probes were added to the samples and incubated for 30 min on ice. Reactions were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% TBE, dried, and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-OmatR film at –80 °C.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Transduction—NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and C3H10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Celbio) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Celbio), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections in NIH3T3 cells were carried out by CaPO4 precipitation (25Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 12 μg of reporter plasmid, 2.5–5.0 μg of expression construct, and 0.1 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase (Clontech) as internal control were used per 6-cm dish. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed, lysed, and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase expression (26Zappavigna V. Sartori D. Mavilio F. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Each transfection was done in duplicate in the same experiment, and the plotted luciferase activities represent the average of 3–6 different experiments. To transiently express HA-HOXD13, HA-HOXA13, or HA-HOXD13(I47L) in NIH3T3 cells, we transfected 5 μg of the corresponding expression vector per 10-cm dish. To transduce C3H10T1/2 cells, viral stocks of the LXIΔN and LHOXD13IΔN retroviral expression constructs were produced by transient transfection of Eco-Phoenix cells as described previously (27Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The viral supernatant was added to a subconfluent culture of C3H10 T1/2 cells in the presence of 0.8 μg/ml Polybrene; incubation was performed twice, initially for 6 h and then overnight. Cells were washed, and medium was replaced. HOXD13 transient expression in NIH3T3 and stable expression in C3H10T1/2 were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. An antibody against the NFY-B nuclear transcription factor (kind gift of C. Imbriano) was used as a loading control. Immunostained bands were detected with a chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences).Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—Formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described in Ref. 28Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods (San Diego). 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, with the following modifications: NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 cells were fixed for 15 min with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature, and the reaction was quenched with 0.125 m glycine in 1× PBS for 5 min. The cross-linked material was sonicated 15 × 25 s to obtain 500–1000-bp fragments, and the immunoprecipitations were performed with 10 μl of protein G-agarose (KPL), blocked twice with 1 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, first for 2 h and then overnight. The chromatin was precleared by adding 20 μl of protein G-agarose for 2 h and incubated with 5 μg of anti-HA polyclonal antibody (sc-7392; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or 5 μg of a purified rabbit polyclonal anti-HOXD13 antibody or with 5 μg of anti-FLAG (F3165; Sigma) or anti-GAL4 antibody (sc-577; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a control. The incubation was performed overnight at 4 °C. Chromatin immunoprecipitation on E13.5 mouse limbs and brain was performed according to the protocol of the P. Farnham laboratory (genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/farnham/farnham), with the following modifications. To disaggregate tissues, the samples were homogenized 20 times with a Dounce B homogenizer and then freezed-thawed 20 times before sonicating 60 × 30 s; the immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above. PCR amplifications were performed using the following primers: EphA7S1for, 5′-CTTTGTGTAATCCGAGCACTAC-3′; EphA7S1rev, 5′-TGCATCTTTACGACACGGTA-3′; EphA7S2for, 5′-GTCCGAGGTTGAACTTTTTGTCCA-3′; EphA7S2rev, 5′-CCACTTGAATTCACCCAATCCTAGC-3′; EphA7S3for, 5′-GCAACCGACTCCGCTCGGC-3′; EphA7rev, 5′-GCTGCCTGCAAGTCTCCGACTGC-3′; EphA7S4/5for, 5′-TCGGAGACTTGCAGGCAGCAA-3′; EphA7S4/5rev, 5′-CAACCATGGTGCATGAGCAGGT-3′; EphA7Cfor, 5′-GGAAGTACCATGCTTGAAAGTGA-3′; EphA7Crev, 5′-TCTGGATCCTTCTCATTCTCTGGA-3′.RT-PCR Analysis—RNA from NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 cells was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Synthesis of cDNA was done starting from 3 μg of RNA using the SSII reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative PCR was performed with the following oligonucleotides: EphA7RTfor, 5′-TCTACACCACGACTGGTGGAAAAA-3′; EphA7RTrev, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTTGGGTTTCGAATCATTTTGTCT-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control RT-PCR was done using standard oligonucleotides.RESULTSThe 5′ Region of the Mouse EphA7 Gene Contains Several Potential Binding Sites for the HOXD13 Protein—To identify possible HOXD13-dependent regulatory elements within the transcriptional control regions of the EphA7 gene, we analyzed genomic sequences upstream to the putative transcription start site of the EphA7 gene. An interspecies comparison using the UCSC Genome Browser (29Kent W.J. Sugnet C.W. Furey T.S. Roskin K.M. Pringle T.H. Zahler A.M. Haussler D. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (6541) Google Scholar) was made, with the idea that sequence conservation might highlight relevant regulatory regions. We found that at distances greater than 5 kb 5′ to the putative transcription start site of EphA7, the degree of sequence conservation drops significantly, whereas the highest degree of interspecies similarity is found within a region of ∼2 kb upstream of the start site (Fig. 1A), suggesting that regulatory elements crucial for EphA7 expression might be confined to this region. The MatInspector software (30Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender H. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar, 31Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar) was subsequently employed to scan the 5 kb upstream region of EphA7 for possible HOXD13 binding sites. We previously showed, through optimal DNA binding site selection experiments, that the HOXD13 protein has an equal preference for two types of sites, one having TTAT and the other having TTAC as core consensus sequence (24Caronia G. Goodman F.R. McKeown C.M. Scambler P.J. Zappavigna V. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on our previous results, a binding site matrix was generated, using the MatInd program (30Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender H. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). We identified five putative HOXD13 binding sites within the 5′ region of the EphA7 gene having a matrix similarity of 1.0 (Fig. 1A). Four of them have TTAT as a core consensus sequence, and one has TTAC. Moreover, four of the identified sites are located within the proximal region of the promoter (sites 2–5; Fig. 1A), and three of these (sites 3–5) are located downstream from the putative transcription start site (Fig. 1, A and B). A sequence alignment of these putative HOXD13 DNA binding sites with the corresponding available genomic sequences from different species revealed that of the five sites identified within the mouse genome, only site 3 displays a high degree of conservation (Fig. 1A, bottom part). These results indicated that the sequences upstream to and in the vicinity of the presumed transcription start site of EphA7 contain several putative HOXD13 binding sites that match the optimal consensus binding sequence determined in vitro, suggesting that Hoxd13 and possibly also Hoxa13 may directly associate with these sites to regulate EphA7 expression.The EphA7 Promoter Is Bound in Vivo by HOXD13—We then set out to verify which of the putative sites was actually bound in vivo by HOXD13. For this purpose, we exogenously expressed a HA-tagged HOXD13 protein both stably and transiently in two different mouse cell lines of mesenchymal derivation, C3H10T1/2 and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. In C3H10T1/2 cells, stable expression was achieved by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer (Fig. 2A, left), whereas transient expression in NIH3T3 cells was obtained using a plasmid expression vector (Fig. 2A, right). We found that the exogenous expression of HOXD13 could efficiently activate transcription of the endogenous EphA7 gene both in C3H10T1/2 and in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that the expressed HOXD13 protein is functional and that the chosen cell backgrounds are permissive for activation of EphA7 transcription by HOXD13 and therefore represent suitable models for studying the interactions of HOXD13 with the EphA7 promoter in vivo.FIGURE 2The exogenous expression of HOXD13 up-regulates EphA7 transcription in NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 cells. The HA-tagged HOXD13 protein was exogenously expressed both stably and transiently, in C3H10T1/2 and NIH3T3 fibroblasts, respectively. In C3H10T1/2 cells, stable expression was achieved by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, and transient expression in NIH3T3 cells was obtained using a plasmid expression vector. A, Western blots showing the expression of HOXD13 in nuclear extracts from NIH3T3 cells or C3H10T1/2 cells, transfected with HOXD13 expression vectors (3T3-D13; T1/2-D13), or from control cell lines (3T3; T1/2). C, control Phoenix packaging cell line expressing HOXD13; RRL, in vitro transcribed/translated HOXD13 using rabbit reticulocite lysates; NFY-B, an antibody against the NFY-B nuclear transcription factor was used as a loading control.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Cross-linked and sonicated chromatin from HA-HOXD13-expressing C3H10T1/2 cells was immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody (αHA) and was analyzed by PCR for the presence of the five putative HOXD13 binding sites. In addition, as a control, we tested for the presence of a region of 263 bp located at –6000 bp (control site; Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, the immunoprecipitated chromatin showed a substantial enrichment only of the sequence including site 3, indicating that only site 3 was efficiently bound in vivo by HOXD13. No enrichment was detected for the remaining sites, as well as for the control site (Fig. 3B). Thus, of the five sites matching the optimal DNA-binding consensus sequence of HOXD13, which could hence all be potentially bound by HOXD13, only site 3 turned out to be actually contacted in vivo by HOXD13.FIGURE 3HOXD13 binds in vivo to the EphA7 promoter. A, schematic representation of the EphA7 promoter showing the position of the identified putative HOXD13 binding sites. The arrows indicate the primers used in ChIP assays to PCR-amplify genomic regions containing the HOXD13 binding sites or a control region (C site). B, ChIP on C3H10T1/2 cells expressing HOXD13 using αHA antibodies. The enrichment was analyzed by PCR using oligonucleotides that amplify genomic regions of 174 bp (site 1), 297 bp (site 2), 245 bp (site 3), or 221 bp (site 4/5) within the mouse EphA7 promoter. No enrichment of the genomic regions containing sites 1, 2, and 4/5 or of the control site was detected even after 41 cycles of amplification. PCRs were performed in triplicate; a representative set is shown. C, ChIP on pooled fore and hind limbs or on brain tissue, dissected from E13.5 mouse embryos, using an anti-Hoxd13 (αHoxd13) antiserum. PCRs were performed in triplicate; representative experiments are shown. No enrichment was observed with immunoprecipitated brain chromatin even after 42 cycles of amplification, as well as no enrichment was detected for the control site (C site). I, input chromatin; CA, non-specific control antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then wanted to test whether also endogenous Hoxd13 is bound in vivo, in the developing limb, to site 3 of the EphA7 promoter. To this end, chromatin was prepared from E13.5 mouse fore and hind limbs and immunoprecipitated using a αHoxd13 antibody. As a control, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using chromatin extracted from E13.5 mouse brain, a tissue that does not express Hoxd13 (33Dolle P. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Boncinelli E. Duboule D. Mech. Dev. 1991; 36: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated limb chromatin showed a significant enrichment of the fragment containing site 3 (Fig. 3C). No enrichment of the site 3-containing sequence was observed in the control brain chromatin (Fig. 3C), as well as no enrichment of the control sequence (C site; Fig. 3C) was detected. Thus, these data confirm that site 3 is bound in vivo during mouse limb development at a stage when both Hoxd13 and EphA7 are coexpressed in the perichondrium of the digit condensations.The HOXD13(I47L)-mutated Protein Does Not Bind to the EphA7 Promoter—We previously reported that the HOXD13(I47L) mutation, identified in patients showing a novel brachydactyly-polydactyly syndrome, caused a selective impairment of the DNA binding potential of HOXD13 (24Caronia G. Goodman F.R. McKeown C.M. Scambler P.J. Zappavigna V. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1701-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Indeed, the HOXD13(I47L) mutant protein, unlike its wild type counterpart, proved to be unable to up-regulate the expression of the endogenous EphA7 gene, if overexpressed in developing chick limbs, suggesting that it is unable to bind to the EphA7 promoter. To test this assumption, we verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation whether HOXD13(I47L) was able to bind site 3 of the EphA7 promoter in vivo. HA-HOXD13, HA-HOXA13, or HA-HOXD13(I47L) was transiently expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and their chromatin was tested by immunoprecipitation using an αHA antibody. As in the case of HA-HOXD13-expressing C3H10T1/2 cells, the immunoprecipitated chromatin from NIH3T3 cells expressing HA-HOXD13, showed a significant enrichment only of the sequence containing site 3 (Fig. 4A; data not shown), indicating that also in this cell background only site 3 of the EphA7 promoter was occupied in vivo by HOXD13. Similarly, HOXA13, which was previously reported to be a candidate"

Although there are numerous reports describing loss of function after treatment of proteins with peroxynitrite, we recently demonstrated that the microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 is activated rather than inactivated by peroxynitrite and suggested that this could be attributed to nitration of tyrosine residues rather than to other effects of peroxynitrite. In this report, the nitrated tyrosine residues of peroxynitrite-treated microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 were characterized by mass spectrometry and their functional significance determined. Of the seven tyrosine residues present in the protein, only those at positions 92 and 153 were nitrated after treatment with peroxynitrite. Three mutants (Y92F, Y153F, and Y92F, Y153F) were created using site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in LLC-PK1 cells. Treatment of the microsomal fractions of these cells with peroxynitrite resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in enzyme activity in cells expressing the wild type microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 or the Y153F mutant, whereas the enzyme activity of Y92F and double site mutant was unaffected. These results indicate that activation of microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 by peroxynitrite is mediated by nitration of tyrosine residue 92 and represents one of the few examples in which a gain in function has been associated with nitration of a specific tyrosine residue.

Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hutchinson A. Persson B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although these proteins share common structural characteristics, their biological functions are quite varied, including roles in xenobiotic metabolism, cellular protection, pain, and inflammation. Human membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism includes six proteins: 5-lipooxygenase-activating protein, leukotriene-C4 synthase, MGST1, MGST2, MGST3, and microsomal prostaglandin-E synthase. Rat hepatic MGST1 exists as a homotrimer of identical 17.3-kDa subunits and has a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity (83%) to human MGST1. In contrast to the cytosolic GSTs, an important characteristic of microsomal GST1 is that the enzyme can be activated by various treatments, including limited proteolysis, heating, radiation, and exposure to sulfhydryl modifying reagents and reactive oxygen species. In addition, since MGST1 possesses glutathione peroxidase activity, it has been suggested that this enzyme may play a protective role under conditions of oxidative stress (2Mosialou E. Morgenstern R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Activation of MGST1 also occurs after exposure to reactive nitrogen species (RNS), including nitric oxide (NO) donors and peroxynitrite (ONOO–) (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Ji Y. Toader V. Bennett B.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in contrast to the cytosolic GSTs, which are inhibited by RNS (5Wong P.S.-Y. Eiserich J.P. Reddy S. Lopez C.L. Cross C.E. Vliet A.V.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ONOO–-induced activation of MGST1 was associated with tyrosine nitration, polymer formation, and protein fragmentation but not protein S-oxidation (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This increase in enzyme activity by ONOO– is unusual, since tyrosine nitration of proteins is almost always associated with a loss of function. For example, a number of enzymes involved in protection against oxidative stress are inhibited by ONOO–, including superoxide dismutases (6Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tasi M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar), glutathione reductase (7Francescutti D. Baldwin J. Lee L. Mutus B.

The activation of MGST1 by RNS, together with its GSH peroxidase activity, suggest that this enzyme may play an important role in limiting the extent of oxidative tissue injury under pathophysiological conditions of excessive ONOO– formation, especially if other antioxidant defense mechanisms are compromised. The tyrosine residues of MGST1 that are nitrated by ONOO– have not been identified. In the present study, we used two mass spectrometric techniques, MALDI-TOF MS and ESI-MS/MS, to identify the tyrosine residues of purified rat hepatic MGST1 that are nitrated after ONOO– treatment. Subsequently, we determined the functional consequences resulting from nitration of these tyrosine residues using site-directed mutagenesis. Materials—Hydroxyapatite, CM-Sepharose, GSH, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, Triton X-100, manganese (IV) dioxide, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and nutrient mixture F-12 were purchased from Sigma. Sequence-grade modified trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI). Monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody was from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI) and horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Bio-Rad (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Chemiluminescence reagents were from Kirkegaard and Perry (Gaithersburg, MA). All other chemicals were of reagent grade and were obtained from common commercial sources. Enzyme Purification and Enzyme Activity Assay—Rat hepatic MGST1 was purified from male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) by hydroxyapatite and CM-Sepharose chromatography as described (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels under reducing conditions. The protein migrated as a single band at about 17 kDa (4Ji Y. Toader V. Bennett B.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Prior to experiments, GSH was removed from the preparation by dialysis against buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol using a System 500 Microdialyzer (Pierce). Enzyme activity was determined by the spectrophotometric method of Habig et al. (11Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jacoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (1.0 ml) contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm GSH, and 1.0 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene at 25 °C. Preparation of Peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and Treatment of MGST1—ONOO– was synthesized from acidified nitrite and H2O2 as described (12Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Prior to each experiment, excess H2O2 in ONOO– solutions was removed by MnO2 chromatography (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme (20 μg/ml) or microsomal fractions (200–400 μg/ml protein) in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), were exposed to the indicated concentrations of ONOO– at room temperature for 10 s. To keep the pH value of the reaction unchanged, ONOO– was added to the protein or microsomal solution as a small volume during vigorous mixing, and the reaction was terminated by dilution of the sample into the assay buffer for the determination of enzyme activity or into the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis, samples treated with ONOO– were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel under non-reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with a 3-nitrotyrosine-specific antibody. The immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Identification of Nitration Sites by MALDI-TOF MS—Protein bands corresponding to the MGST1 monomer (17.3 kDa) with and without ONOO– treatment were excised from Coomassie Blue-stained, 15% reducing SDS-PAGE gels (approximately 2 μg of purified protein/band). Gel slices were washed three times with 50% ACN, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 (15 min each time under gentle agitation) to remove the Coomassie Blue and were then incubated with 100% ACN for 5 min and vacuum-dried. To reduce and alkylate proteins, dried gel slices were incubated with 10 mm DTT in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 55 °C for 45 min followed by incubation with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Gel slices were then washed with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and dried with 100% ACN as described above. In-gel digestion was performed by swelling the dried gel slices with 10 μg/ml trypsin in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, for 30 min on ice. Excess trypsin solution was removed and digestion continued at 37 °C for 16 h. Tryptic peptides were extracted with 50% ACN/5% trifluoroacetic acid, dried under vacuum, and reconstituted in 3 μl of 70% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Reconstituted extract (0.5 μl) was mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid in 70% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), spotted onto a stainless steel 100-well MS plate, and air dried. Samples were analyzed using a Voyager DE-Pro MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated in the delayed extraction/reflector mode with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, grid voltage setting of 72%, and a 50-ns delay. Three spectra (100 laser shots/spectrum) were obtained for each sample. External calibration was performed using a Sequazyme Peptide Mass Standard kit (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) containing the following standards: des-Arg-bradykinin, angiotensin-1, and Glu-fibrinopeptide B. Peptide mass fingerprinting was conducted with the data base search tool MS-Fit using Protein Prospector (version 3.2.1), available at prospector.ucsf.edu/. The modifications due to nitration were included in the search for both control and ONOO––treated samples. The criteria for identification of the protein by MALDI-TOF MS were: a match of at least four peptides from the protein compared with the data base of rat proteins with similar to observed molecular mass and with an error of less than 50 ppm for all peptides, including modified ones. Analysis of Trypsin Cleavage Products by ESI-MS/MS—Samples were analyzed with a ESI/MS/MS system composed of Waters Capillary LC (Waters Corp., Milford, MA,) coupled to a Finnigan LCQ Deca iontrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray ionization source. Separation was performed using a picofrit column (PFC7515-PP18–5-3PK), New Objective, Woburn, MA) with a 75 μm inner diameter and a 15 μm tip. The stationary phase was 5 μm ProteoPep C18 matrix packed in a column of 5 cm length. The mobile phase was ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Separation of peptides was achieved using a gradient of ACN from 5 to 65% in 45 min, followed by a wash with 95% ACN. MS/MS spectra were analyzed using SEQUEST® (ThermoFinnigan) software. For the ESI-LC MS/MS spectra, a correlation score above 2 was considered significant for peptides with a charge of 2 to accept the deduced sequence, whereas the sequence of peptides with a lower score was deduced manually. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmid (pCMV5) containing rat liver MGST1 cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Ralf Morgenstern (Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). The plasmid was digested with EcoRI (Promega), and the MGST1 cDNA was inserted into pcDNA3.1(–). All mutations were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pcDNA3.1-MGST1 was used as template for generating mutants Y92F and Y153F, and subsequently pcDNA3.1-MGST (Y153F) was used as the template for generation of double mutants (Y92F and Y153F). Oligonucleotides bearing mismatched bases at the residues to be mutated (underlined) were synthesized by ACGT Corp. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) as follows: Y92F (5′-C GGC CTC CTG TAC TCC CTG AGC GG-3′) and Y153F (5′-G CTC AGG AGC AGA CTG TAC TTG TAA AGA GAT TTG TGA CC-3′). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Gene Transfection—LLC-PK1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient transfections, LLC-PK1 cells were seeded in 150-mm cell culture plates, and the expression plasmids were introduced using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24-h incubation with the transfection reagents, cells were harvested, lysed by sonication in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and microsomal fractions (100,000 × g pellet) prepared by ultracentrifugation. MGST1 activity in both ONOO–-treated and non-treated microsomal fractions was assessed as described above. MGST1 activity determinations were performed in triplicate, and data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed by the appropriate statistical test, as indicated. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Tyrosine Nitration and Activation of MGST1 by ONOO–—Exposure of purified MGST1 to 2.0 mm ONOO– resulted in a 4.3-fold increase in enzyme activity (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). However, decayed ONOO– or 2.0 mm H2O2 did not affect enzyme activity (Fig. 1). The presence of 3-nitrotyrosine in the activated protein was demonstrated using SDS-PAGE (under non-reducing conditions) and immunoblot analysis employing a monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. Immunoreactive staining of the 17.3-kDa MGST1 monomer increased in intensity after exposure to increasing concentration of ONOO– (Fig. 2). In addition, there was staining evident in proteins bands of about 34 and 50 kDa, as observed previously (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating the formation of tyrosine-nitrated dimers and trimers.FIGURE 2Nitration of purified MGST1 by ONOO–. Purified MGST1 (20 μg/ml) was exposed to the indicated concentrations of ONOO– in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm DTPA, at room temperature for 10 s. Nitration of MGST1 was detected by SDS-PAGE (15% gel) and immunoblot analysis using anti 3-nitrotyrosine antibody (upper panel). There were three predominant bands with approximate molecular weights 17, 35, and 50 kDa, corresponding to the MGST1 monomer, dimer, and trimer, respectively (as labeled). The membrane was stripped and stained with Amido Black to confirm equal loading of MGST1 (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of Sites of Tyrosine Nitration in MGST1—Peroxynitrite-treated and non-treated MGST1 were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and the monomeric MGST1 (17.3 kDa) underwent in-gel digestion with trypsin. Peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF MS confirmed the identification of the 17.3-kDa band as rat MGST1 (SwissProt accession number P08011, Mr 17,472, pI 9.6) (∼57% protein coverage for both control (non-treated) and ONOO–-treated samples). There are 7 tyrosine residues in MGST1 (Table 1). Tryptic peptides containing these tyrosine residues were observed by either MALDI-TOF MS and/or ESI-MS/MS with the exception of the tryptic peptide containing Tyr18. Most likely this was not observed due to poor ionization of the peptide fragment containing Tyr18. Based on the sequence of MGST1, digestion using either Asp-N or Glu-C would not have been predicted to produce shorter peptides containing Tyr18. Digestion with thermolysine produced a large number of very short peptides not suitable for identification by MALDI-TOF MS.TABLE 1Result of mass spectrometric characterization of ONOO–-treated versus non-treated MGST1MALDI-TOF MS fragment massModified Tyr residueControl/ONOO-Control/ONOOm/zTyr18aa 4-25NDNDTyr92aa 74-107ND3705.9/3750.1Tyr115 and Tyr120aa 114-1291897.1/-1896.7/-Tyr137 and Tyr145aa 130-1461851.9/-NDTyr153aa 152-154407.9/453.0aa 150-154651.3/697.3 Open table in a new tab The tryptic peptide containing Tyr92 (a.a. 74–107) was observed in both untreated and ONOO–-treated MGST1 by ESI-MS/MS, whereas the nitrated form of the Tyr92 peptide was detected only in the ONOO–-treated sample. Tyrosines 115 and 120 present within the same peptide (1897.03 m/z (aa 114–129) were observed using both types of MS, but there was no evidence for nitration of either of these tyrosine residues in ONOO–-treated samples. Similarly, Tyr137 and Tyr145 lie within the tryptic peptide comprising residues 131–147 (1851.95 m/z). Nitration of these two tyrosine residues also was not detected. However, in all cases, the methionine residue at position 143 was always found in the oxidized form, and this modification could have prevented the identification of other potential modifications within the same peptide. The tyrosine residue located near the C terminus, Tyr153, was found in a short 3-amino acid peptide (aa 152–154) by ESI-MS/MS or as a peptide that resulted from a single missed cleavage comprising the penultimate 5 amino acids (aa 150–154) by MALDI-TOF MS. Nitration at Tyr153 in ONOO–-treated samples was observed in both peptides. The MS data are summarized in Table 1. The Sequest summary for parental and nitrated peptides observed in ONOO–-treated samples and a schematic representation of the MS/MS sequence for peptides containing nitrated Tyr153 are shown in Fig. 3. Cellular Functional Analysis—The functional consequences of nitration of tyrosine residues Tyr92 and Tyr153 of MGST1 were determined by comparing the wild type protein to several MGST1 mutants, in which these tyrosine residues were substituted with phenylalanine, alone or in combination (Y92F, Y153F, and a Y92F, Y153F double mutant). These mutations would prevent any potential nitration at the mutated amino acid site while maintaining similar overall chemistry. Expression vectors containing the wild type or mutated MGST1 (both single and double sites) were transiently transfected in LLC-PK1 cells and the MGST1 activity in the microsomal fractions assessed. Immunoreactive MGST1 protein was readily detected in transfected cells but not in non-transfected cells or cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 4A), consistent with a 2–3-fold increase in basal MGST1 activity in MGST1-transfected cells. (Fig. 4B). As expected, the basal MGST1 activity was similar in microsomes containing either the wild type or mutated proteins. However, after treatment with 2.0 mm ONOO– for 10 s, there was a significant increase in MGST1 activity only in microsomal fractions from cells transfected with wild type MGST1 or with the Y153F mutant (Fig. 4B). In contrast, MGST1 activity in the Y92F mutant or the double mutant was unaltered by ONOO–, suggesting that nitration of Tyr92 is required for the peroxynitrite-induced activation of MGST1. MGST1 is a homotrimeric membrane-bound protein, with each subunit containing seven tyrosine residues (at positions 18, 92, 115, 120, 137, 145, and 153) in addition to a single cysteine residue (Cys49). Six of the seven tyrosine residues are located in the C-terminal half of the protein. Electron crystallography of two-dimensional crystals of MGST1 has been used to construct a three-dimensional model of the enzyme. In this model, the trimeric enzyme exhibits three repeats of a left-handed four-helix bundle motif (13Holm P.J. Morgenstern R. Hebert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The catalytic center of the enzyme is thought to be contained in the first cytosolic loop of the protein between peripheral transmembrane helices designated D and A. Only two of the tyrosine residues (Tyr120 and Tyr153) are located in putative non-membrane domains, the former in the second cytosolic loop and the latter at the intra-lumen C-terminal; the other five are located in one of the four putative transmembrane domains (13Holm P.J. Morgenstern R. Hebert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The first cytosolic loop does not contain any tyrosine residues (13Holm P.J. Morgenstern R. Hebert H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) but does contain Cys49, the alkylation or oxidative modification of which results in increased catalytic activity and is thought to act as a sensor of chemical or oxidative stress (14Busenlehner L.S. Codreanu S.G. Holm P.J. Bhakat P. Hebert H. Morgenstern R. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11145-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, oxidation of Cys49 by reactive oxygen species does not appear to cause enzyme activation, since we (Ref. 3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and Fig. 1) and others (15Lundqvist G. Morgenstern R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) could not demonstrate activation of the enzyme by H2O2 or by superoxide generating systems. In studies that have demonstrated activation of the enzyme by H2O2 (16Aniya Y. Anders M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1998-2002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Aniya Y. Anders M.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), incubations with H2O2 were performed in the presence of GSH, and the increase in enzyme activity was attributed to S-glutathiolation or polymer formation, rather than oxidation of the Cys49 per se. In our studies, incubations with H2O2 were performed in the absence of GSH, and therefore S-glutathiolation of Cys49 and subsequent activation of the enzyme would not be expected. To identify sites of tyrosine nitration of MGST1, we utilized mass spectrometric techniques using both MALDI and ESI to maximize coverage of the protein and allow observation of most of the tyrosine residues. Spectra of the tryptic digests of the MGST1 obtained using both techniques showed the presence of nitration of Tyr153 in ONOO–-treated but not in the untreated samples. A second nitration site at Tyr92 was detected by ESI-MS/MS (sequence confirmation shown in Fig. 3, upper panel). Modification of the other tyrosine residues, Tyr115, Tyr120, Tyr137, and Tyr145, was not detected. However, Tyr18 was not detected by either MS instrument, and hence we could not assess its nitration status. It is noteworthy that the methionine residue present in the peptide that contains Tyr137 and Tyr145 (aa 130–146) was always found in the oxidized form. Methionine was not present in peptides containing Tyr92, Tyr115, Tyr120, or Tyr153. Oxidation of methionine is a common modification that occurs prior to protein preparation as well as during protein purification and analysis. Methionine oxidation can cause suppression of ionization and can prevent or mask identification of any other modifications within the same peptide. Therefore, confirmation of the presence or absence of nitration at Tyr137 and/or Tyr145 would have to be investigated by other means, possibly by either chemical derivatization of the nitro group to enhance its ionization or by other non-MS techniques such as immunoassay with site specific antibodies. Peroxynitrite is a strong biological oxidant that has been implicated in diverse forms of free radical-induced tissue injury. It can react with a variety of biological molecules to modify cellular structure and function, and there are now many reports in the literature describing the inhibitory effect of ONOO– on the enzymatic activity of a variety of proteins, including several enzymes involved in defense against oxidative stress. In most cases this inhibitory activity has been attributed to nitration of critical tyrosine residues, although in some, oxidation of critical sulfhydryl groups (18Kuhn D.M. Geddes T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29726-29732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Kuhn D.M. Aretha C.W. Geddes T.J. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 22Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) has been proposed. In marked contrast, however, treatment with ONOO– increases MGST1 activity in both hepatic microsomes or in purified enzyme preparations (Ref. 3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and Fig. 1) and also increases the GSH peroxidase activity of the enzyme (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found that MGST1 was much more susceptible to sulfhydryl oxidation than to tyrosine nitration (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Exposure of MGST1 to 0.1 mm ONOO– resulted in 80% oxidation of sulfhydryl groups, whereas tyrosine nitration was barely detectable. However, the extent of Cys49 oxidation by ONOO– did not correlate well with the increase in enzyme activity, suggesting that S-oxidation of MGST1 by ONOO– was not sufficient to cause the observed enzyme activation. In contrast, the dose-dependent increase in tyrosine nitration by ONOO– paralleled quite closely the increase in enzyme activity, suggesting that tyrosine nitration was the basis for the gain of function (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results of the site-directed mutagenesis studies reported herein provide direct evidence that this is the case, since in cells expressing the Y92F mutant, ONOO– was completely without effect. The active site of MGST1 is localized on the cytosolic side of endoplasm reticulum (23Andersson C. Weinander R. Lundqvist G. DePierre J.W. Morgenstern R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The MGST1 trimer binds one molecule of GSH, and subunit communication is thought to play a role in the activation of the enzyme (24Sun T.-H. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Svensson R. Rinaldi R. Swedmark S. Morgenstern R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15144-15149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thiolate formation follows a biphasic kinetic pattern, with rapid binding of GSH followed by slower formation of thiolate (26Svensson R. Alander J. Armstrong R.N. Morgenstern R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8869-8877Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presumed conformational changes brought about by modification of Cys49 by N-ethylmaleimide markedly increases the rate of thiolate formation and increases kcat. Although nitration of Tyr153 was shown to occur, this residue is the penultimate C-terminal residue, far removed from the catalytic site of the enzyme, and thus might not be expected to influence enzyme conformation or activity. This is supported by the site-directed mutagenesis data (Fig. 4), in which microsomes from cells expressing the Y153F mutant exhibited significant increases in MGST1 activity after exposure to ONOO–. On the other hand, Tyr92 is located in the transmembrane domain on the C-terminal side of the cytosolic loop containing the catalytic domain. Considering the location of Tyr92, it seems reasonable to suppose that in a manner analogous to that occurring after structural modification of Cys49, a conformational change brought about by nitration of this tyrosine residue might increase the rate of thiolate formation and increase catalytic activity. Therefore, in simile with the role of Cys49 as a sensor of chemical and oxidative stress, the nitration of Tyr92 could function as a sensor of nitrosative stress. Data from this and other studies have shown that activation of MGST1 by RNS occurs by two distinct mechanisms: S-nitrosylation of Cys49 and nitration of Tyr92, and the question arises as to the relative importance of these two mechanisms in vivo. Using the purified enzyme, the degree of activation by ONOO– is about 2.5-fold greater than that by GSNO (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4Ji Y. Toader V. Bennett B.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Using hepatic microsomes, enzyme activity is increased about 3-fold by ONOO– and is not increased by GSNO. Thus in purified enzyme or microsomal preparations, ONOO– is a better activator of the enzyme. The lack of effect of GSNO could be due to contamination of the microsomal fraction by cytosolic GSTs, whose activity is inhibited by GSNO, with a net effect of no change in activity. However, in a recent report in which S-nitrosylation of MGST1 was assessed using biotin switch methodology, no evidence was found for S-nitrosylation of the enzyme after incubation of hepatic microsomes with GSNO or in microsomes from rats treated with lipopolysaccharide to induce nitrosative stress (27Shi Q. Lou Y.J. Pharmacol. Res. 2005; 51: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We would therefore speculate that in vivo, under pathological situations associated with increased ONOO– formation, that tyrosine nitration would be the more relevant modification of MGST1. In a previous study we found that addition of ONOO–-treated MGST1 to microsomal membrane preparations caused a marked reduction in iron-induced lipid peroxidation, consistent with the finding that the GSH peroxidase activity of MGST1 is increased after treatment with ONOO– and suggesting a protective function for the nitrated enzyme (3Ji Y. Bennett B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Under conditions of oxidative/nitrosative stress, most antioxidant enzymes are inactivated by S-oxidation or/and tyrosine nitration by ONOO– (5Wong P.S.-Y. Eiserich J.P. Reddy S. Lopez C.L.

The data obtained in the present study suggest that nitration of Tyr92 and subsequent activation of MGST1 after exposure to ONOO– may be an important mechanism for cellular protection against nitrosative stress under circumstances in which other antioxidant defense mechanisms are compromised.

https://openalex.org/W1977419580,"EBNA 2 is one of only five viral genes essential for the infection and immortalization of human B cells by the cancer-associated virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBNA 2 activates cellular and viral transcription and associates with components of the basal transcription apparatus and a number of coactivators. We provide the first evidence to show that the mechanism of transcriptional activation by EBNA 2 also involves phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (pol II). We found that transcriptional activation by EBNA 2 was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of the pol II CTD kinase, CDK9, and by low concentrations of the CDK9 inhibitor 5, 6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole. Moreover, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we demonstrated that EBNA 2 stimulates both pol II recruitment and pol II phosphorylation on serine 5 of the CTD in vivo. These results identify a new step in the transcription cycle that is subject to regulation by a key EBV-encoded transcription factor and highlight CDK9 inhibitors as potential anti-EBV agents."
https://openalex.org/W2069867832,"CDX2 is a Drosophila caudal-related homeobox transcription factor that is important for the establishment and maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells. CDX2 is a marker of colon cancer, with strong staining in up to 90% of colonic adenocarcinomas. CDX2 heterozygous-null mice develop colonic neoplasms, which have suggested that CDX2 is a tumor suppressor. However, CDX2 has not been reported to affect xenograft growth. Furthermore, CDX2 is rarely mutated in colon cancer, which has led to suggestions that it may play only a minor role as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer. To understand the functional contributions of CDX2 to colon cancer, we disrupted CDX2 in LOVO and SW48 human colon cancer cell lines by targeted homologous recombination. Consistent with the literature, disruption of CDX2 enhanced anchorage-dependent cell proliferation. However, homozygous loss of CDX2 led to significant inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in LOVO cells, and cell lethality in SW48 cells. Further analyses revealed that disruption of CDX2 led to anchorage-independent G1 to S growth arrest and anoikis. In vivo xenograft studies confirmed that disruption of CDX2 inhibited LOVO tumor growth. These data demonstrate that CDX2 mediates anchorage-independent growth and survival. Thus, CDX2 has tumorigenic potential in the human colon cancer cell lines LOVO and SW48."

To understand its structural architecture and to provide a molecular scaffold for the design of new cancer therapeutics, the crystal structure of the human form was determined. The structure at 2.1 Å resolution shows that the overall folding and functional dimerization are very similar to those of the liver (PFKFB1) and testis (PFKFB4) forms, as expected from sequence homology. However, in this structure, the N-terminal regulatory domain is revealed for the first time among the PFKFB isoforms. With a β-hairpin structure, the N terminus interacts with the 2-Pase domain to secure binding of fructose-6-phosphate to the active pocket, slowing down the release of fructose-6-phosphate from the phosphoenzyme intermediate product complex. The C-terminal regulatory domain is mostly disordered, leaving the active pocket of the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase domain wide open. The active pocket of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase domain has a more rigid conformation, allowing independent bindings of substrates, fructose-6-phosphate and ATP, with higher affinities than other isoforms. Intriguingly, the structure shows an EDTA molecule bound to the fructose-6-phosphate site of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase active pocket despite its unfavorable liganding concentration, suggesting a high affinity. EDTA is not removable from the site with fructose-6-P alone but is with both ATP and fructose-6-P or with fructose-2,6-bisphosphate.

Mammalian tissues have evolved to carry out various functions under different physiological conditions. Such differentiation has naturally caused the tissue cells to have different optima for their energy metabolism. The bifunctional enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB, 2The abbreviations used are: PFKFB, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphophatase;2-Kase,6-phosphofructo-2-kinase;2-Pase,fructose-2,6-bisphophatase;Fru-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; Fru-2,6-P2, fructose-2,6-bisphophate; E-P, phosphoenzyme intermediate. 2-Kase/2-Pase), plays a key role in such tissue-specific energy metabolism by controlling glucose utilization. Because this enzyme controls the cellular concentration of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), which is the most potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, PFKFB eventually controls the glycolytic rate (1Pilkis S.J.

The bifunctional enzyme acutely controls the concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 by modulating the two mutually exclusive catalytic activities of Fru-2,6-P2 synthesis (2-Kase) and hydrolysis (2-Pase) that reside in the two separate domains (4Bazan J.F.

Although these isoforms share high “2-Kase/2-Pase core” sequence homology (85%), each isoform has different kinetic properties and responds differently to upstream regulatory signals.

Metabolic adaptation to hypoxia is initiated by changes in gene expression patterns triggered by anaerobic activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), and the gene (pfkfb3) for the inducible bifunctional enzyme is one of the most immediate targets of transcriptional activation by HIF-1 (15Minchenko A.

The extremely high 2-Kase activity of the inducible PFKFB provides the impetus for vigorous glycolysis in cancer cells. Recent studies suggest that inhibition of glycolysis to deplete the cellular ATP may serve as an alternative strategy to kill cancer cells that have acquired resistance to traditional drugs. Thus, the inducible PFKFB has been considered as the primary target (26Chesney J. Telang S. Yalcin A. Clem A. Wallis N. Bucala R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We have studied the PFKFB enzyme system for several years and have made significant contributions to understanding the structure/function relationships of the enzyme at a molecular level (29Lee Y.-H.

To understand molecular differentiation of the entire PFKFB protein system, which has been the long-term goal of our study, and to provide information on the molecular structure of possible therapeutic targets for cancer, we report here the crystal structure of the human tumor/inducible form of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3). Preparation and Crystallization of PFKFB3—The His-tagged human inducible bifunctional enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS and purified using nickel-affinity columns, and the N-terminal His tag was removed by treatment with thrombin using a standard protocol (19Manes N.P. El-Maghrabi M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 438: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The final purification was performed using Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography; the resulting pure protein was kept, after concentration to 8 mg ml-1 protein, in pH 8.0, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaPi, 0.05 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm ADP, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mm Fru-6-P. Crystals were prepared by the sitting drop vapor diffusion of the 1:1 mixture of the protein sample with a mother liquor of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20-25% ethylene glycol, 12% dioxane, 5% glycerol, and 12% polyethylene glycol 4000. Crystals in a size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm were grown in 2-3 weeks. Data Collection and Processing—The crystal was soaked with cryoprotectant solutions for 0.5-2 h to remove inorganic phosphate and to incorporate the targeted ligands. A typical cryoprotectant solution is pH 7.5, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer enriched with 35% ethylene glycol and 1.0 mm Fru-2,6-P2. A soaked crystal was flash frozen at 100 K using an Oxford cryo-device and kept at the same temperature during data collections. The diffraction data were collected at The Gulf Coast Consortium Protein Crystallography PX1 beamline in The Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices, Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, LA). The x-ray source wavelength was 1.3808 Å. The data recorded on a Mar 165-mm CCD detector were integrated, merged, and scaled using HKL2000 (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar), and the resulting data statistics are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Statistics of reflection data and structure refinementsLigandingPFKFB3·ADP·EDTAPFKFB3·ADP·Fru-2,6-P2Space groupP6522P6522Unit cell dimension (Å)102.6 × 102.6 × 259.9102.2 × 102.2 × 259.2Resolution range (Å)30.0-2.130.0-2.5Reflections [F ≤ σ(F)]44,65128,580Completeness (%)92.8 (87.6)99.7 (97.8)Redundancy9.6 (9.3)13.9 (9.2)I/σ(I)16.9 (1.5)15.3 (1.9)Rsym0.107 (0.687)0.099 (0.535)Rcrys0.2090.214Rfree0.2330.262No. of amino acids452449No. of protein atoms3,6693,658No. of hetero atoms6366No. of waters353221R.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.0100.006Angles (°)1.61.3Dihedral angles (°)22.622.2Mean B factorProtein atoms (Å2)34.4243.6Hetero atoms (Å2)31.8141.1Water atoms (Å2)46.752.3 Open table in a new tab As summarized in Table 1, the crystals belong to space group P6522 with similar cell dimensions regardless of the liganding conditions. The reduced data were formatted for the program suites CCP4 (33Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar) and CNS (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of PFKFB3 complexed with ADP and EDTA was determined first by molecular replacement using AMoRE (35Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 588-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) implemented in the CCP4 suite (33Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). A single polyalanine form of the liver structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 1K6M) (31Lee Y.-H. Li Y. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was used as a search model. An AMoRE rotation and subsequent translation search was performed using a data subset between 15.0 and 4.0 Å. The molecular replacement search as well as the measurement of solvent fraction suggested a single protein molecule in an asymmetric unit. A good molecular replacement solution was found to show an R-factor of 0.52 and a correlation factor of 0.58. Assignment of the side chains was made using program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The initial model went through iterated cycles of manual model rebuilding using O program and refinement at 2.1 Å using CNS (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). When Rcrys/Rfree reached 0.27/0.29 or below, the ligand molecules were built into the model, referring to the |Fo| - |Fc| omit maps. ADP and the 2-Pase-bound Fru-6-P were incorporated first, and EDTA was added after mass spectrometric confirmation of the crystal. As summarized in Table 1, the final model has Rfree/Rcrys of 0.233/0.209 using a total of 4,085 scatterers, including solvent molecules, against all available 44,651 reflections in the resolution range of 30.0-2.1 Å. The structure contains a total of 452 protein residues of the full-length protein of 520 residues. The subsequent structure of PFKFB3 complexed with ADP and Fru-2,6-P2 was determined by using the structure of the protein·ADP·EDTA complex after striping the ligands and solvents as the initial model and by following the structural refinements procedures similar to that used for the structure of the protein·ADP·EDTA complex. But to guarantee a freedom to structural refinements, the indices of reflections in the free data were kept as those of the protein·ADP·EDTA complex. The final structure has Rfree/Rcrys of 0.262/0.214 using a total of 3,945 scatterers, including solvent molecules, against all available 28,580 reflections in the resolution range of 30.0-2.5 Å. The structure contains a total of 449 protein residues of the full-length protein of 520 residues. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Overall Structure—The PFKFB3 protein was crystallized under conditions similar to those for the liver form (31Lee Y.-H. Li Y. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The structures from the two different liganding conditions were determined by molecular replacement using the liver structure as a start model. The two different liganding conditions used were ADP and fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) and ADP and Fru-2,6-P2, and the resulting resolutions of the final structures were 2.1 and 2.5 Å, respectively. Among all the structure-assigned residues, 89% are in the most favored regions in a Ramachandran plot, 9.5% in the additional allowed region, and the rest in the generously allowed region. Details of the crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 1. Most descriptions of the structure below are according to the structure determined to 2.1 Å resolution, unless specifically mentioned. Amino acid sequence numbers are from the inducible PFKFB3. When the sequence is different in other isoforms, the different sequence is given in a small case. For example, S162e means the 162nd residue in the inducible protein is Ser and the equivalent residue in the liver form is Glu. As predicted from the high sequence homology (85%) between the PFKFB isoforms, the folding of the inducible form is very similar to those of the testis and liver forms (31Lee Y.-H. Li Y. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Hasemann C.A. Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1a, a PFKFB-typical head-to-head functional dimerization is also conserved. However, the inducible form also has structural features uniquely different from the other isoforms. The conformations of the substrate loops in the 2-Kase domain are different from those of other isoforms (31Lee Y.-H. Li Y. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Hasemann C.A. Istvan E.S. Uyeda K. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1996; 4: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), providing a structural rationale for the higher 2-Kase activity. The structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain is revealed: the N terminus binds to the 2-Pase domain to cause a local conformational change in the active pocket to enhance inhibitory binding of product. Most strikingly, an EDTA molecule was found at the Fru-6-P site of the active pocket of 2-Kase. Detailed descriptions of these structural features of the inducible form will be made in following sections. Autoregulation of the 2-Pase by the N-terminal Domain—This is the first time the structure of the regulatory N terminus (residues 2-28 of 31 residues) has been revealed among any of the solved PFKFB structures. As shown in Fig. 1, a and b, residues 4-15 form a β-hairpin structure, and the rest serve as an arm connecting the hairpin to the 2-Kase. The turn of this hairpin makes a contact with its own 2-Pase domain and causes a global rotation of the 2-Pase domain from its relative position in the liver form (data not shown). Although the domain twist is interesting, its functional effect is not clear. On the other hand, the contacting area of the 2-Pase domain is functionally very sensitive because the residues critical for binding of both product and substrate are located in close proximity (Fig. 1c). The three key residues, Arg-347, Lys-351, and Tyr-362, which interact with the 6-phosphate moiety (6-P) of substrate (Fru-2,6-P2) and product (Fru-6-P) are located in this area (38Li L. Lin K. Pilkis J. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21588-21594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Li L. Lin K. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16669-16675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the N terminus to this area is mediated by salt bridges and/or hydrogen bonds between Arg-8 and Glu-342, between the main chain of Val-9 and that of Tyr-354, between Gln-10 and Gln-363 and Arg-355, and between Lys-11 and the main chain of Arg-355. As a result, the β-strand where Tyr-354, Arg-355, and Tyr-356 are located moves deep inside by more than 1 Å; as a result, a local network of side chain interactions is reorganized when compared with that of the liver form. Tyr-354 makes a hydrogen bond to Glu-343 and Tyr-356 to Arg-347. Consequently, the interaction of Arg-347 with 6-P of the bound Fru-6-P becomes stronger with a distance shortened by 0.7 Å. Similarly, the distances from 6-P to Lys-356 and Tyr-362 are shortened by 0.7 and 0.4 Å, respectively. This may cause a substantial increase in affinities for both substrate and product. Because of sequence difference from other isoforms, the inducible form has a serine instead of an arginine at the 302nd residue. The corresponding Arg-307 in the liver form and all other isoforms has dual functions by providing a positive charge for the 2-phosphate moiety (2-P) of substrate: facilitating substrate binding and stabilizing the phosphoenzyme intermediate (E-P) during its breakdown (40Lin K. Li L. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6556-6562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the inducible PFKFB is doubly compromised by the loss of arginine at this position; its affinity for substrate is decreased, and the rate of E-P breakdown is drastically slowed. Yet, binding of the product, Fru-6-P, which is a potent non-competitive inhibitor of the reaction, is not affected. Site-specific mutagenesis of the liver 2-Pase showed similar results, and the current structure supports the observation (40Lin K. Li L. Correia J.J. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6556-6562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the net result of the loss of arginine in the inducible PFKFB is that its 2-Pase reaction spends more time in the E-P·Fru-6-P complex state. This was kinetically observed in a recent study in which the arginine residue was restored (19Manes N.P. El-Maghrabi M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 438: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, the interaction with the N terminus mentioned above confers an even tighter binding of Fru-6-P, reducing the activity of the inducible form to negligible rates. Consequently, the N terminus exerts a negative regulatory effect on the 2-Pase activity by enhancing the binding of inhibitor, Fru-6-P, or, more precisely, by slowing down the catalytic rate-limiting step, the release of Fru-6-P from the E-P·Fru-6-P complex. Supporting this hypothesis, the alternative mRNA splicing product of the inducible PFKFB, in which the N terminus is naturally deleted, has a 7-fold higher 2-Pase activity (19Manes N.P. El-Maghrabi M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 438: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Substrate Binding Loops of the 2-Kase Domain—The 2-Kase domain has binding sites for the two substrates, ATP and Fru-6-P, the binding of which are sensitive to the conformations of the two outer lobes known as the ATP loop (residues 168-179) and the Fru-6-P loop (residues 72-84) that surround the whole active pocket (31Lee Y.-H. Li Y. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Yuen M.H. Wang X.L. Mizuguchi H. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12333-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the testis form, the two loops are structurally coupled to each other through two hydrogen bonds donated by Arg-181. Upon binding of ATP, the last turn of helix α5 unwinds to allow Lys-172 to interact with γ-phosphate. This conformational change is transmitted to the Fru-6-P loop via Arg-181 such that the Fru-6-P loop has a new conformation. Fru-6-P can bind only to this new conformation (41Yuen M.H. Wang X.L. Mizuguchi H. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12333-12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of Fru-6-P is dependent on that of ATP in the testis form in an ordered fashion. However, the native liver form with a cysteine instead of an arginine has the two loops decoupled from each other. As a result, their conformations are different from those in the testis form, and the two substrates bind independently from each other (31Lee Y.-H. Li Y. Uyeda K. Hasemann C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The inducible form also has a cysteine instead of an arginine, and thus the two loops are decoupled like in the liver form, allowing the independent binding of substrate. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2a, sequence differences in the residues of N178d and E181k provide new interactions necessary to form an additional helix turn to the end of the ATP loop. The substitution of Gln-80 with serine and an added Lys-79 change the local conformation of the Fru-6-P loop to a helix turn; as a result, Tyr-81 makes a hydrogen bond to the main body of the following helix through Asp-185. The sequence differences in these loop regions add he"

In order to investigate the molecular basis of this epitope in a cellular context, we compared two Drosophila melanogaster cell lines: the S2 and the neuronal-like BG2-c6 cell lines. As shown by mass spectrometric and chromatographic analyses, only the BG2-c6 cell line expresses α1,3/α1,6-difucosylated N-glycans, a result that correlates with anti-horseradish peroxidase binding. Of all four α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues previously identified, the core α1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucTA; EC 2.4.1.214) is expressed in the neuronal cell line as well as throughout fly development and in heads and bodies of flies of both sexes. This pattern is distinctive in comparison with the expression of the other three α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues (FucTB, FucTC, and FucTD). Furthermore, only transfection of FucTA cDNA into S2 cells resulted in expression of the anti-horseradish peroxidase epitope, a result compatible with its substrate specificity in vitro. Finally, silencing of FucTA by RNAi in the neuronal cell line led to a significant reduction of anti-horseradish peroxidase binding. The present study, in conjunction with our previous in vitro data, thereby shows that FucTA is indispensable for expression of the neural carbohydrate epitope in Drosophila cells.

Salvaterra P.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). More recently, neural anti-HRP staining has been suggested to be a characteristic of Ecdysozoa (5Haase A. Stern M. Wachtler K. Bicker G. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), one of the two newly redefined clades of protostomians. Thus, not only has anti-HRP been much used to track neurons in insects (especially Drosophila melanogaster), but there is also a report that 10% of the neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans are recognized by this reagent (6Siddiqui S.S. Culotti J.G. J. Neurogenet. 1991; 7: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The first hints as to the basis of this staining in insects were shown by its sensitivity to reagents that destroy carbohydrate moieties and its inhibition by bromelain glycopeptides (3Katz F. Moats W. Jan Y.N. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which carry N-glycans decorated with β1,2-xylose and core α1,3-fucose residues. The epitopes recognized by anti-HRP were partially revealed by analysis of N-glycans attached to horseradish peroxidase (7Kurosaka A. Yano A. Itoh N. Kuroda Y. Nakagawa T. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4168-4172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the α1,6-linked mannose of the trimannosyl core and the core α1,3-linked fucose contribute to the recognition the most, whereas the presence of nonreducing terminal N-acetylglucosamines greatly reduces the reactivity of the anti-HRP. In this study, analyses also showed that the contribution of xylose in anti-HRP binding to HRP was minimal (7Kurosaka A. Yano A. Itoh N. Kuroda Y. Nakagawa T. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4168-4172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the latter contrasts with more recent data demonstrating that anti-HRP binds both xylose-substituted and fucose-substituted structures to a similar extent (8Bencúrová M. Hemmer W. Focke-Tejkl M. Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the exact molecular basis of the neuronal anti-HRP staining in insects remained unclear. Thus, we began to re-examine this problem and found that only neoglycoconjugates containing native, and not defucosylated, bromelain glycopeptides inhibit this reaction, suggesting that core α1,3-fucose is part of the epitope recognized in flies. Furthermore, staining fly embryos with anti-bee venom, which contains antibodies directed against core α1,3-fucose, and not xylose, reproduces the same pattern as using anti-HRP. In addition, we detected core α1,3-/α1,6-difucosylated N-glycans in adult flies and cloned a cDNA encoding an enzymatically active coreα1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucTA) (9Fabini G. Freilinger A. Altmann F. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, we were also able to demonstrate that anti-HRP staining in C. elegans is due to the activity of FUT-1, a core α1,3-fucosyltransferase (10Paschinger K. Rendic D. Lochnit G. Jantsch V.

Is FucTA expressed in fly neural tissue, and does it create the anti-HRP epitope in vivo? Are other α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues involved in neuronal anti-HRP epitope synthesis? Are core α1,3-/α1,6-difucosylated N-glycans enriched in fly neuronal tissue? Particularly the last question is problematic, since acquiring enough tissue for glycan analyses is a challenge. To circumvent this, a Drosophila third instar larval neuronal cell line (BG2-c6), previously found to bind anti-HRP (11Ui K. Nishihara S. Sakuma M. Togashi S. Ueda R. Miyata Y. Miyake T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1994; 30A: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was considered as a suitable model for further study of the anti-HRP epitope synthesis; on the other hand, the commonly used Schneider 2 (S2) cell line was also employed in the expectation that these cells, since they are of hemocyte origin, do not bind anti-HRP. By examining N-glycans of these cell lines, performing knock-in and knock-down experiments on α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues in the respective cell lines, and determining the tissue and stage specificity of the expression of all four α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues, we have gained further evidence pointing to a key role for FucTA in the biosynthesis of the anti-HRP epitope in Drosophila cells and have demonstrated that the other three fucosyltransferase homologues are not responsible for the formation of anti-HRP epitopes in the neuronal cell line.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaintenance and Growth of Insect Cell Lines—The Drosophila neuronal cell line BG2-c6 was kindly provided by Kumiko Ui-Tei, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, whereas the S2 and Sf9 cell lines were gifts from Gerald Aichinger (Intercell) and Wolfgang Ernst (Department für Biotechnologie, Universität für Bodenkultur, Wien), respectively. For expression experiments, S2 cells were grown in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Sigma) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μ g/ml streptomycin sulfate in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks (Sarstedt) at 26 °C. For RNAi experiments, neuronal BG2-c6 cells were grown in Shields and Sang M3 insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% FBS, 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma) in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks (Sarstedt) at 26 °C. In order to avoid contamination from bovine serum proteins for the N-glycan analysis, both cell lines were also adapted to serum-free medium (Drosophila-SFM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 16.5 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and cultured at 26 °C. We found that both cell lines grew at twice the rate as in the media supplemented with 10% FBS and showed a stronger adherence to the flask surface. For general maintenance, S2 and BG2-c6 cells were split always to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml after they reached 0.8–2 × 107 cells/ml. Sf9 cells were passaged at 100% confluence using IPL-41 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 3% FBS.N-Glycan Preparation from Drosophila Cell Lines—Typically, 500 mg (wet weight) of S2 or BG2-c6 cell lines grown in serum-free medium (Drosophila-SFM; Invitrogen) were resuspended in up to 80 mm HCl, pH 2.0 (HCl was added until pH reached ∼2.0) and homogenized with an Ultra Turrax T25 apparatus (high speed). Pepsin (1 mg) was added, and proteolysis was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. The resulting extract was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to a Dowex AG50W×2 column (1.5 × 50 cm); the column was then washed with 50 ml of 2% (v/v) acetic acid. Subsequently, the glycopeptides were eluted with 0.4 m ammonium acetate, pH 6, and orcinol-positive fractions were pooled and concentrated prior to gel filtration (Sephadex G25; elution with 1% (v/v) acetic acid). The resultant glycopeptide fractions were lyophilized and dissolved in 250 mm citrate-phosphate, pH 5, and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min to inactivate any remaining proteases. The N-glycans were then released using 0.375 milliunits of peptide:N-glycosidase A (37 °C, 24 h). The sample was then acidified by adding two volumes of 5% (v/v) acetic acid and applied to a 2-ml Dowex AG50W×2 column. The column was washed with 2% (v/v) acetic acid, and the unretained orcinol-positive fractions were passed through reverse phase clean-up columns (100 mg; Zorbax; Agilent Technologies). Lyophilized N-glycans were dissolved in water and subject to either MALDI-TOF analysis (see below) or pyridylamination followed by RP-HPLC (12Kubelka V. Altmann F. Staudacher E. Tretter V. März L.

Biochem. 2000; 285: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a DYNAMO (Thermo BioAnalysis, Hemel Hempstead, UK) linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a dynamic extraction setting of 0.1. External mass calibration was performed with pyridylaminated N-glycans or with a partial dextran hydrolysate. On-plate α-fucosidase digestion was performed using 0.2 milliunits of bovine kidney α-fucosidase (Sigma) in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5, with incubation in a “wet chamber” at 37 °C for 1 h. On-plate α-mannosidase digestion was performed using ∼10 milliunits of jack bean α-mannosidase (Sigma; repurified on Sephacryl S200) in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5, with incubation in a “wet chamber” at 37 °C for 5 h.Reverse Phase and Normal Phase HPLC of Pyridylaminated N-Glycans—After crude gel filtration to remove excess 2-aminopyridine, pyridylaminated oligosaccharides were fractionated by reverse phase chromatography on an ODS column (0.4 × 25 cm), following the previously published methods (12Kubelka V. Altmann F. Staudacher E. Tretter V. März L. Hård K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 1055-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The starting buffer was 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.0, and a gradient increasing at 1% per min using 30% (v/v) methanol was applied. Columns were calibrated daily in terms of glucose units with a pyridylaminated partial dextran hydrolysate (3–11 glucose units). Fractions containing fucosylated structures were further fractionated on a normal phase HPLC (PalPak Type N) column in order to remove accompanying oligomannosidic structures. The buffer A used was made up by mixing a stock solution of 3% acetic acid (pH 7.3, adjusted with triethylamine) and 10% acetonitrile and acetonitrile in a 25:75 ratio, whereas buffer B was made up by mixing the stock solution and acetonitrile in a 75:25 ratio. The following gradient was applied: 0–5 min, 10% B; 5–45 min, 10–100% B; 45–55 min, 100% B; 55–56 min, 100–10% B; 56–65 min, 10% B. Selected fractions or the entire N-glycan pool were subject to exo- or endoglycosidase digestions as follows: Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean) α-mannosidase (200 milliunits in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm zinc chloride, pH 4.2); C. ensiformis β-hexosaminidase (5 milliunits in 20 μl of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0); bovine kidney α-fucosidase (4 milliunits in 20 μl of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0). In addition, core α1,3-fucose-containing fractions were specifically defucosylated with hydrofluoric acid (48% w/v) overnight at 4 °C as previously described (17Haslam S.M. Coles G.C. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Construction of Insect Expression Vectors—In order to construct plasmids encoding all four α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues suitable for expression in insect cells, PCRs were performed using the following primers: FucTA (CG6869, GenBank™ accession number AJ302045), forward primer 5′-CGGGGTACCTGGTCACCATGCGGCGTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGGGAATTCTCAGTCGTCGCTGGAGTCG-3′; FucTB (CG4435, GenBank™ accession number AJ302046), forward primer 5′-CGGGGTACCGATAATCATGCGACTGGCAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCTCTAGATTAAGTATTTGAACTATTACTG-3′; FucTC (CG40305, GenBank™ accession number AJ302047), forward primer 5′-CGGGGTACCATGTATTTAGGGAGGGTTCAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGGGAATTCTCACAAACGTATTCGGCTTTG-3′; FucTD (CG9169, GenBank™ accession number AF441265), forward primer 5′-GGGTACCCCAAAAGGCAATGCCGATAGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGAATTCCTCAGAGGAAGGTGGTGGAT-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). In the case of FucTA, BG2-c6 cDNA was used as template; for FucTB, the Tf24 strain was used as a cDNA source, whereas for FucTD, Canton S male body cDNA or an EST clone carrying the complete ORF (EST AT16002; GenBank™ accession number AY075216) was used as a template for PCR. For FucTC, the major portion of the insert was excised from a previously constructed Pichia expression vector (where the insert originated from the Tf24 strain cDNA) (9Fabini G. Freilinger A. Altmann F. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas the 5′-end (first 675 nt) was generated by PCR from Canton S female body cDNA. Complete ORFs of FucTB and FucTD as well as of the first 675 nt of FucTC were amplified from cDNA and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). Subsequently, complete ORFs with or without the natural stop codon of all four FucTs were cloned into the pIZT/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) carrying a gfp-zeoR gene; in the latter case, the sequences were cloned in frame with a 3′ sequence encoding the V5 and His6 epitopes using the following reverse primers: FucTA, 5′-CGGGAATTCCAGTCGTCGCTGGAGTCG-3′; FucTB, 5′-GCTCTAGAGTATTTGAACTATTACTG-3′; FucTC, 5′-CGGGAATTCAAACGTATTCGGCTTTG-3′; FucTD, 5′-GGAATTCCAGAGGAAGGTGGTGGAT-3′. The sequence and orientation of all cloned cDNAs were verified by sequencing.Transfection of Drosophila Schneider 2 Cells—The pIZT/V5-His vectors with native stop codons were introduced to Drosophila S2 cells using TransFectin Lipid Reagent (Bio-Rad), according to the manufacturer's protocol for adherent cells (comparable results where also obtained with the standard calcium phosphate transfection method). The cells were incubated at 26 °C and harvested between the second and the fifth day of expression. A small aliquot of the cells was analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy with a UV light source to confirm the presence of GFP fluorescence within the cells as an indication of a successful transfection procedure. Harvested cells were counted, spun down (1000 × g for 10 min), and washed twice with PBS. Cell pellets were either processed immediately or left frozen at –80 °C. Cell pellets were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with Complete-mini protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche Applied Science) or His tag protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Different volumes of radioimmune precipitation buffer were used to normalize the number of cells per microliter (normally 2.5 × 104 cells/μl). After lysis for 10 min at room temperature and 20 min on ice, cells were spun down at 14,100 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants (10 μl/lane) were then analyzed by Western blotting as described below.Transfection of Sf9 Cells—pIZT/V5-His vectors carrying complete ORFs of all four Drosophila α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues with either the native stop codon or in frame with V5 coding sequence were used to transfect Sf9 cells using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol for insect cells. A small aliquot of the cells was analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy with a UV light source to confirm the presence of GFP fluorescence within the cells as an indication of successful transfection. Cells were collected 48 h post-transfection, washed once with PBS, and stored at –80 °C. For assaying, cells were lysed using 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with Complete-mini protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche Applied Science) or His tag protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) following the lysis protocol for Drosophila S2 cells. Different volumes of the buffer were used to normalize the number of cells per volume (to 1.25 × 104 cells/μl).Western Blotting—Cell lysates were mixed with 2× Laemmli loading buffer followed by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose sheets were reversibly stained with 0.5% Ponceau S (in 1% acetic acid) to verify that equal amounts of proteins were present in every lane. Subsequently, the membrane was blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with rabbit anti-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:20,000 in blocking buffer. After washing the nitrocellulose membrane three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, bound antibodies were detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), followed by color detection using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate. Alternatively, the expression of recombinant proteins in Sf9 cells was verified by probing the extracted proteins on Western blots with anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen; 1:5,000), followed by anti-mouse IgG (Fc-specific, alkaline phosphatase conjugate, 1:30,000; Sigma).Assay of Fucosyltransferase Activity—Activity of core α1,3-fucosyl-transferase from insect cell cultures was measured as previously described (18Leiter H. Mucha J. Staudacher E. Grimm R. Glössl J. Altmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21830-21839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with modifications using 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm AMP, 210 μm 6-acetamido-6-deoxycastanospermine, 0.4 mm GDP-fucose, and 25 μm dabsylated glycopeptide, with the sequence GENR in either the GnGn-, GnGnF6-, MM-, or GNGN-glycoforms (see Fig. 1 for oligosaccharide structures) supplemented with Complete-mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Reaction tubes were incubated at 23 °C and analyzed after 18 h. For analysis by MALDI-TOF MS, 0.5 μl of a 1:10 dilution of the reaction mixture was mixed with 0.5 μl of 1% α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid (Fluka; in 70% acetonitrile) on a MALDI plate. An increase in glycopeptide m/z by 146.1 Da indicated the transfer of one fucose residue to the reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine of the glycopeptide. For testing the substrate specificity of the recombinant Drosophila core α1,3-fucosyltransferase, a FLAG-tagged form of FucTA was expressed in Pichia pastoris under control of the AOX1 promoter using a modified form of the pPICZαC vector (Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody showing a protein with apparent size of Mr 75,000). After 4 days of expression at 16 °C, the enzyme was concentrated 10-fold (using UltraFree centrifugal concentration devices, molecular weight cut-off 30,000) and tested with dabsylated MGn-glycopeptide, which had been prepared from dabsylated MM-glycopeptide by the activity of FLAG-tagged human GnTI expressed also in P. pastoris at 16 °C, as well as with dabsylated MGnF6-glycopeptide that was prepared from the dabsylated MGn-glycopeptide by the activity of P. pastoris expressed C. elegans FUT-8 core α1,6-fucosyltransferase. The assays were performed using 0.1 mm glycopeptide, 2 mm GDP-fucose, 40 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2 at 30 °C for 4 h prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis as described for the insect cell line assays. The enzyme was also tested using a dansylated Man5GlcNAc2-glycopeptide, which was prepared after Pronase digestion of Aspergillus oryzae amylase. The resulting dansyl-Man5GlcNAc2 (0.2 mm) was incubated at 30 °C in the presence of supernatant of yeast expressing human GnTI (with or without a supernatant of yeast expressing C. elegans core α1,6-fucosyltransferase), 1 mm UDP-Glc-NAc, 1 mm GDP-Fuc, 40 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 10 mm MnCl2. After 12 h, an aliquot of a supernatant of yeast expressing FLAG-tagged Drosophila FucTA was added, and the incubation continued for another 24 h. The products were analyzed and purified by RP-HPLC under isocratic conditions (9% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid), collected, and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix.Developmental Stages and RT-PCR—Canton S or w–wild type D. melanogaster flies were maintained at room temperature. For different developmental stages, w–wild type was used; after a 1-h “precollection” phase, eggs were collected for 1.5 h on standard apple juice Petri dishes, and different developmental stages were collected. For the tissue specificity (i.e. gender-separated heads and bodies), the Canton S strain was used. Total RNAs from various stages were isolated by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by a first strand cDNA synthesis using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo (dT)18 as primer. Expression of Drosophila fucosyltransferase genes FucTA, FucTB, FucTC, and FucTD was analyzed by performing a 32–35 cycle PCR (55–60 °C for 30 min, 72 °C for 2 h; 94 °C for 30 min) using first strand cDNAs from staged flies and the following primers: FucTA, forward primer 5′-GGCCGACATGATCCTCTAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTTCTTCGTGAATGCGCTG-3′ (58 °C, 35 cycles); FucTB, forward primer 5′-CGCATCACCAACAAGCGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GACAAGGTTGTGGAGTAG-3′ (57 °C, 35 cycles); FucTC, forward primer 5′-CTTATCGCATTGACTCGGATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGCGGAATTCTCACAAACGTATTCGGCTTTGC-3′ (55 °C, 32 cycles); FucTD, forward primer 5′-CAATGCCGATAGACAGACTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTCCGGACACGCCGACG-3′ (60 °C, 35 cycles). The cDNAs were normalized against the rp49 transcript, coding for a ribosomal protein. The primers used, producing a 440-bp fragment, were as follows: rp49-fw, GACCATCCGCCCAGCATAC; rp49-rev, TCCGACCAGGTTACAAGAAC (60 °C).RNA Interference (RNAi) in a Drosophila Cell Line—Primers used to create the PCR templates for double-stranded RNA production contained a T7 promoter (GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA) at the 5′-end followed by gene-specific sequences as follows: FucTA, forward primer CCCACGGGCATTCGAC and reverse primer TGACGTCCTTGCGCGC; FucTB, forward primer TACGGCAGCTGCCTACG and reverse primer ATCAAACTCTGCGTCATTG; FucTC, forward primer GCTGGACGACGAACAAG and reverse primer GGATTGGATATCGTGGTAG; FucTD, forward primer AATTTGACAATGACCTATCG and reverse primer CCCAAGCTGTAGGATCTC; Nervana nrv2.2 (CG9261; GenBank™ accession U22440), forward primer CGACCCCTGCCCACCCGT and reverse primer GTAGCCCTCGGAGTTCTG. Commercial double-stranded DNA (clone CG6869; Open Biosystems) was also used as template for FucTA dsRNA synthesis. The PCR products were purified over GFX columns (Amersham Biosciences) and used as templates for in vitro transcription (Megascript T7 transcription kit; Ambion, Austin, TX) to produce dsRNA. The dsRNAs were precipitated by ethanol/sodium acetate and then resuspended in 20 μl of sterile deionized water. Dissolved dsRNA was incubated at 75 °C for 5 min and left at 23 °C to cool down to facilitate annealing of the RNA strands. To verify that the majority of the dsRNAs were intact and present as a single band, 2 μgof each were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gel. The amount and purity of dsRNA were also estimated by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. The dsRNAs were stored at –20 °C until use.To silence the aforementioned genes, RNAi was essentially performed as described by Worby et al. (19Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Dixon J.E. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : PL1Google Scholar). Drosophila BG2-c6 cells were diluted to a final concentration of 3–4 × 106 cells/ml in Shields and Sang M3 medium (Sigma) lacking FBS, and 1 ml was pipetted per well of a 6-well cell culture dish (Nunc). Thereafter, each individual dsRNA was immediately added to a final concentration of 70 nm, mixed vigorously, and incubated for 45 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 2 ml of Shields and Sang M3 medium (Sigma) containing FBS and insulin. The cells were collected after 4 days by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The cell pellets were lysed in the same way as for the transfected Drosophila S2 cells.Flow Cytometer Analysis of RNAi-treated Cells—For flow cytometer analysis, 2.25 × 106 cells treated with dsRNA were incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-HRP in PBS at 26 °C for 30 min, washed once with 5 ml of PBS, and then incubated with anti-rabbit FITC (Sigma) diluted 1:100 in PBS for another 30 min. Cells were again washed with 5 ml of PBS and resuspended in PBS to around 10,000 cells/μl and subject to flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur with a 488-nm argon Laser (15-milliwatt output power) in the standard configuration. FITC fluorescence was measured with a 530/30 BP filter in FL1.RESULTSA Drosophila Neuronal Cell Line Is Enriched in Difucosylated N-Glycans—Due to the challenges in collecting a sufficient amount of Drosophila heads to show by direct HPLC or MS analyses t"
https://openalex.org/W1993547947,"The region of human chromosome 11p15.5 is linked with Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome that is associated with susceptibility to Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and hepatoblastoma. TSSC5 (tumor-suppressing subchromosomal transferable fragment cDNA; also known as ORCTL2/IMPT1/BWR1A/SLC22A1L) is located in the region. The expression of TSSC5 and other genes in the region is regulated through paternal imprinting. Mutations and/or reduced expression of TSSC5 have been found in certain tumors. TSSC5 encodes an efflux transporter-like protein with 10 transmembrane domains, whose regulation may affect drug sensitivity, cellular metabolism and growth. Here, we present evidences indicating that RING105, a novel conserved RING-finger protein with a PA (protease-associated) domain and a PEST sequence, is a ubiquitin ligase for TSSC5 that can function in concert with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH6. The polyubiquitin target site on TSSC5 was mapped to a region in the 6th hydrophilic loop. Ectopic expression of RING105 in HeLa cells caused an accumulation of cells during G1 that was not observed with the expression of a form of RING105 in which a residue within the RING finger was mutated to inactivate its ligase activity. UbcH6-RING105 may define a novel ubiquitin–proteasome pathway that targets TSSC5 in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2116016084,"Cytochrome c peroxidases (CCP) play a key role in cellular detoxification by catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water. The di-heme CCP from Rhodobacter capsulatus is the fastest enzyme (1060 s-1), when tested with its physiological cytochrome c substrate, among all di-heme CCPs characterized to date and has, therefore, been an attractive target to investigate structure-function relationships for this family of enzymes. Here, we combine for the first time structural studies with site-directed mutagenesis and spectroscopic studies of the mutant enzymes to investigate the roles of amino acid residues that have previously been suggested to be important for activity. The crystal structure of R. capsulatus at 2.7 Å in the fully oxidized state confirms the overall molecular scaffold seen in other di-heme CCPs but further reveals that a segment of about 10 amino acids near the peroxide binding site is disordered in all four molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. Structural and sequence comparisons with other structurally characterized CCPs suggest that flexibility in this part of the molecular scaffold is an inherent molecular property of the R. capsulatus CCP and of CCPs in general and that it correlates with the levels of activity seen in CCPs characterized, thus, far. Mutagenesis studies support the spin switch model and the roles that Met-118, Glu-117, and Trp-97 play in this model. Our results help to clarify a number of aspects of the debate on structure-function relationships in this family of bacterial CCPs and set the stage for future studies.

It binds two heme c groups covalently and utilizes the two co-factors as platforms to catalyze the two-electron reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water by a one-electron donor such as ferrocytochrome c. 2Cytc(Fe2+)+H2O2+2H+→2Cytc(Fe3+)+2H2O The overall reaction for the bacterial di-heme peroxidases is similar to that in yeast and horseradish peroxidases, but the catalytic mechanism is significantly different. Eukaryotic cytochrome peroxidases possess only one, noncovalently bound heme b group, and since the reduction of peroxides requires two electrons, the reaction generates an oxy-ferryl center on the heme and a cation radical on Trp-191 or on the porphyrin ring of the heme. The second heme group in the BCCPs removes the need for cation radical formation. With the exception of the Nitrosomonas europaea enzyme (3.Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11878-11886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), BCCPs are only active in the mixed valence state in which the high potential, electron transferring heme is in the reduced state and the peroxidatic, low potential heme is in the Fe(III) state (4.Foote N.

Upon reduction of hydrogen peroxide, one electron is abstracted from the reduced high potential heme, which becomes reoxidized; this requires intramolecular electron transfer from the high to the low potential heme. The second electron is abstracted from the peroxidatic low potential heme group with the formation of an oxy-ferryl center. The high potential heme, with a midpoint potential of +270 mV, therefore, functions as the electron transferring heme, whereas the low potential heme has a midpoint potential between -190 and -310 mV (7.De Smet L. Pettigrew G.W. Van Beeumen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6559-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and is the peroxidatic center.

Moura I. Romao M.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 961-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have already been determined. The structure of the P. aeruginosa enzyme is that of the completely oxidized, inactive enzyme with bound calcium. That from N. europaea is also of the completely oxidized enzyme, but the peroxidase retains activity in this state. Recently, two distinct structural snapshots of CCP from P. nautica became available as the result of the serendipitous reduction of the C-terminal heme group by synchrotron X-rays used for the structural studies (10.Dias J.M. Alves T. Bonifacio C. Pereira A.S. Trincao J. Bourgeois D. Moura I. Romao M.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 961-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The inactive form did not contain Ca2+ and was captured in a closed conformation (IN-form) where the N-terminal peroxidatic heme was coordinated by six ligands, thus blocking the peroxidatic reaction from taking place. On the other hand, the active form does bind Ca2+ and exhibits an open conformation (OUT-form) with release of the distal histidine ligand, thus allowing peroxide access to the active site. These structural studies further suggested that a tryptophan residue found in the hydrophobic cavity at the interface of the low and high potential domains (Trp-94, Pseudomonas numbering) is a possible electron transfer conduit between the two heme groups because its indole ring interacts with the propionate groups of the two hemes. To date, the most thoroughly studied BCCPs are those from P. aeruginosa and Paracoccus pantotrophus (5.Gilmour R. Goodhew C.F. Pettigrew G.W. Prazeres S. Moura J.J. Moura I. Biochem.

Spectroscopic studies of these enzymes suggest the existence of a complex reaction mechanism that involves changes in the redox and spin states of the heme groups. In both cases, the completely oxidized CCP is inactive, whereas the mixed valence state reacts rapidly with hydrogen peroxide. In the completely oxidized enzyme the high potential electron-transferring C-terminal heme group is in high spin/low spin equilibrium and is ligated by a histidine and a methionine (14.Foote N. Peterson J. Gadsby P.M. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The second heme is a low potential group bound to the N-terminal domain and is coordinated by two histidines in the oxidized form (8.Fülöp V. Ridout C.J. Greenwood C. Hajdu J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1225-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Further studies of these two enzymes and of those of P. nautica and R. capsulatus revealed a dependence on Ca2+ ions, although the requirement of this ion for the function of P. aeruginosa CCP has not been fully investigated. However, the crystal structure of P. aeruginosa CCP does contain bound calcium even without the addition of the ion to any of the media used during purification and crystallization of the enzyme, suggesting that this BCCP also has an inherent affinity for calcium (8.Fülöp V. Ridout C.J. Greenwood C. Hajdu J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1225-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the current model of the reaction mechanism, reduction of the high potential heme results in a switch of the low potential heme to a high spin state, and calcium is essential for this switch. In the mixed-valence form, the sixth heme ligand of the N-terminal heme is released from the iron, and hydrogen peroxide can enter the active site to be reduced at the peroxidatic center. In almost all peroxidases a catalytic distal histidine is essential for promoting the heterolytic cleavage of the peroxide O-O bond. In the structure from the OUT-form of the P. nautica CCP and in that of the N. europaea CCP, His-74 (the sixth heme ligand of the NT heme in the complete oxidized form) is at a position where functioning as an acid-base catalyst is impossible. In chloroperoxidases a glutamic acid acts as an acid-base catalyst and helps to promote heterolytic cleavage of the peroxide O-O bond to form compound I (22.Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 461-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23.Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J Poulos T.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 24.Wagenknecht H.A. Woggon W.D. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 367-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the N. europaea CCP structure, a conserved glutamic acid is present near the active site, where it can act as the catalytic group. The side chain of this residue in the OUT form of the P. nautica enzyme points away from the active site and, therefore, is not in position to function as such a catalyst. Next to the acid-base catalyst, a conserved arginine and phenylalanine are present in the active site of yeast and horseradish cytochrome c peroxidase, which forms a ligand pocket for the peroxide. Through its charge, arginine makes the distal side more polar and helps to “pull” the O-O bond of the bound peroxide by stabilizing the separating charge. In the present paper we have determined the crystal structure of the R. capsulatus enzyme to compare it with the known structures of BCCPs and to complement the structure with site-directed mutagenesis studies. So far, proposals for the general mechanism of bacterial CCPs were only based on insights derived from spectroscopic and structural studies, whereas the field lacked site-directed mutagenesis data. In this respect our combined approach helps to evaluate and complement previous mechanistic proposals and to provide new insights. Crystallization and Structure Determination—Recombinant R. capsulatus CCP was prepared and crystallized as previously described (7.De Smet L. Pettigrew G.W. Van Beeumen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6559-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25.De Smet L. Leys D. Van Beeumen J.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 522-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Briefly, the periplasmic fraction was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column and eluted with a step gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl. The fractions between 0.2 and 0.3 m NaCl were pooled and concentrated using ammonium sulfate precipitation. The BCCP-containing fractions were separated on an octyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction column. As a polishing step, the BCCP was subjected to anion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme fractions were pure according to SDS-PAGE and mass-spectrometric analysis (7.De Smet L. Pettigrew G.W. Van Beeumen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6559-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis were obtained from 25% (w/v) polyethyleneglycol monomethyl ether 550, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.01 m ZnSO4; they appeared after 2-3 weeks at 294 K. Crystals of RcCCP belong to space group P212121 with unit-cell parameters a = 64.6 Å, b = 132.5 Å, and c = 163.9 Å and contained four molecules of RcCCP in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The crystals diffracted poorly using our in-house x-ray source (FR591 rotating-anode generator, Bruker-Nonius) but yielded a complete data set to 2.7 Å at beamline X11 (EMBL-DESY, Hamburg) (Table 1). The structure was determined by molecular replacement methods with the program CNS (26.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Structure. 1995; 3: 1225-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) as a search model, with non-conserved amino acid residues mutated to alanines. PaCCP emerged as the most suitable search model following structure-based sequence alignments of CCPs of known structure against the sequence of RcCCP. Initially, plausible rotation and translation functions for one RcCCP protomer were identified and subsequently used to search for the remaining three molecules of RcCCP in the crystal asymmetric unit. As expected, the four molecules were arranged as two dimers. Placement of the model was optimized by rigid-body refinement. The correctness of the structure solution was assessed from the quality of the electron density for missing side chains and other unique structural features. Several rounds of model building were subsequently alternated with further crystallographic refinement employing simulated-annealing, conjugate-gradient minimization, and individual B-factor refinement using a maximum-likelihood target function as implemented in CNS (26.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to main-chain atoms and were optimized throughout refinement to account for the higher structural mobility in loop regions and elsewhere in the structure. The structure contains eight well ordered Zn2+ ions at crystal contact regions, consistent with the absolute requirement for ZnSO4 in obtaining diffraction-quality crystals. The stereochemical correctness of the final model was assessed with the program MOLPROBITY (27.Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I.W. Word J.M. Prisant M.J. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar). The structure was found to have good stereochemistry, with 95% of all ϕ/Ψ angles located in the favored regions of the Ramachandran plot.TABLE 1Data collection and crystallographic refinement for R. capsulatus CCPData collection Space groupP212121 Source, wavelengthDESY/X11, 1 Å Reflections (total/unique)414706/39539 Completeness (%)95.2 (95.7)aNumbers in parentheses correspond to values in the highest resolution shell (2.8–2.7 Å) Rsym (%)bRsym = Σ | I – 〈I 〉 | / ΣI, where I = the observed intensity, and 〈I 〉 = the average intensity for symmetry-related reflections12.5 (39.4) I/σ (I)9.2 (3.1)Refinement (PDB code 1ZZH) Resolution (Å)30–2.7 |F|/σ (|F|)0 Number of reflections (working set/test set)35,681/1,877 Molecules per asymmetric unit4 Protein atoms8,898 Heme-group atoms344 Water molecules36 Ca2+4 Zn2+8 Rcryst, Rfree0.249 (0.372), 0.278 (0.408) B-values (Å2) Protein (chains A/B/C/D)51/46/45/47 Heme groups (ALP, AHP/BLP, BHP48, 45/36, 43 Heme groups CLP, CHP/DLP, DHP41, 40/43, 41 Ca2+ (A/B/C/B)46/40/46/54 Water26 r.m.s.d.

PCR was carried out in a 50-μl mixture using 50-ng template plasmid DNA (pMC-ccp) (7.De Smet L. Pettigrew G.W. Van Beeumen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6559-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), 125 ng of each primer carrying the mutation, 10 nmol of dNTPs, and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in Pfu polymerase reaction buffer. The thermal cycler was programmed as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 10 min. One microliter (20 units) of DpnI (New England Biolabs) was added to the sample (50 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Two microliters of the DpnI-treated PCR reaction was used to transform competent Escherichia coli cells (XL1-Blue). The mutant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (7.De Smet L. Pettigrew G.W. Van Beeumen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6559-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The folding was verified by gel filtration chromatography on a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75 prep (Biosciences) column using 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl as eluent. All mutant enzymes eluted at a volume corresponding to a dimer. Peroxidase Assay—R. capsulatus bacterial cytochrome c peroxidase can use mitochondrial cytochrome c and R. capsulatus cytochrome c2 as electron donors (7.De Smet L. Pettigrew G.W. Van Beeumen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6559-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The activity of the enzyme was monitored through the decrease in absorbance of the α-band of the ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm. The assay mix was composed of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 6 μm ferrocytochrome c, and 18 μm H2O2 and was stirred continuously (3.Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11878-11886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was started through the addition of the enzyme to a final concentration of 1.3 nm. The reaction is first order toward horse ferrocytochrome c under conditions where the reaction is rapid. Under such conditions, the initial velocity (v) can be calculated by determining the pseudo-first-order rate constant (k) and by use of the relationship v = k[Cr], where Cr is concentration of the ferrocytochrome. Potentiometric Redox Titrations—The titrations were performed as described previously (7.De Smet L. Pettigrew G.W. Van Beeumen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6559-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cyanide Titrations—A volume of 500 μl of 4 μm protein in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, was titrated by the addition of different amounts of a neutralized sodium cyanide solution. The wild-type enzyme and M118L mutant were titrated with 0, 1, 3, 5, 25, 65, 105, 205, and 305 μm sodium cyanide, and the M118H mutant was titrated with 0, 1, 3, 5, 105, 205, 305, 405, and 505 μm sodium cyanide. The titration was carried out on the calcium-activated mixed-valence state of the wild-type and mutant peroxidase.

Romao M.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 961-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The tertiary structure is organized into two domains that stack on top of each other and create an interaction interface of about 1200 Å (2.Hu W. De Smet L. Van Driessche G. Bartsch R.G. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Each domain features a classical c-type cytochrome fold (29.Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R. Cytochromes c: Biological Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Google Scholar) and harbors a covalently bound heme center. The low potential domain (LP) is almost entirely helical and is defined by residues 20-167 and 306-326. It contains a hydrophobic pocket that binds the low potential heme center via the heme binding motif Cys-54-X2-Cys-57—His-58... His-74, with His-58 and His-74 being the axial ligands. On the other hand, the high potential domain (HP) contains a more balanced mixture of secondary structure and is formed by residues 4-19 and 168-305. The HP domain has His-204 and Met-278 as the axial ligands to the heme and employs the heme binding motif Cys-200-X2-Y—Cys-203—His-204... Met-278 to bind to the heme center. The two iron ions are about 20 Å from each other. The interface between the two domains takes the form of a hydrophobic cavity and accommodates a calcium ion that is equidistant (12 Å) from the iron centers of the LP and HP heme groups. Based on temperature factor (B-factor) comparisons, this Ca2+ is present at full occupancy in all four molecules of RcCCP in the asymmetric unit of the crystal and is coordinated by five ligands: Asn-82 Oδ1, Thr-259 C = O, Pro-261 C = O, and two water molecules (Fig. 1B). This geometry is analogous to that observed in the PaCCP and PnCCP-OUT structures (8.Fülöp V. Ridout C.J. Greenwood C. Hajdu J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1225-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10.Dias J.M. Alves T. Bonifacio C. Pereira A.S. Trincao J. Bourgeois D. Moura I. Romao M.J.

As in PaCCP and PnCCP, the charge of the calcium ion in RcCCP is not countered by negatively charged groups, suggesting that it can act as a modulator of electron transfer between the two heme domains. Structural Comparisons with Other CCP Structures—Pairwise structural overlays of RcCCP against PaCCP (8.Fülöp V. Ridout C.J. Greenwood C. Hajdu J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1225-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the IN-form of PnCCP (10.Dias J.M. Alves T. Bonifacio C. Pereira A.S. Trincao J. Bourgeois D. Moura I. Romao M.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 961-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reveal that the three enzymes are very similar overall, as expected from their high sequence identity (RcCCP versus PaCCP: 1.34 Å r.m.s.d. for 293 Cα atoms; RcCCP versus PnCCP-in: 1.58 Å r.m.s.d. for 297 Cα atoms) (Fig. 1C). Rather unexpectedly, however, the three structures exhibit significant structural differences in the LP domain and, more specifically, in the structural segment (defined by residues 108-118 in RcCCP) just adjacent to the flexible loop that contributes His-74 as a ligand to the low potential heme (Fig. 1D). During catalysis this loop loses its ligation to the low potential heme group via His-74 and swings outward to make room for the incoming peroxide (9.Shimizu H. Schuller D.J. Lanzilotta W.N.

Bourgeois D. Moura I. Romao M.J. Structure. 2004; 12: 961-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In PaCCP, the equivalent segment to residues 108-118 is well ordered and forms a helix (Fig. 1D). In PnCCP-IN this segment is significantly more extended with much less secondary structure and higher B-factors (Fig. 1D). In RcCCP, however, this segment is completely disordered. Crystal packing analysis revealed that residues 108-118 in RcCCP in all four molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal are not involved in crystal contacts. Similar analyses for the other two enzymes indicated the same feature. RcCCP is the only enzyme of the three considered here that has been crystallized with more than one molecule in the asymmetric unit of the crystal and, therefore, offers an opportunity to visualize the intrinsic conformational diversity of the molecule. Pairwise superpositions of these four crystallographically observed RcCCP molecules reveal overall r.m.s.d. values between 0.27 and 0.4 Å for all Cα atoms, indicating a strong conservation of conformational space. Interestingly, the most pronounced local structural differences concern residues 104-107 (1.8 Å r.m.s.d.), i.e. the four residues preceding t"

Here, using live cell imaging and inverted fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we demonstrate that ataxin-7 has the ability to export from the nucleus via the CRM-1/exportin pathway and that ataxin-7 contains a classic leucine-type nuclear export signal (NES). We have precisely defined the location of this NES in ataxin-7 and found it to be fully conserved in all vertebrate species. Polyglutamine expansion was seen to reduce the nuclear export rate of mutant ataxin-7 relative to wild-type ataxin-7. Subtle point mutation of the NES in polyglutamine expanded ataxin-7 increased toxicity in primary cerebellar neurons in a polyglutamine length-dependent manner in the context of full-length ataxin-7. Our results add ataxin-7 to a growing list of polyglutamine disease proteins that are capable of nuclear shuttling, and we define an activity of ataxin-7 in the STAGA complex of trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

La Spada A.R. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 100: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). SCA7 is a member of a family of neurodegenerative diseases in which a CAG DNA triplet repeat expansion results in polyglutamine expansion in the gene product (2Lebre A.S. Brice A. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 100: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Other members of this polyglutamine expansion disease family include Huntington disease, spinobulbar muscle atrophy, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 (3Nakamura K.

Sanders M.D. Harding A.E. Brain. 1994; 117: 445-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mutant ataxin-7 protein can have polyglutamine repeats from 38 to 300 residues in length (6David G. Abbas N. Stevanin G. Durr A. Yvert G. Cancel G. Weber C. Imbert G. Saudou F. Antoniou E.

Ataxin-7 subcellular localization has been seen to be primarily nuclear with nuclear import signals (NLSs) defined in both the central (7Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Skinner P.J. Koob M.D. Ranum L.P.

La Spada A.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, ataxin-7 is known to be a subunit of the mammalian GCN5 histone acetyltransferase STAGA transcription coactivator complex (9Helmlinger D. Hardy S. Sasorith S. Klein F. Robert F.

Ataxin-7 directly binds GCN5, and mutant ataxin-7 can inhibit the histone acetyltransferase activity of STAGA (10Palhan V.B. Chen S. Peng G.H. Tjernberg A. Gamper A.M. Fan Y. Chait B.T. La Spada A.R.

Although the precise biological function of ataxin-7 is unknown, mutant ataxin-7 is known to interfere with Crx-dependent transcription of retinal photoreceptor-specific genes (11Yoo S.Y.

Ataxin-7 interacts with TFTC/STAGA protein subunits through a central evolutionarily conserved block of residues that have defined an ataxin-7 homology family in species ranging from human to yeast (9Helmlinger D.

Ellerby, submitted for publication.In this study, we have examined the subcellular localization of ataxin-7 and ataxin-7 fragments in cultured cells by live cell microscopy and aequoria fluorescent protein fusion technology. In fragments of ataxin-7 containing a defined NLS (7Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Skinner P.J. Koob M.D. Ranum L.P. Orr H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and a leucine-rich evolutionarily conserved region (9Helmlinger D. Hardy S. Sasorith S. Klein F. Robert F. Weber C. Miguet L. Potier N. Van-Dorsselaer A. Wurtz J.M. Mandel J.L. Tora L. Devys D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we observed a predominantly cytoplasmic distribution, indicating the possible presence of a nuclear export signal (NES) in this region of ataxin-7. Treatment of cells expressing these ataxin-7 fragments with the CRM-1/exportin inhibitor compound leptomycin B (20Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 21Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar) led to the nuclear accumulation of these fragments, indicating that ataxin-7 could export from the nucleus by the CRM-1/exportin pathway. By a live cell nucleocytoplasmic inverted fluorescence after photobleaching (iFRAP) shuttling assay (22Howell J.L. Truant R. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (84, 86-87): 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we found that ataxin-7 had the ability to shuttle to and from the nucleus. We precisely defined the position of the NES in ataxin-7 and found it to be typical of leucine-type NESs, highly conserved, and that it could be inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis, preventing ataxin-7 nuclear export. In primary granule cerebellar neurons, mutation of the ataxin-7 NES was seen to significantly increase cell toxicity, but only in the context of full-length ataxin-7 with all of its nuclear localization signals intact. The nuclear shuttling ability of ataxin-7 adds this protein into a growing list of polyglutamine disease proteins that have the ability to shuttle to and from the nucleus and suggests that the role of ataxin-7 in STAGA/SAGA/SLIK may be to traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression Plasmids—The plasmids encoding ataxin-7 and ataxin-7 (344–892) were made in the following manner. The plasmids encoding EGFP-ataxin-7 (Q10) (pMV014) and EGFP-ataxin-7 (Q64) (pMV015) were made by digesting pTAG-SCA7 (Q10) and pTAG-SCA7 (Q64) with EcoRI and EcoRV. The resulting 2.7-kb ((CAG)10) and 2.8-kb ((CAG)64) fragments were ligated into EcoRI/SmaI-digested pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences). The plasmid encoding EGFP-ataxin-7 (344–892) (pMV020) was made by PCR amplification using pTAGA-hr-GFP-SCA7 (Q10) as a template and primers RT0399 and RT0371 to truncate the SCA7 gene and introduce BglII and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The PCR product was digested with BglII and EcoRI and ligated into BglII/EcoRI-digested pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences). The inserts for the plasmids encoding EGFP-ataxin-7 (1–619) (Q10) (pJT018) and EGFP-ataxin-7 (1–619) (Q64) (pJT019) were made by digesting pTAG-SCA7 (Q10) and pTAG-SCA7 (Q64) with EcoRI and KpnI. The resulting 1.9-kb ((CAG)10) and 2.0-kb ((CAG)64) fragments were ligated into EcoRI/KpnI-digested pEGFP-C2. The inserts for the plasmids encoding the EGFP-ataxin-7 (1–619) (Q10)V349S I350T (pJT020) and EGFP-ataxin-7 (1–619) (Q64) V349S I350T (pJT021) NES mutants were made by recombinant PCR. Complimentary mutagenic primers RT0419 and RT420 were used to introduce the point mutations encoding for the V349S I350T amino acid changes in the putative NES of ataxin-7 and a ScaI restriction site. The final PCR product was digested at endogenous restriction sites with PstI and BspEI, and the resulting 0.6-kb fragment was ligated into a 6.0-kb fragment resulting from PstI/BspEI digestion of pJT018 and a 6.1-kb fragment resulting from PstI/BspEI digestion of pJT019. The plasmids encoding EGFP-ataxin-7 (228–619) (pJT024) and EGFP-ataxin-7 (228–619) V349S I350T (pJT025) were made by digesting pJT018 and pJT020 with PstI and KpnI and ligating the resulting 1.2-kb fragments into PstI/KpnI-digested pEGFP-C3. For the plasmid encoding EGFP-ataxin-7 (619–892) (pJG006), pTAG-SCA7 (Q10) cDNA was digested with KpnI and EcoRV, and the resulting 0.8-kb fragment was ligated into KpnI/EcoRV-digested pEGFP-C3 (BD Biosciences). The plasmid encoding EGFP-ataxin 7 (1–230) (Q10) was made by digesting pJT018 and pJT033 plasmids with NheI and PstI and ligating the resulting 1.4-kb fragment from pJT018 with the 4.0-kb fragment from pJT033. The pJT033 plasmid was made by digesting pJT034 and pJT018 with NheI and XmnI and ligating the resulting 4.2-kb fragment from pJT034 with the 1.6-kb band from pJT018. The pJT034 plasmid was made by PCR amplification of a region of pTAG-SCA7 (Q10) encoding ataxin-7 (1–343) using primers RT0441 and RT0442 to introduce HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The PCR product was digested with HindIII and EcoRI and ligated into HindIII/EcoRI-digested pEGFP-C1. For the plasmids encoding EGFP-ataxin-7 (1–344) (Q10), the region of cDNA encoding ataxin-7 (201–344) was PCR-amplified using pMV014 as a template to introduce a BamHI restriction site at the 3′ end and a stop codon following amino acid 344. SV40Tag NLS (PKKKRKVR) EGFP-IκBα expression plasmid was purchased from BD Biosciences. All of the constructed plasmids were PCR-sequenced at fusion junctions, mutations, or CAG repeats at the McMaster Sequencing Facility.Cell Culture and Transfections—The cell lines used were mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells (ATCC, CRL-1658) grown and passaged by ATCC specifications. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 10% CO2. For the purposes of live cell microscopy, ∼100,000–150,000 cells were seeded on 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes 18–24 h before transfection. The culture dishes were prepared using a procedure based on that described elsewhere (22Howell J.L. Truant R. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (84, 86-87): 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The cells were transfected using polyethylenimine (Exgen 500, MBI Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize expression, transfection conditions were optimized for the limit of EGFP-ataxin-7 protein detection on an imaging system optimized for EGFP detection. One microgram of DNA was transfected per 35-mm culture dish, and imaging was carried out at 14–18 h post-transfection. For CRM-1/exportin inhibition experiments, the cells were treated with 5 ng/ml leptomycin B (Sigma) for 20–23 h in serum-free medium, conditions empirically determined to cause nuclear accumulation of EGFP-IκBα (BD Biosciences). All ataxin-7 EGFP fusion moieties were tested by Western blot analysis and found to be intact with no apparent degradation after 24 h of expression, typically 8 h after the imaging experiments were performed.Live Cell Microscopy—Epifluorescence microscopy was performed on a Nikon TE200 inverted fluorescence microscope with a 175 W xenon arc lamp (Sutter Instruments) light source. Nikon 63× plan apochromat (NA 1.3) or 100× plan apochromat (NA 1.4) oil immersion objectives were used. Specific EGFP filter sets were used for EGFP imaging, and Texas Red filter sets were used for mRFP imaging (Chroma Technologies). The images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA100 digital camera and SimplePCI 5.2 software (C-imaging). Quantitation of intensity was done using SimplePCI “Mass” (intensity × area) measurement for the nucleus divided by the Mass measurement of the total cell. The cells were imaged at the lower limit of detection after transfection, typically 14–18 h. The results presented are typical of 200 cells observed for each construct accumulated over at least three independent experiments. The statistical significance of results was determined using a Student's t test. The images were captured “self-blinded” using cotransfection of mRFP expression plasmid, as described elsewhere (23Voss T.C. Demarco I.A. Day R.N. BioTechniques. 2005; 38: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were only visualized by red channel fluorescence (mRFP) at the time of image capture to identify only healthy transfected cells, without observing green fluorescence. The images were then captured in both red and green channels. Green (EGFP) channel data were only measured after cells were blindly observed and imaged.Live Cell iFRAP Shuttling Assays—The qualitative live cell iFRAP shuttle assays were performed essentially as described elsewhere (22Howell J.L. Truant R. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (84, 86-87): 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. iFRAP experiments of NES mutant ataxin-7 in single cells were done 18 h post-transfection in NIH3T3 cells in the presence of cycloheximide. For full-length ataxin-7 export measurements in single cells, the photo-multiplier detector settings were set to maximum to detect cytoplasmic fluorescence. Subsequently, the nucleus was not measured for fluorescence loss, because >80% of pixels in the nucleus were at or above maximum intensity. Only cytoplasmic recovery could be accurately measured. Quantitation of recovery was done on raw data TIFF images exported from LSM 510 5.0 software. Mean pixel intensity levels and area measurements were conducted with NIH Image J software.Immunocytochemistry Studies with Transiently Transfected Cerebellar Granule Cell Neurons—Neurons were cultured from 7-day-old mice as described previously (24Gao W.O. Heintz N. Hatten M.E. Neuron. 1991; 6: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). For purification and coculture of identified cell populations, briefly, the cerebella were dissected from 7-day-old mice and minced in cold Hanks' buffered saline. Tissue was trypsinized for 25 min at 37 °C and then dissociated by titration with a P1000 pipette tip. The cells were counted and plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml in basal medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 25 mm KCl, 9.5 mm glucose, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Twenty-four hours after plating, cytosine arabinoside was added (10 μm). This resulted in a culture of 95% granule cell neurons. After 5 days in culture, the neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were fixed at 24 h post-transfection and stained with a polyclonal antibody for active caspase-3 (1:200; Cell Signaling) and monoclonal mitogen-activated protein 2 antibody (1:500; Chemicon). The nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33258 dye (4 μg/ml). The images were captured at 40× with an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss). Toxicity was determined by looking at nuclear morphology, caspase-3 activity, and loss of Map2-positive dendrites. All of the plasmids assayed were designated with a coded name only, and the assays were performed blinded.RESULTSSubcellular Localization in Live Cells—In mouse model studies and human brains, ataxin-7 is seen in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (15Mauger C. Del-Favero J. Ceuterick C. Lubke U. van Broeckhoven C. Martin J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 74: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Garden G.A. Libby R.T. Fu Y.H. Kinoshita Y. Huang J. Possin D.E. Smith A.C. Martinez R.A. Fine G.C. Grote S.K. Ware C.B. Einum D.D. Morrison R.S. Ptacek L.J. Sopher B.L. La Spada A.R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4897-4905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein may reside in either compartment or dynamically traffic between the two compartments. In cell culture models, ataxin-7 is predominantly nuclear (7Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Skinner P.J. Koob M.D. Ranum L.P. Orr H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Zander C. Takahashi J. El Hachimi K.H. Fujigasaki H. Albanese V. Lebre A.S. Stevanin G. Duyckaerts C. Brice A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2569-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To examine whether there might be additional nuclear transport signals to those previously described (7Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Skinner P.J. Koob M.D. Ranum L.P. Orr H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Chen S. Peng G.H. Wang X. Smith A.C. Grote S.K. Sopher B.L. La Spada A.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we expressed human wild-type (Q10) and polyglutamine-expanded mutant (Q64) ataxin-7 and fragments as EGFP fusion proteins and observed them in live NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1A). As seen in Fig. 1B, both wild-type and mutant ataxin-7 localized primarily to the nucleus (panels a and b), as did a carboxyl-terminal fragment containing two basic stretches of residues, previously shown to be NLSs by fixed cell immunofluorescence (8Chen S. Peng G.H. Wang X. Smith A.C. Grote S.K. Sopher B.L. La Spada A.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (panel g). This indicated that EGFP carboxyl-terminal fusions were not disrupting the normal nuclear localization of ataxin-7. Expansion of polyglutamine from 10 to 64 repeats did not affect the subcellular localization of ataxin-7 but did induce the presence of nuclear inclusions. An amino-terminal truncation of ataxin-7 (1–619), and the central region of ataxin-7 (228–619) (Fig. 1, panels d–f), both displayed weak nuclear localization despite the presence of an NLS in these fragments (7Kaytor M.D. Duvick L.A. Skinner P.J. Koob M.D. Ranum L.P. Orr H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, ataxin-7 could have either a cytoplasmic retention signal or an NES within a fragment of 228–619 amino acids.Ataxin-7 Is Capable of Nucleocytoplasmic Trafficking—Many proteins that contain nuclear localization signals also rely on nuclear export signals for their biological function (26Fornerod M. Ohno M. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2002; 35: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To assess whether ataxin-7 localized statically to both the nucleus and cytoplasm or whether ataxin-7 shuttled dynamically between the two compartments, we used a live cell nucleocytoplasmic transport assay by iFRAP analysis (22Howell J.L. Truant R. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (84, 86-87): 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this assay, a nuclear protein is fused to EGFP and expressed in polyethylene glycol-fused cells to generate binucleate cells or bikaryons (Fig. 2, panel a). The cells are treated with cycloheximide to prevent new protein synthesis, and the entire area of the bikaryon except one nucleus (donor) is photobleached by a 488-nm laser to irreversibly destroy the fluorescence of those molecules (Fig. 2, panel c). The images are then successively captured at timed intervals to detect fluorescence recovery into the bleached nucleus (acceptor) (panels d–f). Recovery into the acceptor nucleus indicates active export of ataxin-7 from the donor nucleus and active import into the acceptor nucleus, thus nuclear shuttling. From this assay, we could detect ataxin-7 shuttling as early as 10 min post-bleaching (Fig. 2, panel e), a similar time scale as seen with a known shuttling protein, the mRNA processing factor hnRNPA1 (22Howell J.L.

In these assays, both wild-type (Fig. 2) and polyglutamine-expanded mutant (Q64) ataxin-7 (data not shown) were observed to dynamically import to and export from the nucleus.FIGURE 2Ataxin-7 can dynamically traffic in and out of the nucleus. A live cell iFRAP nuclear transport assay in NIH 3T3 cells with wild-type (Q10) EGFP-ataxin-7 expressed in a bikaryon is shown.

Panels d–f, bleach recovery post-bleaching at 0 (panel d), 10 (panel e), and 20 min (panel f). Recovery is seen in the acceptor, or bleached nucleus, starting at 10 min (panel e), indicating export of ataxin-7 from the unbleached donor nucleus and import to the acceptor nucleus.

Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and a data base of known NESs (28la Cour T. Gupta R. Rapacki K. Skriver K. Poulsen F.M. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We noted the presence of a hydrophobic residue-rich sequence within the defined conserved block II of ataxin-7. Classical leucine-rich nuclear export signals are often seen to export from the nucleus by the CRM-1/exportin pathway (21Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The CRM-1/exportin-specific inhibitory compound, leptomycin B (20Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), was used to treat ataxin-7 fragment expressing cells to see whether these fragments would shift in localization toward the nucleus, because of inhibition of export in the same time frame as a known exportin-dependent NES-containing protein, IκBα (29Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3, nuclear accumulation of ataxin-7 fragments, in either the wild-type or polyglutamine-expanded mutant was seen after 20 h of 5 ng/ml leptomycin B treatment (Fig. 3, panels c, e, and g versus panels d, f, and h). The same time frame and leptomycin B concentration was required to see nuclear accumulation of IκBα (panels a and b). Therefore, ataxin-7 uses the CRM-1/exportin pathway to exit the nucleus.FIGURE 3Ataxin-7 exports from the nucleus via the CRM-1/exportin pathway.

Therefore, we wanted to know whether this nuclear export was being mediated directly by signal sequences in ataxin-7 or potentially by another associated protein. We compared the leucine/methionine/valine-rich region to see whether any sequence existed that could fit into a loose NES consensus (27Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2046670265,"In silico studies carried out by using a computer model of oxidative phosphorylation and anaerobic glycolysis in skeletal muscle demonstrated that deamination of AMP to IMP during heavy short term exercise and/or hypoxia lessens the acidification of myocytes. The concerted action of adenylate kinase and AMP deaminase, leading to a decrease in the total adenine nucleotide pool, constitutes an additional process consuming ADP and producing ATP. It diminishes the amount of ADP that must be converted to ATP by other processes in order to meet the rate of ADP production by ATPases (because the adenylate kinase + AMP deaminase system produces only 1 ATP per 2 ADPs used, ATP consumption is not matched by ATP production, and the reduction of the total adenine nucleotide pool occurs mostly at the cost of [ATP]). As a result, the rate of ADP consumption by other processes may be lowered. This effect concerns mostly ADP consumption by anaerobic glycolysis that is inhibited by AMP deamination-induced decrease in [ADP] and [AMP], and not oxidative phosphorylation, because during heavy exercise and/or hypoxia [ADP] is significantly greater than the Km value of this process for ADP. The resultant reduction of proton production by anaerobic glycolysis enables us to delay the termination of exercise because of fatigue and/or to diminish cell damage."

Interest in the topologically intricate mitochondrial DNA (kinetoplast or kDNA) of Trypanosoma brucei brucei and related kinetoplastid protozoan parasites has led to many reports of type II topoisomerases that participate in kDNA metabolism (we term the T. brucei brucei gene TbTOP2mt). We have now identified and characterized two new genes for type II topoisomerases in T. brucei brucei, termed TbTOP2α and TbTOP2β. Phylogenetically, they share a common node with other nuclear topoisomerases, clearly distinct from a clade that includes the previously reported kinetoplastid genes, all of which are homologs of TbTOP2mt. Southern blot analysis reveals the new genes are single copy and positioned ∼1.7 kb apart. Cognate mRNAs are expressed in African trypanosomes, but only a single message is detected in Leishmania or Crithidia. TbTOP2α encodes an ATP-dependent topoisomerase that appears as a single ∼170-kDa band on immunoblots and localizes to the nucleus; RNA interference leads to pleomorphic nuclear (but not kDNA) abnormalities and early growth arrest. The role of TbTOP2β is unclear. Although transcribed in trypanosomes, TbTOP2β is not detected by β-specific antiserum, and RNAi silencing results in no obvious phenotype. These studies indicate that African trypanosomes and related kinetoplastid human pathogens are unusual in having independent topoisomerase II genes to service their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and they highlight TbTOP2α as a promising target for the development of much-needed new therapies.

Type II enzymes, which make double-stranded breaks in the DNA substrate via a phosphodiester linkage of active site tyrosines with the DNA backbone, can be further divided into type IIA and IIB subfamilies, which share common mechanistic features but vary in structure (13Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). Because there is no evidence to date for fully functional type IIB enzymes in either mammalian or kinetoplastid cells, we hereafter refer to the type IIAs simply as type II. In mammalian cells, the type II enzymes are represented by two isoforms, topoisomerase IIα and -β, both of which localize to the nucleus and play a role in mitosis and/or meiosis. Topoisomerase II activity serving the mitochondrial genome of mammalian cells has been described only recently (14Low R.L. Orton S. Friedman D.B. Eur. J.

To date, topoisomerase II activity has been purified from Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma equiperdum (15Douc-Rasy S. Riou J.F. Ahomadegbe J.C. Riou G. Biol.

The above genes share a high degree of identity (≥65%) with one another at the amino acid level, and when studied their products immunolocalize predominantly, if not exclusively, to the mitochondrion (26Melendy T.

Our previous studies with topoisomerase inhibitors suggested that trypanosomes might have more than one type II enzyme (29Shapiro T.A. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); however, separate enzymatic activities were not detectable when cell extracts were fractionated, and the source for nuclear topoisomerase II activity has remained unknown.In this study we describe two new topoisomerase II genes from T. brucei brucei, TbTOP2α and TbTOP2β. The product of TbTOP2α localizes to the nucleus, demonstrates ATP-dependent type II topoisomerase activity, and its silencing leads to growth arrest and severe defects in nuclear (but not mitochondrial) DNA. TbTOP2β expression is detected at the mRNA level in several species of African trypanosomes but presents no apparent phenotype when silenced. The role of TbTOP2β, if any, remains unclear.

All sequencing and RNAi experiments were done with procyclic strain 427.Identification of Topoisomerase II Genes—T. brucei brucei mRNA purified with Oligotex® mRNA mini kit (Qiagen) was used in first strand cDNA synthesis with poly(dT) primer (ProSTARTM First Strand RT-PCR kit; Stratagene). For TbTOP2α, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using splice leader sequence (37Parsons M. Nelson R.G. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Cell. 1984; 38: 309-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (GCGTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG, sense primer) and nucleotide sequence from the EST as antisense primer (CATTAGGAATCACAGGAACATAGTAAAAAGGTTC). 3′-RACE was then performed with sequence from a region upstream of the 5′-end of the EST (CGTCCGGAACGTATCCTACTCTG, sense primer) and oligo(dT)35 antisense primer. Resulting PCR products were sequenced and assembled into a single contig. For confirmation the entire TbTOP2α message was amplified from poly(dT) cDNA with specific primers and cloned into pBluescript® II KS(+) plasmid (Stratagene), and both strands were sequenced.For TbTOP2β, BLAST searches of the T. brucei brucei Genome Project data base (TIGR) using EST sequence as query identified two P1 clones as follows: 9C4.TP, 8I15.TF, and a single sheared DNA clone 35N15.TR. The assembled EST-containing contig, distinct from the sequence of TbTOP2α, lacked a termination codon. Additional 3′-end sequence, including the stop codon, was obtained by sequencing the entire 35N15 clone obtained by PCR from genomic DNA. The 3′-untranslated region was determined from poly(dT) cDNA by sequencing the product of 3′-RACE with gene-specific sequence GCGTTCCAAGTCAGAATCACCAG as sense primer and oligo(dT)35 as antisense primer. The intergenic region separating TbTOP2α and TbTOP2β was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using primers specific to the coding regions of the α (CAGATGATTTGGACCTTGACTG, sense primer) and β gene (AGAAATAATCTCTGAGTTTTCCGACGCC, antisense primer). The latter antisense primer was used to obtain the 5′-untranslated region for the β gene by 5′-RACE analysis with sense primers encompassing each putative splice site upstream from the first ATG codon. Finally, the entire cDNA of the TbTOP2β was amplified with specific primers, cloned into pBluescript® II KS (+) plasmid (Stratagene), and sequenced.Southern and Northern Blotting—Genomic DNA from procyclic strain 427 was purified, cut with restriction endonucleases, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was purified from cell lysates with RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen), separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes. 32P-Labeled probes were prepared by random priming (MegaPrime DNA labeling kit; Amersham Biosciences) of the following DNA templates: Alpha (nucleotides 3630–4299 of TbTOP2α coding sequence), Beta (nucleotides 3724–4373 of TbTOP2β coding sequence), Linker (nucleotides 1601–2150 of TbTOP2α, 90.6% identity with nucleotides 1724–2273 of TbTOP2β), TbTOP2mt (nucleotides 3001–3650 of TbTOP2mt coding sequence), α-tubulin (nucleotides 1–650 of T. brucei brucei α-tubulin gene, AL929605) (Fig. 1A), and LmT2A (nucleotides 781–1065 of L. major putative topoisomerase II, CAB72310).

Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony (and other methods) (40Swofford D.L. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (and Other Methods). 4th Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2002Google Scholar), with default parameters, was used for tree reconstruction (maximum parsimony method) and bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates).RNAi Plasmid Constructs—All constructs for RNAi were made in pLew 100 (34Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar); RNAi sequences were identical to probe regions described above. To make constructs for Linker and Beta targets, inserts were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA, using primers containing HindIII/SphI (forward insert) or BamHI/MluI (reverse insert) sites at their 5′- or 3′-ends, respectively. Digested and gel-purified forward inserts were ligated into HindIII-SphI-digested pET-29a plasmid (Novagen). Next, MluI-digested reverse inserts were ligated into MluI-HpaI-digested pET-29a containing the forward insert. Finally, the entire construct, including 525-bp fragment of pET-29a (flanked by SphI and MluI sites) serving as a stuffer, was released and ligated into HindIII-BamHI-digested pLew 100. For the construct targeting Alpha, primers with HindIII/XbaI (forward insert) and BamHI/BstEII (reverse insert) linkers were used, with a 560-bp stuffer of luciferase gene present in original pLew 100 plasmid.Transfection, Generation of Clonal Lines, and RNAi Induction—107 cells (strain 29-13) were washed in cytomix (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2), resuspended in 0.5 ml of cytomix containing 5 μg of NotI-linearized pLew100 construct, and transfected in 4-mm cuvettes using BTX ECM 830 square wave electroporator (1.7 kV, three pulses of 100 μs length and 200-ms interval). Cells were immediately transferred into 5 ml of RNAi medium; 24 h later 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin was added, and cells were grown for 3 weeks to obtain stable cultures. Clonal lines were generated by limiting dilution in conditioned medium (41Bakshi R.P. Shapiro T.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At ∼2 weeks, detectable clones were transferred into nonconditioned medium, grown for several days to ensure stability, and dsRNA expression was induced by addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline.Preparation of Antigens and Antibodies—Fragments of TbTOP2α (nucleotides 3940–4239) and TbTOP2β (nucleotides 4090–4395) were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with addition of NdeI and XhoI restriction sites to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Amplified fragments were digested with NdeI and XhoI, gel-purified, and ligated into pET-29a(+) vector (Novagen) cut with the same enzymes. The resulting constructs, each with an additional LE(His)6 C-terminal tag, were transformed into E. coli strain Rosetta™ (Novagen). Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.7 with 0.08 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 18 h at 16 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed in CelLytic™ B-II (Sigma), and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The His-tagged, soluble, and overexpressed proteins were purified on TALON™ Co2+ affinity resin in native conditions (BD Biosciences) and sent for commercial polyclonal antibody generation in rabbits (Covance Research Products, Inc.).Western Blotting—Lysates from 106 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Duralose-UV membrane (Stratagene), and blocked overnight at 4 °C with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA fraction V; Sigma) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.001% Thimerosal (TTBS). The blot was incubated with rabbit anti-TbTOP2α or anti-TbTOP2β serum at 1:5000 dilution or rabbit polyclonal anti-BiP antibodies (1:10000; a generous gift from Dr. Jay Bangs). Primary antibodies were detected by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:40,000; Sigma) and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences). Images were adjusted for contrast and brightness only in Adobe Photoshop. Western blots of yeast lysates (5 μg total protein/sample) were carried out as above.Flow Cytometry—Cells (107) were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in 5% glycerol/PBS, fixed at 4 °C overnight in 75% methanol, 5% glycerol, washed once with 5% glycerol/PBS, and then incubated in 5% glycerol/PBS, 10 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. After addition of propidium iodide (10 μg/ml final concentration), 10,000 cells were analyzed on FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using a 585 ± 21 nm bandpass filter. Forward and side scatter gates were set to exclude cell debris and clumps. Cells were also gated on height versus width of the red fluorescent signal with implementation of doublet discriminator module to exclude doublets. Data were analyzed with CELLQuest version 3.3 software (BD Biosciences). For kDNA analysis, live parasites were incubated for 20 min with 1 μg/ml dihydroethidium (Molecular Probes) in SDM-79 medium. Cells were washed once and resuspended in 5% glycerol/PBS.Microscopy—Cells were fixed using a modified procedure of Field et al. (42Field M.C. Allen C.L. Dhir V. Goulding D. Hall B.S. Morgan G.W. Veazey P. Engstler M. Microsc. Microanal. 2004; 10: 621-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were washed once in 1 ml of PBS, 1 mg/ml glucose, resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS, diluted with an equal volume of ice-cold 6% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and placed on ice for 15 min. Paraformaldehyde was inactivated by addition of 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine in PBS; cells were pelleted (5 min, 800 × g), washed with 1 ml of PBS, 0.1 m glycine, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of PBS. Cells were applied to slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences) coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine (Sigma), allowed to adhere for 15 min, immersed in methanol (–20 °C, 30 min), rehydrated by three 5-min washes in TTBS, and treated with primary anti-TbTOP2α antibody (1:2000 in 3% BSA, TTBS) for 1 h. Next, the samples were washed in TTBS (three times for 5 min), exposed to secondary Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000 in 3% BSA, TTBS; Molecular Probes) for 1 h, washed (twice for 5 min) in TTBS, stained with 2 μg/ml 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), washed once in TTBS, mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and coverslips were sealed with clear nail polish. Fluorescence microscopy and digital image acquisition were carried out using an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a Retiga EXi Mono Cooled camera (QImaging) operated with IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc.). All images were acquired using a ×100, 1.30 NA Plan-Neofluar oil immersion objective. Contrast and brightness only were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop. For quantitative analysis, sets of micrographs of DAPI-stained cells were counted (>100 parasites/set) and scored in a blinded fashion by four independent observers. The nuclear morphology was defined as follows: absent (0N); abnormally small (<1N); normal (1–2N); and abnormally large (>2N). 0K, 1K, and 2K indicate number of kDNA networks per cell.Yeast Plasmids and Strain—The multiple cloning site of pRS426(URA) (43Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) was replaced with a KpnI/SacI fragment of pRS316GU(URA) (44Nigro J.M.

Entire open reading frames of TbTOP2α and -β were PCR-amplified from cloned cDNAs with primers incorporating SalI and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively. Coding sequence of the human TOP2α gene was amplified from plasmid pMJ1 (45Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Rose A. McMahon J. Duncan D. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 91-99PubMed Google Scholar) (generous gift from Neil Osheroff) with the addition of SalI and XmaI sites at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively. PCR products were digested, ligated into pRS426GU(URA), and digested with corresponding restriction enzymes to produce pRS426GU-TbTOP2α, pRS426GU-TbTOP2β, and pRS426GU-HsTOP2α constructs. S. cerevisiae strain JCW28 (MATa his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63 ura3-52 top2-4 Δtop1-h&r) (46Mirabella A. Gartenberg M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was transformed simultaneously with YEptopA-PGPD(TRP) (47Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which contains E. coli topA gene linked to the yeast GPD promoter (strain and plasmid generously provided by Marc Gartenberg), and one of the topoisomerase II-containing pRS426GU(URA) plasmids. Transformants were selected on SD–ura,trp plates.Decatenation Assay—Individual double-transformants were grown in liquid SD –ura,trp medium at 26 °C to an absorbance of 0.8 at 600 nm and then switched to SGal –ura,trp medium to induce protein expression. After 18 h cells were harvested, washed with cold water and then cold buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (100×, Sigma P8340)), and resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer I. 50 μl of glass beads were added, and cells were lysed by vortexing (10 20-s bursts followed by 40 s on ice).

A., Huizinga, E., De Maeyer, M., and Deckmyn, H. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 37815–37821). By this, it potently inhibits the interaction of von Willebrand factor to collagens, which is a prerequisite for blood platelet adhesion to the injured vessel wall at sites of high shear. To fully understand the mode of action of 82D6A3 at the molecular level, we resolved its crystal structure in complex with the A3-domain and fine mapped its paratope by construction and characterization of 13 mutants. The paratope predominantly consists of two short sequences in the heavy chain CDR1 (Asn-31 and Tyr-32) and CDR3 (Asp-99, Pro-101, Tyr-102 and Tyr-103), forming one patch on the surface of the antibody. Trp-50 of the heavy and His-49 of the light chain, both situated adjacent to the patch, play ancillary roles in antigen binding. The crystal structure furthermore confirms the epitope location, which largely overlaps with the collagen binding site deduced from mutagenesis of the A3-domain (Romijn, R.

We herewith further consolidate the location of the collagen binding site and reveal that the potent action of the antibody is due to direct competition for the same interaction site. This information allows the design of a paratope-mimicking peptide with antithrombotic properties.

Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation are the three major steps in primary hemostasis, a process that is necessary for the cessation of bleeding at sites of vascular injury. The same process is also responsible for pathologic thrombus formation, particularly in arteries at sites of high shear stress. At high shear stress, binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) 3The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; CDR, complementarity-determining region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type. 3The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; GP, glycoprotein; CDR, complementarity-determining region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type. to collagen that is exposed in the subendothelial matrix after injury, and the subsequent interaction of the immobilized VWF with the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX/V-receptor complex, is a prerequisite for proper adhesion (1Sixma J.J. van Zanten G.H.

Our group characterized a monoclonal antibody against human VWF, 82D6A3, that binds with high affinity to the VWF A3-domain and inhibits VWF binding to collagen types I and III (15Hoylaerts M.F. Yamamoto H. Nuyts K. Vreys I. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Its inhibiting effect on VWF-mediated platelet adhesion becomes more pronounced with increasing shear stress, as is expected because the collagen-VWF-GPIb axis is essential for platelet adhesion under high shear only (30Vanhoorelbeke K.

The discontinuous epitope of 82D6A3, which has recently been unraveled via phage display and binding studies with alanine mutants of the VWF A3-domain, includes several residues of the A3-domain that are important for collagen binding (30Vanhoorelbeke K.

We further demonstrated that 82D6A3 has antithrombotic effects in a baboon arterial thrombosis model (31Wu D. Vanhoorelbeke K. Cauwenberghs N. Meiring M. Depraetere H. Kotze H.F. Deckmyn H.

Interestingly, the antithrombotic effect was not associated with significantly increased bleeding times, even at high doses, demonstrating that administration of 82D6A3 results in a broad therapeutic window. These benefits were also observed in in vivo studies with saratin, another inhibitor of the VWF-collagen interaction (33Barnes C.S. Krafft B. Frech M. Hofmann U.R. Papendieck A. Dahlems U.

This suggests that interference with the collagen-VWF-GPIb axis could have important advantages over existing antithrombotic agents such as inhibitors of platelet aggregation (GPIIb/IIIa-receptor blockers) or platelet activation (aspirin). Treatment with the latter agents results in smaller therapeutic windows and is frequently associated with bleeding problems and thus requires close monitoring of the patients (39Reilly I.A.

In addition, compounds that interfere with the collagen-VWF-GPIb interaction could also be more effective in the prevention of intimal hyperplasia after angioplasty and endarterectomy, because they interfere with the first steps in primary hemostasis and thus prevent the release of smooth muscle cell mitogenic (e.g. transforming growth factor β1) and attractant (e.g. basic fibroblast growth factor) factors during platelet activation (42Ferns G.A.

In the future, this information will be used as a lead for the construction of a peptidomimetic with similar inhibitory characteristics as 82D6A3. On the basis of the crystal structure of the complex between 82D6A3 and the VWF A3-domain determined in this study, we selected amino acids of the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of the antibody for mutation to alanine. Binding studies with alanine mutants of the single chain variable fragment of 82D6A3 (scFv-82D6A3) resulted in the identification of the paratope. Materials—The pCANTAB 5 E expression vector, pCANTAB 5 E gene rescue primer R2 and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-E Tag antibodies (anti-E Tag-HRP) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Human full-length VWF purified from donor plasma displaying a normal multimeric pattern was purchased from Red Cross, Belgium. Bacti casein peptone, Bacti yeast extract, and Bacti purified agar were purchased from BioTrading (Keerbergen, Belgium). PCR buffer, dNTP, and primers for the construction of the scFv-DNA and for its ligation in the prokaryotic expression vector were purchased from Invitrogen. Primers for the construction of the mutants were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Preparation of VWF A3-domain and Fab Fragments of 82D6A3—Recombinant VWF A3-domain comprising residues 920–1111 of mature VWF was expressed and purified essentially as described (22Huizinga E.G. van der Plas M.

During removal of the His tag with thrombin the A3-domain precipitated. Resolubilization without significant protein loss was achieved by the addition of solid urea to a final concentration of 7 m followed by overnight dialysis against 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.2. Subsequent purification proceeded as described previously. 82D6A3 was raised in mice against human VWF (15Hoylaerts M.F. Yamamoto H. Nuyts K. Vreys I. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Biochem.

The IgG of 82D6A3 was purified from earlier produced ascites, and Fab fragments were prepared as previously described (30Vanhoorelbeke K. Depraetere H. Romijn R.A. Huizinga E.G. De Maeyer M.

Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of space group P212121 (unit cell dimensions a = 72.2 Å, b = 89.1 Å, c = 123.5 Å) were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. VWF A3-domain (10 mg/ml) and 82D6A3 Fab fragment (7 mg/ml) were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and allowed to equilibrate at 21 °C against a reservoir solution containing 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6. Crystals grew overnight with dimensions of ∼0.4 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm. For data collection, crystals were transferred to reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beam line ID14 EH4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data were collected to 1.9 Å resolution with oscillations of 0.7° to reduce spot overlap. Data were processed using computer programs MOSFLM, SCALA, and TRUNCATE (44Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Prokaryotic Expression and Purification of Wild Type scFv of 82D6A3 (scFv-82D6A3(WT))—The construction of scFv-82D6A3(WT) (European Bioinformatics Institute Database accession number AJ965435) through splicing by overlap extension, its cloning in the pCANTAB 5 E vector, and its expression as a soluble protein in the periplasm of Escherichia coli HB2151 cells has been previously described (52Staelens S.

The underlined nucleotides introduce the desired mutation Open table in a new tab Western Blot—Equal volumes of supernatant, periplasm, or elution fractions containing scFv-82D6A3(WT) or its alanine mutants were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell BioScience, Dassel, Germany). Detection of the scFvs with anti-E Tag-horseradish peroxidase antibodies was performed as described (52Staelens S. Desmet J. Ngo T.H. Vauterin S. Pareyn I. Barbeaux P. Van Rompaey I. Stassen J.M. Deckmyn H. Vanhoorelbeke K. Mol. Immunol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Concentration Determination of the Purified scFvs—The concentration of the purified scFvs was determined according to the Bradford method (53Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using the Coomassie® Plus protein assay kit (Pierce). Briefly, dilution series of purified scFvs and Albumin Standard in PBS were added to a 96-well plate (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany). A fixed volume of Coomassie® Plus protein assay reagent was added, and absorbance was measured at 630 nm. Binding of scFv-82D6A3(WT) and Its Alanine Mutants to VWF—Binding of scFv-82D6A3(WT) and its alanine mutants to VWF was performed as described before (52Staelens S. Desmet J. Ngo T.H. Vauterin S. Pareyn I. Barbeaux P. Van Rompaey I. Stassen J.M. Deckmyn H. Vanhoorelbeke K. Mol. Immunol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 96-well plate was coated with VWF and incubated with dilution series of purified scFv-82D6A3(WT) and its alanine mutants. Next, bound scFv was detected by incubation with anti-E Tag-horseradish peroxidase antibodies. Visualization was performed by adding H2O2 and orthophenylenediamine (Sigma). The plate was washed three times after coating and blocking and nine times elsewhere with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. Inhibition of the scFv Binding to VWF by IgG-82D6A3—A 96-well plate was coated with VWF, blocked, and incubated as described above with scFv-82D6A3(WT) and its alanine mutants at their respective EC50 concentrations as calculated from their binding curves. IgG-82D6A3 (15 μg/ml in PBS, 0.3% milk powder) was added to the plate for 1 h at room temperature. Detection of bound scFv, visualization, and washing were performed as described above. Structure Determination and Refinement—We solved the crystal structure of the complex between the VWF A3-domain and the Fab fragment of 82D6A3 to 1.9 Å resolution (Fig. 1A) (Protein Data Bank accession code 2ADF). The structure has been refined to an R-factor of 18.5% and a free R-factor of 21.7% and shows good geometry (Table 1). The final model contains residues 922–1110 of the A3-domain, residues 1–210 of the 82D6A3 light chain, and residues 1–216 of the 82D6A3 heavy chain. The electron density of residues 122–130, 152–156, 181–189, and 199–201 in the constant domain of the light chain is ill defined, and the interpretation of these residues is tentative. This does not affect the analysis of the A3–82D6A3 interaction, because these residues are not located in the vicinity of the antigen binding surface of the antibody. The Epitope of 82D6A3—82D6A3 binds a discontinuous epitope located at a side face of the A3-domain (Fig. 1B). The interaction buries a solvent-accessible surface of ∼1640 Å2. The epitope consists of residues located in strand β3, helix α3, and loops β2-β3 and α3-β4. Loop α3-β4 and α3 residue Arg-1016 form a protrusion on the surface of the A3-domain that is nicely accommodated by a cleft between the light and heavy chain subunits of 82D6A3. Accordingly, mutations of Arg-1016 and residues Ser-1020, Met-1022, and His-1023 of α3-β4 led to a significant decrease in binding of VWF to 82D6A3 (30Vanhoorelbeke K. Depraetere H. Romijn R.A.

Although it cannot be excluded that the mutations in the A3-domain have caused indirect effects on collagen binding, these residues define a putative collagen binding surface that overlaps extensively with the footprint of 82D6A3 (Fig. 1C), and thus 82D6A3 effectively blocks collagen binding to VWF by direct competition for the same binding site. 82D6A3 Residues Interacting with the A3-Domain—Residues of 82D6A3 that interact with the A3-domain are located in all si"

Using a series of biological and biochemical analyses of wild-type and site-directed mutant receptors, we identified Asn205 as a potential interacting partner with the Tyr266 residue. An N205H/Y266H double mutant showed pH-dependent functional activity, whereas the N205H receptor was non-functional and the Y266H receptor was partially active indicating that the histidine 205 and 266 residues interact in an activated state of the receptor. The introduction of N205K or Y266D mutations into the P258L/S259L constitutively active receptor suppressed the constitutive activity; in contrast, the N205K/Y266D/P258L/S259L quadruple mutant was fully constitutively active, again indicating an interaction between residues at the 205 and 206 positions in the receptor-active state. To further test this interaction, we introduced the N205C/Y266C, F204C/Y266C, and N205C/A265C double mutations into wild-type and P258L/S259L constitutively active receptors. After trypsin digestion, we found that a disulfide-cross-linked product, with the molecular weight expected for a receptor fragment with a cross-link between N205C and Y266C, formed only in the N205C/Y266C constitutively activated receptor.

Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). A major goal of GPCR studies is to ascertain the interactions between ligand and receptor to aid in the identification of analogs used for modulation of receptor activity and to understand how the receptor activates its signal transduction pathway. GPCRs are extremely important for medicine as they represent the target for the majority of prescribed drugs (2Klabunde T. Hessler G. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 928-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To identify Ste2p residues or regions involved in α-factor binding, a number of experiments have been performed. Chimeric receptors between the closely related S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces kluyveri α-factor receptors implicated the involvement of portions of EL1 (extracellular loop 1), EL3, and the N-terminal extracellular region of transmembrane 1 (TM1) in the specificity of ligand recognition (3Sen M. Marsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 968-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sen M. Shah A. Marsh L. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our group using site-directed mutagenesis of Ste2p and binding assays with different α-factor analogs suggested that portions of TM1 and TM6 were important for ligand interaction (5Abel M.G. Lee B.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that the tenth residue of α-factor is in close proximity to Ser47 and Thr48 in TM1 of Ste2p (6Lee B.K. Khare S. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37950-37961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Tyr266 in TM6 plays an important role in the recognition of the N terminus of α-factor as well as switching of Ste2p into an activated state upon agonist binding (7Lee B.K. Lee Y.H. Hauser M. Son C.D. Khare S. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13681-13689Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and using photo-affinity labeling we suggested that the N terminus of α-factor interacts with a region of the receptor spanning the upper portions of TM5 and TM6 and the connecting EL3 (8Henry L.K. Khare S. Son C. Babu V.V. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6128-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Studies with α-factor analogs and fluorescently modified α-factor indicated that the binding environments of the position one (9Zhang Y.L. Lu H.F. Becker J.M. Naider F. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 50: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and position three side chains were hydrophobic, whereas the seventh residue was exposed to a partially hydrophilic environment suggesting that the middle portion of the pheromone was not buried in the transmembrane domains (10Ding F.X.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Experiments to identify Ste2p residues and regions involved in receptor activation and signaling have been extensive. An interaction between TM5 and TM6 has been identified by a Cys-cross-linking experiment (12Dube P. DeCostanzo A. Konopka J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26492-26499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and other interactions between and among transmembrane domains and between specific residues in transmembrane domains have been demonstrated by genetic experiments (13Sommers C.M. Dumont M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 559-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Parrish W. Eilers M. Ying W. Konopka J.B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 429-443PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dube P. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7205-7215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, extensive searches for dominant-negative mutations in the receptor revealed that most mutants exhibiting this phenotype are mapped to the extracellular ends of the transmembrane domains, especially TM5 and TM6 (16Dosil M. Giot L. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5981-5991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leavitt L.M. Macaluso C.R. Kim K.S. Martin N.P. Dumont M.E. Mol. Gen.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5321-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A detailed and elegant analysis concluded that Phe204 in the EL2 loop was important for ligand binding and that Tyr266 at the extracellular end of TM6 was involved in signal transduction (19Lin J.C. Parrish W. Eilers M. Smith S.O. Konopka J.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on these previous Ste2p findings, we initiated studies described in this communication to map residues interacting with Tyr266 using alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the EL2-TM5 interface (residues Gln200 to Ile209). All mutant receptors were subjected to detailed functional and ligand binding assays. Our results revealed that Asn205 is critical for signal transduction, and based on site-directed mutagenesis and disulfide cross-linking studies we deduced that Asn205 interacts with Tyr266 in a receptor that is activated by mutation to the constitutively activated state.

LM23-3az has the same genotype as LM102 except that it contains an intact chromosomal STE2 gene coding for the α-factor receptor. LM23-3az was used only to study dominant negative effects of certain mutant receptors on the function of wild-type (WT) Ste2p (see “Results”). The LM102 strain was used as the recipient for the transformation with WT and the site-directed STE2 mutants. Measurement of the pheromone-induced growth arrest (halo assay), pheromone-induced gene expression (FUS1-lacZ assay), and determination of pheromone binding were done in the LM102 host strain. Both LM102 and LM23-3az strains carried the bar1 mutant allele, which inactivated the BAR1 protease responsible for degradation of α-factor, and a FUS1-lacZ gene. The WT STE2 gene with a native promoter was cloned into a yeast/bacterial shuttle vector pGA314.WT (5Abel M.G. Lee B.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and was used as a template for the site-directed mutagenesis of the α-factor receptor gene. The plasmid pGA314-T7 was constructed for the disulfide-cross-linking experiment by homologous recombination between pGA314 and pPD225-T7, which was used previously for the identification of interaction between TM5 and TM6 of Ste2p (12Dube P. DeCostanzo A. Konopka J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26492-26499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ste2p encoded by pPD225-T7 contains no cysteine residues and is identical to wild-type Ste2p in its biological activity. In this report we refer to the Cys-less, T7-tagged Ste2p as WT. The plasmid pMD82 (16Dosil M. Giot L. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5981-5991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which overexpresses G-αβγ, was a kind gift from Dr. James Konopka, State University of New York, Stony Brook. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single-stranded phagemid DNA of pGA314.WT was prepared by infecting Escherichia coli strain CJ236 (ung-, dut-) carrying pGA314.WT with the helper phage M13KO7 (20Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded phagemid DNA was conducted as described by Kunkel et al. (21Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). After sequence confirmation, constructs were transformed into yeast strain LM102 (ste2-deletion strain), and transformants were selected by their growth in the medium lacking tryptophan. All primers were purchased from Sigma/Genosys (Woodlands, TX) and Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). DNA sequencing was carried out in the DNA sequencing facility located on the campus of the University of Tennessee. Growth Arrest (Halo) Assay—Yeast nitrogen base medium (Difco) without amino acids (SD medium) supplemented with histidine (20 μg/ml), leucine (30 μg/ml), and methionine (20 μg/ml) was overlaid with 4 ml of cell suspension (2.5 × 106 cells/ml of Nobel agar). Filter disks (sterile blanks from Difco), 7 mm in diameter, were impregnated with 10-μl portions of peptide solutions at various concentrations (adjusted by molar extinction coefficient) and placed onto the overlay (22Abel M.G. Zhang Y.L. Lu H.F. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24-36 h and then observed for clear zones (halos) around the disks. The halo measured included the diameter of the disc. All assays were carried out at least three times with no more than a 2-mm variation in halo size at a particular amount applied for each peptide. The data were plotted as halo size versus the amount of peptide and linearized by regression analysis using Prism™ software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). FUS1-lacZ Gene Induction Assay—S. cerevisiae LM102 contains a FUS1-lacZ gene that is inducible by mating pheromone. Cells were grown overnight in SD medium supplemented with the required amino acids at 30 °C to 5 × 106 cells/ml, washed by centrifugation, and grown for one doubling (hemocytometer count) at 30 °C. Induction was performed by adding 0.1 ml of α-factor at various concentrations (as shown in Fig. 5 or at 10-6 m for the results reported in Fig. 6A) to 1 ml of concentrated cells (1 × 108 cells/ml). The mixtures were vortexed and, after incubation at 30 °C with shaking for 2 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and each pellet was resuspended and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (expressed as Miller units) in duplicate by modification (23Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar) of a standard protocol (24Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as the substrate. The percent activity at various α-factor concentrations was determined by comparing β-galactosidase activity to the maximal activity at 1 μm α-factor for the wild-type receptor. Each experiment was carried out at least two times with similar results in each assay.FIGURE 6FUS1-LacZ assays and growth arrest assay of WT and mutant receptors.

Res. 1998; 52: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The competition binding assay was started by the addition of [3H]α-factor and various concentrations of non-labeled α-factor or α-factor analogs (140 μl) to a 560-μl cell suspension such that the final concentration of radioactive peptide was 6 ×10-9 m (20 Ci/mmol). After a 30-min incubation, triplicate samples of 200 μl were filtered and washed over glass fiber filter mats using the Standard Cell Harvester (Skatron Instruments, Sterling, VA) and placed in scintillation vials for counting. Each experiment was carried out at least three times with similar results. Data curves for competition binding assays were fitted from at least eight triplicate data points using Prism™ software (GraphPad) with non-linear regression one site competition. The Ki values for competition binding assays were calculated by using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (25Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12321) Google Scholar), where Ki = IC50/(1 + [ligand]/Kd). Determination of Disulfide Cross-links in α-Factor Receptors—Immunoblot analysis of Ste2p was carried out essentially as described previously (12Dube P. DeCostanzo A. Konopka J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26492-26499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to log phase, and then 1 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by agitation with glass beads in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and then membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 45 min. The membrane pellet was washed and then resuspended in 100 μl of a buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.1% SDS. The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry assay (Pierce), and then aliquots containing either 50 or 100 μg of membrane protein were then digested with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington Biochemicals Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h or longer. No oxidizing reagent was used to promote the disulfide bond formation. The gel samples were incubated at room temperature, heated at 37 °C for 15 min, and then separated on NuPAGE 12% Bis-Tris SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) with either non-reducing or reducing conditions and electrophoretically transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with anti-T7 antibodies at 1:10,000 dilutions (Novagen Inc.), and then the immunoreactive bands were detected using a Super Signal Ultra ECL kit (Pierce). Molecular Modeling—A molecular model of Ste2p was generated by homology with the crystal structure of rhodopsin (26Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar) using ExPASy molecular biology server (27Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4530) Google Scholar). After selecting rhodopsin as the modeling template, the amino acid sequence of each TMD of Ste2p was used to construct the model. Computer programs used to predict the boundaries of the TMDs of Ste2p were obtained from the same server (ca.expasy.org). The coordinates of each helix were generated by the protein modeling tool ProMod, and final energy minimization was performed by Gromos96 for 200 cycles to improve the stereochemistry of the model and to remove unfavorable clashes. This model is referred to as representing the resting state of Ste2p, because the template used during modeling was the rhodopsin resting state. A similar model of Ste2p (28Eilers M. Hornak V. Smith S.O. Konopka J.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8959-8975Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) resulted in coordinates for transmembrane domains that were almost identical to the ones generated herein. The activated state of Ste2p was generated using the same model by introducing torsion on the backbone omega, phi and psi angles around Pro258 and Ser259. (These residues were mutated to Leu to generate a constitutively active receptor.) The torsion applied was just enough to bring Asn205 and Tyr266 into close proximity without any unfavorable clashes by using Swiss-PdbViewer (version 3.7) torsion tool. The mutations generated during this study were introduced into the model by using the mutation tool in Swiss-Pdb Viewer, and the distances between the side-chain atoms were measured with the distance tool in the same program. Biological Activity and Binding of Ste2p Variants after Mutagenesis of Residues 200-209—Ten amino acids spanning a portion of Ste2p at the junction between TM5 and extracellular loop 2 (residues 200-209) were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). All residues were mutated to alanine except residue 206, which is alanine in the native protein; in this case the residue was mutated to glycine. The biological activity of each mutant receptor was measured by the growth arrest assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The response of cells expressing each of the receptor constructs, except F204A and N205A, increased linearly throughout the range of α-factor tested (Fig. 2A). Excluding F204A and N205A, which responded only minimally to a high amount of α-factor (8 μg), the biological activity of all receptors measured as the amount of α-factor required to produce a 15-mm zone of inhibition, a halo size in the middle of the dose-response curve, was within 10% of WT Ste2p (Table 1). Measurement of α-factor binding to the receptors indicated that the Ki for WT Ste2p (5.2 nm) was in the range previously reported for this receptor (29Jenness D.D. Burkholder A.C. Hartwell L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chen Q. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 247-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except for the F204A mutant receptor, cells expressing each of the receptor constructs showed affinities for α-factor from 2-fold higher (S207A and I209A) to ∼3-fold lower (Y203A and N205A) when compared with WT receptor (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The F204A mutant showed no measurable binding of α-factor at a concentration up to 1 μm of added pheromone, which agreed with previously reported results for F204S (16Dosil M. Giot L. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5981-5991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A saturation binding assay using whole cells indicated a level of ∼40,000 receptors/cell for both the wild-type and the N205A receptor. In addition, an immunoblot of membranes demonstrated that the N205A mutant receptor was expressed at a level similar to that of the WT receptor (Fig. 3). The N205A mutant represented a unique phenotype among the ten mutants studied in that α-factor bound well but the receptor was not able to initiate signal transduction.FIGURE 2A, dose-response analysis of growth arrest assay, and B, competition binding assay for wild-type and ten mutant receptors. A, the halo zone of growth inhibition of strains carrying the indicated receptors was measured at various concentrations of α-factor, and the data were plotted by regression analysis. The results are the means ± S.E. of two separate experiments. A comparison of the biological activities of the various mutant receptors is shown in Table 1. B, yeast cells expressing wild-type or a mutant Ste2p were incubated with 6 nm [3H]α-factor in the presence of increasing concentrations of α-factor.

Cells harboring wild-type (○) or N205A (▴) receptor were incubated with increasing amounts of [3H]α-factor and assayed as described previously (7Lee B.K. Lee Y.H. Hauser M. Son C.D. Khare S. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13681-13689Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Specific binding was determined by subtracting counts associated with cells in the presence of 100-fold excess cold α-factor. Assays were carried out at least three times, and each concentration point was performed in triplicate.

Giot L. Davis C. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5981-5991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leavitt L.M. Macaluso C.R. Kim K.S. Martin N.P. Dumont M.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 917-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding either wild-type or N205A Ste2p were transformed into LM23-3az, a strain containing a chromosomal copy of WT Ste2p. Co-expression of a WT construct on the plasmid did not affect the strong response to pheromone (Fig. 4A). In contrast, a strain co-expressing the chromosomally encoded WT and the plasmid-encoded N205A mutant responded weakly to α-factor (Fig. 4C). Additional transformation of these yeast with pMD82, a plasmid expressing the G proteins GPA1(Gα), STE4(Gβ), and STE18(Gγ), resulted in a cell with regained sensitivity to α-factor (Fig. 4D) while having little effect on the co-expressed wild-type Ste2p from the chromosome and plasmid (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the dominant-negative phenotype of the N205A mutant receptor (Fig. 4C) was due to G protein sequestration. Moreover, the results substantiate that N205A is expressed and localized to the cell membrane where it may interact with G protein. Characteristics of N205A and Y266A Mutant Receptors Are Very Similar—Similarly to Y266A (7Lee B.K. Lee Y.H. Hauser M. Son C.D. Khare S. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13681-13689Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the N205A mutant receptor showed a very good binding affinity (Ki = 15 nm as compared with the WT, Ki = 5 n m), yet had <5% of WT biological activity as measured by the growth arrest assay (Table 1). Both N205A and Y266A also showed very similar characteristics in the Fus1-lacZ induction assay (Fig. 5). To further compare the N205A and Y266A receptors, we carried out competition binding assays using single Ala-substituted α-factor analogs. In both N205A and Y266A receptors the binding affinities of [Ala1]α-factor through [Ala4]α-factor increased ∼2- to 4-fold compared with WT receptor (Table 2). In contrast, Ala substitution at residue 5 and at residues 7 through 13 of α-factor resulted in a decreased affinity of 2- to 10-fold for both N205A and Y266A compared with WT Ste2p. Substitution at residue 6 led to a 2-fold increase in affinity for the N205A receptor compared with wild-type and a 2-fold decrease in the Y266A receptor. None of the Ala-scanned analogs of α-factor induced lacZ in either mutant. Overall the affinities and activities of Ala-scanned α-factor analogs for N205A and the Y266A mutant Ste2ps were similar (Table 2). Because the N205A and Y266A receptors had a similar recognition pattern to α-factor analogs containing Ala at positions 1-4, and because we previously concluded that Tyr266 interacts with residues at the amine terminus of the pheromone (6Lee B.K. Khare S. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37950-37961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that residues at positions 205 and 266 might occupy a common space to work together to initiate receptor activation.TABLE 2Binding affinities of Ala-scanned α-factor analogs for wild-type, N205A, and Y266A receptors Ki values for α-factor and 13 Ala-scanned analogs were determined in competition binding assays by displacement of [3H]α-factor.PeptideBinding (Ki)ChangeWTN205AN205AY266AaData are from Lee et al.

The response was mediated by endogenous muscarinic receptors and was blocked by atropine or proteasomal inhibitors. We have used these cells to identify the sites of ubiquitination on IP3Rs and study the role of Ca2+ and substrate recognition properties of the degradation system using exogenously expressed IP3R constructs. Employing caspase-3 for IP3R cleavage, we show that Cch promotes polyubiquitination in the N-terminal domain and monoubiquitination in the C-terminal domain. The addition of extracellular Ca2+ to Ca2+-depleted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells initiates IP3R degradation provided Cch is present. This effect is inhibited by thapsigargin. The data suggest that both a sustained elevation of IP3 and a minimal content of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen is required to initiate IP3R degradation. Transient transfection of IP3R constructs into CHO cells indicated the selective degradation of only the SI(+) splice variant of the type I IP3R. This was also the splice form present endogenously in these cells. A pore-defective, nonfunctional SI(+) IP3R mutant (D2550A) was also degraded in Cch-stimulated cells.

Down-regulation of IP3R protein is associated with a decrease in the ability of IP3 to mobilize Ca2+ (4Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12454-12461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). More has shown been recently it that the frequency of elementary Ca2+ puffs that trigger propagating Ca2+ waves in cells is decreased by chronic agonist stimulation (14Tovey S.C. De Smet P. Lipp P. Thomas D. Young K.W. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Berridge M.J. Thuring J. Holmes A. Bootman M.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 114: 3979-3989Crossref Google Scholar). The physiological significance of IP3R down-regulation is unknown. However, down-regulation of receptors would be expected to inhibit the global Ca2+ signal elicited by all Ca2+ mobilizing agonists (heterologous desensitization). If this is the only component of the signal transduction system that is down-regulated, then an imbalance in signaling pathways would exist and may have profound consequences for cellular responses. A physiologically relevant example is the response of pituitary cells to GnRH receptor agonists (17McArdle C.A. Franklin J. Green L. Hislop J.N. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mammalian GnRH receptors lack a C-terminal tail and therefore do not bind arrestin. Consequently these receptors desensitize and internalize only very slowly. However, sustained activation of GnRH receptors does lead to desensitization of gonadotrophin hormone secretion, which suggests the presence of adaptive mechanisms distal to the cell surface receptor. Treatment with GnRH receptor agonists produce a rapid and pronounced degradation of IP3Rs, and this is associated with a marked reduction in the IP3-mediated Ca2+ signal (15Willars G.B. Royall J.E.

Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mechanism of IP3R degradation has not been established. Previous studies have shown that chronic elevation of IP3 and IP3 binding to the receptor are required to facilitate IP3R degradation (19Zhu C.-C. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3476-3484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Zhu C. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the sustained elevation of IP3 causes the IP3R to adopt a conformation that exposes sites that become ubiquitinated. The proteasome pathway then degrades the ubiquitinated IP3 receptor. The regions of the IP3R involved in ubiquitination have not been determined. Pretreatment of cells with the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin has been found to inhibit agonist-mediated IP3R degradation, suggesting that Ca2+ also plays a role in IP3R degradation (4Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined IP3R degradation in CHO-K1 cells stimulated with carbachol. This system has been used to examine the domains of IP3Rs that are ubiquitinated and to further explore the role of Ca2+ in IP3R degradation. The ability to readily transfect CHO-K1 cells with various IP3R constructs has allowed an initial characterization of the substrate recognition properties of the IP3R degradation system. Materials—Carbachol, acetylcholine, atropine, ALLN, and ALLM were purchased from Sigma. Lactacystin was purchased from Dr. E. J. Corey (Harvard University). ZL3VS was a kind gift of Dr. Mathew Bogyo (Stanford University). Stabilized acrylamide solution (Protogel) for the preparation of SDS gels was obtained from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). Recombinant caspase-3 was purified from BL-21 bacterial lysates expressing the enzyme as a His6-tagged fusion protein using previously described methods (21Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T.

The plasmid encoding caspase-3 was kindly given by Dr. E. S. Alnemri. Antibodies—The type I polyclonal antibody was raised to unique amino acids 2731-2749 present at the C terminus of the rat type I IP3R (CT-1) and has been previously characterized (22Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Nature. 1989; 342: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 23Joseph S. Samanta S. J. Biol.

This Ab was used after affinity purification using the immobilized antigenic peptide as a column matrix. The type III IP3R monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal Ab to ubiquitin was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, Canada). Myc monoclonal Ab (9E11) was obtained from the Cell Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Expression Constructs—The cDNA encoding rat type I IP3R SI(-)/SII(+)/SIII(+) splice variant in pCMV3 was the kind gift of Dr. Thomas Sudhof (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) (24Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the rat type I IP3R SI(+) variant was the kind gift of Dr. Gregory Mignery (Loyola University Chicago) (25Ramos-Franco J. Caenepeel S. Fill M. Mignery G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2783-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The D2550A pore-defective mutant in SI(-) (26Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was transferred to the SI(+) IP3R using BstBI/XbaI restriction sites. The Myc-tagged constructs were made using PCR as described previously (27Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Pretreatment—CHO-K1 cells were obtained from ATCC (catalog number CCL-61) and from Dr. John Pastorino. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The confluent cells were deprived of serum (1-2 h) and treated with carbachol for the indicated times. At the end of the treatment period, the medium was aspirated, and the plates were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped into a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) (solubilization buffer). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 25,000 × g. 20 μg of protein was loaded on 5% SDS-PAGE, and the separated polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose. Repeated immunoblotting of the same nitrocellulose sheet was carried out after treating blots for 30 min at 60 °C in a stripping buffer containing 65 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Measurement of Ca2+ Mobilization—Changes in cytosolic [Ca2+]in individual CHO cells plated on coverslips were measured by digital imaging fluorescence microscopy as previously described (28Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were loaded with Fura-2 by incubating with 5 μm Fura-2AM in 0.03% pluronic F-127 in the presence of 100 μm sulfinpyrazone for 30 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed with HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) containing 2% bovine serum albumin and then in HEPES buffer containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips with Fura-2-loaded cells were transferred into a chamber with 1 ml of HEPES buffer with or without Ca2+ and mounted onto the stage of an inverted microscope thermostatically maintained at 37 °C. Fluorescence images with a 4-s delay were collected alternately at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm with an emission wavelength of 460-600 nm. [Ca2+]i for each individual cell was calculated from the fluorescence values at each time point using the ratio method as described previously (28Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of IP3R Ubiquitination—To measure ubiquitination CHO-K1 cells were pretreated for 1 h with or without proteasomal inhibitors and then treated for 4-6 h with 1 mm carbachol. The cells were then treated for 10 min at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm NEM and lysed in solubilization buffer supplemented with 1 mm NEM. The NEM was added to block deubiquitinating enzymes. The lysate was then immunoprecipitated overnight with CT-1 Ab. The immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on 5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-ubiquitin Ab (StressGen). To resolve IP3R domains that contained ubiquitin, we employed a Myc-tagged Ub plasmid (kindly given by Dr. Ron Kopito) that was transfected together with the type I IP3R into 4 × 150-mm plates (20 μg of DNA each/plate) using LT-1 as a transfection reagent (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI). After 48 h the plates were treated for 1 h with a mixture of proteasomal inhibitors consisting of 10 μm lactacystin, 50 μm ZL3VS, and 50 μm ALLN. The plates were then treated with 1 mm carbachol, lysed as described above in NEM-containing medium, and immunoprecipitated overnight with CT-1 Ab. After washing twice in solubilization buffer, an aliquot of the immunoprecipitate (80%) was digested with caspase-3 in 200 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 μg recombinant caspase-3. 20% of this sample was quenched with SDS-PAGE buffer and was used as the uncut control sample. The digested fragments were released from the PrA-Sepharose beads by 5 min of treatment at 95 °C with 0.35 m glycine (pH 2.8) and 0.1% Triton X-100. The sample was diluted in lysis buffer and reimmunoprecipitated with Myc-Ab to recover the ubiquitinated fragments. The uncut control sample and the Myc reimmunoprecipitated samples were processed on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with IP3R Abs to locate the ubiquitinated fragments. Basic Characterization of IP3R Down-regulation in CHO-K1 Cells— Our previous studies on IP3R degradation were carried out in WB rat liver epithelial cells stimulated with angiotensin II (8Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12454-12461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Bokkala S. Rubin E. Joseph S.K. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1999; 23: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These cells have proved very difficult to transiently transfect with IP3R constructs, and stable WB cell lines lose their IP3R degradation response to angiotensin II (data not shown). We therefore examined other cells types that were more amenable to transfection for an agonist-mediated IP3R degradation response. Fig. 1A shows that carbachol (Cch) addition to CHO-K1 cells stimulated IP3R down-regulation. Similar Cch effects were seen when the blots were reprobed for the type III IP3R isoform (data not shown). The effect was specific to Cch because ATP, which also elevates Ca2+ in these cells (cf. Fig. 5), did not induce significant IP3R degradation. To further characterize these effects we examined time course and dose-response relationships (Fig. 1, B and C). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots showed that IP3R down-regulation was detected within 2 h and peaked between 4 and 6 h of Cch stimulation (Fig. 1B). This pattern of response is comparable with what has been observed for agonist-mediated IP3R down-regulation in other systems (8Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12454-12461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows the dose response for IP3R down-regulation using carbachol, methacholine, and acetylcholine as agonists. The dose response for the carbachol effect was complex and showed two distinct components with half-maximal inhibitory effects at ∼20 and 80-100 μm. Methacholine was somewhat more potent than carbachol (IC50 = ∼10 μm). Acetylcholine was the least potent agonist with half-maximal effects at 50 μm and only a 40% down-regulation even at 1 mm. These data, together with the finding that the carbachol effects on down-regulation are completely blocked by atropine (Fig. 2), suggest that IP3R down-regulation is mediated by endogenous muscarinic receptors in CHO-K1 cells.FIGURE 5Calcium transients in CHO-K1 cells in response to agonists. A, cytosolic Ca2+ changes were monitored in Fura-2-loaded cells incubated in normal extracellular Ca2+ and stimulated with 1 mm Cch or ATP. B shows cytosolic Ca2+ changes in cells challenged with two concentrations of ATP after being exposed to Cch pretreatment (1 mm; 6 h). For both experiments each trace represents the average of three coverslips (30 cells/coverslip).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 2The effect of protease inhibitors on carbachol-mediated IP3R degradation. CHO cells were incubated with 1 mm carbachol for 6 h in the absence or presence of protease inhibitors and were analyzed for type I IP3R by immunoblotting. The concentration of drugs used were as follows: atropine (100 μm), ALLN (50 μm), ALLM (50 μm), lactacystin (10 μm), caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO (100 μm), NH4Cl (5 mm), chloroquine (1 mm), and calpain inhibitor MDL-28170 (20 μm). None of the agents changed IP3R levels when added alone with the exception of NH4Cl and chloroquine, which increased levels by 44 + 14 and 35 + 7.9%, respectively. *, p > 0.05 significant from carbachol alone. The data are the means ± S.E. for three to five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The role of different proteolytic pathways in IP3R degradation was investigated using various protease inhibitors (Fig. 2). The most pronounced inhibition of Cch-mediated IP3R degradation was observed with the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin. Rather surprisingly, 50 μm of the peptide aldehyde inhibitor ALLN, which is effective at preventing proteasomal degradation of IP3Rs in WB cells (8Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12454-12461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), exerted only a small inhibitory effect on Cch-mediated IP3R degradation. A small inhibitory effect of 100 μm chloroquine was also observed. This is probably an indirect effect and unlikely to reflect the involvement of the lysosomal pathway because 5 mm NH4Cl was without effect. Similarly the lack of effects of ALLM, DEVD-CHO, and calpain inhibitor would rule out the involvement of general cysteine proteases, caspases, and calpains, respectively. Thus the data would suggest that the major proteolytic system involved in Cch-mediated IP3R degradation is the proteasomal pathway. Ubiquitination Domains in IP3R—We first carried out experiments to confirm that the proteasomal degradation of IP3Rs was accompanied by ubiquitination. CHO cell lysates were treated with Cch in the presence or absence of lactacystin, and the immunoprecipitated IP3R was probed for ubiquitin with anti-Ub Ab (Fig. 3A). The data show that ubiquitinated IP3R accumulated only when the cells were treated with a combination of Cch and lactacystin (Fig. 3A, lane 3). There are 159 cytosol-exposed lysines in the primary sequence of the type I IP3R that could potentially serve as sites for ubiquitination. Our limited objective in the present study was to identify domains in the IP3R that may serve as targets of ubiquitination. The strategy we chose to employ was to digest the ubiquitinated IP3R with a protease that would cleave the IP3R but not ubiquitin. A protease that satisfies this criteria is caspase-3, which is known to cleave IP3Rs (31Hirota J. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34433-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Haug L.S. Walaas I. Ostvold A.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1852-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Initial experiments to detect endogenous Ub attached to caspase-3-cleaved IP3R fragments were limited by the poor sensitivity of the available anti-Ub Abs. For this reason we chose to transfect the CHO cells with Myc-tagged Ub. However, transfection with Myc-tagged Ub alone did not significantly label endogenous IP3Rs immunoprecipitated from CHO cells treated with Cch and lactacystin (Fig. 3B, lane 1). At high exposures of the blot it was possible to detect a single band at the expected migration of IP3R, indicating that endogenous receptors may become monoubiquitinated under these conditions (Fig. 3B, lane 5). A weak labeling of endogenous receptors by Myc-tagged Ub has also been observed in αT3-1 anterior pituitary cells (18Wojcikiewicz R.J. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In part, this may be related to the low transfection efficiency of our cells, which was estimated at 10-20% by indirect immunofluorescence measurements (data not shown). To maximize the signal we cotransfected CHO cells with both Myc-tagged Ub and IP3R cDNA. Under these conditions a significant increase in Myc ubiquitinated IP3R was observed when IP3R was immunoprecipitated from CHO cells treated with Cch and lactacystin (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Fig. 4A shows the location of eight potential DXXD caspase-3 cleavage sites in the type I IP3R and the expected size of N- and C-terminal fragments for cleavage at each of these sites. Previous studies have documented a single cleavage site distal to the DEVD sequence at aspartate 1892 (31Hirota J. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34433-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Haug L.S. Walaas I. Ostvold A.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1852-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This would be expected to generate a 98-kDa C-terminal fragment and a 215-kDa N-terminal fragment. IP3R immunoprecipitates were prepared from CHO cells cotransfected with Myc-Ub and type I IP3R plasmids that were then treated with Cch in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors. IP3R was immunoprecipitated from these lysates with CT-1 Ab and then cleaved with caspase-3. The fragments formed were reimmunoprecipitated with Myc-Ab to bring down the Myc-tagged cleavage fragments (Fig. 4B). Analysis of the fragments by immunoblotting with Myc Ab showed a prominent single band at 95 kDa and a smeared signal that extended from 119 to 230 kDa (Fig. 4B, lane 2). The 95-kDa band was cross-reactive with the CT-1 Ab and corresponds to the expected C-terminal caspase-3 cleavage product (Fig. 4B, lane 4). Because it appears as a single band, we propose that the C-terminal segment of IP3Rs can be monoubiquitinated. The smeared signal seen in the Myc Ab blots was cross-reactive with the N-terminal Ab (lane 6) but not the C-terminal Ab (lane 4). We conclude that polyubiquitination is confined to the N-terminal segments of the IP3R. When caspase-3-cleaved IP3R was examined with N-terminal Ab, a fragment of ∼95 kDa was observed rather than the expected 215-kDa fragment (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). This suggests that in vitro caspase may cleave at other sites in addition to aspartate 1892. The size of the 95-kDa N-terminal fragment is compatible with cleavage at aspartate 820, which would locate the polyubiquitination sites proximal to this amino acid. The spread of the Myc-Ub signal would suggest heterogeneity in the size of the polyubiquitin chains and/or the use of multiple attachment sites in the N-terminal domain. The Role of Ca2+ in Carbachol-mediated IP3R Degradation—Fig. 5A shows the Ca2+ transients recorded in Fura-2-loaded CHO-K1 cells in response to a maximal dose of Cch that triggers IP3R degradation. Cch addition elicited a Ca2+ signal that remained elevated for a prolonged period (>30 min). By contrast a Ca2+-mobilizing stimulus such as ATP, which did not cause IP3R degradation, produced a smaller and more transient Ca2+ signal. The ATP responses observed in cells that were pretreated with Cch for 6 h was substantially blunted as would be anticipated if IP3Rs were degraded by Cch pretreatment (Fig. 5B). To further examine the role of Ca2+, we pretreated the cells for 30 min with thapsigargin (to empty intracellular stores) or EGTA (to remove extracellular Ca2+). Fig. 6A show that both treatments blocked Cch-mediated degradation, in agreement with previous studies on other cell types (4Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7963-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of buffering the cytosolic Ca2+ transient by loading the cell permeant BAPTA-AM chelator is shown in Fig. 6B. BAPTA-AM completely blocked Cch-mediated IP3R degradation when added 30 min prior to Cch (data not shown), but its effectiveness declined progressively when the chelator was added at different times after Cch. Thus BAPTA-AM loaded into the cells 30 min after Cch addition was unable to prevent the degradation of IP3R observed at 6 h. This indicates that a continuously elevated cytosolic Ca2+ is not required for IP3R degradation and that the signals that irreversibly commit the IP3R to degradation are formed within a 30-min interval of Cch addition. A similar conclusion was reached from experiments in which the Cch stimulus was terminated at various times by the addition of atropine (Fig. 6C). These data show that carbachol exposure for 1 h has the same effect as the continuous exposure to carbachol for 4 h. The interpretation of the finding that thapsigargin, EGTA, and BAPTA-AM inhibit IP3R degradation is complicated by the known Ca2+ sensitivity of phospholipase C (PLC) in CH"
