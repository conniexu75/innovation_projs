https://openalex.org/W1984338631,"Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mediates a wide range of immune and inflammatory responses. The active cytokine is generated by proteolytic cleavage of an inactive precursor. A complementary DNA encoding a protease that carries out this cleavage has been cloned. Recombinant expression in COS-7 cells enabled the cells to process precursor IL-1 beta to the mature form. Sequence analysis indicated that the enzyme itself may undergo proteolytic processing. The gene encoding the protease was mapped to chromosomal band 11q23, a site frequently involved in rearrangement in human cancers."

https://openalex.org/W1496457337,"Macrophages activated by exposure to cytokines and/or to endotoxin produce nitric oxide (NO.), a free radical that is a mediator of the host response to infection. Activation induces the expression of nitric oxide synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes formation of NO. from L-arginine and molecular oxygen. We report the cloning of a cDNA encoding the inducible nitric oxide synthase from a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, exposed to interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. Oocytes injected with mRNA transcribed from this cDNA demonstrate arginine-dependent production of nitrite, a stable metabolite of NO.. Nitric production is blocked by the enzyme inhibitor, NG-monomethylarginine, and is independent of calcium/calmodulin. RAW264.7 cells demonstrate rapid accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase-encoding mRNAs upon activation. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence to the calcium/calmodulin-dependent nitric oxide synthase previously purified (Bredt, D. S., and Synder, S.H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 682-685) and cloned (Bredt, D. S., Hwang, P. M., Glatt, C. E., Lowenstein, C., Reed, R. R., and Synder, S. H. (1991) nature 351, 714-718) from rat brain identifies shared binding sites for the cofactors NADPH and flavins in the C-terminal half of both proteins and an additional conserved region near the N terminus that may recognize L-arginine and/or contribute to the active site."
https://openalex.org/W2078225503,"Lymphocytes must proliferate and differentiate in response to low concentrations of a vast array of antigens. The requirements of broad specificity and sensitivity conflict because the former is met by low-affinity antigen receptors, which precludes achieving the latter with high-affinity receptors. Coligation of the membrane protein CD19 with the antigen receptor of B lymphocytes decreased the threshold for antigen receptor-dependent stimulation by two orders of magnitude. B lymphocytes proliferated when approximately 100 antigen receptors per cell, 0.03 percent of the total, were coligated with CD19. The B cell resolves its dilemma by having an accessory protein that enables activation when few antigen receptors are occupied."
https://openalex.org/W1981268965,"In the visual cortex of the brain, long-ranging tangentially oriented axon collaterals interconnect regularly spaced clusters of cells. These connections develop after birth and attain their specificity by pruning. To test whether there is selective stabilization of connections between those cells that exhibit correlated activity, kittens were raised with artificially induced strabismus (eye deviation) to eliminate the correlation between signals from the two eyes. In area 17, cell clusters were driven almost exclusively from either the right or the left eye and tangential intracortical fibers preferentially connected cell groups activated by the same eye. Thus, circuit selection depends on visual experience, and the selection criterion is the correlation of activity."

https://openalex.org/W1966482743,"Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with human bone marrow were treated with human mast cell growth factor, a fusion of interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PIXY321), or both, starting immediately or 1 month later. Immature human cells repopulated the mouse bone marrow with differentiated human cells of multiple myeloid and lymphoid lineages; inclusion of erythropoietin resulted in human red cells in the peripheral blood. The bone marrow of growth factor-treated mice contained both multipotential and committed myeloid and erythroid progenitors, whereas mice not given growth factors had few human cells and only granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Thus, this system allows the detection of immature human cells, identification of the growth factors that regulate them, and the establishment of animal models of human hematopoietic diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1486866108,"We have previously identified a 15-kDa interferon-induced protein that is recognized by affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ubiquitin (Haas, A. L., Ahrens, P., Bright, P. M., and Ankel, H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11315-11323). This ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP) possesses significant homology to a tandem diubiquitin sequence. Since the biological effects of ubiquitin arise from its covalent ligation to intracellular target proteins, we hypothesized that the multiple cellular responses to inteferon are mediated in part by an analogous conjugation pathway for UCRP. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for UCRP were prepared against homogeneous recombinant protein. Affinity-purified anti-UCRP antibodies detected the induction of UCRP in interferon-beta-treated A549 cells and recognized a group of high molecular weight UCRP conjugates on immunoblots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-resolved cell extracts. Both free and conjugated UCRP are constitutively present at low levels in untreated cells, suggesting a role for UCRP ligation in normal cellular regulation, and significantly accumulate following interferon treatment. The temporal induction of free UCRP following interferon treatment preceded a delayed increase in UCRP conjugates. Treatment of A549 cells with type I interferons (alpha and beta) strongly induced the expression of free and conjugated UCRP, whereas the response to type II interferon (gamma) was significantly less. A survey of selected cultured cell lines showed differential induction of free versus conjugated UCRP pools in response to interferon. Interferon-beta treatment of A549, MG63, and U937 cells induced high levels of both free and conjugated UCRP, whereas only free UCRP levels increased in Daudi, Namalwa, and K562 cells. These results confirm that UCRP represents a functional ubiquitin homolog participating in a parallel pathway of post-translational ligation and provides a novel mechanism for the response of susceptible cells to the effects of interferon exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1568192877,"Kidney medullary cells in situ, as well as kidney-derived Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells accumulate nonperturbing, small organic solutes (osmolytes), including myo-inositol, when bathed in hypertonic media. Accumulation of osmolytes balances the osmolality of extracellular fluid without raising intracellular salts that would perturb cellular functions. In hypertonic media, increased myo-inositol accumulation is the result of increased activity of a Na+/myo-inositol cotransporter. We have isolated a cDNA encoding a Na+/myo-inositol cotransporter from MDCK cells using expression in Xenopus oocytes. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 718 amino acids with a significant amino acid sequence similarity to the Na+/D-glucose cotransporters of absorbing epithelia. Transporter mRNA is present in kidney and brain and is markedly induced in MDCK cells by medium hypertonicity, demonstrating that adaptation to hypertonic stress involves up-regulation of transporter mRNA accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1552333098,"Human alveolar macrophages (HAM) express an elastase activity of acidic pH optimum inhibitable by cysteine protease inhibitors. Recent studies indicate that the only known eukaryotic elastinolytic cysteine protease, cathepsin L, cannot completely account for this activity. In order to search for additional cysteine proteases with elastinolytic activity, low degeneracy oligonucleotide primers based on regions of strong homology among the known cysteine proteases were used to screen reverse-transcribed HAM RNA for cysteine proteases by the polymerase chain reaction. Among the cDNA sequences generated was a 493-base pair product highly homologous to bovine cathepsin S. Screening of a HAM cDNA eukaryotic expression library with this cDNA yielded a 1.7-kilobase full-length cDNA highly homologous to bovine cathepsin S (approximately 85% identical). This cDNA predicts a 331-amino acid preprocathepsin. Expression of this cDNA in COS cells revealed the active enzyme to be a single chain 28-kDa protease, as judged by active site labeling with a novel iodinated analogue of N-(L-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-leucylamido-(4-gua nido)butane (E-64). The recombinant enzyme was found to be elastinolytic toward 3H-labeled elastin (bovine ligamentum nuchae) at pH 5.5 but with 25% of this activity retained at pH 7.0. Labeling of HAM with the active site probe revealed these cells express a 28-kDa cysteine protease, and Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a approximately 1.7-kilobase cathepsin S mRNA. These data establish that human macrophages express at least two cysteine proteases with elastinolytic activity. The relatively broad pH range of human cathepsin S activity suggests this enzyme may contribute to the contact-dependent elastase activity of live human alveolar macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2046184981,"Id is a helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein that represses activity of several basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins involved in cell type--specific transcription and cell lineage commitment. The myeloid precursor cell line 32DC13(G) expressed Id messenger RNA, which was transiently decreased when cells were induced to terminally differentiate with granulocyte--colony-stimulating factor. Concomitant with the decrease of Id messenger RNA was the appearance in nuclear extracts of DNA binding proteins that recognized a canonical E-box motif, a DNA binding site for some bHLH proteins. Constitutive expression of an Id complementary DNA in 32DC13(G) cells blocked their ability to differentiate and to induce E-box-binding activity. These results suggest that Id and, hence, bHLH proteins function in the process of myeloid differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1498425904,"Phagocytic cells of many higher species express calcium mobilizing G protein-coupled receptors for bacterial N-formyl peptides which mediate chemotaxis, degranulation, and the respiratory burst. cDNA encoding an N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) has been reported. We now report the isolation of a closely related cDNA, 2.6 kilobase pairs in length, which we have designated as the FPRL1 receptor cDNA (FPRL1 = formyl peptide receptor like-1). FPR and the FPRL1 receptor derive from small, single-copy genes, both of which are located on human chromosome 19. The gene loci are designated FPR1 and FPRL1, respectively. Both FPR and FPRL1 cDNA cross-hybridize under high stringency conditions with a third gene, designated as FPRL2, which does not appear to be expressed in neutrophils. In contrast, transcripts for both the FPRL1 receptor and FPR are detected only in differentiated myeloid cells; the distribution of N-formyl peptide binding sites is also restricted to mature myeloid cells. FPRL1 cDNA encodes a 351-amino acid polypeptide whose sequence is 69% identical to that of FPR. G protein-coupled receptors that exhibit this degree of structural similarity typically possess a conserved ligand specificity. However, the FPRL1 receptor does not bind prototype N-formyl peptide ligands when expressed in heterologous cell types. These results suggest that FPR1 may be the only gene that is expressed by neutrophils that encodes a receptor capable of binding prototype N-formyl peptides. Moreover, discovery of the FPRL1 receptor indicates the existence of another as yet unidentified peptide that may recruit neutrophils to sites of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1497519846,"Fatty acids are important metabolic substrates and may also be involved in pathological syndromes such as the insulin resistance of diabetes and obesity. We demonstrate here that fatty acids can regulate specific gene expression; mRNAs encoding the fatty acid binding protein adipocyte P2 (aP2) and the Fos-related transcription factor Fra1 are specifically induced at least 20-fold upon treatment of preadipocytes with oleate. For aP2, the effect requires long chain fatty acids and occurs without a generalized activation of the genes linked to adipocyte differentiation. Other fibroblastic cells without preadipocyte characteristics do not induce aP2 mRNA in response to fatty acids. Unlike aP2, Fra1 induction by fatty acids also can be detected in NIH 3T3 and 3T3-C2 fibroblasts. Nuclear transcription assays in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes demonstrate that fatty acids elicit no transcriptional increase in the aP2 gene. Fra1, on the other hand, shows a 3-4-fold increase in transcription. These results demonstrate at least two distinct mechanisms by which fatty acids may influence gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1517339521,"We report the isolation of a cDNA clone providing the first and complete sequence of mouse 72-kDa type IV collagenase. The clone contains 2800 nucleotides with a 1986-nucleotide open reading frame coding for 662 amino acids. The amino acid sequence includes a 29-residue signal peptide, an 80-residue propeptide, and a 553-residue enzyme proper. The sequence identity between the mouse and human enzymes is 96% with all cysteine residues conserved. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the mouse enzyme contains two more residues than the human enzyme. Northern hybridization analysis revealed considerable expression of the enzyme gene in newborn mouse lung, heart, kidney, and psoas muscle tissues, whereas only weak or no signals were observed in liver, spleen, and brain. Expression of the gene was substantially reduced in the same tissues of 3-month-old mice. In situ hybridization analysis of 72-kDa type IV collagenase expression in 10-15-day-old mouse embryos showed that the gene was intensely expressed in mesenchymal cells. Brain and surface ectoderm were completely negative. The epithelial tissue component of developing organs was negative with the exception of salivary gland. Although the expression varied somewhat between different mesenchymal tissues, no temporal or spatial changes could be associated with the advancement of epithelial branching morphogenesis. These findings together with our previous data on the expression of 72-kDa type IV collagenase in human tumors indicate that this enzyme has some very specific roles both in the physiological and pathological degradation of extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it has become clear that the closely related 92-kDa type IV collagenase differs completely with respect to expression pattern as well as gene regulation. The mouse cDNA clones reported in this study may provide important tools unraveling the actual roles of these enzymes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2046127685,"Prediction and modeling of RNA structure requires knowledge of the free energy contributions of various interactions. Many unusual hydrogen bonds were recently proposed in the structure of a GCAA hairpin determined from nuclear magnetic resonance. The contributions of these hydrogen bonds to the folding stability of the hairpin formed by rGGCGCAAGCC have now been investigated through the use of functional group substitutions. These and previous results suggest a strong context dependence for the free energy of hydrogen bond formation. The results also suggest that the phylogenetic preference for GNRA (where N = A, C, G, or U and R = A or G) tetraloops may have a functional rather than thermodynamic basis."
https://openalex.org/W1530177683,"Platelets provide a useful system for studying Fc gamma receptor-mediated signaling events because these cells express only a single class of Fc gamma receptors and because platelet aggregation and secretion can be activated through Fc gamma receptor stimulation. We report here that stimulation of platelets by cross-linking antibodies to Fc gamma RII or by treatment with an anti-CD9 monoclonal antibody, which acts through Fc gamma RII, causes an induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple platelet proteins. Although the profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by stimulation of this Fc receptor was similar to that induced by thrombin, an additional 40-kDa phosphorylated protein was also detected. This protein co-migrated with Fc gamma RII and was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to Fc gamma RII. In addition, after the cross-linking of Fc gamma RII in HEL cells or in COS-1 cells transfected with Fc gamma RII cDNA, the 40-kDa protein immunoprecipitated with anti-Fc gamma RII was also phosphorylated on tyrosine. These data strongly suggest that Fc gamma RII itself is a substrate for a tyrosine kinase(s) activated when Fc gamma RII is stimulated. Fc gamma RII was phosphorylated by the Src protein in vitro, suggesting that this kinase may be responsible for phosphorylation of Fc gamma RII in vivo. These studies establish that activation of platelets and human erythroleukemia cells through Fc gamma RII and CD9 involves an induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins including Fc gamma RII itself and suggest that these phosphorylation events may be involved in Fc gamma RII-mediated cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2020403539,"Diacylglycerols, which are generated during phospholipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of phospholipids, stimulated actin polymerization in the presence of highly purified plasma membranes from the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. The increased rate of actin polymerization apparently resulted from de novo formation of actin nucleation sites rather than uncapping of existing filament ends, because the membranes lacked detectable endogenous actin. The increased actin nucleation was mediated by a peripheral membrane component other than protein kinase C, the classical target of diacylglycerol action. These results indicate that diacylglycerols increase actin nucleation at plasma membranes and suggest a mechanism whereby signal transduction pathways may control cytoskeletal assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1566404299,"alpha s1-Casein variants F and D, synthesized in goat milk at lower levels than variant A, essentially differ from it by internal deletions of 37 and 11 amino acid residues, respectively. Northern blot analysis of mRNAs encoding alpha s1-casein F and A and sequencing of the relevant cloned cDNAs, as well as sequencing of in vitro amplified genomic fragments, revealed multiple alternatively processed transcripts, from the F allele. Although correctly spliced messengers were identified, most of the FmRNAs lacked three exons. These exons, further identified as exons 9, 10, and 11, together encode the 37 amino acid residues present in alpha s1-casein variant A but missing in variant F. Exon 9 codes for the sequence present in variant A but deleted in variant D. A single nucleotide deletion in exon 9 and two insertions, 11 and 3 base pairs in length, in the downstream intron, were identified as mutations potentially responsible for the alternative skipping of these 3 exons. From a computer-predicted secondary structure it appeared that the 11-base pair insertion might be involved in base-pairing interactions with the intron 5' splice site which might consequently be less accessible to U1 snRNA. We also report here the complete structural organization of the goat alpha s1-casein transcription unit, deduced from polymerase chain reaction experiments. It contains 19 exons scattered within a nucleotide stretch nearly 17-kilobase pairs long."
https://openalex.org/W1485999498,"The interferon-inducible double-stranded (ds) RNA-activated protein kinase (p68 kinase) is a physiologically important enzyme that regulates the rate of cellular and viral protein synthesis by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating the peptide chain initiation factor 2. We have generated a cDNA clone of the human p68 kinase by polymerase chain reaction cloning using the recently published sequence of this enzyme. Active enzyme was synthesized by in vitro transcription-translation of the cDNA clone. This system was used for mapping the dsRNA-binding domain of the enzyme. Progressive deletions from the carboxyl terminus were introduced by digesting the cDNA with suitable restriction enzymes. Expression of proteins harboring deletions from the amino terminus was achieved by cloning DNA fragments into appropriately constructed expression vectors. Affinity of the truncated proteins for dsRNA was examined by testing their capacity to bind to dsRNA-agarose beads. Our results demonstrated that the dsRNA-binding domain lies at the amino terminus of the protein. A truncated protein containing the first 170 amino acid residues from the amino terminus could bind to dsRNA. However, deletion of 34 residues from the amino terminus or 41 residues from the carboxyl terminus of this truncated protein eliminated its dsRNA-binding activity. Comparison of the primary structure and the secondary structure of this region of p68 kinase and the corresponding region of 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase revealed no apparent similarity."
https://openalex.org/W2081001417,"We generated transgenic mice that specifically express foreign genes in myelinating Schwann cells. A 1.1 kb segment of 5′ flanking sequence from the rat P0 gene was used to drive expression of the genes encoding human growth hormone (hGH) and bacterial diphtheria toxin A chain (DT-A). The P0-hGH mice expressed hGH in myelinating Schwann cells, but not in nonmyelinating Schwann cells, the central nervous system, or any other tissue assayed. This expression was activated on a developmental schedule comparable to that of endogenous myelin gene expression. One line of P0-DT-A mice developed a generalized hypomyelinating peripheral neuropathy, with Schwann cell deficiency apparent in newborn animals. Peripheral nerves from adult mice of this line displayed morphological alterations ranging from completely denuded axons to myelinated Schwann cells undergoing degeneration, although occasional Schwann cells were able to form apparently normal myelin sheaths. Pronounced secondary changes, including proliferation and retraction of processes, occurred in the nonmyelinating Schwann cells of these P0-DT-A mice."
https://openalex.org/W1543778012,"We reported previously that stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells through the high-affinity IgE receptor resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 72-kDa protein (pp72) that was coupled to signal transduction. In the present study, although pp72 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced only by antigen triggering, stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells by either antigen or the calcium-ionophore A23187 led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110-kDa protein (pp110). This tyrosine phosphorylated protein was also observed when RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with the G protein-coupled m3 muscarinic receptor and then stimulated to secrete with carbachol. In contrast to tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72, antigen-induced pp110 tyrosine phosphorylation required extracellular calcium, was absent in cells depleted of protein kinase C, and was detected between 1 and 5 min after stimulation. The protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocked both histamine release and tyrosine phosphorylation induced by A23187. Altogether, the data suggest a role for pp110 in secretion. However, protein kinase C activation induced pp110 tyrosine phosphorylation but not histamine release demonstrating that pp110 tyrosine phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for degranulation. We conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72 is associated with the early steps of IgE receptor-generated signaling, whereas pp110 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs secondary to calcium influx and protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W243299273,"High affinity binding of factor VIIa (VIIa) to its cellular receptor tissue factor (TF), as well as association of factor X with phospholipid are required for optimal assembly of the extrinsic activation complex. In addition to the interactions of substrate with phospholipid and enzyme, we here provide evidence that cofactor residues Lys-165 and Lys-166 specifically contribute to the recognition of macromolecular substrate. Ala for Lys replacement in TFA165A166 was compatible with high affinity binding of VIIa when analyzed on cell surfaces as well as in the absence of phospholipid. Dissociation of TFA165A166.VIIa did not occur with a faster rate compared to TF.VIIa, further supporting unaltered VIIa binding function of TFA165A166. Cleavage of chromogenic peptidyl substrate by TFA165A166.VIIa complexes was not diminished, demonstrating that TFA165A166 supported enhancement of catalytic function of the VIIa protease domain. In contrast, factor X activation was reduced in the presence and absence of phospholipid. Further, TFA165A166 effectively competed with wild-type TF in the cleavage of factor X at limited VIIa concentrations. Selective reduction in macromolecular substrate hydrolysis combined with normal VIIa binding by TFA165A166 indicates that the cofactor TF does contribute, either directly or indirectly via specific interactions with VIIa, to factor X recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1511855455,"Abstract The gene responsible for fibrosis (CF) has recently been cloned and sequenced. When transfected into CF epithelial cells, normal transcripts of this gene correct the underlying defect in CF, i.e. cAMP-dependent Cl- secretion is restored. Thus, the protein encoded by this gene, designated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), somehow participates in the Cl- secretory response. In this paper we have correlated CFTR gene expression with cAMP and Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- secretion in unpolarized (parental) and polarized (Cl.19A) clones of the human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29. These cell lines were found to express equally high levels of CFTR mRNA at 4 days post-passage. In addition, protein expression (determined by immunoprecipitation) was also identical. The cAMP-generating agonist forskolin had little effect on 125I efflux from the unpolarized cells. In contrast, this agonist increased 125I efflux 3-fold in polarized cells. The lack of response in the unpolarized cells was not due to the inability of forskolin to raise cAMP levels. Neurotensin, a Ca(2+)-mobilizing agonist, stimulated 125I efflux from both cell lines. In the polarized cells, the magnitude of this response was attenuated at 8 days post-seeding. At this time, the undifferentiated line attained some cAMP responsiveness. This latter effect was paralleled by the appearance of monolayers within areas of the multicell layer. Cell-attached patch-clamp recording from apical membrane patches of polarized cells revealed the presence of a forskolin-stimulated 8-pS Cl- channel; no channel activity was observed in forskolin-stimulated unpolarized cells. Ca(2+)-activated Cl- channels were found in both cell lines. In agreement with the 125I efflux data, the single-channel activation response to [Ca2+]i was smaller in the polarized cell line. From these studies, we can conclude that CFTR expression, measured both at the mRNA and protein level, does not correlate with the colonocyte's ability to secrete chloride ions in response to a cAMP-generating agonist. Cyclic AMP-dependent Cl- secretion requires cellular polarization; specifically, the delineation of an apical membrane. Differences in the cellular location of CFTR during differentiation are likely to explain our results. In contrast, Ca(2+)-stimulated Cl- secretion occurred independently of cellular polarization but was reduced when the cells formed tight junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1574858023,"The majority of mutations which lead to clinical cystic fibrosis are located within the two predicted nucleotide binding domains of the cystic fibrosis gene product. We have used a prokaryotic expression system to synthesize and purify the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD-1, amino acids 426-588) with and without the most common mutation associated with the disease (the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508, delta F508). Both wild type and delta F508 NBD-1 bind ATP-agarose in a quantitatively comparable manner; this binding was inhibited by excess Na2ATP, trinitrophenol-ATP, or 8-azido-ATP. Irreversible NBD-1 labeling by an ATP analog was demonstrated using [32P]8-azido-ATP. This covalent labeling was inhibited by preincubation with Na2ATP, with half-maximal inhibition for Na2ATP occurring at approximately 5 mM for both the wild type and delta F508 nucleotide binding domain. These experiments are among the first to confirm the expectation that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator NBD-1 binds nucleotide. Since, under the conditions used in our study, NBD-1 without phenylalanine 508 displays very similar nucleotide binding characteristics to the wild type protein, our results support previous structural models which predict that the delta F508 mutation should not cause an alteration in ATP binding."
https://openalex.org/W1579042999,"Antibodies elicited by immunization with short peptides containing antigenic determinants have been shown, in general, to bind with greatly reduced affinity to the corresponding region in the native proteins. Thus, contiguous linear peptides have not proven to be effective immunogens in generating high affinity neutralizing or protective antibodies and consequently appear to be poor prospects for vaccines. The molecular basis for such reduced reactivity is clear from the crystal structure determination of antibody Fabs bound to protein antigens, which showed the complementarity between interfaces to be lock-and-key-like and extending over a large area (750 A2) involving discontinuous segments of the polypeptide chain. Thus, small perturbations in the secondary and tertiary structure of the antigen have profound effects on the fit of the antigen and its corresponding antibody. Because short peptides are unlikely to assume any particular conformation in solution, the fit is likely to be poor. New strategies are therefore required to produce conformationally stable peptides that mimic the critical structural features of the protein antigenic site. Here we show that a putative topographic determinant of the testis-specific isozyme of lactate dehydrogenase C4 (LDH-C4), designed and synthesized to adopt a well defined alpha-helical secondary and tertiary structure (four-helix bundle motif) in aqueous solutions, is highly immunogenic in both rabbits and mice, inducing IgG antibodies that bind to native LDH-C4. This engineered conformational 40-residue peptide is considerably more effective in inducing antibodies, as compared with the corresponding linear peptide. The antibody response is obtained without coupling the peptide to a carrier protein, suggesting that the peptide contains a T-cell antigenic determinant. The strategy described here to produce a conformationally stable peptide that mimics the native structure may have general applications in vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W1565382580,"The LuxR protein is a transcriptional activator involved in regulation of the genes required for bioluminescence (lux) in the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Transcription of the two divergently oriented lux operons (luxR and luxICDABEG) is activated by LuxR in the presence of a diffusible inducer (autoinducer). Transcription of the luxR gene is subject to both positive and negative autoregulation as well as activation by the cAMP-catabolite gene activator protein complex (cAMP-CAP). Transcription of luxR was studied using both luminescence in vivo as a reporter and primer extension analysis of mRNA synthesized in vivo. Mutation of the lux CAP-binding site resulted in a reduction in luminescence from the reporter and the complete loss of luxR positive autoregulation. Positive autoregulation was restored if luxR was provided in trans, demonstrating that LuxR and autoinducer activate luxR transcription in the absence of cAMP-CAP. By means of primer extension analysis, three sites of initiation of luxR transcription were demonstrated; initiation at two of these sites required cAMP-CAP. The quantity of all three transcripts was increased in the presence of LuxR and autoinducer when a plasmid with a wild-type CAP-binding site was used. Initiation at the cAMP-CAP-dependent sites was not observed from a plasmid with a mutated CAP-binding site in the presence or absence of autoinducer even with luxR supplied in trans. Instead, with luxR supplied in trans, initiation at the cAMP-CAP-independent initiation site was specifically stimulated by LuxR and autoinducer. Thus, in the course of positive autoregulation, the LuxR protein activates transcription from two luxR promoters by a cAMP-CAP-dependent mechanism and a third promoter by a cAMP-CAP-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1565385008,"Previously, two rat monoclonal antibodies where developed which bind distinct epitopes on a murine glycoprotein, P112, which is expressed primarily in lung capillary endothelium. In this paper we show that P112 is identical to the endothelial anticoagulant protein, thrombomodulin (TM). Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, amino acid analysis of P112 shows a high degree of homology to TM, and both molecules exhibit the same mobility in gel electrophoresis. Second, P112 and TM share reactivity for two different monoclonal antibodies. Third, purified P112, like TM, acts as a cofactor for protein C activation. Finally, two cDNA clones identified with P112 polyclonal antiserum contain sequence identity with the known TM cDNA sequence. Quantitative analysis of TM (P112) expression using a two-site monoclonal antibody assay demonstrates that significantly higher levels of TM are found in lung in comparison with other highly vascularized organs, i.e. the kidney and liver. Quantitative Northern blot data coincides with the two-site assay data and demonstrates that the high level of TM expression in lung is not due to preferential binding of the monoclonal antibodies to lung TM but rather to increased production of TM mRNA in the lung relative to other highly vascularized organs. It is suggested that expression of TM is highest in cells from continuous endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W2085929632,"The interaction of Escherichia coli threonyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase with the leader sequence of its own messenger RNA inhibits ribosome binding, resulting in negative translational feedback regulation. The leader sequence resembles the substrate (tRNAThr) of the enzyme, and the nucleotides that mediate the correct recognition of the leader and the tRNA may be the same. A mutation suggested by tRNA identity rules that switches the resemblance of the leader sequence from tRNAThr to tRNAMet causes the translation of the threonyl-tRNA synthetase messenger RNA to become regulated by methionyl-tRNA synthetase. This identity swap in the leader messenger RNA indicates that tRNA identity rules may be extended to interactions of synthetases with other RNAs."

Substitution of the methionine anticodon CAU with the cysteine anticodon GCA was found to allow initiation of protein synthesis by the mutant tRNA from a complementary initiation codon in a reporter protein. Sequencing of the protein revealed that cysteine comprised about half of the amino acid at the N terminus. An additional mutation, converting the discriminator base of tRNA(GCAfMet) from A73 to the base present in tRNA(Cys) (U73), resulted in a 6-fold increase in the amount of protein produced and insertion of greater than or equal to 90% cysteine in response to the complementary initiation codon. Substitution of C73 or G73 at the discriminator position led to insertion of little or no cysteine, indicating the importance of U73 for recognition of the tRNA by cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase. Single base changes in the anticodon of tRNA(GCAfMet) containing U73 from GCA to UCA, GUA, GCC, and GCG (changes underlined) eliminated or dramatically reduced cysteine insertion by the mutant initiator tRNA indicating that all three cysteine anticodon bases are essential for specific aminoacylation of the tRNA with cysteine in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1668698517,"We have shown previously that a deletion mutant of human heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF)-1, HBGF-1U, lacking the sequence Asn-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Pro-Lys-Leu is capable of initiating c-fos mRNA expression and polypeptide phosphorylation on tyrosine residues at concentrations that do not induce either DNA synthesis or cell proliferation (1). The fact that addition of the nuclear translocation signal from the yeast histone 2B protein to the HBGF-1U mutant caused reconstitution of the biological activity of HBGF-1 indicated that nuclear translocation may be an important component of the mitogenic signal induced by HBGF-1. In order to examine the nuclear translocation potential of HBGF-1 alpha, the deletion mutant HBGF-1U, and the yeast histone 2B-HBGF-1 chimera, HBGF-1U2, we expressed these forms of HBGF-1 in murine endothelial cells. Western blot and two-dimensional Western blot analysis of cytosol and nuclei demonstrate that although the three forms of HBGF-1 are readily detectable in the cytosol of the individual transfectants, HBGF-1 alpha and HBGF-1U2 but not HBGF-1U was detected in the nucleus. Furthermore, murine endothelial cells expressing HBGF-1 alpha and HBGF-1U2 exhibited an atypical cellular phenotype in vitro that was absent in the HBGF-1U transfectants. These data suggest that HBGF-1 contains a functional nuclear translocation sequence that may be responsible for the initiation of DNA synthesis, and these data further correlate the presence of the nuclear translocation sequence with an abnormal endothelial cell phenotype in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1605304685,"The recessive mutation nanomelia blocks the synthesis of a large aggregating proteoglycan (aggrecan) by avian embryo chondrocytes. Lack of aggrecan is associated with short stature, multiple morphological defects in cartilage, and embryo lethality. Bony defects have also been described, but were assumed to be a secondary consequence of the cartilage defect. However, two lines of evidence presented in this paper indicate that the aggrecan deficiency directly affects intramembranous bone. First, the morphology (i.e. projected area and shape) of certain membranous bones of nanomelia embryos was abnormal. Second, membranous bone from nanomelia embryos proved to be significantly stiffer in biomechanical tests that measured functional properties of the extracellular matrix. These findings were unexpected because intramembranous bones normally develop from mesenchyme and not from a cartilage intermediate, and they prompted a search for evidence of aggrecan expression in the bone of normal chick embryos. We report that: 1) aggrecan mRNA was identified by PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from day-13 chick embryo calvarium, 2) the PCR method successfully amplified aggrecan mRNA from primary chick embryo osteoblasts in culture, 3) in situ hybridization of membranous bone tissue sections demonstrated aggrecan expression by chick embryo osteoblasts in vivo, and 4) the aggrecan message was identified in Northern blots of calvarial mRNA probed at high stringency. The results of the molecular and biomechanical studies provide evidence that aggrecan is indeed expressed in membranous bone as well as cartilage. Altogether, these results suggest that aggrecan may contribute to the functional properties and the normal growth and development of avian membranous bone."

https://openalex.org/W1592293066,"Human melanoma cells, A375-C6, were committed to growth arrest within a few hours of exposure to interleukin-1 (IL-1). Co-treatment with actinomycin D rescued the cells from the commitment, suggesting that gene activation events may be crucial for growth arrest. To understand the mechanism of IL-1 action, we are studying early genes whose expression is induced by the cytokine. Five early genes associated with IL-1 action in the melanoma cells were isolated by differential screening of a cDNA library, which was enriched for sequences representing IL-1 responsive genes (IRGs). Nucleotide sequencing identified four of the genes as gro-alpha, gro-beta, c-jun and nur77/NGF1-B/NAK1, respectively, while the fifth was judged as novel by GenBank search and designated IRG-9. None of the early genes was uniquely associated with the antiproliferative action of IL-1: other growth-inhibitory as well as growth-stimulatory signals induced these genes in diverse cell types. However, analysis of the induction patterns of the IRGs and other well known early genes revealed that IL-1 action in the melanoma cells is characterized by activation of a unique primary gene expression program. This program was defined by the magnitude and temporal pattern of induction of the five IRGs, feeble induction of c-fos, and lack of induction of Egr-1 and c-myc. We present evidence that this program is growth arrest-specific in the melanoma cells and that distinct cell type-specific programs are associated with IL-1 growth-regulatory actions in other tumor cells. Based on these data, we propose that early genes may play multifunctional roles in tumor growth control, but specificity for the growth arrest action of IL-1 is determined by the composite early gene induction program."
https://openalex.org/W1545260380,"The serum level of the fourth component of complement (C4) in mice bearing the H-2k haplotype is only 1/10 to 1/20 of that of non-H-2k mice. We have analyzed C4 cDNA clones from B10.BR(H-2k) mouse liver and found aberrant C4 cDNA which contained a 200-base pair (bp) insertion between the exon 13 and exon 14 encoded sequences in addition to the normal C4 cDNA. The 5' 148 bp and the 3' 52 bp of this insert were derived from the B2 sequence, the short interspersed repeats of mouse genome, and the central part of intron 13, respectively. Sequence analysis of intron 13 of the C4k gene showed the presence of a complete copy of a B2 consensus sequence. The structure of aberrant C4 mRNA indicated that the possible 3' splice site in the B2 sequence and the cryptic 5' splice site in intron 13 were used. Both the insertion of the B2 sequence into intron 13 and the presence of aberrant mRNA in the liver were specific to H-2k-bearing mice, suggesting that the aberrant splicing due to the B2 insertion is the basis for low C4 expression in H-2k mice."
https://openalex.org/W1524411228,"The effect of the local anesthetics SKF 525-A, dibucaine, tetracaine, procaine, and benzocaine on sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was studied. All the anesthetics tested inhibited the phosphorylation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase by Pi in a competitive manner. Tertiary amine and positively charged anesthetics, in addition to competing with Pi, also decreased the apparent affinity of the ATPase for Mg2+. There was a good correlation between the octanol/water partition coefficients and the inhibitory activity of the different anesthetics. All the anesthetics tested induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the rate of Ca2+ efflux. This was promoted by the same drug concentration that inhibited the phosphorylation of the ATPase by Pi. The effect on Ca2+ efflux was antagonized by the ligands of the ATPase (Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, MgATP, and ADP) and by the organic polyamines ruthenium red, spermine, spermidine, and putrescine. The natural anion heparin was found to potentiate the effect of the positively charged anesthetics on the rate of Ca2+ efflux. It is concluded that the local anesthetics increase the Ca2+ efflux through a nonenergized state of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, rather than promoting a nonspecific Ca2+ leakage through the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1538603889,"Estrogen regulates the expression of the yolk protein genes in the chicken liver during periods of egg laying. While all five of these genes, vitellogenins I, II, and III, very low density apolipoprotein II (apo VLDLII), and apolipoprotein B, respond to estrogen, individual controls are superimposed on their coordinate regulation with respect to the kinetics of induction, magnitude of response, and developmental expression. The estrogen-responsive Leghorn strain M hepatoma (LMH) cell line provides a model system for studying the molecular basis of the similarities and differences in the regulation of these genes. The apoVLDLII gene is regulated by estrogen in LMH cells in an appropriate time- and dose-dependent manner. Regulatory regions of the apoVLDLII gene have been identified by transient transfection studies in LMH cells. All four of the sequences previously shown to bind protein between the TAATA motif at -26 and proximal estrogen response element at -171 are essential in regulation of the apoVLDLII gene. Mutation of any single binding region reduces expression by more than 80%, indicating cooperative interactions of proteins across the entire region. While these sequences will direct assembly of a functional transcription complex, we demonstrate that addition of the first intron of the apoVLDLII gene to the promoter construct results in a 4-fold increase in estrogen-dependent expression following transient transfection into LMH cells. Results of deletion analyses indicate that two distinct regions of the intron contribute to this regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1516550690,"Monoclonal IgGs were shown to be useful for the specific inhibition of a set of activities of the recA protein, a key protein in homologous genetic recombination. The mapping of the epitopes for these IgGs and site-directed mutagenesis based on the mapping will facilitate location of the functionally active sites on the tertiary structure of the protein, which is being solved by means of physicochemical techniques. We developed a novel technique for region-specified mutagenesis and applied the technique to epitope mapping. Using the polymerase chain reaction in the presence of deoxyinosine triphosphate, we introduced random base substitutions specifically into a region of the recA gene defined by a pair of primers. RecA mutants exhibiting altered antigenicity were selected, in plaque-immunoblotting experiments, from libraries of mutagenized recA genes constructed on the lambda gt11 expression vector. Mutant recA genes were obtained at the frequency of about 10(-2) among the plaques expressing fused recA genes and then each one was expressed as a whole protein, which was characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analyzing the DNA sequences of the mutant recA genes, we located at the amino acid sequence level the epitopes for two anti-recA IgGs which could not be located in previous studies. One of the antibodies was shown to prevent self-assembly of the recA protein and the other was suggested to inhibit the binding of double-stranded DNA. Thus, the active sites involved in these functions would be located in the space around or near the relevant epitope."
https://openalex.org/W10456686,"Reduction of proteins which require disulfide bonds to be stable in the folded state is accompanied by step-wise unfolding. A soluble human interferon gamma receptor produced in Escherichia coli was used to investigate the kinetics of formation of unfolding intermediates. The protein includes 8 cysteine residues forming four disulfide bonds. It was reduced by using either dithiothreitol or the thioredoxin reduction system. Reduction with dithiothreitol resulted in formation of mainly four monomeric unfolding species as visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The enzymatically catalyzed reaction produced only small amounts of two monomeric products and mostly delivered oligomeric and polymeric forms. In both cases, the ligand binding capacity of the receptor was significantly reduced immediately after appearance of the first intermediate. The intermediates involved interchange of disulfide bonds and did not show ligand binding capacity. Some of them were recognized by specific antibodies which detect conformational epitopes on the native interferon gamma receptor. On the basis of the antibody binding, a preliminary characterization of the formed intermediates was attempted. When the soluble receptor was reduced in the presence of denaturing agents, the reduction products were different from the unfolding intermediates generated in the absence of denaturants."

https://openalex.org/W1577583614,"Leukoregulin (LR) is a novel T-cell derived cytokine with unique anti-tumor properties. We have recently demonstrated that LR is also able to modulate the biosynthetic repertoire of normal human skin fibroblasts in culture (Mauviel, A., Redini, F., Hartmann, D.J., Pujol, J.-P., and Evans, C.H. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 113, 1455-1462). In this study, we have examined in detail the effects of LR on collagenase gene expression in human skin fibroblast cultures. The results indicated time- and dose-dependent induction of collagenase mRNA steady-state levels, the maximum elevation being approximately 35-fold. In contrast, the mRNA levels for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases remained unchanged in the same RNA preparations. The enhancement of collagenase mRNA levels was shown to be dependent on protein synthesis, and it could be counteracted by dexamethasone or all-trans-retinoic acid. Transient transfections of cultured fibroblasts with a human collagenase promoter/reporter gene construct indicated up-regulation of the promoter activity, which could be blocked by dexamethasone and all-trans-retinoic acid. The observation suggested regulation at the transcriptional level of collagenase gene expression. LR was also shown to induce the mRNA levels for junB, suggesting possible involvement of the AP-1 complex in the regulation. The ability of LR to selectively induce collagenase gene expression in skin fibroblasts suggests that this cytokine may significantly contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix in physiological situations, such as tissue development and repair, and in diseases characterized by excessive degradation and turnover of collagen."
https://openalex.org/W259072379,"We have studied the discrepancy in the degree of methotrexate (MTX) resistance that exists between two clonal cell lines, mouse 3T6 R50 cells and Chinese hamster ovary B11 0.5 cells that overexpress comparable levels of dihydrofolate reductase, yet exhibit a 100-fold difference in MTX resistance while maintaining similar sensitivity to the lipophilic antifolates trimetrexate and piritrexim. These data suggested that R50 cells may possess additional mechanism(s) of antifolate resistance, such as MTX transport alteration. Flow cytometric analysis using fluorescein methotrexate revealed comparable levels of fluorescein MTX displacement with lipophilic antifolates in viable R50 and B11 0.5 cells, but marked insensitivity of R50 cells to MTX competition, thus suggesting a poor uptake of MTX into R50 cells. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of dihydrofolate reductase from R50 cells neither showed alterations in enzyme affinities for various antifolates nor in the Michaelis constant for folic acid and NADPH nor a change in the pH activity optimum. R50 cell-free extracts contained wild-type levels of folylpoly-gamma-glutamyl synthetase activity. However, following metabolic labeling with [3H]MTX, no MTX polyglutamates could be detected in R50 cells. We conclude that the high level of MTX resistance in R50 cells is multifactorial, including overexpression of dihydrofolate reductase, reduced MTX transport, and possibly altered formation of MTX polyglutamates. The potential interactions between the different modalities of MTX resistance in R50 cells are being discussed."
https://openalex.org/W230661754,"Abstract Human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) exists in two well defined, highly distinct conformations and in less well described intermediate conformations. In this study, previously characterized reactions were used to partially or completely transform the conformation of alpha 2M. Electron micrographs of each preparation were subjected to image analysis. Ternary alpha 2M-trypsin (2 mol of trypsin/mol of alpha 2M) was analyzed as a control for the fully transformed state. Correspondence analysis (CORAN) and hierarchical ascendant classification (HAC) generated five image clusters from 330 aligned alpha 2M-trypsin complexes. Average images of each cluster resembled the letter H with four nearly equivalent lateral arms. Abnormally shaped lateral arms were not demonstrated by HAC, using a variety of factor sets. In a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system, alpha 2M-thrombin migrated in a diffuse band partially behind alpha 2M-trypsin, suggesting conformational heterogeneity. CORAN and HAC of 733 alpha 2M-thrombin complexes identified two neighboring clusters, the average images of which showed an H-like structure in which one arm was replaced by a globular stain-excluding body. The two alpha 2M-thrombin clusters included 125 images (17.1% of image population). The complete absence of atypical lateral arm structure in the alpha 2M-trypsin clusters suggests that this variation is not the result of orientation or staining artifact. Native alpha 2M was reacted with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) and then with trypsin to form alpha 2M-Pt-trypsin, a preparation that includes partially transformed alpha 2M structures. CORAN and HAC of 580 alpha 2M-Pt-trypsin complexes generated five clusters, the average images of which showed atypical lateral arm structure equivalent to that demonstrated with alpha 2M-thrombin. The five alpha 2M-Pt-trypsin clusters accounted for 15.2% of the image population. These studies suggest that alpha 2M conformational change intermediates demonstrate common structural characteristics, permitting an elucidation of the steps involved in this complex transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1527370218,"The cell adhesion glycoprotein LFA-3 is expressed on the cell surface of nucleated cells in both a membrane-spanning form and a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored form. To determine whether distinct membrane anchors direct the dynamics of a given protein, the turnover of biosynthetically 35S-labeled and biotin surface-labeled LFA-3 molecules was followed. It is shown here that (a) expression of the two LFA-3 forms is regenerated with similar kinetics after enzymatic removal from the cell surface; (b) neither of the distinct LFA-3 molecules undergoes constitutive internalization; and (c) transmembrane and glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored LFA-3 have an unusually long life span with an identical half-life of 50 h. Thus, the type of membrane anchor is not affecting turnover characteristics of a particular cell surface glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1591725687,"Changes in insulin-regulated gene expression occur in a time- and tissue-dependent fashion. To monitor these changes we have adapted the S1 nuclease protection assay to allow simultaneous estimation of multiple RNA species in a single sample by using synthetic oligonucleotides of various lengths as probes for specific RNA species, which can then be resolved by electrophoresis. The multiple S1 nuclease protection assay was used to assess the influence of insulin on the RNA concentrations of 12 different genes in human skeletal muscle. Estimates obtained by this assay were comparable with those obtained by Northern analysis. RNA levels for proto-oncogene c-src displayed a transient 4-fold increase, whereas RNA levels for type 1 protein phosphatase were suppressed by 50% during the same time period. RNAs corresponding to known insulin-responsive genes such as c-fos, c-myc, c-Ha-ras, and c-src displayed rapid and transient 2-4-fold increases between 30 and 60 min as detected by either Northern analysis or the multiple S1 nuclease protection assay. In addition, RNA levels for the insulin receptor, Glut-4, Glut-3, and c-jun were apparently unaffected by exposure of the cells to insulin."
