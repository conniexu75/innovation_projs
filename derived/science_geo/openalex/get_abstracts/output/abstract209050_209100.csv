https://openalex.org/W1982800288,A METABOLITE with possible anabolic and marked uterotrophic activity has been isolated from extracts of the fungus Gibberella zeae (Fusarium graminearum).
https://openalex.org/W1991467421,Interaction properties of tropocollagen are markedly altered by treatment with pepsin. This treatment liberates terminal or near-terminal covalently bonded peptides whose amino acid composition is strikingly different from the composition of the pepsin-resistant triple-helix body of the macromolecule. Pepsin also converts most of the beta-chains to alpha-chains. This fact indicates that the interchain link is also external to the body of the macromolecule and probably involves peptides. The role of these properties in bioregulative mechanisms is briefly discussed.

All drugs inhibited eating, but only the centrally active compounds inhibited drinking. Anticholinergic drugs evidently block drinking by a central effect and eating by a peripheral effect."
https://openalex.org/W1965361724,"Eight nontransfused donors of antibodies against a hereditary gamma-globulin factor lacked the factor, but each donor's mother had it. The probability that this is a chance observation is .00003. A ninth donor had been transfused, and she and her mother both lacked the factor. It is assumed that each nontransfused donor's antibody was formed against his mother's gamma-globulin and that immune tolerance had not been induced."
https://openalex.org/W2083979723,"Persistent vaginal cornification induced in A/Crgl mice by brief postnatal treatment with estrogen is not prevented by later ovariectomy, adrenalectomy, or hypophysectomy. Transplantation of the persistently cornified vaginae into ovariectomized normal mice or into ovariectomized persistently estrous mice also does not eliminate cornification in the majority of transplants. Administration of ""anti-estrogenic"" steroids temporarily alters the vaginal picture in some but not all of these mice. The vaginal epithelium of the persistently estrous mouse appears to represent an altered cell population which does not require estrogen for its constant keratinization."

Colored components were removed with charcoal and diatomaceous earth, and salts by rapid passage through a column of granulated 8 percent agar gel. The virus particles were sorted according to length by passage through a 1 percent granulated agar-gel column to isolate the 300- and 200-mmicro fractions and through a 5 percent agar gel to isolate the shorter particles."

https://openalex.org/W2000903168,"RATS with large bilateral lesions of the lateral hypothalamus refuse to eat or drink and, unless force-fed and watered, die within two weeks of operation1–3. During an examination of these animals3 we noticed that the rate of loss of body-weight was greater and the duration of survival shorter than in intact rats deprived of food and water. Morgane4 has also remarked on this more rapid deterioration and has suggested that such lesions cause a specific ‘metabolic decay’."

https://openalex.org/W1627538187,"There are obvious limitations to normative studies of the kind described. Many of the studies dealt with special content areas-for example, mental health-and thus may not provide a sound basis for generalization. Selection of the various samples presented still greater problems. In some cases, the universe was so ill-defined (for example, that of science writers) that conventional sampling procedures were of doubtful significance. There were also limitations of subject availability and funds. Thus, we tended to proceed on an ad hoc basis, using more-or-less intact groups where we could find them-a group of scientists or a group of science writers attending an NSF-sponsored seminar; news editors from papers in the State of Wisconsin; and so on."

https://openalex.org/W2037741394,"Infant rats were ""handled"" by removing them periodically from their home cages. ""Non-handled"" rats were left undisturbed. Half of the animals were killed at weaning, and weights and cholinesterase activity were determined on four different sections of the brain. The remaining animals were conditioned to avoid an administered shock. Handling increased ventral-cortex and subcortical weights and decreased subcortical cholinesterase. No differences in avoidance conditioning were observed."

https://openalex.org/W2031516693,"IT has recently been reported that two patients who had the characteristic syndrome of congenital galactosaemia as infants, and who lack gal-1-P uridyl transferase in their red blood cells, are nevertheless able to oxidize galactose-1-14C to 14CO2 in vivo in a near-normal fashion1. It is therefore apparent that some tissues within these individuals must be capable of metabolizing galactose. Further studies on one of these subjects (T. B.), a 30-year-old Negro who was the first case of galactosaemia reported in the American literature2, have inquired into possible tissue differences with respect to the presence or absence of the metabolic derangement typical of galactosaemia."

Implications for the nature of the carcinogenic mechanism in the human organism are discussed, with emphasis on the possible effects of the ionizing radiation from iodine-131 and other short-lived isotopes."

https://openalex.org/W1977506388,"In studies with reserpine and with etryptamine, quite opposite electroencephalographic effects were obtained when either of these two drugs was administered to rabbits prior to surgical preparation for EEG recording as opposed to the drug being given after the rabbits had been fully prepared for EEG recording. With the one method, EEG rhythms indicative of sleep were obtained, while with the other method, EEG rhythms indicative of central nervous system stimulation were obtained, although with both methods, the amount of drug, duration of drug in animal, and type of acute preparation were identical for both sets of findings. The presurgical injection procedure produced EEG results more in accordance with behavioral and biochemical findings, even though the conventional procedure is to administer the experimental drug after the animal has been prepared for EEG recording."

https://openalex.org/W1994483698,"THE procedure of Gornall, Bardawill and David1 is widely used for the estimation of proteins, the only frequent modification being adjustment of the volumes to permit mixing of reagents and reading of the extinction directly in the cells of a spectrophotometer. Gornall, Bardawill and David1 state that ‘ammonium ion is a disturbing factor in the biuret reaction’, but provide no quantitative data. Some information on the interference has been provided by Henry, Sobel and Berkman2; but these workers used two biuret reagents of different composition and instead of a pure protein used serum as a standard. The extent of the interference of ammonium ion with the biuret reaction does not appear to be widely known. Thus, Dixon and Webb3 claim that “few of the non-protein materials likely to be present affect the estimation, and it is particularly useful because it is insensitive to ammonium salts”."
https://openalex.org/W2010431192,"WHENEVER a particular type of calculation is to be repeated frequently, the use of slide rules, nomograms or graphs eliminates a major part of the time required. This is frequently the case in problems involving isotopes of short half-life. Because radioactive decay is exponential, the conventional mechanical calculator is of little help. An ordinary slide rule is far from ideal, and its use requires familiarity with the mathematics of exponential decay. Therefore a simple special purpose rule has been devised to solve a specific problem. The utility of this rule should make it of general interest and may encourage the development of other rules for special purposes."

This work was stimulated by the reports of high correlations between carcass specific gravity and the chemical composition of the carcass published by numerous authors and summarized in ref. 1. Moreover, recent work2 emphasizes that subjective methods of estimating the proportion of fafc in the carcasses of lambs are unsatisfactory."
