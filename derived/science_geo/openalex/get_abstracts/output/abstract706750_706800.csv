https://openalex.org/W4313266870,"Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types relay parallel streams of visual feature information. We hypothesized that neuromodulators might efficiently control which visual information streams reach the cortex by selectively gating transmission from specific RGC axons in the thalamus. Using fiber photometry recordings, we found that optogenetic stimulation of serotonergic axons in primary visual thalamus of awake mice suppressed ongoing and visually evoked calcium activity and glutamate release from RGC boutons. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed that serotonin axon stimulation suppressed RGC boutons that responded strongly to global changes in luminance more than those responding only to local visual stimuli, while the converse was true for suppression induced by increases in arousal. Converging evidence suggests that differential expression of the 5-HT1B receptor on RGC presynaptic terminals, but not differential density of nearby serotonin axons, may contribute to the selective serotonergic gating of specific visual information streams before they can activate thalamocortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W4313315418,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing health disparities and disproportionately affected vulnerable individuals and communities (e.g., low-income, precariously housed or in institutional settings, racialized, migrant, refugee, 2SLBGTQ+). Despite their higher risk of infection and sub-optimal access to healthcare, Canada’s COVID-19 vaccination strategy focused primarily on age, as well as medical and occupational risk factors. Methods We conducted a mixed-methods constant comparative qualitative analysis of epidemiological data from a national database of COVID-19 cases and vaccine coverage in four Canadian jurisdictions. Jurisdictional policies, policy updates, and associated press releases were collected from government websites, and qualitative data were collected through 34 semi-structured interviews of key informants from nine Canadian jurisdictions. Interviews were coded and analyzed for themes and patterns. Results COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out in Canada in three phases, each accompanied by specific challenges. Vaccine delivery systems typically featured large-venue mass immunization sites that presented a variety of barriers for those from vulnerable communities. The engagement and targeted outreach that featured in the later phases were driven predominantly by the efforts of community organizations and primary care providers, with limited support from provincial governments. Conclusions While COVID-19 vaccine rollout in Canada is largely considered a success, such an interpretation is shaped by the metrics chosen. Vaccine delivery systems across Canada need substantial improvements to ensure optimal uptake and equitable access for all. Our findings suggest a more equitable model for vaccine delivery featuring early establishment of local barrier-free clinics, culturally safe and representative environment, as well as multi-lingual assistance, among other vulnerability-sensitive elements."

Identifying the relationship between NIHL and nutrient consumption could help in reducing the prevalence of hearing loss. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between NIHL and dietary factors using data of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (KNHANES). The data were collected from The Fifth KNHANES 2010–2012. The survey was taken by a total of 10,850 participants aged 20–65 years. Air conduction audiometry was measured at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz in both ears. Metabolic syndrome, noise exposure, alcohol consumption, smoking, income level, marital status, and nutritional intake were evaluated. The differences between non-HI and HI participants in the noise-exposed group showed statistically significant differences in age, sex, marital and smoking status, alcohol consumption, and fasting glucose and triglyceride levels (p&lt;0.05). In a multiple regression analysis of the noise-exposed group, age showed a significant association with HI (OR: 0.604; 95% CI: 0.538–0.678) after adjusting for confounders. In multivariate analysis for dietary factors affecting HI in noise-exposed groups, retinol (OR: 1.356; 95% CI: 1.068–1.722), niacin (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.022–2.201), and carbohydrates (OR: 0.692; 95% CI: 0.486–0.985) showed a significant association with NIHL. Age was identified as the only factor significantly affecting NIHL. When the dietary factors of the noise-exposed group were analyzed, high intake of niacin and retinol and low intake of carbohydrates appeared to reduce the risk of hearing loss."
https://openalex.org/W4313334013,"In eukaryotes, carnitine is best known for its ability to shuttle esterified fatty acids across mitochondrial membranes for β-oxidation. It also returns to the cytoplasm, in the form of acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC), some of the resulting acetyl groups for posttranslational protein modification and lipid biosynthesis. While dietary LAC supplementation has been clinically investigated, its effects on cellular metabolism are not well understood. To explain how exogenous LAC influences mammalian cell metabolism, we synthesized isotope-labeled forms of LAC and its analogs. In cultures of glucose-limited U87MG glioma cells, exogenous LAC contributed more robustly to intracellular acetyl-CoA pools than did β-hydroxybutyrate, the predominant circulating ketone body in mammals. The fact that most LAC-derived acetyl-CoA is cytosolic is evident from strong labeling of fatty acids in U87MG cells by exogenous 13C2-acetyl-L-carnitine. We found that the addition of d3-acetyl-L-carnitine increases the supply of acetyl-CoA for cytosolic posttranslational modifications due to its strong kinetic isotope effect on acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Surprisingly, whereas cytosolic carnitine acetyltransferase is believed to catalyze acetyl group transfer from LAC to coenzyme A, CRAT-/- U87MG cells were unimpaired in their ability to assimilate exogenous LAC into acetyl-CoA. We identified carnitine octanoyltransferase as the key enzyme in this process, implicating a role for peroxisomes in efficient LAC utilization. Our work has opened the door to further biochemical investigations of a new pathway for supplying acetyl-CoA to certain glucose-starved cells."
https://openalex.org/W4300962343,"The binding of nerve growth factor (NGF) to the tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) and p75NTR receptors activates a large variety of pathways regulating critical processes as diverse as proliferation, differentiation, membrane potential, synaptic plasticity, and pain. To ascertain the details of TrkA-p75NTR interaction and cooperation, a plethora of experiments, mostly based on receptor overexpression or downregulation, have been performed. Among the heterogeneous cellular systems used for studying NGF signaling, the PC12 pheochromocytoma-derived cell line is a widely used model. By means of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we created PC12 cells lacking TrkA, p75NTR , or both. We found that TrkA-null cells become unresponsive to NGF. Conversely, the absence of p75NTR enhances the phosphorylation of TrkA and its effectors. Using a patch-clamp, we demonstrated that the individual activation of TrkA and p75NTR by NGF results in antagonizing effects on the membrane potential. These newly developed PC12 cell lines can be used to investigate the specific roles of TrkA and p75NTR in a genetically defined cellular model, thus providing a useful platform for future studies and further gene editing."

We examined the prevalence of psychological distress and its association with social isolation among public university students in the southern United States.A cross-sectional survey was emailed to all University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill students in June 2020 and was open for two weeks. Students self-reported if they were self-isolating none, some, most, or all of the time. Validated screening instruments were used to assess clinically significant symptoms of depression, loneliness, and increased perceived stress. The data was weighted to the complete student population.7,012 completed surveys were included. Almost two-thirds (64%) of the students reported clinically significant depressive symptoms and 65% were categorized as lonely. An estimated 64% of students reported self-isolating most or all of the time. Compared to those self-isolating none of the time, students self-isolating some of the time were 1.78 (95% CI 1.37, 2.30) times as likely to report clinically significant depressive symptoms, and students self-isolating most or all of the time were 2.12 (95% CI 1.64, 2.74) and 2.27 (95% CI 1.75, 2.94) times as likely to report clinically significant depressive symptoms, respectively. Similar associations between self-isolation and loneliness and perceived stress were observed.The prevalence of adverse mental health indicators among this sample of university students in June 2020 was exceptionally high. University responses to the COVID-19 pandemic should prioritize student mental health and prepare a range of support services to mitigate mental health consequences as the pandemic continues to evolve."
https://openalex.org/W4313266915,"Localized mRNA translation regulates synapse function and axon maintenance, but how compartment-specific mRNA repertoires are regulated is largely unknown. We developed an axonal transcriptome capture method that allows deep sequencing of metabolically labeled mRNAs from retinal ganglion cell axon terminals in mouse. Comparing axonal-to-somal transcriptomes and axonal translatome-to-transcriptome enables genome-wide visualization of mRNA transport and translation and unveils potential regulators tuned to each process. FMRP and TDP-43 stand out as key regulators of transport, and experiments in Fmr1 knockout mice validate FMRP's role in the axonal transportation of synapse-related mRNAs. Pulse-and-chase experiments enable genome-wide assessment of mRNA stability in axons and reveal a strong coupling between mRNA translation and decay. Measuring the absolute mRNA abundance per axon terminal shows that the adult axonal transcriptome is stably maintained by persistent transport. Our datasets provide a rich resource for unique insights into RNA-based mechanisms in maintaining presynaptic structure and function in vivo."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of use and integration of Vayu bCPAP Systems into the newborn unit at Muhimbili National Hospital in Tanzania.A prospective qualitative study was conducted from April 6 to October 6 2021. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients treated with Vayu bCPAP Systems were collected and analyzed. Healthcare workers were interviewed until thematic saturation. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using a framework analysis.370 patients were treated with Vayu bCPAP Systems during the study period. Mean birth weight was 1522 g (500-3800), mean duration of bCPAP treatment was 7.2 days (<1-39 d), and survival to wean was 81.4%. Twenty-four healthcare workers were interviewed and perceived Vayu bCPAP Systems as having become essential for treating neonatal respiratory distress at MNH. Key reasons were that Vayu bCPAP Systems improve patient outcomes, are easy to use, and more patients are now able to receive quality care. Barriers to integration included durability of oxygen tubing material and training.It was feasible to implement and integrate Vayu bCPAP Systems into the care of neonates at Muhimbili National Hospital."
https://openalex.org/W4313306919,"The emergence of drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial uropathogens poses a grave threat worldwide, howbeit studies on their magnitude are limited in most African countries, including Ethiopia. Therefore, measuring the extent of their drug resistance is essential for developing strategies to confine the spread. A cross-sectional study was conducted at title hospital from 01 June to 31 August 2020. Midstream urine specimens were collected and inoculated onto MacConkey agar. Positive urine cultures showing significant bacteriuria as per the Kass count (>105 CFU/mL) were further subjected to biochemical tests to identify the type of uropathogens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique, and potential carbapenemase producers were phenotypically determined by the modified carbapenem inactivation method as per the CLSI guidelines. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26; P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Totally, 422 patients were included, and the majority were females (54.7%). The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative uropathogens was 12.9%, and 64.7% of them were carbapenemase producers. Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 5) was the predominant carbapenemase producer, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4). Consumption of antibiotics prior to six months of commencement of the study, the presence of chronic diseases and hospitalizations were statistically associated with UTI caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative uropathogens. Carbapenemase producers were resistant to most of the antibiotics tested. Our findings highlight the need for periodic regional bacteriological surveillance programs to guide empirical antibiotic therapy of UTI."

https://openalex.org/W4313379629,"Escherichia coli K-12 possesses two versions of Trk/Ktr/HKT-type potassium ion (K+) transporters, TrkG and TrkH. The current paradigm is that TrkG and TrkH have largely identical characteristics, and little information is available regarding their functional differences. Here, we show using cation uptake experiments with K+ transporter knockout mutants that TrkG and TrkH have distinct ion transport activities and physiological roles. K+-transport by TrkG required Na+, whereas TrkH-mediated K+ uptake was not affected by Na+. An aspartic acid located five residues away from a critical glycine in the third pore-forming region might be involved in regulation of Na+-dependent activation of TrkG. In addition, we found that TrkG but not TrkH had Na+ uptake activity. Our analysis of K+ transport mutants revealed that TrkH supported cell growth more than TrkG; however, TrkG was able to complement loss of TrkH-mediated K+ uptake in E. coli. Furthermore, we determined that transcription of trkG in E. coli was downregulated but not completely silenced by the xenogeneic silencing factor H-NS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein or heat-stable nucleoid-structuring protein). Taken together, the transport function of TrkG is clearly distinct from that of TrkH, and TrkG seems to have been accepted by E. coli during evolution as a K+ uptake system that coexists with TrkH."
https://openalex.org/W4313379921,"Obesity and diabetes normally cause mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatic lipid accumulation, while fatty acid synthesis is suppressed and malonyl-CoA is depleted in the liver of severe obese or diabetic animals. Therefore, a negative regulatory mechanism might work for the control of mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism that is independent of malonyl-CoA in the diabetic animals. As mitochondrial β-oxidation is controlled by the acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio, and the acetyl-CoA generated in peroxisomal β-oxidation could be transported into mitochondria via carnitine shuttles, we hypothesize that peroxisomal β-oxidation might play a role in regulating mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and inducing hepatic steatosis under the condition of obesity or diabetes. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which peroxisomal β-oxidation controls mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in diabetic animals. We determined that excessive oxidation of fatty acids by peroxisomes generates considerable acetyl-carnitine in the liver of diabetic mice, which significantly elevates the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA/CoA ratio and causes feedback suppression of mitochondrial β-oxidation. Additionally, we found that specific suppression of peroxisomal β-oxidation enhances mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by reducing acetyl-carnitine formation in the liver of obese mice. In conclusion, we suggest that induction of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation serves as a mechanism for diabetes-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Targeting peroxisomal β-oxidation might be a promising pathway in improving hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance as induced by obesity or diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4313398890,"The kinetochore establishes the linkage between chromosomes and the spindle microtubule plus ends during mitosis. In vertebrates, the spindle-kinetochore-associated (Ska1,2,3) complex stabilizes kinetochore attachment with the microtubule plus ends, but how Ska is recruited to and stabilized at the kinetochore-microtubule interface is not understood. Here, our results show that interaction of Ska1 with the general microtubule plus end-associated protein EB1 through a conserved motif regulates Ska recruitment to kinetochores in human cells. Ska1 forms a stable complex with EB1 via interaction with the motif in its N-terminal disordered loop region. Disruption of this interaction either by deleting or mutating the motif disrupts Ska complex recruitment to kinetochores and induces chromosome alignment defects, but it does not affect Ska complex assembly. Atomic-force microscopy imaging revealed that Ska1 is anchored to the C-terminal region of the EB1 dimer through its loop and thereby promotes formation of extended structures. Furthermore, our NMR data showed that the Ska1 motif binds to the residues in EB1 that are the binding sites of other plus end targeting proteins that are recruited to microtubules by EB1 through a similar conserved motif. Collectively, our results demonstrate that EB1-mediated Ska1 recruitment onto the microtubule serves as a general mechanism for the formation of vertebrate kinetochore-microtubule attachments and metaphase chromosome alignment."
https://openalex.org/W4313398930,"In response to environmental stresses, cells invoke translational control to conserve resources and rapidly reprogram gene expression for optimal adaptation. A central mechanism for translational control involves phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 (p-eIF2α), which reduces delivery of initiator tRNA to ribosomes. Because p-eIF2α is invoked by multiple protein kinases, each responding to distinct stresses, this pathway is named the integrated stress response (ISR). While p-eIF2α lowers bulk translation initiation, many stress-related mRNAs are preferentially translated. The process by which ribosomes delineate gene transcripts for preferential translation is known to involve upstream open reading frames (uORFs) embedded in the targeted mRNAs. In this study, we used polysome analyses and reporter assays to address the mechanisms directing preferential translation of human IBTKα in the ISR. The IBTKα mRNA encodes four uORFs, with only 5'-proximal uORF1 and uORF2 being translated. Of importance, the 5'-leader of IBTKα mRNA also contains a phylogenetically conserved stem-loop of moderate stability that is situated 11 nucleotides downstream of uORF2. The uORF2 is well translated and functions in combination with the stem-loop to effectively lower translation reinitiation at the IBTKα coding sequence. Upon stress-induced p-eIF2α, the uORF2/stem loop element can be bypassed to enhance IBTKα translation by a mechanism that may involve the modestly translated uORF1. Our study demonstrates that uORFs in conjunction with RNA secondary structures can be critical elements that serve as the ""bar code"" by which scanning ribosomes can delineate which mRNAs are preferentially translated in the ISR."
https://openalex.org/W4313307095,"In this paper, three optimal control problems are proposed to prevent forming lung fibrosis while control is transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the myofibroblast diffusion process. Two diffusion equations for fibroblast and myofibroblast are mathematically formulated as the system's dynamic, while different optimal control model problems are proposed to find the optimal TGF-β. During solving the first optimal control problem with the regulator objection function, it is understood that the control function gets unexpected negative values. Thus, in the second optimal control problem, for the control function, the non-negative constraint is imposed. This problem is solved successfully using the extended canonical Hamiltonian equations with no flux boundary conditions. Pontryagin's minimum principle is used to solve the related optimal control problems successfully. In the third optimal control problem, the fibroblast equation is added to a dynamic system consisting of the partial differential equation. The two-dimensional diffusion equations for fibroblast and myofibroblast are transferred to a system of ordinary differential equations using the central finite differences explicit method. Three theorems and two propositions are proved using extended Pontryagin's minimum principle and the extended Hamiltonian equations. Numerical results are given. We believe that this optimal strategy can help practitioners apply some medication to reduce the TGF-β in preventing the formation of pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4313315417,"In Korea, the prevalence rate of hypertension among people aged over 30 is on an upward trend, which increased from 26.2% in 2008 to 28.3% in 2018. This hovers above the global morbidity rate of hypertension. As hypertension is the cause of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular diseases, early treatment and management are critical. Also, while there has been numerous research conducted on exercise intervention, the number of studies done on hypertension and physical fitness falls far below. To identify the relationship between health and physical fitness depending on the blood pressure levels of Korean seniors, the physical fitness test results of the National Fitness Award 100 conducted in 2017 were used, and blood pressure level, physique, and physical fitness data of 17,110 elderly population aged above 65 were analyzed. IBM Statistics SPSS 25.0 was used to process the collected data. Due to the gender difference in blood pressure levels, physique, and physical strength, the analysis was conducted by each gender, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to identify the differences in physique and physical strength depending on the blood pressure level. Also, Tukey's HDS test was conducted if such differences were found. All analyzes were tested at the significance level (α) of 0.05. As a result of comparing the physique factors by blood pressure level, only males showed a significant difference between groups in terms of height(p = .019), and higher blood pressure implied greater height. Also, for both genders, those with high blood pressure appeared to have greater body weight(p < .001), body fat percentage(p < .001), BMI(p < .001), waist circumference(p < .001), and waist-to-height ratio(p < .001),. In addition, as the result of comparing health-related physical strength and skill-related physical strength by blood pressure level, males showed a significant difference only in muscular strength(p = .026) and flexibility(p < .001), while females showed a significant difference between groups in terms of cardiovascular endurance(p < .001), muscular strength(p = .025), muscular endurance(p < .001), balance, and motor coordination except for flexibility. Holistically, males only showed a significant difference in muscular strength and flexibility while females appeared to have a significant difference between groups in all categories except flexibility, which can be considered that physical fitness factors influence the blood pressure of females more than males."
https://openalex.org/W4313315738,"The brain volume loss also known as brain atrophy is increasingly observed among children in the course of performing neuroimaging using CT scan and MRI brains. While severe forms of brain volume loss are frequently associated with neurocognitive changes due to effects on thought processing speed, reasoning and memory of children that eventually alter their general personality, most clinicians embark themselves in managing the neurological manifestations of brain atrophy in childhood and less is known regarding the offending factors responsible for developing pre-senile brain atrophy. It was therefore the goal of this study to explore the factors that drive the occurrence of childhood brain volume under the guidance of brain CT scan quantitative evaluation.This study was a case-control study involving 168 subjects with brain atrophy who were compared with 168 age and gender matched control subjects with normal brains on CT scan under the age of 18 years. All the children with brain CT scan were subjected to an intense review of their birth and medical history including laboratory investigation reports.Results showed significant and influential risk factors for brain atrophy in varying trends among children including age between 14-17(OR = 1.1), male gender (OR = 1.9), birth outside facility (OR = 0.99), immaturity (OR = 1.04), malnutrition (OR = 0.97), head trauma (OR = 1.02), maternal alcoholism (OR = 1.0), antiepileptic drugs & convulsive disorders (OR = 1.0), radiation injury (OR = 1.06), space occupying lesions and ICP (OR = 1.01) and birth injury/asphyxia (OR = 1.02).Pathological reduction of brain volume in childhood exhibits a steady trend with the increase in pediatric age, with space occupying lesions & intracranial pressure being the most profound causes of brain atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W4313334051,"Misfolded proteins are recognized and degraded through protein quality control (PQC) pathways, which are essential for maintaining proteostasis and normal cellular functions. Defects in PQC can result in disease, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. The small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) were previously implicated in the degradation of nuclear misfolded proteins, but their functions in cytoplasmic PQC are unclear. Here, in a systematic screen of SUMO protein mutations in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified a mutant allele (Smt3-K38A/K40A) that sensitizes cells to proteotoxic stress induced by amino acid analogs. Smt3-K38A/K40A mutant strains also exhibited a defect in the turnover of a soluble PQC model substrate containing the CL1 degron (NES-GFP-Ura3-CL1) localized in the cytoplasm, but not the nucleus. Using human U2OS SUMO1- and SUMO2-KO cell lines, we observed a similar SUMO-dependent pathway for degradation of the mammalian degron-containing PQC reporter protein, GFP-CL1, also only in the cytoplasm but not the nucleus. Moreover, we found that turnover of GFP-CL1 in the cytoplasm was uniquely dependent on SUMO1 but not the SUMO2 paralogue. Additionally, we showed that turnover of GFP-CL1 in the cytoplasm is dependent on the AAA-ATPase, Cdc48/p97. Cellular fractionation studies and analysis of a SUMO1-GFP-CL1 fusion protein revealed that SUMO1 promotes cytoplasmic misfolded protein degradation by maintaining substrate solubility. Collectively, our findings reveal a conserved and previously unrecognized role for SUMO1 in regulating cytoplasmic PQC and provide valuable insights into the roles of sumoylation in PQC-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4313398612,"The N-terminal half of PHF2 harbors both a plant homeodomain (PHD) and a Jumonji domain. The PHD recognizes both histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 and methylated nonhistone proteins including vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1). The Jumonji domain erases the repressive dimethylation mark from histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) at select promoters. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of H3 (AR2TK4) and VRK1 (PR2VK4) bear an arginine at position 2 and lysine at position 4. Here, we show that the PHF2 N-terminal half binds to H3 and VRK1 peptides containing K4me3, with dissociation constants (KD values) of 160 nM and 42 nM, respectively, which are 4 × and 21 × lower (and higher affinities) than for the isolated PHD domain of PHF2. X-ray crystallography revealed that the K4me3-containing peptide is positioned within the PHD and Jumonji interface, with the positively charged R2 residue engaging acidic residues of the PHD and Jumonji domains and with the K4me3 moiety encircled by aromatic residues from both domains. We suggest that the micromolar binding affinities commonly observed for isolated methyl-lysine reader domains could be improved via additional functional interactions within the same polypeptide or its binding partners."
https://openalex.org/W4313399082,"Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) has a high propensity to misfold and form abnormal aggregates when it is subjected to oxidative stress or carries mutations associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the transition from functional soluble SOD1 protein to aggregated SOD1 protein is not completely clear. Here, we propose that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) represents a biophysical process that converts soluble SOD1 into aggregated SOD1. We determined that SOD1 undergoes LLPS in vitro and cells under oxidative stress. Abnormal oxidation of SOD1 induces maturation of droplets formed by LLPS, eventually leading to protein aggregation and fibrosis, and involves residues Cys111 and Trp32. Additionally, we found that pathological mutations in SOD1 associated with ALS alter the morphology and material state of the droplets and promote the transformation of SOD1 to solid-like oligomers which are toxic to nerve cells. Furthermore, the fibrous aggregates formed by both pathways have a concentration-dependent toxicity effect on nerve cells. Thus, these combined results strongly indicate that LLPS may play a major role in pathological SOD1 aggregation, contributing to pathogenesis in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W4313399136,"Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are the noncatalytic modules that assist functions of the catalytic modules in carbohydrate-active enzymes, and they are usually discrete structural domains in larger multimodular enzymes. CBMs often occur in tandem in different alginate lyases belonging to the CBM families 13, 16, and 32. However, none of the currently known CBMs in alginate lyases specifically bind to an internal alginate chain. In our investigation of the multidomain alginate lyase Dp0100 carrying several ancillary domains, we identified an alginate-binding domain denoted TM6-N4 using protein truncation analysis. The structure of this CBM domain was determined at 1.35 Å resolution. TM6-N4 exhibited an overall β-sandwich fold architecture with two antiparallel β-sheets. We identified an extended binding groove in the CBM using site-directed mutagenesis, docking, and surface electrostatic potential analysis. Affinity analysis revealed that residues of Lys10, Lys22, Lys25, Lys27, Lys31, Arg36, and Tyr159 located on the bottom or the wall of the shallow groove are responsible for alginate binding, and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses indicated that the binding cleft consists of six subsites for sugar recognition. This substrate binding pattern is typical for type B CBM, and it represents the first CBM domain that specifically binds internal alginate chain. Phylogenetic analysis supports that TM6-N4 constitutes the founding member of a new CBM family denoted as CBM96. Our reported structure not only facilitates the investigation of the CBM-alginate ligand recognition mechanism but also inspires the utilization of the CBM domain in biotechnical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4313410176,"This study brings novelty to the tourism literature by re-examining the role of exchange rate in the tourism-growth nexus. It differs from previous tourism-led growth narrative to probe whether tourism exerts a positive effect on economic growth when the exchange rate is accounted for. Using a moderation modelling framework, instrumental variables general method of moments (IV-GMM) and quantile regression techniques in addition to real per capita GDP, tourism receipts and exchange rate, the study engages data on 44 Asian countries from 2010 to 2019. Results from the IV-GMM show that: (1) tourism exerts a positive effect on growth; (2) exchange rate depreciation hampers growth; (3) the interaction effect is positive but statistically not significant; and (4) results from EAP and SA samples are mixed. For the most part, constructive evidence from the quantile regression techniques reveals that the impact of tourism and exchange is significant at lower quantiles of 0.25 and 0.50 while the interaction effect is negative and statistically significant only for the SA sample. These are new contributions to the literature and policy recommendations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4313266782,"Visceral pain is among the most prevalent and bothersome forms of chronic pain, but their transmission in the spinal cord is still poorly understood. Here, we conducted focal colorectal distention (fCRD) to drive both visceromotor responses (VMRs) and aversion. We first found that spinal CCK neurons were necessary for noxious fCRD to drive both VMRs and aversion under naive conditions. We next showed that spinal VGLUT3 neurons mediate visceral allodynia, whose ablation caused loss of aversion evoked by low-intensity fCRD in mice with gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation or spinal circuit disinhibition. Importantly, these neurons were dispensable for driving sensitized VMRs under both inflammatory and central disinhibition conditions. Anatomically, a subset of VGLUT3 neurons projected to parabrachial nuclei, whose photoactivation sufficiently generated aversion in mice with GI inflammation, without influencing VMRs. Our studies suggest the presence of different spinal substrates that transmit nociceptive versus affective dimensions of visceral sensory information."

Pregnant women are most susceptible for Vitamin D deficiency, and black women particularly are under double burden of the problem. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency and identify associated factors among antenatal care attending pregnant women. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study involving 331 pregnant women was conducted from March to April in 2021. Systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants from antenatal care service providing facilities. Data were collected by using interviewer-administered questionnaire and 5ml of blood sample was collected using aseptic techniques. Data were entered into Epi Data software version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the associated factors. Results In this study, about 39% of the women were Vitamin D deficient; of which 8.8% were severely deficient. The mean serum Vitamin D level was 24.43ng/ml. Women with Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥30 (AOR = 47.31; 95% CI: 3.94, 567.70) and who never ate egg had a higher chance of being Vitamin D deficient (AOR = 7.48; 95% CI: 1.02, 55.05). On the other hand, women who were exposed to mid-day time sunlight (AOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.77) were less likely to become Vitamin D deficient. Conclusions Vitamin D deficiency is higher among obese women and women who did not consume egg. Being exposed to mid-day sunlight is protective against Vitamin D deficiency. Having optimal body weight, mid-day sun light exposure and consumption of Vitamin D rich diet might contribute to reduce the risk of Vitamin D deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4313307788,"Various low-volume bowel cleansing formulations that improve compliance have been approved and are being used in clinical practice. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of 1 L polyethylene glycol (PEG) with ascorbic acid with that of sodium picosulfate (PICO) with magnesium citrate. This was a multicenter, randomized controlled, non-inferiority study. Patients were randomized into a 1 L PEG with ascorbic acid group and a PICO with magnesium citrate group according to the bowel cleansing agent used. Colonoscopy was performed as a single-blind study wherein the endoscopist had no information about any bowel preparation agent. The efficacy of bowel cleansing was assessed using the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS), and adverse events, preferences, and satisfaction were evaluated using a patient-reported questionnaire before colonoscopy. A total of 254 participants were randomly assigned to two groups: 115 in the 1 L PEG with ascorbic acid group and 113 in the PICO with magnesium citrate group. Overall bowel cleansing success was not statistically different between the two groups (97.4 vs. 97.3%), confirming that 1 L PEG with ascorbic acid was not inferior to PICO with magnesium citrate (lower confidence limit, -4.15%; p = 1.00). High-quality bowel cleansing was achieved in 87% of the 1 L PEG with ascorbic acid group and 77% of the PICO with magnesium citrate group (Lower confidence limit, 1.29%, p = 0.05). In terms of patient satisfaction, PICO with magnesium citrate was better, but compliance and side effects were similar in both groups. The 1 L PEG with ascorbic acid showed similar efficacy and adverse events as PICO with magnesium citrate. Although 1 L PEG with ascorbic acid is very effective in bowel preparation despite its small volume, it is necessary to increase satisfaction such as taste and feeling."
https://openalex.org/W4313315409,"Female genital mutilation (FGM) includes a range of procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia. It is a harmful procedure that violates human rights of girls and women. FGM has been associated with obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI), among other adverse obstetric complications. However, the obstetric outcomes in high-income countries are not clear. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of OASI among primiparous women, with and without a history of FGM, giving birth in Sweden.A population-based cohort-study based on data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register during the period 2014-2018. The study included primiparous women with singleton term pregnancies. We compared the risk, using multivariable logistic regression, of our main outcome OASI between women with a diagnosis of FGM and women without a diagnosis of FGM. Secondary outcomes included episiotomy and instrumental vaginal delivery.A total of 239,486 primiparous women with a term singleton pregnancy were identified. We included 1,444 women with a diagnosis of FGM and 186,294 women without a diagnosis of FGM in our analysis. The overall rate of OASI was 3% in our study population. By using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we found that women with a diagnosis of FGM had a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) of OASI (OR 2.69, 95%CI: 2.14-3.37) compared to women without a diagnosis of FGM. We also found an association between FGM and instrumental delivery as well as the use of episiotomy.Women with a history of FGM have an almost tripled risk of OASI in comparison with women without FGM, when giving birth in a Swedish setting. Increased knowledge and awareness regarding FGM, and its potential health implications is crucial in order to minimise the risk of OASI among women with FGM giving birth in high-income countries. A limitation in our study is the lack of information about the specific types of FGM."
https://openalex.org/W4313315556,"Background The pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) service is introduced to save lives, restore mental and physical functions, and improve the quality of life of children living with HIV/AIDS. This evaluation aimed to assess the implementation status of the pediatric ART service provision in Gondar city administration health facilities to promote evidence-based decision-making for program improvement. Methods An institutional-based single case-study design with concurrent mixed methods were applied. The service was evaluated by the availability of essential resources, compliance of health providers with the standard guideline, and caregivers’ satisfaction dimensions. Document review, key informant interviews, observations, and interviewer-administered exit-interview were conducted. The quantitative data were analyzed in descriptive and analytical, while the qualitative data were transcribed, translated, and thematically analyzed. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with caregivers’ satisfaction. Results The overall implementation of pediatric ART service was 75.32%. The availability, compliance, and satisfaction were 68.96%, 74.44%, and 84.64%, respectively. Trained healthcare professionals, essential ART drugs, registers, and basic laboratory diagnostic equipment were reasonably available. However, the lack of opportunistic infection medications and adequate rooms were significant gaps in service provision. Respondents noted a shortage of drugs and rooms for consultation and service provision. Short travel distance (AOR = 2.87), low viral load (AOR = 3.15), and sex of caregivers (AOR = 4.98) were significantly associated with good satisfaction. Conclusions The overall implementation of pediatric ART service is well based on the pre-determined judgment criteria. The health facilities and policymakers are advised to focus on availing medications to treat opportunistic infections and expanding the health facility to have enough space for consultation and service provision. Furthermore, particular emphasis should be given to caregivers who come from long distances and patients with a high viral load to increase caregivers’ satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W4313315650,"We assessed clinical risk factors, anthropometric measures of adiposity and weight gain to determine associations with development of GDM in a cohort of pregnant women with obesity.This was a secondary analysis of the UPBEAT trial of a complex lifestyle intervention in pregnant women with obesity (ISRCTN89971375). Clinical risk factors, and measures of adiposity and weight were assessed in the early 2nd trimester (mean 17 +0 weeks), and adiposity and weight repeated in the early 3rd trimester (mean 27 +5 weeks').Of the 1117 women (median BMI 35.0 kg/m2) with complete data, 25.8% (n = 304) developed GDM (IADPSG criteria, OGTT 24-28weeks). Using multivariable analysis, early clinical risk factors associated with later development of GDM included age (adj OR 1.06 per year; 95% CI 1.04-1.09), previous GDM (3.27; 1.34-7.93) and systolic blood pressure (per 10mmHg, 1.34; 1.18-1.53). Anthropometric measures positively associated with GDM included second trimester (mean 17+0 weeks) subscapular skinfold thickness, (per 5mm, 1.12; 1.05-1.21), and neck circumference (per cm, 1.11; 1.05-1.18). GDM was not associated with gestational weight gain, or changes in skinfolds thicknesses or circumferences between visits.In this cohort of women with obesity, we confirmed clinical risk factors for GDM, (age, systolic blood pressure) previously identified in heterogeneous weight women but add to these indices of adiposity which may provide a discriminatory approach to GDM risk assessment in this group. This study also underscores the need to focus on modifiable factors pre-pregnancy as an opportunity for GDM prevention, as targeting gestational weight gain and adiposity during pregnancy is likely to be less effective."
https://openalex.org/W4313334307,"The family of small-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium ion channels (SK channels) is composed of four members (SK1, SK2, SK3, and SK4) involved in neuron-firing regulation. The gating of these channels depends on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and their sensitivity to this ion is provided by calmodulin (CaM). This protein binds to a specific region in SK channels known as the calmodulin-binding domain (CaMBD), an event which is essential for their gating. While CaMBDs are typically disordered in the absence of CaM, the SK2 channel subtype displays a small prefolded α-helical region in its CaMBD even if CaM is not present. This small helix is known to turn into a full α-helix upon CaM binding, although the molecular-level details for this conversion are not fully understood yet. In this work, we offer new insights on this physiologically relevant process by means of enhanced sampling, atomistic Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations, providing a more detailed understanding of CaM binding to this target. Our results show that CaM is necessary for inducing a full α-helix along the SK2 CaMBD through hydrophobic interactions with V426 and L427. However, it is also necessary that W431 does not compete for these interactions; the role of the small prefolded α-helix in the SK2 CaMBD would be to stabilize W431 so that this is the case. In conclusion, our findings provide further insight into a key interaction between CaM and SK channels that is important for channel sensitivity to Ca2+."

A role for CD1b in T-cell–mediated autoreactivity was proposed when it was established that CD1b can present self-phospholipids with short alkyl chains (∼C34) to T cells; however, the structural characteristics of this presentation and recognition are unclear. Here, we report the 1.9 Å resolution binary crystal structure of CD1b presenting a self-phosphatidylinositol-C34:1 and an endogenous scaffold lipid. Moreover, we also determined the 2.4 Å structure of CD1b–phosphatidylinositol complexed to an autoreactive αβ TCR, BC8B. We show that the TCR docks above CD1b and directly contacts the presented antigen, selecting for both the phosphoinositol headgroup and glycerol neck region via antigen remodeling within CD1b and allowing lateral escape of the inositol moiety through a channel formed by the TCR α-chain. Furthermore, through alanine scanning mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance, we identified key CD1b residues mediating this interaction, with Glu-80 abolishing TCR binding. We in addition define a role for both CD1b α1 and CD1b α2 molecular domains in modulating this interaction. These findings suggest that the BC8B TCR contacts both the presented phospholipid and the endogenous scaffold lipid via a dual mechanism of corecognition.

A. 2016; 113: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An emerging classification system divides CD1b–TCR interactions into three categories: TCRs are highly specific for individual lipid structures, broadly reactive to a family of structurally related lipids or CD1b specific in a lipid-independent manner (19Shahine A. Reinink P. Reijneveld J.F. Gras S. Holzheimer M. Cheng T.Y. et al.A T-cell receptor escape channel allows broad T-cell response to CD1b and membrane phospholipids.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For example, structural determination of CD1b in complex with autoreactive TCR PG90 (TRAV26-1/TRBV7-8) was highly specific for the phospholipid bound, whereas BC8B (TRAV9-2/TRBV6-2) could respond broadly to many glycerylphospholipids. This promiscuous recognition occurs because the TCR binds the neck region that is common to many phospholipid classes (19Shahine A. Reinink P. Reijneveld J.F. Gras S. Holzheimer M. Cheng T.Y. et al.A T-cell receptor escape channel allows broad T-cell response to CD1b and membrane phospholipids.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Shahine A. van Rhijn I. Cheng T.Y. Iwany S. Gras S. Moody D.B. et al.A molecular basis of human T cell receptor autoreactivity toward self-phospholipids.Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2: aao1384Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In both cases, the TCR directly recognized the amphipathic lipid headgroups exposed on the outer surface of CD1b, but not the scaffold lipid, which is typically seated beneath the antigenic lipid, distant from the TCR. To further understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning CD1b-self-lipid antigen recognition, we sought to solve the structure of CD1b presenting a self-glycophospholipid in complex with an autoreactive αβTCR, BC8B. We determined the crystal structures of CD1b presenting self-phosphatidylinositol (CD1b–PI-C34:1) and CD1b–PI-C34:1–BC8B TCR and conducted alanine scanning mutagenesis on CD1b surface residues involved in BC8B TCR docking evaluated via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Our findings support the model of broadly reactive αβTCR recognition of CD1b presenting self-antigens, highlight conserved residues necessary for CD1b–phospholipid recognition by BC8B, and provide direct evidence of dual recognition directed toward both the presented antigen and the scaffold lipid. Previous structural determination of the molecular mechanisms of PI-C33:0 presentation by CD1b involved the refolding of CD1b expressed in Escherichia coli, which included the determination of artificially loaded detergent molecules within the binding pocket (35Gadola S.D. Zaccai N.R. Harlos K. Shepherd D. Castro-Palomino J.C. Ritter G. et al.Structure of human CD1b with bound ligands at 2.3 Å, a maze for alkyl chains.Nat.

In this study, we sought to determine the structure of CD1b exogenously loaded with cellular PI that contains two alkyl chains, C18 and C16:1, which combined have an overall unsaturation profile of C34:1. Cellular endogenous lipids were displaced from CD1b by first loading with lysosulfatide, and subsequently loaded with PI, and purified via anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1A). Lipid loaded onto CD1b was validated by isoelectric focusing gel (Fig. 1B), before being crystallized, and the structure of CD1b–PI solved to a resolution of 1.9 Å (Fig. 2A and Table 1). The electron density for both PI acyl tails was clearly defined, with the C18:1 sn2 tail extending toward the base of the A′ portal, and the C16:0 sn1 tail anchored in the C′ portal (Fig. 2B). In addition, a single tube of electron density was observable with the T′ and F′ portals, corresponding to a single scaffold lipid of 31 carbons in length, where the lipid remains buried within the F′ pocket (Fig. 2B).Figure 2Presentation of PI-C34:1 by CD1b and comparison with refolded CD1b–PI-C33:0.

However, because of sn1 tail length differences by one carbon, PI-C33:0 penetrates deeper into the C′ portal. The CD1b α2 hinge region bends toward the PI-C34:1 headgroup, where the inositol moiety is anchored via hydrogen bond. This is not the case with PI-C33:0 (Fig. 2C), where the side chain of Gln152 faces in the opposite direction, away from PI-C33:0. This interaction between inositol and the outer surface of CD1b is notable because previously determined CD1b–phospholipid antigen structures show no significant contacts made between CD1b and the solvent-exposed headgroup (37Shahine A.

https://openalex.org/W4313334376,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a lethal muscle wasting disease caused by the absence of the protein dystrophin. Utrophin is a dystrophin homologue currently under investigation as a protein replacement therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Dystrophin is hypothesized to function as a molecular shock absorber that mechanically stabilizes the sarcolemma. While utrophin is homologous with dystrophin from a molecular and biochemical perspective, we have recently shown that full-length utrophin expressed in eukaryotic cells is stiffer than what has been reported for dystrophin fragments expressed in bacteria. In this study, we show that differences in expression system impact the mechanical stiffness of a model utrophin fragment encoding the N terminus through spectrin repeat 3 (UtrN-R3). We also demonstrate that UtrN-R3 expressed in eukaryotic cells was phosphorylated while bacterial UtrN-R3 was not detectably phosphorylated. Using atomic force microscopy, we show that phosphorylated UtrN-R3 exhibited significantly higher unfolding forces compared to unphosphorylated UtrN-R3 without altering its actin-binding activity. Consistent with the effect of phosphorylation on mechanical stiffness, mutating the phosphorylated serine residues on insect eukaryotic protein to alanine decreased its stiffness to levels not different from unphosphorylated bacterial protein. Taken together, our data suggest that the mechanical properties of utrophin may be tuned by phosphorylation, with the potential to improve its efficacy as a protein replacement therapy for dystrophinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4313357296,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yta7 is a chromatin remodeler harboring a histone-interacting bromodomain (BRD) and two AAA+ modules. It is not well understood how Yta7 recognizes the histone H3 tail to promote nucleosome disassembly for DNA replication or RNA transcription. By cryo-EM analysis, here we show that Yta7 assembles a three-tiered hexamer with a top BRD tier, a middle AAA1 tier, and a bottom AAA2 tier. Unexpectedly, the Yta7 BRD stabilizes a four-stranded β-helix, termed BRD-interacting motif (BIM), of the largely disordered N-terminal region. The BIM motif is unique to the baker's yeast, and we show both BRD and BIM contribute to nucleosome recognition. We found that Yta7 binds both acetylated and nonacetylated H3 peptides but with a higher affinity for the unmodified peptide. This property is consistent with the absence of key residues of canonical BRDs involved in acetylated peptide recognition and the role of Yta7 in general nucleosome remodeling. Interestingly, the BRD tier exists in a spiral and a flat-ring form on top of the Yta7 AAA+ hexamer. The spiral is likely in a nucleosome-searching mode because the bottom BRD blocks the entry to the AAA+ chamber. The flat ring may be in a nucleosome disassembly state because the entry is unblocked and the H3 peptide has entered the AAA+ chamber and is stabilized by the AAA1 pore loops 1 and 2. Indeed, we show that the BRD tier is a flat ring when bound to the nucleosome. Overall, our study sheds light on the nucleosome disassembly by Yta7."
https://openalex.org/W4313364971,"The overall aim was to explore the prevalence and persistent regular prescription of opioids and paracetamol among nursing home (NH) residents with dementia at admission and over time. A total of 996 residents with dementia, mean (SD) age 84.5 (7.6) years and (36.1% men), were included at admission (A 1 ). Yearly assessments were performed for two years (A 2 and A 3 ) or until death. Pain was assessed using the Mobilization-Observation-Behavior-Intensity-Dementia-2 (MOBID-2) Pain Scale. Information regarding prescription of analgesics, general physical health, personal activities of daily living, severity of dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and prescription of psychotropic drugs was collected. A generalized linear mixed model was used to explore whether pain severity was associated with persistent and persistent prescription of opioids and/or paracetamol across timepoints. At A 1 , 495 of 996 (49.7%) NH residents were prescribed analgesics and prevalence increased at the follow-ups (A 2 : n = 630, 65.1%; A 3 : n = 382, 71.2%). Paracetamol was the most frequently prescribed analgesic at all assessments (A 1 : 45.5%; A 2 : 59.5%; A 3 : 67.1%). Opioid prescriptions were quite prevalent (A 1 : 18.1%; A 2 : 25.1%; A 3 : 28.3%), with odds approximately 13 times (OR = 13.3, 95% CI 6.8–26.0) and 9 times (OR = 8.6, 95% CI 3.7–20.3) higher for prescription at follow-up A 2 and A 3 , respectively, relative to prescription at A 1 . In adjusted analyses, higher pain intensity and poor physical health were associated with prescription and persistent prescription of opioids and paracetamol. In conclusion, prevalence and persistent prescription of analgesics were high in NH residents with dementia. The odds for the prescription of opioids at follow-up were high if prescribed at baseline. Interdisciplinary collaboration, routine assessment of pain at admission and regularly thereafter, and systematic drug reviews are essential to adequately assess and treat pain in NH residents with dementia."
https://openalex.org/W4313398614,"The flavoprotein methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the reduction of N5, N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2-H4folate) to N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate), committing a methyl group from the folate cycle to the methionine one. This committed step is the sum of multiple ping-pong electron transfers involving multiple substrates, intermediates, and products all sharing the same active site. Insight into folate substrate binding is needed to better understand this multifunctional active site. Here, we performed activity assays with Thermus thermophilus MTHFR (tMTHFR), which showed pH-dependent inhibition by the substrate analog, N5-formyltetrahydrofolate (CHO-H4folate). Our crystal structure of a tMTHFR•CHO-H4folate complex revealed a unique folate-binding mode; tMTHFR subtly rearranges its active site to form a distinct folate-binding environment. Formation of a novel binding pocket for the CHO-H4folate p-aminobenzoic acid moiety directly affects how bent the folate ligand is and its accommodation in the active site. Comparative analysis of the available active (FAD- and folate-bound) MTHFR complex structures reveals that CHO-H4folate is accommodated in the active site in a conformation that would not support hydride transfer, but rather in a conformation that potentially reports on a different step in the reaction mechanism after this committed step, such as CH2-H4folate ring-opening. This active site remodeling provides insights into the functional relevance of the differential folate-binding modes and their potential roles in the catalytic cycle. The conformational flexibility displayed by tMTHFR demonstrates how a shared active site can use a few amino acid residues in lieu of extra domains to accommodate chemically distinct moieties and functionalities."
https://openalex.org/W4313398650,"Translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerase Polζ is crucial for the bypass replication over sites of DNA damage. The Rev7 subunit of Polζ is a HORMA (Hop1, Rev7, Mad2) protein that facilitates recruitment of Polζ to the replication fork via interactions with the catalytic subunit Rev3 and the translesion synthesis scaffold protein Rev1. Human Rev7 (hRev7) interacts with two Rev7-binding motifs (RBMs) of hRev3 by a mechanism conserved among HORMA proteins whereby the safety-belt loop of hRev7 closes on the top of the ligand. The two copies of hRev7 tethered by the two hRev3-RBMs form a symmetric head-to-head dimer through the canonical HORMA dimerization interface. Recent cryo-EM structures reveal that Saccharomyces cerevisiae Polζ (scPolζ) also includes two copies of scRev7 bound to distinct regions of scRev3. Surprisingly, the HORMA dimerization interface is not conserved in scRev7, with the two scRev7 protomers forming an asymmetric head-to-tail dimer with a much smaller interface than the hRev7 dimer. Here, we validated the two adjacent RBM motifs in scRev3, which bind scRev7 with affinities that differ by two orders of magnitude and confirmed the 2:1 stoichiometry of the scRev7:Rev3 complex in solution. However, our biophysical studies reveal that scRev7 does not form dimers in solution either on its own accord or when tethered by the two RBMs in scRev3. These findings imply that the scRev7 dimer observed in the cryo-EM structures is induced by scRev7 interactions with other Polζ subunits and that Rev7 homodimerization via the HORMA interface is a mechanism that emerged later in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4313398773,"G proteins and G protein-coupled receptors activate a diverse array of signal transduction pathways that promote cell growth and survival. Indeed, hot spot-activating mutations in GNAQ/GNA11, encoding Gαq proteins, are known to be driver oncogenes in uveal melanoma (UM), for which there are limited effective therapies currently available. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been recently shown to be a central mediator of Gαq-driven signaling in UM, and as a result, is being explored clinically as a therapeutic target for UM, both alone and in combination therapies. Despite this, the repertoire of Gαq/FAK-regulated signaling mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we used a whole-genome CRISPR screen in GNAQ-mutant UM cells to identify mechanisms that, when overactivated, lead to reduced sensitivity to FAK inhibition. In this way, we found that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway represented a major resistance driver. Our dissection of the underlying mechanisms revealed that Gαq promotes PI3K/AKT activation via a conserved signaling circuitry mediated by FAK. Further analysis demonstrated that FAK activates PI3K through the association and tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and that UM cells require PI3K/AKT signaling for survival. These findings establish a novel link between Gαq-driven signaling and the stimulation of PI3K as well as demonstrate aberrant activation of signaling networks underlying the growth and survival of UM and other Gαq-driven malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W4313398826,"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is known to mediate heme insertion and activation of heme-deficient neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (apo-nNOS) in cells by a highly dynamic interaction that has been extremely difficult to study mechanistically with the use of subcellular systems. In that the heme content of many critical hemeproteins is regulated by Hsp90 and the heme chaperone GAPDH, the development of an in vitro system for the study of this chaperone-mediated heme regulation would be extremely useful. Here, we show that use of an antibody-immobilized apo-nNOS led not only to successful assembly of chaperone complexes but the ability to show a clear dependence on Hsp90 and GAPDH for heme-mediated activation of apo-nNOS. The kinetics of binding for Hsp70 and Hsp90, the ATP and K+ dependence, and the absolute requirement for Hsp70 in assembly of Hsp90•apo-nNOS heterocomplexes all point to a similar chaperone machinery to the well-established canonical machine regulating steroid hormone receptors. However, unlike steroid receptors, the use of a purified protein system containing Hsp90, Hsp70, Hsp40, Hop, and p23 is unable to activate apo-nNOS. Thus, heme insertion requires a unique Hsp90-chaperone complex. With this newly developed in vitro system, which recapitulates the cellular process requiring GAPDH as well as Hsp90, further mechanistic studies are now possible to better understand the components of the Hsp90-based chaperone system as well as how this heterocomplex works with GAPDH to regulate nNOS and possibly other hemeproteins."
