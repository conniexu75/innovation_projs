https://openalex.org/W2033250493,"Trace metals transported by the Amazon (and Yukon rivers were analytically partitioned among the transport phases: in solutions, ion exchange, organic materials, metallic coatings, and crystalline solids. The distribution for both rivers is similarly proportioned, with copper and chromium transported mainly in the crystalline solids, manganese in coatings, and iron, nickel, and cobalt distributed equally between precipitated metallic coatings and crystalline solids."
https://openalex.org/W2002246292,"The calling song of male field crickets is composed of stereotyped rhythmic pulse intervals, which are predictable expressions of genotype. Females identify conspecific males by their song. Two species of crickets were found to exhibit species-specific song preference, and hybrids between them preferred hybrid calls over either parental call. These results imply genetic control of song reception as well as transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1983740606,"Rare-earth manganites such as La(1-x) Pb(x)MnO(3), with 0.3 x 0.6, and their perovskite-like homologs are active catalysts for the reduction of nitric oxide to molecular nitrogen. At low temperatures, innocuous nitrous oxide rather than anmmonia is the main side product. The activity of single crystalline catalysts and of ceramic catalysts of this type is substantially improved by etching with dilute acids."

Stimulation of the amygdala was followed by an elevation of plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. Hippocampal stimulation resulted in a decreased corticosteroid level, followed in two instances by a secondary elevation."
https://openalex.org/W2086327958,A new class of ductile superconductors has been prepared by casting and appropriate heat treatments. These alloys superconduct between 4 degrees and 18 degrees K and contain at least 90 atom percent copper and a superconducting phase such as Nb(3)Sn or niobium. They can be processed into wires by conventional metallurgical techniques.
https://openalex.org/W2075271709,"Geostrophic water transport by the equatorial countercurrent is compared with the observed sea level difference between two pairs of islands situlated north and south of the current. The high correlation between the transport and the sea level difference makes it possible to construct a time series for the countercurrent transport over a 21-year period. The countercurrent carries warm water into the eastern tropical Pacific, and fluctuations in its strength give rise to temperature anomalies off Central America. Periods of exceptionally high transport by the countercurrent in the western Pacific coincide with the occurrence of El Ni√±o several thousand kilometers downstream and demonstrate the existence of teleconnections between events in the Pacific Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W1981980265,"The cyanogenic secretion of the polydesmoid millipede Apheloria corrugata (Wood) is discharged from paired, serially arranged glands, each consisting of two compartments. In one compartment is stored an undissociated cyanogenic compound, and in the other, a chemical factor that triggers cyanogenesis. The gland is constructed in such a way that the contents of the two compartments are mixed, and cyanogenesis is initiated, at the very instant of discharge. The stored cyanide precursor may be mandelonitrile."
https://openalex.org/W1994097702,Experiments at 700 degrees C and 800 bars total pressure demonstrate positive deviations from ideality for mixtures of hydrogen and H(2)O gases. The deviations are greater than predicted with Stockmayer's method. The composition of the mixture and the fugacity of hydrogen are controlled by diffusing hydrogen through metallic membranes. The results give the fugacities of both H(2)O and oxygen.
https://openalex.org/W2004935209,"The course of the ancient Pelusiac branch of the Nile River has been traced on a deltaic plain east of the Suez Canal, between the El Baqar Canal and Tell el Farama (ancient Pelusium). Two minor distributaries branched northward. The critical stage in the process of the silting up of the lower reaches of the Pelusiac branch, due to prograding beach accretion, occurred around A.D. 25. Ancient ruins in the area are closely associated with the courses."
https://openalex.org/W2007743917,"Uniaxial compression at 800 degrees C and 5 kilobars confining pressure of a specimen cored from a single crystal of orthoenstatite [(Mg,Fe)SiO(3)] produced fine lamellae 100 to 1000 angstroms thick of untwinned clinoenstatite. The two phases are joined along (100) planes and have b and c axes in common. The orientation of the clinoenstatite a axis contradicts several previously suggested transformation mechanisms and reduces the set of possible mechanisms by a factor of 2."
https://openalex.org/W2054397027,A neutron-diffraction analysis of the xenon tetrafluoride crystal structure has confirmed the square-planar symmetry of the molecule; from the data the average Xe to F bond length is 1.953 A (sigma = .002) and the F to Xe to F angle is 90.0 degrees (sigma = 0.1). A description of the thermal displacements in the crystal is given.
https://openalex.org/W2003642881,Data on terrestrial eruptions of pyroclastic material and ballistic considerations suggest that in the lunar environment (vacuum and reduced gravity) low-rimmed pyroclastic rings are formed rather than the high-rimmed cinder cones so abundant on the earth. Dark blanketing deposits in the Taurus-Littrow region (Apollo 17 landing area) are interpreted as being at least partly composed of lunar counterparts of terrestrial cinder cones.
https://openalex.org/W2060858838,"Bermuda marine waters are not in equilibrium with the bulk carbonate sediments with which they are in contact, and they are supersaturated with respect to pure calcite. This apparent supersaturation seems to result from a metastable equilibrium between sea water and the most soluble solid phase available locally in excess."
https://openalex.org/W2010079080,"Averaged helium to carbon dioxide ratios measured from systematic collections of gases from Sulphur Bank fumarole. Kilauea, Hawaii, when coupled with estimates of carbon in the earth's crust, give a helium flux of 1 x 105 atoms per square centimeter per second. This is within the lower range of other estimates, and may represent the flux from deep-seated sources in the upper mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2062817788,"Brief excursions of magnetic field differences between a base station and two satellite station magnetometers show only slight correlation with ground tilt at Kilauea Volcano. This result suggests that only transient, localized stresses occur during prolonged periods of deformation and that the volcano can support no large-scale pattern of shear stresses."
https://openalex.org/W1972510734,A similarity exists between the low molecular weight alkane isomers in crude oil and Fischer-Tropsch catalytic synthesis products. The composition of the C4 through C7 alkane isomers in a crude oil was calculated quantitatively with the equations previously used to calculate the alkane isomers in Fischer-Tropsch products. These results may have significance in ascertaining the origin of the volatile hydrocarbons in crude oils.

https://openalex.org/W1966543510,A fork made up of hollow tubing may be chronically implanted in the cat's brain. When cooling fluid is pumped through this fork a reversible plane lesion is formed. This technique permits analysis of functional parts of the nervous system in unanesthetized animals.
