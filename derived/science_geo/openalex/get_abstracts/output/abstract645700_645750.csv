https://openalex.org/W2999314916,"Diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic levels, and it threatens the economy and health globally and Saudi Arabia in particular. The study assessed health-related quality of life using EuroQol instrument and its predictors among patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 378 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus from two major health centers in Eastern Province. The study showed moderate health-related quality of life, as reported by the median index score of 0.808 with more than a quarter of patients with severe-extreme health state in some or all domains. Multiple-regression models showed that male gender, high monthly income, having no diabetes-related complications and having random blood glucose level less than 200 mg/dl were prone to have a higher index score compared to the corresponding contrary groups. The study will help in guiding the development of effective intervention programs to improve diabetes-related health-related quality of life among the Saudi population."
https://openalex.org/W2998946248,"The present study aims to estimate the minimum number of accelerometer measurement days needed to estimate habitual physical activity (PA) among 6- (2010), 18- (2011) and 30- (2012) year-old participants, belonging to three population-based Brazilian birth cohorts.PA was assessed by triaxial wrist-worn GENEActiv accelerometers and the present analysis is restricted to participants with at least 6 consecutive days of measurement. Accelerometer raw data were analyzed with R-package GGIR. Description of PA measures (overall PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), light PA (LPA)) on weekdays and weekend days were conducted, and statistical differences were tested with chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Spearman Brown Formulae was applied to test reliability of different number of days of accelerometer use.Differences between week and weekend days regarding LPA, MVPA and overall PA, were only observed among 30-year-olds. Higher levels of MVPA (p = 0.006) and overall PA (p<0.001) were identified on weekdays. For overall PA, to achieve a reliability coefficient >0.70, two and three days of measurement were needed in adults and children, respectively. For LPA, a reliability coefficient >0.70 was achieved with five days in 6-year-old children, three days in 18-year-old young adults, and four days in 30-year-old adults. Considering MVPA, four days would be necessary to represent a week of measurement among all cohort groups.Our results show that four and five measurement days are needed to estimate all habitual PA constructs, for children and adults, respectively. Also, among 30-year-old adults, it is important to make efforts towards weekend days measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2999255452,"Nosema ceranae is a microsporidian parasite that causes nosemosis in the honey bee (Apis mellifera). As alternatives to the antibiotic fumagillin, ten nutraceuticals (oregano oil, thymol, carvacrol, trans-cinnmaldehyde, tetrahydrocurcumin, sulforaphane, naringenin, embelin, allyl sulfide, hydroxytyrosol) and two immuno-stimulatory compounds (chitosan, poly I:C) were examined for controlling N. ceranae infections. Caged bees were inoculated with N. ceranae spores, and treatments were administered in sugar syrup. Only two compounds did not significantly reduce N. ceranae spore counts compared to the infected positive control, but the most effective were sulforaphane from cruciferous vegetables, carvacrol from oregano oil, and naringenin from citrus fruit. When tested at several concentrations, the highest sulforaphane concentration reduced spore counts by 100%, but also caused 100% bee mortality. For carvacrol, the maximum reduction in spore counts was 57% with an intermediate concentration and the maximum bee mortality was 23% with the highest concentration. For naringenin, the maximum reduction in spore counts was 64% with the highest concentration, and the maximum bee mortality was only 15% with an intermediate concentration. In the longevity experiment, naringenin-fed bees lived as long as Nosema-free control bees, both of which lived significantly longer than infected positive control bees. While its antimicrobial properties may be promising, reducing sulforaphane toxicity to bees is necessary before it can be considered as a candidate for controlling N. ceranae. Although further work on formulation is needed with naringenin, its effect on extending longevity in infected bees may give it an additional value as a potential additive for bee feed in honey bee colonies."
https://openalex.org/W3000030442,"Rootstock has a significant impact on plant growth and development, including fruit maturation. However, the existence of mutual interaction between scion and rootstock is often neglected. To explore the origin of different fruit quality traits in citrus, we studied the effect of rootstock and the reciprocal interaction between scion and rootstock of nine combinations; three mandarin varieties grafted on three different rootstocks. We analyzed the metabolic profile of juice via gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively). Additionally, we profiled phloem sap composition in the scion and the rootstock. Quality traits of fruit and their physio-chemical characteristics were also evaluated.For all three cultivars, rootstock was found to affect fruit yield and biochemical fruit quality parameters (sugar and acidity) in interactions with the scions. In mandarin juice, eight of 48 compounds (two primary and six secondary) were related directly to the rootstock, and another seven (one primary and six secondary) were interactively affected by scion and rootstock. In scion and rootstock sap, six and 14 of 53 and 55 primary metabolites, respectively, were directly affected by the rootstock, while 42 and 33 were affected by rootstock interactively with scion, respectively.In this work, we show for the first time a reciprocal effect between rootstock and scion. Based on our results, the scion and rootstock interaction might be organ, distance or time dependent."
https://openalex.org/W3000030913,"This study proposes a deep learning model that effectively suppresses the false alarms in the intensive care units (ICUs) without ignoring the true alarms using single- and multi- modal biosignals. Most of the current work in the literature are either rule-based methods, requiring prior knowledge of arrhythmia analysis to build rules, or classical machine learning approaches, depending on hand-engineered features. In this work, we apply convolutional neural networks to automatically extract time-invariant features, an attention mechanism to put more emphasis on the important regions of the segmented input signal(s) that are more likely to contribute to an alarm, and long short-term memory units to capture the temporal information presented in the signal segments. We trained our method efficiently using a two-step training algorithm (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning the proposed network) on the dataset provided by the PhysioNet computing in cardiology challenge 2015. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better results compared to other existing algorithms for the false alarm reduction task in ICUs. The proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 93.88% and a specificity of 92.05% for the alarm classification, considering three different signals. In addition, our experiments for 5 separate alarm types leads significant results, where we just consider a single-lead ECG (e.g., a sensitivity of 90.71%, a specificity of 88.30%, an AUC of 89.51 for alarm type of Ventricular Tachycardia arrhythmia)."
https://openalex.org/W2999792781,"A new species of the Campylobacter genus is described, isolated from the preputial mucosa of bulls (Bos taurus). The five isolates obtained exhibit characteristics of Campylobacter, being Gram-negative non-motile straight rods, oxidase positive, catalase negative and microaerophilic. Phenotypic characteristics and nucleotide sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and hsp60 genes demonstrated that these isolates belong to a novel species within the genus Campylobacter. Based on hsp60 gene phylogenetic analysis, the most related species are C. ureolyticus, C. blaseri and C. corcagiensis. The whole genome sequence analysis of isolate FMV-PI01 revealed that the average nucleotide identity with other Campylobacter species was less than 75%, which is far below the cut-off for isolates of the same species. However, whole genome sequence analysis identified coding sequences highly homologous with other Campylobacter spp. These included several virulence factor coding genes related with host cell adhesion and invasion, transporters involved in resistance to antimicrobials, and a type IV secretion system (T4SS), containing virB2-virB11/virD4 genes, highly homologous to the C. fetus subsp. venerealis. The genomic G+C content of isolate FMV-PI01 was 28.3%, which is one of the lowest values reported for species of the genus Campylobacter. For this species the name Campylobacter portucalensis sp. nov. is proposed, with FMV-PI01 (= LMG 31504, = CCUG 73856) as the type strain."
https://openalex.org/W3000153037,"This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Livestock-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) in retail chicken meat and broiler chickens from the Province of Quebec, Canada, and to characterize LA-MRSA isolates. A total of 309 chicken drumsticks and thighs were randomly selected in 2013 from 43 retail stores in the Monteregie. In addition, nasal swabs and caeca samples were collected in 2013-2014 from 200 broiler chickens of 38 different flocks. LA-MRSA was not detected in broiler chickens. Fifteen LA-MRSA isolates were recovered from four (1.3%) of the 309 chicken meat samples. Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and SCCmec typing revealed two profiles (ST398-MRSA-V and ST8-MRSA-IVa), which were distinct using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and microarray (antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes) analyses. In addition to beta-lactam resistance, tetracycline and spectinomycin resistance was detected in all isolates from the 3 positive samples of the ST398 profile. Southern blot hybridization revealed that the resistance genes aad(D) and lnu(A), encoding resistances to aminoglycosides and lincosamides respectively, were located on plasmid. All isolates were able to produce biofilms, but biofilm production was not correlated with hld gene expression. Our results show the presence of two separate lineages of MRSA in retail chicken meat in Quebec, one of which is likely of human origin."
https://openalex.org/W2999470763,"Metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (mKP) relate to important aspects of heart failure pathophysiology, such as inflammation, energy-homeostasis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. We aimed to investigate whether mKP predict mortality in patients with heart failure.The study included 202 patients with heart failure (73.8% with coronary artery disease (CAD)), propensity score matched to 384 controls without heart disease, and 807 controls with CAD (71%). All underwent coronary angiography and ventriculography at baseline. Plasma mKP, pyridoxal 5'phosphate (PLP) and CRP were measured at baseline. Case-control differences were assessed by logistic regression and survival by Cox regression, adjusted for age, gender, smoking, diabetes, ejection fraction, PLP, eGFR and CRP. Effect measures are reported per standard deviation increments.Higher plasma levels of kynurenine, 3- hydroxykynurenine (HK), quinolinic acid (QA), the kynurenine-tryptophan-ratio (KTR) and the ratio of HK to xanthurenic acid (HK/XA) were detected in heart failure compared to both control groups. The mortality rate per 1000 person-years was 55.5 in patients with heart failure, 14.6 in controls without heart disease and 22.2 in CAD controls. QA [HR 1.80, p = 0.013], HK [HR 1.77, p = 0.005], HK/XA [HR 1.67, p < 0.001] and KTR [HR 1.55, p = 0.009] were associated with increased mortality in patients with heart failure, while XA [HR 0.68-0.80, p = 0.013-0.037] were associated with lower mortality in all groups. HK and HK/XA had weak associations with increased mortality in CAD-controls.Elevated plasma levels of mKP and metabolite ratios are associated with increased mortality, independent of CAD, in patients with heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2998740946,"Chronic inflammation fundamentally influences cancer risk and development. A mechanism of chronic inflammation is the formation of inflammasome complexes which results in the sustained secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1β and IL18. Inflammasome expression and actions vary among cancers. There is no information on inflammasome expression in ovarian cancer (OvCa). To determine if ovarian tumors express inflammasome components, mRNA and protein expression of NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat family, pyrin domain containing 3), caspase-1, IL1β, and IL18 expression in hen and human OvCa was assessed. Chicken (hen) OvCa a valid model of spontaneous human OvCa. Hens were selected into study groups with or without tumors using ultrasonography; tumors were confirmed by histology, increased cellular proliferation, and expression of immune cell marker mRNA. mRNA expression was higher for hallmarks of inflammasome activity (caspase-1, 5.9x increase, p = 0.04; IL1β, 4x increase, p = 0.04; and IL18, 7.8x increase, p = 0.0003) in hen OvCa compared to normal ovary. NLRP3, caspase-8 and caspase-11 mRNA did not differ significantly between tumor and non-tumor containing ovaries. Similar results occurred for human OvCa. Protein expression by immunohistochemistry paralleled mRNA expression and was qualitatively higher in tumors. Increased protein expression of caspase-1, IL1β, and IL18 occurred in surface epithelium, tumor cells, and immune cells. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a potential tumor suppressor and NLRP3 regulator, was higher in hen (2.4x increase, p = 0.002) and human tumors (1.8x increase, p = 0.038), suggesting a role in OvCa. Collectively, the results indicate that inflammasome expression is associated with hen and human OvCa, although the NLR sensor type remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2999980882,"The strains of inbred laboratory mice are isogenic and homogeneous for over 98.6% of their genomes. However, geometric morphometric studies have demonstrated clear differences among the skull shapes of various mice strains. The question now arises: why are skull shapes different among the mice strains? Epigenetic processes, such as morphological interaction between the muscles and bones, may cause differences in the skull shapes among various mice strains. To test these predictions, the objective of this study is to examine the morphological association between a specific part of the skull and its adjacent muscle. We examined C57BL6J, BALB/cA, and ICR mice on embryonic days (E) 12.5 and 16.5 as well as on postnatal days (P) 0, 10, and 90. As a result, we found morphological differences between C57BL6J and BALB/cA mice with respect to the inferior spine of the hypophyseal cartilage or basisphenoid (SP) and the tensor veli palatini muscle (TVP) during the prenatal and postnatal periods. There was a morphological correlation between the SP and the TVP in the C57BL6J, BALB/cA, and ICR mice during E15 and P0. However, there were not correlation between the TVP and the SP during P10. After discectomy, bone deformation was associated with a change in the shape of the adjacent muscle. Therefore, epigenetic modifications linked to the interaction between the muscles and bones might occur easily during the prenatal period, and inflammation seems to allow epigenetic modifications between the two to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2998803469,"Unhealthy dietary behaviour-high intake of fat, sugar, and salt, and low intake of fruits and vegetables-is a major risk factor for chronic diseases. There is a lack of evidence-based interventions to promote healthy dietary intake among Indian populations. Therefore, we tested the effectiveness of an information technology-enabled 'SMART Eating' intervention to reduce the intake of fat, sugar and salt, and to increase the intake of fruits and vegetables.In Chandigarh, a North Indian city, a cluster randomized controlled trial was implemented in twelve geographical clusters, based on the type of housing (i.e., LIG: Low-income group; MIG; Middle-income group, and HIG: High-income group-a proxy for socio-economic status). Computer-generated randomization was used to allocate clusters to intervention and comparison arms after pairing on the basis of socioeconomic status and geographical distance between clusters. The sample size was 366 families per arm (N = 732). One adult per family was randomly selected as an index case to measure the change in the outcomes. For behaviour change, a multi-channel communication approach was used, which included information technology-short message service (SMS), email, social networking app and 'SMART Eating' website, and interpersonal communication along with distribution of a 'SMART Eating' kit-kitchen calendar, dining table mat, and measuring spoons. The intervention was implemented at the family level over a period of six months. The comparison group received pamphlets on nutrition education. Outcome measurements were made at 0 and 6 months post-intervention at the individual level. Primary outcomes were changes in mean dietary intakes of fat, sugar, salt, and fruit and vegetables. Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and serum lipids. Mixed-effects linear regression models were used to determine the net change in the outcomes in the intervention group relative to the comparison group.Participants' mean age was 53 years, a majority were women (76%), most were married (90%) and 51% had completed a college degree. All families had mobile phones, and more than 90% of these families had access to Internet through mobile phones. The intervention group had significant net mean changes of -12.5 g/day (p<0.001), -11.4 g/day (p<0.001), -0.5 g/day (p<0.001), and +71.6 g/day (p<0.001) in the intake of fat, sugar, salt, and fruit and vegetables, respectively. Similarly, significant net changes occurred for secondary outcomes: BMI -0.25 kg/m2, diastolic blood pressure -2.77 mm Hg, FPG -5.7 mg/dl, and triglycerides -24.2mg/dl. The intervention had no effect on haemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.The IT-enabled 'SMART Eating' intervention was found to be effective in reducing fat, sugar, and salt intake, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption among urban adults from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI/2016/11/007457."
https://openalex.org/W3000096215,"Background Risk stratification of myocarditis is challenging due to variable clinical presentations. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the primary non-invasive imaging modality to investigate myocarditis while electrocardiograms (ECG) are routinely included in the clinical work-up. The association of ECG parameters with CMR tissue characterisation and their prognostic value were investigated in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis. Methods and results Consecutive patients with suspected myocarditis who underwent CMR and ECG were analysed. Major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) included all-cause death, hospitalisation for heart failure, heart transplantation, documented sustained ventricular arrhythmia, or recurrent myocarditis. A total of 587 patients were followed for a median of 3.9 years. A wide QRS-T angle, low voltage and fragmented QRS were significantly associated with late gadolinium enhancement. Further, a wide QRS-T angle, low voltage and prolonged QTc duration were associated with MACE in the univariable analysis. In a multivariable model, late gadolinium enhancement (HR: 1.90, 95%CI: 1.17–3.10; p = 0.010) and the ECG parameters of a low QRS voltage (HR: 1.86, 95%CI: 1.01–3.42; p = 0.046) and QRS-T-angle (HR: 1.01, 95%CI: 1.00–1.01; p = 0.029) remained independently associated with outcome. The cumulative incidence of MACE was incrementally higher when findings of both CMR and ECG were abnormal (p<0.001). Conclusion In patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, abnormal ECG parameters are associated with abnormal tissue characteristics detected by CMR. Further, ECG and CMR findings have independent prognostic implications for morbidity and mortality. Integrating both exams into clinical decision-making may play a role in risk stratification in this heterogeneous patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2999182055,"Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis, and identification of novel predictors of therapeutic efficacy and prognosis is urgently needed. Chemoresistance-related molecules are correlated with poor prognosis and may be effective targets for cancer treatment. Here, we aimed to identify novel molecules correlated with chemoresistance and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. We established 10 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines from patients with pancreatic cancer and performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissues from PDXs after treatment with standard drugs. We established a gene-transferred tumor cell line to express chemoresistance-related molecules and analyzed the chemoresistance of the established cell line against standard drugs. Finally, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of chemoresistance-related molecules using 80 pancreatic cancer tissues. From NGS analysis, we identified olfactomedin-4 (OLFM4) as having high expression in the PDX group treated with anticancer drugs. In IHC analysis, OLFM4 expression was also high in PDXs administered anticancer drugs compared with that in untreated PDXs. Chemoresistance was observed by in vitro analysis of tumor cell lines with forced expression of OLFM4. In an assessment of tissue specimens from 80 patients with pancreatic cancer, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients in the low OLFM4 expression group had a better survival rate than patients in the high OLFM4 expression group. Additionally, multivariate analysis showed that high expression of OLFM4 was an independent prognostic factor predicting poor outcomes. Overall, our study revealed that high expression of OLFM4 was involved in chemoresistance and was an independent prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer. OLFM4 may be a candidate therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3000213815,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have desirable mechanical properties for use as biomaterials in orthopedic and dental area such as bone- and tooth- substitutes. Here, we demonstrate that a glass surface densely coated with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs incubated on SWNT- and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT)-coated glass showed high activities of alkaline phosphatase that are markers for early stage osteogenic differentiation. Expression of Bmp2, Runx2, and Alpl of MSCs showed high level in the early stage for MSC incubation on SWNT- and MWNT-coated surfaces, but only the cells on the SWNT-coated glass showed high expression levels of Bglap (Osteocalcin). The cells on the SWNT-coated glass also contained the most calcium, and their calcium deposits had long needle-shaped crystals. SWNT coating at high density could be part of a new scaffold for bone regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3000687049,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus (NSV) and a leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. Transcription of the ten RSV genes proceeds sequentially from the 3’ promoter and requires conserved gene start (GS) and gene end (GE) signals. Previous studies using the prototypical GA1 genotype Long and A2 strains have indicated a gradient of gene transcription extending across the genome, with the highest level of mRNA coming from the most promoter-proximal gene, the first nonstructural (NS1) gene, and mRNA levels from subsequent genes dropping until reaching a minimum at the most promoter-distal gene, the polymerase (L) gene. However, recent reports show non-gradient levels of mRNA, with higher than expected levels from the attachment (G) gene. It is unknown to what extent different transcript stabilities might shape measured mRNA levels. It is also unclear whether patterns of RSV gene expression vary, or show strain- or genotype-dependence. To address this, mRNA abundances from five RSV genes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in three cell lines and in cotton rats infected with RSV isolates belonging to four genotypes (GA1, ON, GB1, BA). Relative mRNA levels reached steady-state between four and 24 hours post-infection. Steady-state patterns were non-gradient and genotype-specific, where mRNA levels from the G gene exceeded those from the more promoter-proximal nucleocapsid (N) gene across isolates. Transcript stabilities could not account for the non-gradient patterns observed, indicating that relative mRNA levels more strongly reflect transcription than decay. Our results indicate that gene expression from a small but diverse set of RSV genotypes is non-gradient and genotype-dependent. We propose novel models of RSV transcription that can account for non-gradient transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2999166887,"Objective To compare effectiveness and safety of oral misoprostol (50 μg every four hours as needed), low dose vaginal misoprostol (25 to 50 μg every six hours as needed), and our established dinoprostone vaginal gel (one to two mg every six hours as needed) induction. Materials and methods Consenting women with a live term single cephalic fetus for indicated labor induction were randomized (3N = 511). Prior uterine surgery or non-reassuring fetal surveillance were exclusions. Concealed computer generated randomization was stratified and blocked. Newborns were assessed by a team unaware of group assignment. The primary outcome was time from induction at randomization to vaginal birth for initial parametric analysis. Sample size was based on mean difference of 240 minutes with α2 = 0.05 and power 95%. Non-parametric analysis was also pre-specified ranking cesareans as longest vaginal births. Results Enrollment was from April 1999 to December 2000. Demographics were similar across groups. Analysis was by intent to treat, with no loss to follow up. Mean time (±SD) to vaginal birth was 1356 (±1033) minutes for oral misoprostol, 1530 (±3249) minutes for vaginal misoprostol, and 1208 (±613) minutes for vaginal dinoprostone (P = 0.46, ANOVA). Median times to vaginal birth were 1571, 1339, and 1451 minutes respectively (P = 0.46, Kruskal-Wallis). Vaginal births occurred within 24 hours in 44.9, 53.5 and 47.7% respectively (P = 0.27, χ2). There were no significant differences in Kaplan Meier survival analyses, cesareans, adverse effects, or maternal satisfaction. The newborn who met birth asphyxia criteria received vaginal misoprostol, as did. all three other newborns with cord artery pH<7.0 (P = 0.04, Fisher Exact). Conclusion There was no significant difference in effectiveness of the three groups. Profound newborn acidemia, though infrequent, occurred only with low dose vaginal misoprostol."
https://openalex.org/W2999330590,"Purpose To test the hypothesis that imaging biomarkers are useful for evaluating in vivo rod photoreceptor cell responses to a mitochondrial protonophore. Methods Intraperitoneal injections of either the mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4 dinitrophenol (DNP) or saline were given to mice with either higher [129S6/eVTac (S6)] or lower [C57BL/6J (B6)] mitochondrial reserve capacities and were studied in dark or light. We measured: (i) the external limiting membrane–retinal pigment epithelium region thickness (ELM-RPE; OCT), which decreases substantially with upregulation of a pH-sensitive water removal co-transporter on the apical portion of the RPE, and (ii) the outer retina R1 (= 1/(spin lattice relaxation time (T1), an MRI parameter proportional to oxygen / free radical content. Results In darkness, baseline rod energy production and consumption are relatively high compared to that in light, and additional metabolic stimulation with DNP provoked thinning of the ELM-RPE region compared to saline injection in S6 mice; ELM-RPE thickness was unresponsive to DNP in B6 mice. Also, dark-adapted S6 mice given DNP showed a decrease in outer retina R1 values compared to saline injection in the inferior retina. In dark-adapted B6 mice, transretinal R1 values were unresponsive to DNP in superior and inferior regions. In light, with its relatively lower basal rod energy production and consumption, DNP caused ELM-RPE thinning in both S6 and B6 mice. Conclusions The present results raise the possibility of non-invasively evaluating the mouse rod mitochondrial energy ecosystem using new DNP-assisted OCT and MRI in vivo assays."
https://openalex.org/W2999438316,"Histogram-based thresholding is one of the widely applied techniques for conducting color image segmentation. The key to such techniques is the selection of a set of thresholds that can discriminate objects and background pixels. Many thresholding techniques have been proposed that use the shape information of histograms and identify the optimum thresholds at valleys. In this work, we introduce the novel concept of a hierarchical-histogram, which corresponds to a multigranularity abstraction of the color image. Based on this, we present a new histogram thresholding-Adaptive Hierarchical-Histogram Thresholding (AHHT) algorithm, which can adaptively identify the thresholds from valleys. The experimental results have demonstrated that the AHHT algorithm can obtain better segmentation results compared with the histon-based and the roughness-index-based techniques with drastically reduced time complexity."
https://openalex.org/W2999687432,"Generally, dietary patterns (DP)s have been linked to the risk of diabetes mellitus, however, only few studies examined the associations between DPs in early pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aims to determine the association between DPs before and during pregnancy and risk of GDM in Malaysian pregnant women. DPs were derived using principal component analysis of consumed 126 food and beverage items assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire collecting data retrospectively for pre-pregnancy, but prospectively for the first and second trimester. Three different DPs were identified at each time point and labelled as DP 1-3 (pre-pregnancy), DP 4-6 (first trimester), and DP 7-9 (second trimester). About 10.6% (n = 48) of pregnant women were diagnosed with GDM in our cohort. Women with high adherence (HA) to DP 2 (adjusted OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.20-0.91) and DP 5 (adjusted OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.11-0.68) showed a significantly reduced risk of GDM compared to women with low adherence (LA). Other DPs were not significantly associated with GDM risk. Compared to women with GDM, non-GDM women showed HA scores for all DPs throughout pregnancy. Overall, a relative low percentage of women with GDM was found in this cohort. The risk was lower in women with HA to a relatively unhealthy dietary pattern, i.e. DP 2 and DP 5. The lower body mass index (BMI) status and energy intake of women showing a HA to DP 2 in the first trimester may underlie the observed association with a lower GDM risk. Additionally, genetic variance might explain the less susceptibility to GDM despite HA to unhealthy DPs among non-GDM women."
https://openalex.org/W2999693332,"Although mood stabilizers such as lithium (LIT), valproate (VAL), and lamotrigine (LMT) appear to be efficacious treatments for bipolar disorder (BD) in research settings, the long-term response to these mood stabilizers in clinical practice is highly variable among individuals. Thus, the present study examined the characteristics associated with good or insufficient responses to long-term treatment with LIT, VAL, or LMT for BD.This study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients who visited an outpatient clinic with a diagnosis of BD I or II. Data from patients who were treated with one of three mood stabilizing medications (LIT, VAL, or LMT) for more than 6 months were selected, and the long-term treatment responses were evaluated using the Alda scale. For the purposes of this study, two response categories were formed: insufficient response (ISR), including non-response or poor response (Alda total score ≤ 6), and good response (GR; Alda total score ≥ 7).Of the 645 patients included in the present study, 172 were prescribed LIT, 320 were prescribed VAL, and 153 were prescribed LMT for at least 6 months. A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that a diagnosis of BD II (odds ratio [OR], 8.868; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.123-70.046; p = 0.038), comorbid alcohol/substance use disorder (OR, 4.238; 95% CI, 1.154-15.566; p = 0.030), and a history of mixed episodes (OR, 4.363; 95% CI, 1.191-15.985; p = 0.026) were significant predictors of LIT-ISR. Additionally, a depressive-predominant polarity significantly predicted LMT-GR (OR, 8.586; 95% CI, 2.767-26.644; p < 0.001).The present findings demonstrated that patients with a diagnosis of BD II, a comorbid alcohol/substance problem, or a history of mixed episodes were not likely to respond to LIT treatment. Additionally, LMT might be a better treatment choice for patients with a depressive-predominant polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2998971104,"Physicians are in an ideal position to describe the impact of medication non-medical switching (switching commonly due to formulary changes by insurer for reasons unrelated to patient health) on their practice dynamics and patient care. We sought to examine physicians' openness to requests for non-medical switching and their experiences and opinions regarding the impact of non-medical switching on their practice, staff and patients.An online survey of randomly-sampled physicians spending ≥10% of time providing patient care and having received ≥1 non-medical switch request during the prior 12-months. The impact of non-medical switching on clinical decision-making process; professional experience with clinical practice, patient-physician relationship, insurance process; and perceived impact on practice, staff and patients were assessed. Weighted percent responses were calculated.We sampled 1,010 physicians (response rate = 55.5%). Many responded being frequently not amenable (26.0%) or had reservations (41.8%) to non-medical switch requests; with >50% indicating patient stability on current therapy and suboptimal alternatives as factors frequently influencing amenability. Physicians agreed non-medical switching can create ethical concerns (clinical judgement, autonomy, ability to treat per guidelines; 74.8%, 82.3%, 53.5%, respectively), while forcing them to take responsibility for insurers' decisions (81.1%) and diverting their clinical time (84.3%). Most indicated non-medical switching increased practice burden (administrative, non-billable interactions, additional staffing, non-office patient contact, calls to/from the pharmacy; 85.0%, 72.5%, 62.2%, 64.2%, 69.5%, respectively). Physicians felt insurer processes discouraged non-medical switch challenges (76.7%) and required inconvenient lengths-of-time (76.1%) speaking to insurer representatives without proper expertise (62.0%). They believed non-medical switching negatively impacted aspects of care (effectiveness, side-effects, medication adherence and abandonment, out-of-pocket costs, medication errors; 46.5%, 53.2%, 50.6%, 49.4%, 59.6%, 54.5%, respectively).Physicians were frequently not amenable or had reservations regarding non-medical switching. They noted ethical concerns due to non-medical switching. Most felt non-medical switches burdened their practice and negatively impacted care."
https://openalex.org/W2999395403,"Tissue-resident and infiltrating immune cells are continuously exposed to molecules derived from the local cells that often come in form of secreted factors, such as cytokines. These factors are known to impact the immune cells’ biology. However, very little is known about whether the tissue resident immune cells in return also affect the local environment. In this study, with the help of RNA-sequencing, we show for the first time that long-term absence of epidermal resident Langerhans cells led to significant gene expression changes in the local keratinocytes and resident dendritic epidermal T cells. Thus, immune cells might play an active role in maintaining tissue homeostasis, which should be taken in consideration at data interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W2998985416,"We consider a demand response program in which a block of apartments receive a discount from their electricity supplier if they ensure that their aggregate load from air conditioning does not exceed a predetermined threshold. The goal of the participants is to obtain the discount, while ensuring that their individual temperature preferences are also satisfied. As such, the apartments need to collectively optimise their use of air conditioning so as to satisfy these constraints and minimise their costs. Given an optimal cooling profile that secures the discount, the problem that the apartments face then is to divide the total discounted cost in a fair way. To achieve this, we take a coalitional game approach and propose the use of the Shapley value from cooperative game theory, which is the normative payoff division mechanism that offers a unique set of desirable fairness properties. However, applying the Shapley value in this setting presents a novel computational challenge. This is because its calculation requires, as input, the cost of every subset of apartments, which means solving an exponential number of collective optimisations, each of which is a computationally intensive problem. To address this, we propose solving the optimisation problem of each subset suboptimally, to allow for acceptable solutions that require less computation. We show that, due to the linearity property of the Shapley value, if suboptimal costs are used rather than optimal ones, the division of the discount will be fair in the following sense: each apartment is fairly ""rewarded"" for its contribution to the optimal cost and, at the same time, is fairly ""penalised"" for its contribution to the discrepancy between the suboptimal and the optimal costs. Importantly, this is achieved without requiring the optimal solutions."
https://openalex.org/W3000325746,"Polygonum is the largest genus of Polygonaceae and 5 species are reported in Tunisia. In order to characterized flower, seed, and fruit development in Polygonum, flower and fruit of Polygonium equisetiforme (var. graecum and peyerinhoffi), P. aviculare and P. maritimum, collected from Tunisia, were examined. Flowers are composed of five oblong tepals. P. equisetiforme and P. aviculare have whitish-pink distylous flowers with dimorphism of style, filament and anther height, pollen diameter and stigma size. In contrast, P. maritimum shows white homostylous flowers. The floral vasculature showed that the tepals are inserted in one whorl and their traces arise independently in 3+2 manner. The eight stamens are arranged in a 5+3 manner and the staminal bundles arise independently in the two whorls. The epidermis and endothecium cells width were higher in P. maritimum and the lowest endothecium width was observed in P. aviculare. Polygonum aviculare and P. equisetiforme showed circular pollen with shallow colpi and trilobite pollen shape with deep colpi, while P. maritimum rarely showed shallow colpi. The ovule is anatropous with basal placentation in P. equisetiforme and P. aviculare and apical placentation in P. maritimum. The young seed coat was formed by an endotesta with thick-walled cells, a mesotesta and exotesta with thin-walled cells and a tegmen composed of radially elongated cells. The fruits of the studied species are trigonous with ovate-lanceolate shape. In P. aviculare, the exocarp is thicker compared to the two other species, in P. equisetiforme, the mature exocarp consists of smaller rectangular cells with narrow cavities, and in P. maritimum showed a thinner exocarpIn conclusion, P. equisetiforme and P. aviculare are a typically distylous species from the morphological point of view and we discussed the significance of heterostyly in Polygonaceae. From this first morpho-anatomical study of Polygonum species in North Africa, we can conclude mainly that there is no significant difference between P. equisetiforme var. graecum and var. peyerinhoffi supporting a taxonomic grouping of these two varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2965662439,"Antibiotics are administered to livestock in animal feeding operations (AFOs) for the control, prevention, and treatment of disease. Manure from antibiotic treated livestock contains unmetabolized antibiotics that provide selective pressure on bacteria, facilitating the expression of anti-microbial resistance (AMR). Manure application on row crops is an agronomic practice used by growers to meet crop nutrient needs; however, it can be a source of AMR to the soil and water environment. This study in central Iowa aims to directly compare AMR indicators in outlet runoff from two adjacent (221 to 229 ha) manured and non-manured catchments (manure comparison), and among three catchments (600 to 804 ha) with manure influence, no known manure application (control), and urban influences (mixed land use comparison). Monitored AMR indicators included antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) ermB, ermF (macrolide), tetA, tetM, tetO, tetW (tetracycline), sul1, sul2 (sulfonamide), aadA2 (aminoglycoside), vgaA, and vgaB (pleuromutilin), and tylosin and tetracycline resistant enterococci bacteria. Results of the manure comparison showed significantly higher (p<0.05) tetracycline and tylosin resistant bacteria from the catchment with manure application in 2017, but no differences in 2018, possibly due to changes in antibiotic use resulting from the Veterinary Feed Directive. Moreover, the ARG analysis indicated a larger diversity of ARGs at the manure amended catchment. The mixed land use comparison showed the manure amended catchment had significantly higher (p<0.05) tetracycline resistant bacteria in 2017 and significantly higher tylosin resistant bacteria in 2017 and 2018 than the urban influenced catchment. The urban influenced catchment had significantly higher ermB concentrations in both sampling years, however the manure applied catchment runoff consisted of higher relative abundance of total ARGs. Additionally, both catchments showed higher AMR indicators compared to the control catchment. This study identifies four ARGs that might be specific to AMR as a result of agricultural sources (tetM, tetW, sul1, sul2) and optimal for use in watershed scale monitoring studies for tracking resistance in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2999492564,"Articular cartilage (AC) is a viscoelastic tissue with a limited regenerative capability because of the lack of vasculature. Mechanical stimulation contributes to the homeostasis of functional AC since it promotes the delivery of nutrients, cytokines and growth factors between the distant chondrocytes. We hypothesized that biomechanical stimulation might enhance mobilization of endogenous mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) from neighboring niches as the bone marrow.This study aimed to introduce a bioreactor for inducing mobilization of MSCs from one compartment to another above by mechanical stimulation in vitro.A novel mechanical system for evaluating mobilization of cells in a 3D context in vitro is presented. The system consists of a compression bioreactor able to induce loading on hydrogel-based scaffolds, custom-made software for settings management and data recording, and image based biological evaluation. Intermittent load was applied under a periodic regime with frequency of 0.3 Hz and unload phases of 10 seconds each 180 cycles over 24 hours. The mechanical stimulation acted on an alginate scaffold and a cell reservoir containing MSCs below it. The dynamic compression exerted amplitude of 200 μm as 10% strain regarding the original height of the scaffold.The bioreactor was able to stimulate the scaffolds and the cells for 24.4 (±1.7) hours, exerting compression with vertical displacements of 185.8 (±17.8) μm and a force-amplitude of 1.87 (±1.37; min 0.31, max 4.42) N. Our results suggest that continuous mechanical stimulation hampered the viability of the cells located at the cell reservoir when comparing to intermittent mechanical stimulation (34.4 ± 2.0% vs. 66.8 ± 5.9%, respectively). Functionalizing alginate scaffolds with laminin-521 (LN521) seemed to enhance the mobilization of cells from 48 (±21) to 194 (±39) cells/mm3 after applying intermittent mechanical loading.The bioreactor presented here was able to provide mechanical stimulation that seemed to induce the mobilization of MSCs into LN521-alginate scaffolds under an intermittent loading regime."
https://openalex.org/W3000300379,"Rationale Pulmonary function testing (PFT) provides diagnostic information regarding respiratory physiology. However, many forms of PFT are time-intensive and require patient cooperation. Respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) provides thoracoabdominal asynchrony (TAA) and work of breathing (WOB) data. pneuRIPTM is a noninvasive, wireless analyzer that provides real-time assessment of RIP via an iPad. In this study, we show that pneuRIPTM can be used in a hospital clinic setting to differentiate WOB indices and breathing patterns in children with DMD as compared to age-matched healthy subjects. Methods RIP using the pneuRIPTM was conducted on 9 healthy volunteers and 7 DMD participants (ages 5–18) recruited from the neuromuscular clinic, under normal resting conditions over 3–5 min during routine outpatient visits. The tests were completed in less than 10 minutes and did not add excessive time to the clinic visit. Variables recorded included labored-breathing index (LBI), phase angle (Φ) between abdomen and rib cage, respiratory rate (RR), percentage of rib cage input (RC%), and heart rate (HR). The data were displayed in histogram plots to identify distribution patterns within the normal ranges. The percentages of data within the ranges (0≤ Φ ≤30 deg.; median RC %±10%; median RR±5%; 1≤LBI≤1.1) were compared. Unpaired t-tests determined significance of the data between groups. Results 100% patient compliance demonstrates the feasibility of such testing in clinical settings. DMD patients showed a significant elevation in Φ, LBI, and HR averages (P<0.006, P<0.002, P<0.046, respectively). Healthy subjects and DMD patients had similar BPM and RC% averages. All DMD data distributions were statistically different from healthy subjects based on analysis of histograms. The DMD patients showed significantly less data within the normal ranges, with only 49.7% Φ, 48.0% RC%, 69.2% RR, and 50.7% LBI. Conclusion In this study, noninvasive pneuRIPTM testing provided instantaneous PFT diagnostic results. As compared to healthy subjects, patients with DMD showed abnormal results with increased markers of TAA, WOB indices, and different breathing patterns. These results are similar to previous studies evaluating RIP in preterm infants. Further studies are needed to compare these results to other pulmonary testing methods. The pneuRIPTM testing approach provides immediate diagnostic information in outpatient settings."
https://openalex.org/W3000333555,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play vital roles in various biological processes under multiple stress conditions by leading to mRNA cleavage or translational repression. However, the detailed roles of miRNAs in cold acclimation in fish are still unclear. In the present study, high-throughput sequencing was performed to identify miRNAs from 6 small RNA libraries from the zebrafish embryonic fibroblast ZF4 cells under control (28°C, 30 days) and cold-acclimation (18°C, 30 days) conditions. A total of 414 miRNAs, 349 known and 65 novel, were identified. Among those miRNAs, 24 (19 known and 5 novel) were up-regulated, and 23 (9 known and 14 novel) were down-regulated in cold acclimated cells. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses indicated that the target genes of known differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNA) are involved in cold acclimation by regulation of phosphorylation, cell junction, intracellular signal transduction, ECM-receptor interaction and so on. Moreover, both miR-100-3p inhibitor and miR-16b mimics could protect ZF4 cells under cold stress, indicating the involvement of miRNA in cold acclimation. Further study showed that miR-100-3p and miR-16b could regulate inversely the expression of their target gene (atad5a, cyp2ae1, lamp1, rilp, atxn7, tnika, btbd9), and that overexpression of miR-100-3p disturbed the early embryonic development of zebrafish. In summary, the present data show that miRNAs are closely involved in cold acclimation in zebrafish ZF4 cells and provide information for further understanding of the roles of miRNAs in cold acclimation in fish."
https://openalex.org/W3000413663,"Objectives To investigate the association between a healthy lifestyle index (HLI) (i.e., a composite score comprising multiple lifestyle factors) and hypertension among community adults living in Sri Lanka. Methods The present study used baseline information of a cluster randomized controlled trial among 456 adults aged 27–65 years in a semi-urban community in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The HLI was constructed by summing a number of low-risk lifestyle factors: low body mass index, sufficient physical activity, non-smoking, low alcohol consumption, and sufficient fruit and vegetable consumption. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, or the use of antihypertensive medication. A logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between the HLI (low: 0–2; middle: 3; high: 4–5) and hypertension. Results A total of 178 (39%) participants were hypertensive. Compared with the low HLI group, multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of hypertension were 0.72 (0.44–1.19) and 0.28 (0.15–0.54) for the middle and high HLI groups, respectively (p-trend <0.001). Conclusions The present study provides essential evidence on an inverse association between adherence to healthy lifestyles and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2998984295,"Background Robotic surgery presents a challenge to effective teamwork and communication in the operating theatre (OR). Our objective was to evaluate the effect of using a wireless audio headset device on communication, efficiency and patient outcome in robotic surgery. Methods and findings A prospective controlled trial of team members participating in gynecologic and urologic robotic procedures between January and March 2015. In the first phase, all surgeries were performed without headsets (control), followed by the intervention phase where all team members used the wireless headsets. Noise levels were measured during both phases. After each case, all team members evaluated the quality of communication, performance, teamwork and mental load using a validated 14-point questionnaire graded on a 1–10 scale. Higher overall scores indicated better communication and efficiency. Clinical and surgical data of all patients in the study were retrieved, analyzed and correlated with the survey results. The study included 137 procedures, yielding 843 questionnaires with an overall response rate of 89% (843/943). Self-reported communication quality was better in cases where headsets were used (113.0 ± 1.6 vs. 101.4 ± 1.6; p < .001). Use of headsets reduced the percentage of time with a noise level above 70 dB at the console (8.2% ± 0.6 vs. 5.3% ± 0.6, p < .001), but had no significant effect on length of surgery nor postoperative complications. Conclusions The use of wireless headset devices improved quality of communication between team members and reduced the peak noise level in the robotic OR."

https://openalex.org/W2999008810,"Introduction This study explores the possibility of a relationship between the sphericity degree of a target volume with the dose distribution. This relationship is evaluated based on the ratio isodose volume / target volume (IV/TV) and the metrics coverage, i.e., selectivity, gradient index, conformity index and mean dose when planning radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma. Methods Sphericity degree (φ) was calculated for each target volume (TV) of 64 patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma. The calculation of this parameter was developed using the theoretical definition for operational sphericity φ = VP/VCS. The values found are evaluated considering the following metrics:—Coverage (C), selectivity (S), gradient index (GI), Paddick conformity index (CIPaddick) and dose distribution (IV/TV). The planning was also carried out considering a spherical target volume defined in a spherical phantom. The spherical volume is the same as the target used in the treatment plan. The planning of the spherical target was considered as a reference plan to evaluate the dose distribution inside and outside the volume. Results It was possible to observe that the majority of target volumes has (ϕ) around 0,66–0,77, corresponding to 54,7% of the total. Considering the mean values for metrics, the results are: C = 0,98, S = 0,78, GI = 3,11 and CI = 0,81. The dose distribution was equivalent for treatment plans and reference plans. Quantitative analysis for IV/TV shows that these values are higher than 30% for treatment plans where shot density is large. Conclusion This study demonstrates that de sphericity degree (φ) can be related to the dose distribution (IV/TV). Therefore the sphericity degree is a good parameter to evaluate the dose distribution of a plan for vestibular schwannoma treatment, considering the reference plan as being a spherical target using a leksell gamma knife® perfexion (LGKP). This study shows that the sphericity degree offers important information of the dose distribution outside and inside the target volume. This is not evaluated by the other parameters already implemented as metric to analyzing the GKP plans."
https://openalex.org/W2999711333,"The objectives of this research were to describe the contact structure of transportation vehicles and swine facilities in an Ontario swine production system, and to assess their potential contribution to possible disease transmission over different time periods. A years’ worth of data (2015) was obtained from a large swine production and data management company located in Ontario, Canada. There was a total of 155 different transportation vehicles, and 220 different farms within the study population. Two-mode networks were constructed for 1-,3-, and 7-day time periods over the entire year and were analyzed. Trends in the size of the maximum weak component and outgoing contact chain over discrete time periods were investigated using linear regression. Additionally, the number of different types of facilities with betweenness >0 and in/out degree>0 were analyzed using Poisson regression. Maximum weekly outgoing contact chain (MOCCw) contained between 2.1% and 7.1% of the study population. This suggests a potential maximum of disease spread within this population if the disease was detected within one week. Frequency of node types within MOCCw showed considerable variability; although nursery sites were relatively most frequent. The regression analysis of several node and network level statistics indicated a potential peak time of connectivity during the summer months and warrants further confirmation and investigation. The inclusion of transportation vehicles contributed to the linear increase in the maximum weekly weak component (MWCw) size over time. This finding in combination with constant population dynamics, may have been driven by the differential utilization of trucks over time. Despite known limitations of maximum weak components as an estimator of possible outbreaks, this finding suggests that transportation vehicles should be included, when possible and relevant, in the evaluation of contacts between farms."
https://openalex.org/W3000046303,"In the US, medication assisted treatment, particularly with office-based buprenorphine, has been an important component of opioid dependence treatment among patients with iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesics. The predictors of initiating buprenorphine for addiction among opioid analgesic patients have not been well-described.We conducted a time-to-event analysis using data from the North Carolina (NC) Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP). Our outcome of interest was time-to-initiation of sublingual buprenorphine. Our study population was a prospective cohort of all state residents receiving a full-agonist opioid analgesic between 2011 and 2015. Predictors of initiation of sublingual buprenorphine examined included: age, gender, cumulative pharmacies and prescribers utilized, cumulative opioid intensity (defined as cumulative opioid exposure divided by duration of opioid exposure), and benzodiazepine dispensing.Of 4.3 million patients receiving opioid analgesics in NC between 2011 and 2015 (accumulated 8.30 million person-years of follow-up), and a total of 28,904 patients initiated buprenorphine formulations intended for addiction treatment (overall rate 3.48 per 1,000 person-years). In adjusted multivariate models, the utilization of 3 or more pharmacies (HR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.82, 3.05) or 6 or more controlled substance prescribers (HR: 12.09; 95% CI: 10.76, 13.57) was associated with buprenorphine initiation. A dose-response relationship was observed for cumulative opioid intensity (HR in highest decile relative to lowest decile: 5.05; 95% CI: 4.70, 5.42). Benzodiazepine dispensing was negatively associated with buprenorphine initiation (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.65).Opioid analgesic patients utilizing multiple prescribers or pharmacies are more likely to initiate sublingual buprenorphine. This finding suggests that patients with multiple healthcare interactions are more likely to be treated for high-risk opioid use, or may be more likely to be identified and treated for addiction. Future research should utilize prescription monitoring program data linked to electronic health records to include diagnosis information in analytic models."
https://openalex.org/W3000058901,"In intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) the energy of the electron beam is selected under the conventional assumption of water-equivalent tissues at the applicator end. However, the treatment field can deviate from the theoretic flat irradiation surface, thus altering dose profiles. This patient-based study explored the feasibility of acquiring intraoperative computed tomography (CT) studies for calculating three-dimensional dose distributions with two factors not included in the conventional assumption, namely the air gap from the applicator end to the irradiation surface and tissue heterogeneity. In addition, dose distributions under the conventional assumption and from preoperative CT studies (both also updated with intraoperative data) were calculated to explore whether there are other alternatives to intraoperative CT studies that can provide similar dose distributions. The IOERT protocol was modified to incorporate the acquisition of intraoperative CT studies before radiation delivery in six patients. Three studies were not valid to calculate dose distributions due to the presence of metal artefacts. For the remaining three cases, the average gamma pass rates between the doses calculated from intraoperative CT studies and those obtained assuming water-equivalent tissues or from preoperative CT studies were 73.4% and 74.0% respectively. The agreement increased when the air gap was included in the conventional assumption (98.1%) or in the preoperative CT images (98.4%). Therefore, this factor was the one mostly influencing the dose distributions of this study. Our experience has shown that intraoperative CT studies are not recommended when the procedure includes the use of shielding discs or surgical retractors unless metal artefacts are removed. IOERT dose distributions calculated under the conventional assumption or from preoperative CT studies may be inaccurate unless the air gap (which depends on the surface irregularities of the irradiated volume and on the applicator pose) is included in the calculations."
https://openalex.org/W2999659330,"Preterm infant brain activity is discontinuous; bursts of activity recorded using EEG (electroencephalography), thought to be driven by subcortical regions, display scale free properties and exhibit a complex temporal ordering known as long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). During brain development, activity-dependent mechanisms are essential for synaptic connectivity formation, and abolishing burst activity in animal models leads to weak disorganised synaptic connectivity. Moreover, synaptic pruning shares similar mechanisms to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), suggesting that the timing of activity may play a critical role in connectivity formation. We investigated, in a computational model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurones, whether the temporal ordering of burst activity within an external driving input could modulate connectivity formation in the network. Connectivity evolved across the course of simulations using an approach analogous to STDP, from networks with initial random connectivity. Small-world connectivity and hub neurones emerged in the network structure-characteristic properties of mature brain networks. Notably, driving the network with an external input which exhibited LRTCs in the temporal ordering of burst activity facilitated the emergence of these network properties, increasing the speed with which they emerged compared with when the network was driven by the same input with the bursts randomly ordered in time. Moreover, the emergence of small-world properties was dependent on the strength of the LRTCs. These results suggest that the temporal ordering of burst activity could play an important role in synaptic connectivity formation and the emergence of small-world topology in the developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W2999985260,"In order to achieve deep tissue imaging, a number of optical clearing agents have been developed. However, in a conventional microscopy setup, an objective lens can only be moved until it is in contact with a coverslip, which restricts the maximum focusing depth into a cleared tissue specimen. Until now, it is still a fact that the working distance of a high magnification objective lens with a high numerical aperture is always about 100 μm. In this study, a polymer thin film (also called as nanosheet) composed of fluoropolymer with a thickness of 130 nm, less than one-thousandth that of a 170 μm thick coverslip, is employed to replace the coverslip. Owing to its excellent characteristics, such as high optical transparency, mechanical robustness, chemical resistance, and water retention ability, nanosheet is uniquely capable of providing a coverslip-free imaging. By wrapping the tissue specimen with a nanosheet, an extra distance of 170 μm for the movement of objective lens is obtained. Results show an equivalently high resolution imaging can be obtained if a homogenous refractive index between immersion liquid and mounting media is adjusted. This method will facilitate a variety of imaging tasks with off-the-shelf high magnification objectives."

We sought to develop a pathway with 3-hour changes for major adverse cardiac event (MACE) identification and assess the added value of the HEART [History, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Age, Risk factors, Troponin] score to the pathway.We prospectively enrolled adults with NSTEMI symptoms at two-large emergency departments (EDs) over 32-months. Patients with STEMI, unstable angina and one cTn were excluded. We collected baseline characteristics, Siemens Vista conventional cTnI at 0, 3 or 6-hours after ED presentation; HEART score predictors; disposition and ED length of stay (LOS). Adjudicated primary outcome was 15-day MACE (acute MI, revascularization, or death due to cardiac ischemia/unknown cause). We analyzed multiples of 99th percentile cut-off cTnI values (45, 100 and 250ng/L).1,683 patients (mean age 64.7 years; 55.3% female; median LOS 7-hours; 88 patients with 15-day MACE) were included. 1,346 (80.0%) patients with both cTnI≤45 ng/L; and 155 (9.2%) of the 213 patients with one value≥100ng/L but both<250ng/L or ≤20% change did not suffer MACE. Among 124 patients (7.4%) with one of the two values>45ng/L but<100ng/L based on 3 or 6-hour cTnI, one patient with absolute change<10ng/L and 6 of the 19 patients with≥20ng/L were diagnosed with NSTEMI (patients with Δ10-19ng/L between first and second cTnI had third one at 6-hours). Based on the results, we developed the Ottawa Troponin Pathway (OTP) with a 98.9% sensitivity (95% CI 93.8-100%) and 94.6% specificity (95% CI 93.3-95.6%). Addition of the HEART score improved the sensitivity to 100% (95% CI 95.9-100%) and decreased the specificity to 26.5% (95% CI 24.3-28.7%).The OTP with conventional cTnI 3-hours apart, should lead to better NSTEMI identification particularly those with values >99th percentile, standardize management and reduce the ED LOS."
https://openalex.org/W2999364265,"Oral magnesium for leg cramps treatment in pregnancy is a controversial issue according to recent Cochrane systematic review. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Mg++ supplementation in leg cramps treatment in pregnancy.This observational clinical trial studied 132 pregnant women with leg cramps in the first trimester of pregnancy. At baseline, 74 (56.3%) had two leg cramps episodes per week, 28 (21.1%) three episodes, 13 (9.8%) four episodes and 9 (6.8%) five or more episodes. They were randomized 1:1 to 300 mg/day of oral Mg++ citrate (n = 66) or placebo (n = 66). The primary outcome was the frequency of leg cramps episodes per week reported by pregnant women. Secondary outcomes were the ocurrence of leg cramps and oral magnesium side effects.130 pregnant women completed the study and the two groups were comparable according to some sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. After 4 weeks of intervention it was observed a 28.4% (39/132) (CI 95%: 20.9-37.0) reduction of leg cramps in all participants and no difference between the two groups was found; reduction of 27.2% (18/66) (CI 95%: 17.0-39.6) in Mg++ group and 32.8% (21/66) (CI 95%: 21.6-45.7) in the placebo group. The OR of leg cramps was 1.3 (CI 95%: 0.6-2.9), p = 0.527, taking the placebo group as reference. Among pregnant women who remained with leg cramps the mean of leg cramps episodes per week showed no significance difference between the Mg++ and placebo groups; t-student test: p = 0.408. Four pregnant women showed gastrointestinal side effects; 2 in each group had nauseas and diarrhoea.Oral magnesium supplementation during pregnancy did not reduce the ocurrence and frequency of episodes of leg cramps."
https://openalex.org/W2999609762,"We aimed to compare 30-day readmission after medical-surgical hospitalization for people who experience imprisonment and matched people in the general population in Ontario, Canada. We used linked population-based correctional and health administrative data. Of people released from Ontario prisons in 2010, we identified those with at least one medical or surgical hospitalization between 2005 and 2015 while they were in prison or within 6 months after release. For those with multiple eligible hospitalizations, we randomly selected one hospitalization. We stratified people by whether they were in prison or recently released from prison at the time of hospital discharge. We matched each person with a person in the general population based on age, sex, hospitalization case mix group, and hospital discharge year. Our primary outcome was 30-day hospital readmission. We included 262 hospitalizations for people in prison and 1,268 hospitalizations for people recently released from prison. Readmission rates were 7.7% (95%CI 4.4–10.9) for people in prison and 6.9% (95%CI 5.5–8.3) for people recently released from prison. Compared with matched people in the general population, the unadjusted HR was 0.72 (95%CI 0.41–1.27) for people in prison and 0.78 (95%CI 0.60–1.02) for people recently released from prison. Adjusted for baseline morbidity and social status, hospitalization characteristics, and post-discharge health care use, the HR for 30-day readmission was 0.74 (95%CI 0.40–1.37) for people in prison and 0.48 (95%CI 0.36–0.63) for people recently released from prison. In conclusion, people recently released from prison had relatively low rates of readmission. Research is needed to elucidate reasons for lower readmission to ensure care quality and access."
https://openalex.org/W2999649234,"Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between diabetic mellitus (DM) treatment and the incidence rate of endogenous endophthalmitis (EE). Design This study used a matched cohort design. We utilized the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database to identify outpatients and inpatients who were diagnosed with DM and treated with medication from 2000 to 2010. Methods Several factors and different DM medications were also investigated. The influence of DM medication on the incidence of EE was examined by using Cox proportional hazards regression models, and the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were determined. Results The cumulative incidence of EE was lower in DM patients treated with medication than in subjects in the control group (P = 0.002). The adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) was 0.47-fold lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P = 0.004). With respect to DM medication, single-agent therapy with insulin, metformin, gliclazide, glimepiride, or repaglinide and combination therapy with glimepiride/metformin or repaglinide/metformin were associated with decreased AHRs (0.257–0.544, all P<0.05). Conclusions Diabetic patients treated with medication had lower AHRs than those in the control group. Further stratification indicated that liver abscess, liver disease DM patients who were treated with medication had a lower risk of developing EE. Several specific DM medications may decrease the incidence of EE."
https://openalex.org/W3000696048,"DNA repair inhibition has been described as an essential event leading to the initiation of carcinogenesis. In a previous study, we observed that the exposure to metal mixture induces changes in the miR-nome of the cells that was correlated with the sub-expression of mRNA involved in processes and diseases associated with metal exposure. From this analysis, one of the miRNAs that shows changes in its expression is miR-222, which is overexpressed in various cancers associated with exposure to metals. In silico studies showed that a possible target for the microRNA-222 could be Rad 51c, a gene involved in the double-stranded DNA repair. We could appreciate that up-regulation of miR-222 reduces the expression both gene and as a protein expression of Rad51c by RT-PCR and immunoblot, respectively. A luciferase assay was performed to validate Rad51c as miR-222 target. Neutral comet assay was performed in order to evaluate DNA double-strand breaks under experimental conditions. Here, we demonstrate that miR-222 up-regulation, directly regulates Rad51c expression negatively, and impairs homologous recombination of double-strand break DNA repair during the initiation stage of cell transformation. This inhibition triggers morphological transformation in a two-stage Balb/c 3T3 cell assay, suggesting that this small RNA acts as an initiator of the carcinogenesis process."
https://openalex.org/W3000723038,"Despite its important position in academic and scientific fields, as well as in daily life, statistics is a subject that generates negative attitudes within most t disciplines in the college curriculum. This paper proposes a method for analysing different students' attitudes toward statistics using paired ANOVA tests for comparing components and groups, and discriminant analysis application for measuring the discriminant power of different components. This method was applied to a sample of 145 teachers in training from the University XXX who were studying for degrees in Spanish, English, social sciences, and mathematics during the 2016-2017 academic year. Pedagogic and anthropologic components were established using Estrada's Scale of Attitudes toward Statistics (EAEE). All the students were characterized on such a scale. The results show higher scores, mainly in instrumental components (and, to a lesser extent, cognitive and social components) from students majoring in mathematics. Furthermore, the cognitive component that most strongly characterizes students working toward a degree in social sciences, which suggests that they perceive statistics as a reliable subject but are not as aware of its utility when facing problems in everyday life. The information obtained in this study can be used to devise strategies that can lead to an improvement in future teachers' attitudes toward statistics, which would, in turn, improve the performance of their future students."
https://openalex.org/W3000197315,"The target spraying effect of spray robots mainly depends on the control performance of the spraying arm during the processes of aiming and tracking. To further improve the robustness of the endpoint control and positioning accuracy of the spray arm, an improved potential field algorithm for the motion planning and control of the spray arm is proposed based on prophase research. The algorithm introduces a velocity potential field, visual field constraints and joint position limit constraints into the traditional artificial potential field method. The velocity potential field is used to ensure that the target state of the spraying arm is at the same velocity as the target crop (relative velocity) to achieve stable target tracking. The visual field constraints and joint position limit constraints are utilized to ensure the efficiency of the visual servo control and the movement of the spray arm. The algorithm can plan a feasible trajectory for the spraying arm in Cartesian space and image space, and use the speed controller to control the spraying arm movement along the trajectory for aiming and tracking. Simulation analysis shows that the algorithm can plan better motion trajectories than the servo controller based on image moments in previous studies. In addition, the experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively improve the robustness of targeting and tracking control for the spray robot."
https://openalex.org/W3000225096,"Pain management and sedation are important aspects in the treatment of hospitalized patients, especially those mechanically ventilated. In many hospitals, such patients are treated not only in intensive care units, but also in other wards. In the nineteen eighties, numerous studies demonstrated a wide array of misconceptions and inadequate knowledge related to commonly used sedative, analgesics and muscle relaxants which may prevent appropriate treatment. Since these publications, multiple studies have shown that appropriate sedation and analgesia are associated with improved clinical outcomes, educational programs were developed and guidelines published. Whether the personnel's knowledge kept up with these changes is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the current rate of misconceptions and knowledge gaps regarding commonly used sedative, analgesic and neuromuscular drugs.In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional survey, a questionnaire was e-mailed to physicians and nurses routinely treating mechanically ventilated patients in Rambam Health Care Campus (Haifa, Israel).355 questionnaires were returned. 82.54% knew that midazolam has no analgesic effect. 71-72% were familiar with the sedative effect of opiates. 27% believed that propofol has analgesic properties and 30.52% thought that rocuronium has a sedative effect.Our findings demonstrate that although a lot has been done during the last decades in order to improve the treatment of critically ill patients, the rate of misconceptions regarding pharmacological characteristics of commonly used drugs is unacceptably high. We call for performance of similar surveys in other institutes and for immediate action to improve patients' care."
https://openalex.org/W2998847305,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicates the clinical management of atrial fibrillation (AF) because coronary stenting may influence subsequent antithrombotic therapy. We investigated the use of a bare-metal stent (BMS) or a drug-eluting stent (DES) and associated outcomes in patients with pre-existing AF and first AMI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.Patient records in this population-based study were retrospectively collected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Using propensity score matching (PSM), we used 1:2 ratio stratification into a DES group of 436 and a BMS group of 785 patients from 2007 to 2011. The mean follow-up of matched cohorts was 1.7 years. After PSM, DESs were associated with lower rates of cardiovascular death (7.8%, hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-0.86 and 10.1%, HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.90) and primary composite outcome (35.1%, HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.92 and 48.2%, HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.96) than BMSs within the first year and at the end of follow-up. Although the greatest benefit from DESs, irrespective of the first- and second- generation DESs, implantation was observed within the first year only, this benefit was not observed in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or dialysis.Use of DESs in AMI patients with pre-existing AF is associated with significantly lower rates of cardiovascular death and primary composite outcome within the first year follow-up. However, the effect is not apparent in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease or dialysis."
https://openalex.org/W3000436191,"Approximately half of hospitalized patients suffer functional decline due to spending the vast majority of their time in bed. Previous studies of early mobilization have demonstrated improvement in outcomes, but the interventions studied have been resource-intensive. We aimed to decrease the time hospital inpatients spend in bed through a pragmatic mobilization protocol.This prospective, non-blinded, controlled clinical trial assigned inpatients to the study wards per routine clinical care in an urban teaching hospital. All subjects on intervention wards were provided with a behavioral intervention, consisting of educational handouts, by the nursing staff. Half of the intervention wards were supplied with recliner chairs in which subjects could sit. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. The secondary outcome was the '6-Clicks' functional score.During a 6-month study period, 6082 patient encounters were included. The median length of stay was 84 hours (IQR 44-175 hours) in the control group, 80 hours (IQR 44-155 hours) in the group who received the behavioral intervention alone, and 88 hours (IQR 44-185 hours) in the group that received both the behavioral intervention and the recliner chair. In the multivariate analysis, neither the behavioral intervention nor the provision of a recliner chair was associated with a significant decrease in length of stay or increase in functional status as measured by the '6-Clicks' functional score.The program of educational handouts and provision of recliner chairs to discourage bed rest did not increase functional status or decrease length of stay for inpatients in a major urban academic center. Education and physical resources must be supplemented by other active interventions to reduce time spent in bed, functional decline, and length of stay.ClinicalTrials.gov, HS-16-00804."
https://openalex.org/W3000626102,"Modeling tools are well established in software development. A model is the result of a series of modeling activities. The ability to recognize when a user is working on a certain modeling activity opens up a range of possibilities for context-sensitive support. One possible way to support the user is offering the auto-completion of the current task. The recognition of modeling activities is typically carried out by matching event patterns against events emitted by a user's editing operations. A user that intends to add or customize auto-completions must be able to easily understand and create activity definitions. However, defining the currently required complex event patterns is a challenging and error-prone task even for a person with an intensive knowledge of event-processing languages. In this paper, we propose the visual definition language VisPaRec accompanied by a method that allows creating activity definitions in a semi-automated and graphical way. We evaluate our visual definition language in a comparative user study against the generic event-processing language Rapide. We found that the proposed visual representation increases comprehensibility while reducing time for constructing and modifying activity definitions significantly."
