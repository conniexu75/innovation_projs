https://openalex.org/W2070858110,"A seven-element tracer system shows that regional pollution aerosols of both North America and Europe have characteristic signatures that can be followed into remote areas up to several thousand kilometers downwind. In aerosols of mixed origin, regional contributions to the tracer elements can be resolved by least-squares procedures. After transport of several hundred kilometers, secondary sulfate can also be apportioned satisfactorily. Regional elemental tracers thus offer a way to determine the sources of pollution aerosol in important areas such as the northeastern United States, Scandinavia, and the Arctic."
https://openalex.org/W2041542043,"The Neogene stratigraphic section of the southeastern U.S. continental shelf-coastal plain system is characterized by (i) a series of major regional phosphogenic episodes; (ii) a strong spatial relationship between the structural or topographic framework and phosphate deposition; and (iii) distinct cyclical and regional patterns of deposition of the terrigenous, carbonate, and phosphate lithofacies. The complex depositional patterns are explained by a paleoceanographic model based upon the interaction of glacial eustatic sea-level fluctuations, associated changes in climate, and the dynamics of the Gulf Stream in response to the bathymetric configurations of the continental margin during the past 20 million years."

https://openalex.org/W2008359920,Measurement of the filamentary noctilucent cloud of 2 November 1963 yields a height of 56 km. Study of the motion and orientation of the cloud confirms the hypothesis that these unusual clouds appearing in the southwestern states are produced by the launching of rocket vehicles from the Pacific Missile Range.

The correct value for the drift of atomic clocks relative to gravitational clocks is (0.1 +/- 0.8) x 10(-11) per year."
