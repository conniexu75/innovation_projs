https://openalex.org/W2121760835,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a glutamine repeat expansion in huntingtin protein. Transcriptional deregulation and altered energy metabolism have been implicated in HD pathogenesis. We report here that mutant huntingtin causes disruption of mitochondrial function by inhibiting expression of PGC-1α, a transcriptional coactivator that regulates several metabolic processes, including mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. Mutant huntingtin represses PGC-1α gene transcription by associating with the promoter and interfering with the CREB/TAF4-dependent transcriptional pathway critical for the regulation of PGC-1α gene expression. Crossbreeding of PGC-1α knockout (KO) mice with HD knockin (KI) mice leads to increased neurodegeneration of striatal neurons and motor abnormalities in the HD mice. Importantly, expression of PGC-1α partially reverses the toxic effects of mutant huntingtin in cultured striatal neurons. Moreover, lentiviral-mediated delivery of PGC-1α in the striatum provides neuroprotection in the transgenic HD mice. These studies suggest a key role for PGC-1α in the control of energy metabolism in the early stages of HD pathogenesis.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive and fatal neurological disorder that is characterized phenotypically by involuntary movements and psychiatric disturbances (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998Vonsattel J.P. DiFiglia M. Huntington disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The gene huntingtin, which is mutated in HD patients, contains an expanded polyglutamine repeat within exon 1. The number of polyglutamine diseases continues to grow, and they share several common features, including neurodegeneration, a dominant pattern of inheritance and genetic anticipation (Zoghbi and Orr, 2000Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Glutamine repeats and neurodegeneration.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In HD, mutant huntingtin is expressed ubiquitously, but selective cell loss is observed in the brain, particularly in the caudate and putamen of the striatum (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998Vonsattel J.P. DiFiglia M. Huntington disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Many proteins containing polyglutamine-rich regions function as transcription factors (Alba and Guigo, 2004Alba M.M. Guigo R. Comparative analysis of amino acid repeats in rodents and humans.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interactions of mutant huntingtin with several transcription factors have been demonstrated, suggesting that mutant huntingtin may be directly involved in the regulation of gene transcription (Sugars and Rubinsztein, 2003Sugars K.L. Rubinsztein D.C. Transcriptional abnormalities in Huntington disease.Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 233-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). For example, mutant huntingtin was shown to repress transcription by interfering with activator/coactivator interactions (Sp1/TAF4) in brain samples from presymptomatic patients (Dunah et al., 2002Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Sp1 and TAFII130 transcriptional activity disrupted in early Huntington's disease.Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that a soluble form of mutant huntingtin may interfere with specific components of transcriptional machinery in early stages of HD. In addition to transcriptional deregulation, altered energy metabolism has been implicated in HD pathogenesis (Browne and Beal, 2004Browne S.E. Beal M.F. The energetics of Huntington's disease.Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Striatal hypometabolism was detected in asymptomatic HD subjects, and activities of complexes of the electron transport chain were selectively reduced in caudate and putamen of advanced-grade HD patients (Antonini et al., 1996Antonini A. Leenders K.L. Spiegel R. Meier D. Vontobel P. Weigell-Weber M. Sanchez-Pernaute R. de Yebenez J.G. Boesiger P. Weindl A. Maguire R.P.

The energetics of Huntington's disease.Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Additional evidence that energetic deficits may contribute to neurodegeneration in HD came from studies showing that agents that enhance energy production in the brain were neuroprotective (Browne and Beal, 2004Browne S.E. Beal M.F. The energetics of Huntington's disease.Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which mutant huntingtin disrupts mitochondrial function and oxidative metabolism remains unclear. In this study we demonstrate that mutant huntingtin interferes with energy metabolism by transcriptional repression of PGC-1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 α). PGC-1α is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates several metabolic processes, including mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation (Puigserver and Spiegelman, 2003Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha): transcriptional coactivator and metabolic regulator.Endocr.

Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). We show that PGC-1α plays an important role in brain energy homeostasis and represents a key target of mutant huntingtin in the pathogenesis of HD. Recent findings suggest that striatum, the region most affected in HD, may be particularly susceptible to disruption of energy metabolism caused by lack of PGC-1α (Lin et al., 2004Lin J. Wu P. Tarr P. St-Pierre J. Zhang J. Mootha V.K. Jager S. Vianna C. Reznick R.

To determine whether PGC-1α expression may be altered in the striatum, we examined PGC-1α mRNA in postmortem brain samples from presymptomatic HD patients. We found a 30% decrease of PGC-1α mRNA in the caudate nucleus of striatum, whereas no significant changes in PGC-1α expression were detected in the hippocampus or cerebellum in these brain samples (Figure 1A). These results indicate that PGC-1α expression is specifically decreased in the caudate, the first region affected in HD. To examine whether PGC-1α downregulation leads to alterations in the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, we first analyzed mRNA expression in the striatum of PGC-1α knockout (KO) mice by microarrays. Using gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we found that metabolic pathways involved in mitochondrial function were among the most significantly decreased in PGC-1α KO striata (Figure S1A) (Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Mesirov J.P.

USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (20168) Google Scholar). Comparisons of pathways significantly downregulated in PGC-1α KO mice with those downregulated in striata from early-stage human HD revealed several common pathways involving oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrion, and the electron transport chain (Figure 1B) (Hodges et al., 2006Hodges A. Strand A.D. Aragaki A.K. Kuhn A. Sengstag T. Hughes G. Elliston L.A. Hartog C. Goldstein D.R. Thu D. et al.Regional and cellular gene expression changes in human Huntington's disease brain.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 965-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Decreased expression of a subset of mitochondrial genes in human HD brain was confirmed by real-time PCR (Figure S1B). These findings suggest that reduced expression of PGC-1α and its mitochondrial targets may represent an early dysfunction in HD pathogenesis. The striatum comprises approximately 90% medium spiny projection neurons (MSN) and 10% aspiny interneurons. In HD, medium spiny neurons degenerate whereas striatal interneurons are spared, but the molecular mechanism of this preferential neuronal vulnerability is unknown (Ferrante et al., 1985Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Beal M.F. Richardson Jr., E.P. Bird E.D. Martin J.B. Selective sparing of a class of striatal neurons in Huntington's disease.Science. 1985; 230: 561-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Since we find that the levels of PGC-1α are decreased in HD striatum, we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) and quantitative real-time PCR to analyze the expression of PGC-1α in individual striatal MSN or nNOS interneurons. When compared with normal mice, PGC-1α levels were decreased 5.6-fold in MSN isolated from HD knockin (KI) mice (Menalled et al., 2003Menalled L.B. Sison J.D. Dragatsis I. Zeitlin S. Chesselet M.F. Time course of early motor and neuropathological anomalies in a knock-in mouse model of Huntington's disease with 140 CAG repeats.J Comp Neurol. 2003; 465: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). In contrast, PGC-1α was increased by 47-fold in HD interneurons, as compared with normal striatal interneurons (Figure 1D). These results suggest that decreased expression of PGC-1α may contribute to increased vulnerability of MSN observed in HD, whereas nNOS interneurons may be protected by high levels of PGC-1α. To further examine the function of PGC-1α in the context of HD, we next analyzed levels of PGC-1α in a well-established model of striatal neuronal cell lines generated from HD KI mice (Trettel et al., 2000Trettel F. Rigamonti D. Hilditch-Maguire P. Wheeler V.C. Sharp A.H. Persichetti F. Cattaneo E. MacDonald M.E. Dominant phenotypes produced by the HD mutation in STHdh(Q111) striatal cells.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). These cell lines (STHdhQ111) express endogenous mutant huntingtin and display mutant phenotype, including decreased cAMP synthesis and reduced ATP levels consistent with altered energy metabolism (Gines et al., 2003Gines S. Seong I.S. Fossale E. Ivanova E. Trettel F. Gusella J.F. Wheeler V.C. Persichetti F. MacDonald M.E. Specific progressive cAMP reduction implicates energy deficit in presymptomatic Huntington's disease knock-in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We compared expression of PGC-1α and its mitochondrial targets in wild-type STHdhQ7 and mutant STHdhQ111 cells and found that expression of both PGC-1α and mitochondrial genes such as cytochrome C and COXIV were significantly decreased in STHdhQ111 cells (Figures 1E and 1F). PGC-1α mRNA level was reduced approximately 10-fold in mutant cells compared to the wild-type control. These results suggest that decreased levels of PGC-1α might play a role in mediating energy defects in mutant STHdhQ111 striatal cells. Recent findings suggest that mutant huntingtin may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription as a corepressor (Dunah et al., 2002Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D.

Rubinsztein D.C. Transcriptional abnormalities in Huntington disease.Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 233-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms of PGC-1α downregulation observed in HD brain and STHdhQ111 cells, we next investigated whether mutant huntingtin may repress the PGC-1α promoter. The PGC-1α promoter reporter, encompassing −2533 to +78 of the mouse PGC-1α gene, was transfected into striatal cell lines from the wild-type and HD mutant mice. A dramatic inhibition of the reporter was observed in the mutant cells (STHdhQ111) compared to the wild-type cells (STHdhQ7) (Figure 2A). In order to examine whether mutant huntingtin directly inhibits the reporter, wild-type cells (STHdhQ7) were transfected with increasing concentrations of normal and mutant huntingtin along with the PGC-1α reporter. Transfected mutant huntingtin significantly repressed the PGC-1α reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B), suggesting that mutant huntingtin modulates the expression of the PGC-1α gene at the level of transcription. Since STHdhQ111 cells exhibit decreased cAMP levels (Gines et al., 2003Gines S. Seong I.S. Fossale E. Ivanova E. Trettel F. Gusella J.F. Wheeler V.C. Persichetti F. MacDonald M.E. Specific progressive cAMP reduction implicates energy deficit in presymptomatic Huntington's disease knock-in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether treatment of these cells with cAMP could affect the PGC-1α reporter activity. As shown in Figure 2C, treatment of STHdhQ111 mutant cells with 8-bromo-cAMP was able to significantly upregulate the activity of the PGC-1α reporter. Importantly, these effects were dependent on the CRE binding site in the PGC-1α proximal promoter, which is known to be critically important for PGC-1α regulation in several tissues (Herzig et al., 2001Herzig S. Long F. Jhala U.S. Hedrick S. Quinn R. Bauer A. Rudolph D. Schutz G. Yoon C. Puigserver P. et al.CREB regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis through the coactivator PGC-1.Nature. 2001; 413: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The reduced expression of PGC-1α mRNA in STHdhQ111 cells and upregulation of the PGC-1α reporter by cAMP prompted us to examine whether endogenous PGC-1α mRNA was modulated by cAMP in STHdhQ111 cells. Treatment of these cells with cAMP significantly upregulated PGC-1α mRNA levels (Figure 2D). Taken together, these results suggest that PGC-1α gene repression by mutant huntingtin involves CRE-dependent transcription. To examine the mechanism of regulation of the PGC-1α promoter by mutant huntingtin in relevant target cells, primary striatal neurons were transfected with PGC-1α promoter reporter along with mutant or normal huntingtin. Although huntingtin with normal glutamine repeats (HttQ17) had no significant effect on the promoter activity, mutant huntingtin (HttQ75) produced significant inhibition by more than 75% compared to the normal huntingtin (Figure 2E). To determine whether the inhibition of CRE-mediated transcription was dependent on increased levels of huntingtin relative to those of endogenous CREB, we overexpressed CREB together with huntingtin. We found that overexpression of CREB that is constitutively active (Du et al., 2000Du K. Asahara H. Jhala U.S. Wagner B.L. Montminy M. Characterization of a CREB gain-of-function mutant with constitutive transcriptional activity in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4320-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) significantly reduced but did not rescue the inhibitory effects of mutant huntingtin on PGC-1α promoter reporter (Figure 2E). These effects of CREB were dependent on the CRE site on the PGC-1α promoter, because no significant effect was seen when the CRE site was mutated (not shown). We have previously shown that huntingtin interacts with TAF4 at least in part in the context of TFIID complex and that TAF4 plays a critical role in mediating mutant huntingtin effects on Sp1-driven gene transcription (Dunah et al., 2002Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Sp1 and TAFII130 transcriptional activity disrupted in early Huntington's disease.Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In addition to its function in Sp1 transcription, TAF4 also mediates coupling of CREB to TFIID and the basal transcriptional machinery (Saluja et al., 1998Saluja D. Vassallo M.F. Tanese N. Distinct subdomains of human TAFII130 are required for interactions with glutamine-rich transcriptional activators.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, Shimohata et al., 2000Shimohata T. Nakajima T. Yamada M. Uchida C. Onodera O. Naruse S. Kimura T. Koide R. Nozaki K. Sano Y. et al.Expanded polyglutamine stretches interact with TAFII130, interfering with CREB-dependent transcription.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether CREB/TAF4 is required for maximal activity of the PGC-1α promoter. As shown in Figure 2E, coexpression of TAF4 and CREB resulted in complete reversal of huntingtin-induced inhibition of PGC-1α promoter activity, indicating that mutant huntingtin affects the CREB/TAF4 transcriptional pathway. TAF4 interacts with other TAFs primarily via its C-terminal domain, suggesting the importance of this domain for the interactions of TAF4 with the TFIID complex (Asahara et al., 2001Asahara H. Santoso B. Guzman E. Du K. Cole P.A. Davidson I. Montminy M. Chromatin-dependent cooperativity between constitutive and inducible activation domains in CREB.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To examine whether the effects of CREB and TAF4 on PGC-1α were dependent on intact C-terminal domain of TAF4, we coexpressed the C-terminal deletion mutant of TAF4 in primary striatal neurons. No significant effect of TAF4 on PGC-1α promoter activity was observed when the C terminus of TAF4 was deleted, suggesting that this domain is required to reverse the repression of the PGC-1α promoter by mutant huntingtin (Figure 2E). Together, these results show that mutant huntingtin inhibits transcription of PGC-1α by interfering with the CREB/TAF4 acting on the PGC-1α promoter. We next used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to determine occupancy of transcription factors at PGC-1α gene in striatal tissues of wild-type and HD KI mice (Figure 3A), R6/2 HD mice (Figure 3B), and in striatal cells derived from wild-type and HD KI mice (Figure 3C). Unexpectedly, we found mutant huntingtin protein to occupy the PGC-1α promoter region in the brains and cells of HD KI mice (Figures 3A and 3C), while presence of wild-type huntingtin was not detected at this promoter. By contrast, occupancy by CREB and TAF4 at the PGC-1α promoter was not substantially altered in wild-type and HD KI cells. To investigate whether increased occupancy of PGC-1α promoter by mutant huntingtin results in altered PGC-1α transcription in vivo, RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitations (RNAPol-ChIP) were performed. This procedure detects the presence of RNA polymerase II within the coding region of the target gene as a way of measuring active transcription (Sandoval et al., 2004Sandoval J. Rodriguez J.L. Tur G. Serviddio G. Pereda J. Boukaba A. Sastre J. Torres L. Franco L. Lopez-Rodas G. RNAPol-ChIP: a novel application of chromatin immunoprecipitation to the analysis of real-time gene transcription.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we found decreased transcription of PGC-1α gene in R6/2 mouse brain as compared to normal littermates (Figure 3B). When genes that are not altered in HD mice, such as albumin, were analyzed by RNAPol-ChIP, no change was observed in polymerase II binding between the normal and HD mice (data not shown). These results suggest that mutant huntingtin associates with chromatin and interferes with the activation functions of promoter bound transcription factors CREB and TAF4 to repress transcription. Interestingly, we observed occupancy of wild-type huntingtin at a different promoter, the dopamine D2 receptor gene promoter, indicating that wild-type huntingtin may target certain genes to regulate transcription (Figure 3C). These results represent the first evidence that wild-type and mutant huntingtin occupy promoter regions of endogenous neuronal target genes and suggest that differential targeting of huntingtin may help explain specific changes in gene expression observed in HD. Since PGC-1α regulates mitochondrial respiration (Puigserver and Spiegelman, 2003Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha): transcriptional coactivator and metabolic regulator.Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar), decreased levels of PGC-1α may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction that is characteristic of striatal HD cells (Gines et al., 2003Gines S. Seong I.S. Fossale E. Ivanova E. Trettel F. Gusella J.F. Wheeler V.C. Persichetti F. MacDonald M.E. Specific progressive cAMP reduction implicates energy deficit in presymptomatic Huntington's disease knock-in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We therefore directly assessed mitochondrial energy metabolism in wild-type and mutant STHdhQ111 cells using the MTS assay. This method is based on the reduction of the soluble tetrazolium salt to insoluble formazan product by mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase. The results revealed that formazan production was significantly reduced by approximately 35% in mutant cells compared with wild-type cells (Figure 4A). Importantly, recombinant adenovirus-mediated expression of PGC-1α in STHdhQ111 cells significantly reversed the mitochondrial defect as determined by MTS assay, suggesting that upregulation of PGC-1α can rescue the effect of mutant huntingtin on mitochondrial function. We next analyzed primary striatal cultures that recapitulate features of the neurodegenerative process that occurs in HD. Transfection of full-length mutant huntingtin (HD75) induced neuronal cell death, whereas the wild-type huntingtin did not show any toxic effects, as previously reported (Figure 4B) (Saudou et al., 1998Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Huntingtin acts in the nucleus to induce apoptosis but death does not correlate with the formation of intranuclear inclusions.Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, Dunah et al., 2002Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Sp1 and TAFII130 transcriptional activity disrupted in early Huntington's disease.Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, when mutant huntingtin is coexpressed in striatal neurons together with PGC-1α, the toxicity of mutant huntingtin was significantly abrogated (Figure 4B), suggesting that expression of PGC-1α in striatal neurons substantially rescues the deleterious effects of mutant huntingtin. Since our data showed that CREB and TAF4 were able to completely reverse the repressive effects of mutant huntingtin on PGC-1α promoter activity (Figure 2E), we tested whether striatal neurons could be protected against mutant huntingtin by transfecting constitutively active CREB along with TAF4. We found that coexpression of CREB and TAF4 resulted in statistically significant protection of striatal cells from the effects of mutant huntingtin (Figure 4C). Coexpression of CREB with TAF4 lacking its C-terminal domain failed to block huntingtin-induced cell death (data not shown), suggesting that intact interactions of TAF4 with TFIID and other factors are required for its protective function. Together, these data demonstrate that CREB/TAF4-dependent regulation of PGC-1α gene, at least in part, mediates the protective effects of PGC-1α in striatal neurons. To further test our hypothesis that PGC-1α may be protective in HD, lentiviral vector expressing PGC-1α was directly administered into the striatum of R6/2 transgenic HD mice. We chose to analyze the R6/2 model because it has a well-characterized progressive phenotype that recapitulates many of the neuropathological features observed in HD patients, such as striatal atrophy, cellular atrophy, and huntingtin-positive aggregates (Ferrante et al., 2000Ferrante R.J. Andreassen O.A. Jenkins B.G. Dedeoglu A. Kuemmerle S. Kubilus J.K. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Hersch S.M. Beal M.F. Neuroprotective effects of creatine in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4389-4397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The striata of 5.5 week-old R6/2 mice were injected with lentiviral vector expressing PGC-1α (Figures 5A and 5B). Using unbiased stereological methods, neuronal volumes were examined 3.5 weeks after the injection. When analyzing a series of sections spanning the injected region of striatum, a statistically significant increase in the mean neuronal volume by 27.8% was observed in striata injected with PGC-1α as compared to contralateral striata that were not injected. No significant change in cell volume was observed in neurons injected with control lentiviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Figures 5C and 5D). Previous studies have demonstrated that R6/2 mice exhibit progressive atrophy of striatal neurons from about 3 to 12 weeks of age with almost 40% overall decrease in area measurements. In addition, at the age of 9 weeks, when our analysis was performed, volumes of striatal neurons in R6/2 mice decreased by about 30% compared to littermate transgene-negative mice (Figure 5D, Ferrante et al., 2000Ferrante R.J. Andreassen O.A. Jenkins B.G. Dedeoglu A. Kuemmerle S. Kubilus J.K. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Hersch S.M. Beal M.F. Neuroprotective effects of creatine in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4389-4397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such atrophy of striatal neurons represents a neuropathological feature in R6/2 mice that most closely resembles neuropathology observed in human HD. Here we show that administration of PGC-1α to R6/2 mice completely prevents neuronal atrophy in R6/2 mice. Moreover, the findings in HD mice are in agreement with our studies in cell culture showing that overexpression of PGC-1α protects striatal neurons from toxicity by mutant huntingtin. The experiments described above demonstrated that expression of PGC-1α is neuroprotective in HD mice. We next examined whether further downregulation of PGC-1α leads to worsening of behavioral and neuropathological abnormalities in HD KI mice that have 140 CAG repeats inserted in the murine huntingtin gene.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal Ca2+ depletion results in STIM1 redistribution from ER membrane homogeneity to distinctly localized aggregates near the plasma membrane; these changes precede and are linked to cytoplasmic Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ release-activated channels (CRACs). The molecular mechanisms initiating ER STIM1 redistribution and plasma membrane CRAC activity are not well understood. We recombinantly expressed the Ca2+-sensing region of STIM1 consisting of the EF-hand together with the sterile α-motif (SAM) domain (EF-SAM) to investigate its Ca2+-related conformational and biochemical features. We demonstrate that Ca2+-loaded EF-SAM (holo) contains high α-helicity, whereas EF-SAM in the absence of Ca2+ (apo) is much less compact. Accordingly, the melting temperature (Tm) of the holoform is ∼25 °C higher than apoform; heat and urea-derived thermodynamic parameters indicate a Ca2+-induced stabilization of 3.2 kcal mol–1. We show that holoEF-SAM exists as a monomer, whereas apoEF-SAM readily forms a dimer and/or oligomer, and that oligomer to monomer transitions and vice versa are at least in part mediated by changes in surface hydrophobicity. Additionally, we find that the Ca2+ binding affinity of EF-SAM is relatively low with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼0.2–0.6 mm and a binding stoichiometry of 1. Our results suggest that EF-SAM actively participates in and is the likely the molecular trigger initiating STIM1 punctae formation via large conformational changes.

Calcium is a fundamental signaling messenger in every eukaryotic cell, regulating a multitude of diverse and kinetically distinct cellular phenomena including gene transcription, protein folding, protein degradation, apoptosis, necrosis, and exocytosis, to name a few (1Berridge M.J.

The ER membranes surround an inner cavity, the lumen, that is critical to the function of the ER as a Ca2+ signaling organelle (2Berridge M.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Because vital Ca2+-dependent processes are associated with the ER, it is essential that changes in luminal Ca2+ levels do not adversely affect these phenomena. Eukaryotes have evolved store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), also termed capacitive Ca2+ entry, as a major Ca2+ entry pathway in electrochemically non-excitable cells (3Marchant J.S. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R493-R495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 4Putney Jr., J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 5Draber P. Draberova L. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). SOCE is the process whereby modest ER Ca2+ store depletion leads to plasma membrane (PM) Ca2+ release-activated channel (CRAC) activation, providing a sustained Ca2+ elevation in the cytoplasm from extracellular sources and ultimately refilling the ER luminal Ca2+ stores (6Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). Until recently, the molecular link between ER Ca2+ efflux and extracellular influx was not known. However, interfering and small inhibiting RNA studies have independently implicated stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1) as the likely Ca2+ sensor in the ER (7Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T.

This single-pass, type I transmembrane protein of 685 amino acids has been found localized on both the plasma and ER membranes (3Marchant J.S. Curr.

The N-terminal regions of STIM1 include a signal peptide, putative EF-hand motif, and predicted sterile α-motif (SAM) domain. The cytosolic C-terminal region consists of two coiled-coil domains, a Pro/Ser-rich region, and a Lys-rich region (supplemental Fig. 1A) (9Williams R.T. Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Hancock M.S. Van Stekelenburg L. Eid J.P. Senior P.V. Kazenwadel J.S. Shandala T. Saint R. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Williams R.T.

The putative EF-hand of STIM1 strongly aligns with the helix-loop-helix consensus sequence of this Ca2+ binding motif (supplemental Fig. 1B). The EF-hand in STIM1 is somewhat unorthodox because it is seemingly unpaired, whereas Ca2+ sensor proteins regularly have paired or doubly paired EF-hands (12Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 13Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that the putative SAM domain of STIM1 may serve to dimerize or oligomerize STIM1 in order to facilitate pairing of the EF-hand (3Marchant J.S. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R493-R495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 4Putney Jr., J.W. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 5Draber P.

In the present work, the predicted Ca2+-sensing region of human STIM1 comprising the EF-hand and SAM domain (EF-SAM) was expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli. The behavior of EF-SAM was characterized biophysically in the presence and absence of Ca2+. The results demonstrate that EF-SAM binds Ca2+ with an affinity that can be reconciled with physiological ER luminal and extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The data establish that EF-SAM is monomeric when Ca2+-loaded but readily forms dimers and oligomers in the Ca2+-depleted state. This study provides a mechanistic perspective on recent observations made on changes in physical STIM1 distribution associated with Ca2+ fluctuations in cell culture. Cloning and Recombinant Expression of EF-SAM—Human STIM1 cDNA was from Origene Technologies, Inc. The EF-SAM region (Ser-58 to Gly-201) was subcloned into a pET-28a vector (Novagen, Inc.) and expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. EF-SAM was purified under denaturing conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and refolded according to the accompanying resin protocol (Qiagen, Inc.). After thrombin digestion, the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). ApoEF-SAM was prepared from the holoform by dialysis versus 100 mm EDTA. Protein concentration was measured using ϵ280 nm = 1.54 (mg ml–1)–1 cm–1. All experiments were performed in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, unless otherwise stated. Optical Spectroscopy—Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on an Aviv CD spectrometer, model 62 DS (Aviv, Inc.). Data were collected in 1-nm increments using a 0.1-cm-path length (l) cell, 10-s averaging time, and 1-nm bandwidth. Spectra were corrected for buffer contributions. Thermal melts were acquired at a scan rate of 1 °C min–1. Fluorescence measurements were made on a Shimadzu RF-5301PC fluorimeter (Shimadzu Corp.), and data were collected in 1 ml (l = 1 cm) or 0.1 ml (l = 0.3 cm) cuvettes using excitation and emission slit widths of 1.5 and 5 nm, respectively. 1-Anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS; Sigma) data were collected in 0.1-ml cuvettes. Thermodynamic parameters (Tm, ΔG, ΔH, ΔS, ΔCp) were extracted from the thermal data by applying N ↔ U and N2 ↔ 2U two-state equilibria as described previously (14Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Parameters (Cmid, m-value, ΔG) were extracted from urea data according to the N ↔ U equilibrium using the linear extrapolation method as described previously (15Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Nonlinear curve fitting was performed in Origin (MicroCal Software, Inc.). NMR Spectroscopy—Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed on 500 or 600 MHz Inova NMR spectrometers (Varian, Inc.) equipped with cryogenic, triple resonance probes. Sequential backbone assignments were made using 1H-15N HSQC, HNCACB, and CBCACONNH experiments (16Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 3: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 17Wang A.C. Lodi P.J. Qin J. Vuister G.W. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 105: 196-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The two- and three-dimensional spectra were processed, and resonance assignments were made using NMRPipe and XEASY, respectively (18Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar, 19Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). SEC and Light Scattering—SEC was performed on Superdex 75 or 200 10/300 GL columns (GE Healthcare). Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) measurements were performed in-line using the three-angle (45, 90, and 135°) miniDawn static light-scattering instrument with a 690-nm laser (Wyatt Technologies, Inc.). Molecular weight was calculated using ASTRA software (Wyatt Technologies, Inc.) based on Zimm plot analysis using a refractive index increment, dn dc–1 = 0.185 liter g–1 (20Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were made on a Dynapro DLS module (Protein Solutions Inc.). The incident light was 825 nm, and the scattering angle was 90°. The average of 35 consecutive autocorrelation functions, each with a 10-s accumulation time, was employed for regularization deconvolution using the accompanying DYNAMICS software (Protein Solutions, Inc.). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). The radial absorbance was scanned at 280 nm. Molecular weight determinations were made by global nonlinear least squares fitting of data at three different speeds using the accompanying EQASSOC software (Beckman Coulter). Partial specific volume = 0.729 ml g–1 and sample density = 1.003 g ml–1 were used in the calculations. Ca2+ Titration Experiments—45Ca2+ binding assays were performed as described previously (21Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For CD and fluorescence-based titrations, free Ca2+ was taken to be ≈ total Ca2+, as protein concentration in these titrations was ≪ Kd values. All binding data were fit to the Hill equation using nonlinear least squares regression in MicroCal Origin. Mass Spectrometry—Mass ionization spectra were recorded on an Applied Biosystem/MDS Sciex API QSTAR XL (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) in positive mode using a μESI source. Nondenaturing conditions were maintained by exchanging EF-SAM into a volatile buffer (NH4HCO3) containing a volatile Ca2+ source (Ca(CH3COO)2). Protein Cross-linking—A final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma) was used in each reaction. Cross-linking was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 4 °C before being stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer followed by boiling for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining were performed using standard procedures. HoloEF-SAM Is a Well Folded α-Helical Protein—The secondary structure of recombinant EF-SAM was assessed using far-UV CD. The spectrum of EF-SAM measured in the presence of Ca2+ (holo) was typical of an α-helical protein, with two intense minima at ∼208 and 225 nm and a maximum at <200 nm (Fig. 1A). The relatively high intensity of the bands suggests that EF-SAM is well folded in the presence of Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+ (apo), the minimum at 225 nm weakened along with an observed blue shift in the 208 nm peak (i.e. new minimum at 204 nm) (Fig. 1A). The considerable conformational differences between holo- and apoEF-SAM were confirmed using NMR. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum acquired in the presence of Ca2+ was well dispersed (i.e. 1H(N) backbone resonances ∼10.3–6.5 ppm), consistent with a well folded and compact tertiary structure (Fig. 1B). The most downfield-shifted backbone 1H resonance (∼10.3 ppm) was assigned to the conserved glycine in the Ca2+-binding loop (Gly-81), suggesting that the EF-hand chemical shift pattern in STIM1 follows the canonical EF-hand archetype (Fig. 1B; also see supplemental Fig. 1B) (22Ikura M. Minowa O. Yazawa M. Yagi K. Hikichi K. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 17-21Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Ikura M. Kay L.E. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4659-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Chemical shift index (CSI) calculations (24Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar) from standard triple resonance-based backbone assignments suggest that holoEF-SAM predominantly adopts α-helical secondary structure, which is in agreement with PSIPRED predictions (25McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2741) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of apoEF-SAM was starkly different; 1H(N) backbone amides had chemical shifts clustered in the ∼8.5-7.5-ppm range, and the number of observable peaks decreased significantly (Fig. 1C). The narrow dispersion of 1H(N) backbone chemical shifts indicated that apois considerably less folded than holoEF-SAM. The addition of Ca2+ to the aposample restored peak dispersion; however, the intensity of the peaks were weak relative to the holosample shown in Fig. 1B, likely because of slow reversibility in the aggregation of apoEF-SAM (data not shown). HoloEF-SAM Is Monomeric—Because the majority of eukaryotic Ca2+ sensor proteins have paired or doubly paired EF-hands (12Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 13Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the molecularity of apo- and holoEF-SAM was assessed. SEC showed a single peak in the presence of excess Ca2+ with no evidence for changes in elution volume as a function of protein concentration (Fig. 2A, inset). SEC in-line MALS gave a Zimm plot-based molecular mass of ∼18 kDa, nearly identical to the expected mass of the monomer (17.4 kDa) (Fig. 2A) (20Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). In the presence of excess EDTA, a concentration-dependent elution volume was observed (Fig. 2A, inset), and the MALS-determined molecular mass (∼35 kDa) was indicative of a dimer (Fig. 2A). The apochromatogram showed evidence for the presence of higher order oligomeric species with considerable protein eluting in the void volume (data not shown). Ultracentrifugation sedimentation equilibrium experiments of holoEF-SAM demonstrated linear plots of ln(abs) versus radius2 for all centrifugation speeds, suggesting that the sample was composed primarily of one species (Fig. 2B). The molecular mass, determined using global self-association analysis, was 14.8 kDa, consistent with a monomer (Fig. 2B). Apoprotein gave a nonlinear plot of ln(abs) versus radius2 only at the highest centrifugation speed, suggesting that the sample was composed of more than one species (Fig. 2B). Global self-association analysis of all apoform data sets gave a molecular mass of 33.8 kDa, consistent with a dimer. The best data fits (i.e. lowest variance) were with the monomer-dimer-tetramer model for apoform data. Glutaraldehyde-mediated cross-linking of EF-SAM as a function of Ca2+ concentration was visualized by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The intensity of the monomer band increased with Ca2+ levels, whereas the highest dimer population was observed in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2C). The molecularity experiments demonstrated that the SAM domain does not function as a dimerization motif when EF-SAM is Ca2+ loaded; at the same time, the apoform displays a clear tendency to form dimers and/or oligomers. EF-SAM Binds Ca2+ with Low Affinity—45Ca2+ binding to EF-SAM was assessed at ambient temperature using an equilibrium ultrafiltration procedure (21Ames J.B. Hendricks K.B. Strahl T. Huttner I.G. Hamasaki N. Thorner J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12149-12161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At saturation, the molar ratio of bound Ca2+ to EF-SAM was ∼1 (Fig. 3A). Positive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry under native buffering conditions and in the presence of excess Ca2+ showed a single Ca2+-related adduct attributed to Ca2+- and Na+-bound EF-SAM (i.e. +40(Ca2+), +23(Na+), –3(H+)), confirming the notion of a single Ca2+ binding site (Fig. 3A, inset). The 45Ca2+ data analyzed with the Hill equation showed that binding was of low affinity (Kd ∼0.6 mm) (Fig. 3A). The low affinity resulted in substantial data scatter and great uncertainty in the 45Ca2+-fitted Kd (Fig. 3A; Table 1). At 20 °C, the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of apo- and holoEF-SAM (λex = 280 nm) were distinct; the Ca2+-loaded form had a higher fluorescence intensity and was red-shifted by ∼2 nm compared with the apoform (Fig. 3B, inset). Change in fluorescence intensity as a function of Ca2+ levels was employed as a further probe to assessing binding affinity. The Kd derived from the Hill-fitted data was ∼0.6 mm (Table 1; Fig. 3B). At 10 °C, where the fraction of folded apoEF-SAM was shown to be higher (see below), apparent Kd values were ∼0.2 mm (Table 1; Fig. 3B). CD ellipticity at 208, 222, and 230 nm as a function of Ca2+ concentration was also used to probe affinity. Hill-based Kd values were consistent with other measurements at 20 °C (∼0.5 mm) (Table 1; Fig. 3C). Overall, the data show that Ca2+ binds to EF-SAM with low affinity (sub-mm), consistent with STIM1 functioning as an ER luminal Ca2+ sensor.TABLE 1Apparent Ca2+ dissociation constants derived from the Hill equationProbeTemperatureKd°Cmm45Ca2+∼22aPerformed at ambient temperature.0.55 ± 0.12Fluorescence100.17 ± 0.04Fluorescence100.19 ± 0.11Fluorescence100.49 ± 0.06Fluorescence200.60 ± 0.05CD(208 nm)bDerived from 200-240-nm spectra of one titration.200.52 ± 0.03CD(222 nm)bDerived from 200-240-nm spectra of one titration.200.51 ± 0.02CD(230 nm)bDerived from 200-240-nm spectra of one titration.200.52 ± 0.02a Performed at ambient temperature.b Derived from 200-240-nm spectra of one titration. Open table in a new tab Ca2+ Drastically Increases the Thermodynamic Stability of EF-SAM—The thermal stability of EF-SAM was assessed in the presence and absence of Ca2+ by following changes in CD ellipticity at 225 nm as a function of temperature (Fig. 4A). Reversibility was ∼70% when scanning just to the end of the unfolding transition. Thermodynamic analysis with a native to unfolded (N ↔ U, where N is native and U is unfolded) equilibrium yielded good fits to both curves (Fig. 4A). The temperature at which the fraction of unfolded macromolecules = 0.5 (Tm) was ∼25 °C higher for holo-compared with apoEF-SAM, translating into a 3.2-kcal mol–1 monomer increase in Gibbs free energy of unfolding (ΔG) (Table 2). The difference in heat capacity of the protein between the folded and denatured state (ΔCp) was considerably higher for holo-compared with apoEF-SAM, reflecting a greater cooperativity and change in solvent-accessible surface area (ΔSASA) upon unfolding (Table 2) (26Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for apo- and holoEF-SAMProteina+Ca2+ = excess CaCl2; -Ca2+ = excess EDTA.ProbebThermal = CD melting curve; Urea = intrinsic fluorescence chemical denaturation curve.TmΔH(Tm)cΔH(Tm) = ΔH at the melting temperature.ΔCp(Tm)dΔCp(Tm) = ΔCp at the melting temperature.Cmidm-valueΔG (10 °C)eΔG (10 °C) = ΔG at 10 °C.ΔΔG (10 °C)fΔΔG (10 °C) = ΔGholo - ΔGapo at 10 °C.°Ckcal mol-1kcal mol-1 K-mkcal mol-1 m-1kcal mol-1kcal mol-1+Ca2+Thermal45.2 ± 0.0122.6 ± 2.04.5 ± 0.34.5 ± 0.3+3.2-Ca2+Thermal19.2 ± 0.243.0 ± 2.00.8 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.8+Ca2+Urea1.8 ± 0.12.1 ± 0.23.7 ± 0.4+3.2-Ca2+Urea0.3 ± 0.81.7 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.4a +Ca2+ = excess CaCl2; -Ca2+ = excess EDTA.b Thermal = CD melting curve; Urea = intrinsic fluorescence chemical denaturation curve.c ΔH(Tm) = ΔH at the melting temperature.d ΔCp(Tm) = ΔCp at the melting temperature.e ΔG (10 °C) = ΔG at 10 °C.f ΔΔG (10 °C) = ΔGholo - ΔGapo at 10 °C. Open table in a new tab Unlike thermal denaturation, chemical denaturation was completely reversible. Urea denaturation was monitored by following the changes in intrinsic fluorescence. Urea unfolding induced a red shift and a decrease in the intensity of the emission spectrum (λex = 280 nm) (Fig. 4B, inset). The fluorescence of the fully folded apostate was confirmed by using 10% (v/v) glycerol. The glycerol-stabilized curve had a folded base line with emission spectra identical to apoprotein in the absence of urea and glycerol. Data were fit to the N ↔ U, scheme and the linear extrapolation method was used to calculate ΔG (Table 2) (15Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). The concentration of urea, where the fraction of unfolded macromolecules = 0.5 (Cmid), was significantly higher for the holo- versus apocurves (0.23 and 2.02 m, respectively) (Fig. 4B). The cooperativity of unfolding, reflected in the fitted m-values, was higher for holo, consistent with the ΔCp trend (26Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). ΔG values were somewhat lower than those determined by thermal analysis, but both analyses (thermal and chemical) were in excellent agreement regarding the Ca2+-induced stabilization (=+3.2 kcal mol–1 monomer). ApoEF-SAM Reversibly Forms Oligomers—The solvent-accessible hydrophobicity of EF-SAM in the presence and absence of Ca2+ was probed by monitoring the extrinsic fluorescent properties of ANS (27Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). The emission spectrum of ANS incubated with apoEF-SAM was blue-shifted and demonstrated increased intensity compared with ANS with no protein added (Fig. 5A). Upon the addition of saturating concentrations of Ca2+, the spectrum shifted back to longer wavelengths and displayed a decreased intensity compared with the apoform; but it remained blue-shifted and more intense than ANS alone (Fig. 5A). The ANS data suggest that the conformational transition that accompanies Ca2+ depletion includes an increase in solvent-accessible hydrophobic area. Dynamic light scattering was employed to determine differences in propensity to oligomerization as a function of Ca2+. Upon the addition of Ca2+, the decays in the apoform correlation function shifted to shorter delay times, indicative of smaller hydrodynamic radii (Fig. 5B, inset). Mass-weighted regularization deconvolution results indicated that the majority of protein in the holosample had a radius of hydration consistent with monomer (i.e. <1.5 nm), whereas the distribution of radii in the aposample was indicative of larger dimeric/oligomeric species (Fig. 5B). The DLS data suggest that Ca2+ can induce the dissociation of oligomeric apoEF-SAM into smaller subunits. Studies have implicated STIM1 as a potent mediator of SOCE and CRAC activity (7Liou J.

It is now thought that STIM2 redistributes with STIM1 to ER-localized aggregates that approach the PM (punctae) for CRAC regulatory purposes (36Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Hewavitharana T. He L.P.

Interactions between STIM1 and transient receptor potential channels (TRPC1) in association with SOCE also have been identified (37Lopez J.J. Salido G.M. Pariente J.A. Rosado J.A. J. Biol.

Much attention has focused over the past two decades on identifying the molecular basis of the participation of oncogenic Ras in tumor initiation and progression. The proximal participation of Ras proteins in the activation of Raf family and PI3K family kinases has been well established together with the mechanistic participation of these Ras effectors in normal and aberrant regulatory networks (Downward, 2003Downward J. Targeting RAS signalling pathways in cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar, Mitin et al., 2005Mitin N. Rossman K.L. Der C.J.

However, activation of RalGTPases has historically been the orphan Ras effector pathway with respect to a functional and mechanistic understanding of its role in Ras signaling and oncogenic transformation (Camonis and White, 2005Camonis J.H.

The RalGTPases, RalA and RalB, are close relatives of the founding members of the Ras GTPase superfamily. They are engaged in response to a broad variety of mitogenic, trophic, and hormonal signals by a diverse group of guanyl nucleotide exchange factors that fall into two major groups: those that are directly Ras-responsive via a carboxyterminal Ras binding domain and those that are apparently mobilized by phosphoinositide second messengers via a carboxyterminal pleckstrin homology domain (Feig, 2003Feig L.A. RalGTPases: approaching their 15 minutes of fame.Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recently, a confluence of observations has exposed a central and critical contribution of RalGTPase activation to the initiation and maintenance of oncogenic transformation. Genetically defined human cell models of tumor progression suggest that RalGTPase activation is an essential component of oncogenic Ras-induced transformation in a broad variety of human epithelial cells and is sufficient to drive tumorigenic phenotypes in some backgrounds (Hamad et al., 2002Hamad N.M.

RNAi-mediated loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that RalA and RalB collaborate to both support enhanced proliferative propensity and restrict cell-death programs (Chien and White, 2003Chien Y. White M.A. RAL GTPases are linchpin modulators of human tumour-cell proliferation and survival.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Finally, genetic ablation of RalGDS, a Ras-responsive guanyl nucleotide exchange factor, reduced the incidence and progression of topical carcinogen-induced dermal papillomas (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2005Gonzalez-Garcia A.

RalGDS is required for tumor formation in a model of skin carcinogenesis.Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 219-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Several candidate and bona fide RalGTP effector proteins have been identified that implicate the participation of these proteins in a bewildering array of dynamic cell biological processes. These include a protein with Rac/CDC42 GAP activity, RalBP1/RLIP, that may participate together with Ral to regulate a subset of endocytic pathways; filamin, a structural protein that may participate in Ral-dependent filopodia formation; and the exocyst subunits Sec5 and Exo84 that mediate Ral regulation of dynamic secretory vesicle targeting and tethering processes (Camonis and White, 2005Camonis J.H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 51743-51748Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Here, we have directly investigated the relative contribution of RalGTPase effector proteins to Ral function in normal and tumorigenic human epithelial cells in order to define the regulatory pathway directly engaged by RalB to support tumor cell survival. Surprisingly, we find that a RalB/Sec5 effector complex specifically supports the prosurvival arm of tumorigenic regulatory networks by directly recruiting and activating the atypical IκB kinase family member TBK1 (Tank binding kinase 1). While this process is physically tethered to the exocyst complex, it may be distinct from the participation of RalB or Sec5 in exocyst assembly or function. We show that TBK1 kinases are chronically activated in a variety of cancer cell lines, are required to maintain cancer cell survival, and are required to support oncogenic Ras-induced transformation. Although dispensable for survival of nontumorigenic human epithelial cells in culture, this pathway helps mount an innate immune response to dsRNA or Sendai virus exposure. Therefore, the RalB/Sec5 effector complex is a component of host defense signaling, acting directly at the level of TBK1 activation. These observations define the direct mechanistic contribution of RalB to oncogenic transformation, expose a central component of the proximal machinery required to engage TBK1 in response to antiviral surveillance systems, and reveal the contribution of components of cell-autonomous innate immune pathways to the generation of a tumorigenic regulatory framework. To define the molecular nature of the RalB effector pathway supporting cancer cell survival, we first carried out an RNAi-based candidate screen of RalGTPase effector proteins. Our expectation was that depletion of the bona fide effector protein supporting this pathway would phenocopy RalB depletion: selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells versus nontumorigenic epithelial cells (Chien and White, 2003Chien Y. White M.A. RAL GTPases are linchpin modulators of human tumour-cell proliferation and survival.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). While depletion of the Ral effectors Exo84 (Moskalenko et al., 2003Moskalenko S. Tong C. Rosse C. Mirey G. Formstecher E. Daviet L. Camonis J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with multiple independent siRNA duplexes induced apoptosis in a variety of human tumor-derived cell lines (Figure 1A). In contrast, Sec5 was not limiting for survival of normal nontumorigenic telomerase-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HME) or bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC; Figure 1A). However, as we previously observed upon depletion of RalB (Chien and White, 2003Chien Y. White M.A. RAL GTPases are linchpin modulators of human tumour-cell proliferation and survival.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), depletion of Sec5 did sensitize HME cells to apoptosis in response to a 16 hr release from matrix association (35% of the population as compared to 9.5% in control groups). We have previously observed that RalA-dependent pathological proliferative pressure is offset by RalB-dependent inhibition of apoptosis (Camonis and White, 2005Camonis J.H. White M.A. RalGTPases: corrupting the exocyst in cancer cells.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 327-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Chien and White, 2003Chien Y. White M.A. RAL GTPases are linchpin modulators of human tumour-cell proliferation and survival.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, we find higher relative amounts of activated RalA and RalB in transformed cell lines relative to related nontumorigenic cell lines (Figure 1D). As a result of this yin-yang relationship, depletion of RalA relieves the dependency of cancer cells on RalB-dependent survival signaling (Chien and White, 2003Chien Y. White M.A. RAL GTPases are linchpin modulators of human tumour-cell proliferation and survival.EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Importantly, depletion of RalA also reduced the sensitivity of tumor cells to loss of Sec5 (Figures 1B and 1C). The observation that Sec5 depletion mimics RalB depletion in multiple backgrounds strongly implicates Sec5 as the immediate downstream effector supporting RalB survival signaling. Sec5 is a member of the heterooctameric Sec6/8 complex, a.k.a. the exocyst, responsible for regulated targeting and tethering of selective secretory vesicles to specialized dynamic plasma membrane domains (Guo et al., 2000Guo W. Sacher M. Barrowman J. Ferro-Novick S. Novick P. Protein complexes in transport vesicle targeting.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 251-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The sum of observations to date suggest that RalGTPases regulate a Sec5-Exo84 assembly interface for dynamic control of exocyst function in mammalian cells (Moskalenko et al., 2002Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. The exocyst is a Ral effector complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, Moskalenko et al., 2003Moskalenko S. Tong C. Rosse C. Mirey G. Formstecher E. Daviet L. Camonis J. White M.A. RalGTPases regulate exocyst assembly through dual subunit interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51743-51748Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The consequences of Sec5 depletion described above imply a role for secretory machinery in the maintenance of cancer cell survival. However, in contrast to Sec5, depletion of the exocyst subunits Sec6 or Exo84 did not impair cell viability (Figure 1E), suggesting that the contribution of Sec5 to cancer cell survival may be in addition to but separate from its role as a component of the exocyst. To generate leads for discovery of the mechanistic basis of Sec5-dependent cancer cell survival, we examined the molecular composition of the exocyst complex in human epithelial cells. The endogenous exocyst was immunoisolated using monoclonal α-Sec8 antibodies that were previously shown to effectively precipitate the full octameric complex (Grindstaff et al., 1998Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Sec6/8 complex is recruited to cell-cell contacts and specifies transport vesicle delivery to the basal-lateral membrane in epithelial cells.Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The proteins in the complex were identified by nano-HPLC electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry following 1D gel chromatography (Zhao et al., 2004aZhao Y. Kwon S.W. Anselmo A. Kaur K. White M.A. Broad spectrum identification of cellular small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) substrate proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20999-21002Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). From each of three independent analyses of complexes recovered from the triton-soluble fraction of cell lysates, we identified the exocyst components Sec8, Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, and Sec10 together with the atypical IκB kinase (IKK) family member TBK1/NAK (Tank binding kinase 1/NFκB activating kinase). The presence of TBK1 in the exocyst complex was validated by immunoblot analysis of α-Sec8 immunoprecipitates (Figure 2A). While TBK1−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts proliferate normally in culture, genetic ablation of TBK1 is embryonic lethal, suggesting TBK1 supports cell survival during development (Bonnard et al., 2000Bonnard M. Mirtsos C. Suzuki S. Graham K. Huang J. Ng M. Itie A. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Henzel W.J. et al.Deficiency of T2K leads to apoptotic liver degeneration and impaired NF-kappaB-dependent gene transcription.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TBK1 has recently been recognized as a central component of the regulatory network supporting host defense responses. TBK1 can directly phosphorylate both the p65 Rel and IRF-3 transcription factors, enhancing their transactivating potential, and is required for IRF-3 activation in response to viral invasion (Buss et al., 2004Buss H. Dorrie A. Schmitz M.L. Hoffmann E. Resch K. Kracht M. Constitutive and interleukin-1-inducible phosphorylation of p65 NF-{kappa}B at serine 536 is mediated by multiple protein kinases including I{kappa}B kinase (IKK)-{alpha}, IKK{beta}, IKK{epsilon}, TRAF family member-associated (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and an unknown kinase and couples p65 to TATA-binding protein-associated factor II31-mediated interleukin-8 transcription.J.

Triggering the interferon antiviral response through an IKK-related pathway.Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, both IRF-3 and its close homolog IRF-7 have been implicated in promotion of oncogenic transformation (Lubyova et al., 2004Lubyova B. Kellum M.J. Frisancho A.J. Pitha P.M. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded vIRF-3 stimulates the transcriptional activity of cellular IRF-3 and IRF-7.J. Biol.

Interferon regulatory factor 7 is associated with Epstein-Barr virus-transformed central nervous system lymphoma and has oncogenic properties.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12987-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Given these relationships, we investigated the possible contribution of TBK1 to RalB/Sec5-dependent survival signaling. In vitro binding assays, using recombinant TBK1 together with individual exocyst subunits produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, identified Sec5 as the TBK1-interacting exocyst subunit (data not shown). This was validated with reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged TBK1 and Sec5 from HEK293 cells (Figure 2B). Truncation analysis identified the amino terminus of Sec5 as minimally sufficient for TBK1 interaction (Figure 2C). This region completely overlaps with the previously defined Ral-binding domain of Sec5 (Sec5rbd, amino acids 1–120) that directly interacts with activated RalGTPases (Moskalenko et al., 2002Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. The exocyst is a Ral effector complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, Sugihara et al., 2002Sugihara K. Asano S. Tanaka K. Iwamatsu A. Okawa K. Ohta Y. The exocyst complex binds the small GTPase RalA to mediate filopodia formation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Sec5rbd also directly interacted with TBK1 in vitro (Figure 2D); however, this interaction is not a common feature among “Ral-binding domains,” as a distinct minimal Ral-binding domain from the candidate Ral effector RalBP1/RLIP did not bind TBK1 (Figure 2D). We examined the potential functional relevance of TBK1/Sec5 complexes through siRNA-mediated loss of function. Mimicking the consequences of RalB or Sec5 deficiency, cells depleted of TBK1 engaged an asynchronous apoptotic program, such that approximately 25% of the population scored positive for apoptotic markers at any one time (Figure 3A) and the majority of the cells were dead by 150 hr posttransfection (Figure 3B). Codepletion of Sec5 together with TBK1 did not appreciably alter the apoptotic response as compared to depletion of either alone, implying action on a common pathway (Figure 3A). Consistent with a functional interaction of TBK1 with RalB and Sec5, this phenotype was rescued by codepletion of RalA (Figure 3C). Finally, like RalB and Sec5, TBK1 is a limiting factor for survival of a variety of tumor-derived cell lines but not nontumorigenic epithelial cells (Figure 3D). The portion of Sec5 participating in both RalGTP and TBK1 binding is an immunoglobulin-like structure similar to the NFκB p50 dimerization domain that falls into the IPT/TIG family of protein domains (Fukai et al., 2003Fukai S. Matern H.T. Jagath J.R. Scheller R.H. Brunger A.T. Structural basis of the interaction between RalA and Sec5, a subunit of the sec6/8 complex.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3267-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Given that GTP-bound RalB and TBK1 directly interact with the same domain in Sec5, we examined the consequences of RalGTPase regulation on the Sec5/TBK1 complex and TBK1 kinase activity. Expression of a “fast exchange” variant of Ral that constitutively activates Ral regulatory pathways in cells without grossly interfering with exocyst function (Moskalenko et al., 2002Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. The exocyst is a Ral effector complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) promoted TBK1 association with endogenous Sec5 (Figure 4A). This indicates that, in contrast to potential steric hindrance, Ral activation drives TBK1/Sec5 complex assembly. Importantly, Ral-induced TBK1/Sec5 complex formation correlated with enhanced TBK1 kinase activity as measured by in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant IRF-3, a direct TBK1 substrate (Fitzgerald et al., 2003Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. IKKepsilon and TBK1 are essential components of the IRF-3 signaling pathway.Nat.

Triggering the interferon antiviral response through an IKK-related pathway.Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar; Figure 4B). Surprisingly, expression of the Sec5rbd, which is minimally sufficient for direct TBK1 interaction, was also sufficient to enhance TBK1 kinase activity. In contrast, expression of full-length Sec5 had no impact on TBK1 activation (Figure 4B). As mentioned above, a direct downstream consequence of TBK1 activation is phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic IRF-3 transcription factor. This modification induces IRF-3 dimerization and nuclear translocation to trigger interferon-response gene-expression programs (Fitzgerald et al., 2003Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L.

Consistent with a RalB/Sec5/TBK1 regulatory cascade, expression of activated Ral in normal human bronchial epithelial cells was sufficient to induce Sec5- and TBK1-dependent nuclear translocation of endogenous IRF-3 (Figure 4C). In further support of this relationship, RalB was sufficient to activate expression of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the IRF-3-responsive Interferon-β (IFN-β) promoter (Figure 4D; Foy et al., 2003Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Regulation of interferon regulatory factor-3 by the hepatitis C virus serine protease.Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In addition, Sendai virus-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter was severely abrogated upon inhibition of endogenous Ral protein function by expression of a dominant interfering RalGTP binding domain from RLIP/RalBP1 (RLIPrbd [Moskalenko et al., 2002Moskalenko S. Henry D.O. Rosse C. Mirey G. Camonis J.H. White M.A. The exocyst is a Ral effector complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar]; Figure 4E). Finally, we found that Sec5/TBK1 complexes accumulate in response to host defense pathway activation by Sendai virus infection (Figure 4F). The differential capacity of Sec5rbd versus full-length Sec5 to induce TBK1 activation, coupled with our previous observations that Sec5 can self-associate (Formstecher et al., 2005Formstecher E. Aresta S. Collura V. Hamburger A. Meil A. Trehin A. Reverdy C. Betin V. Maire S. Brun C. et al.Protein interaction mapping: a Drosophila case study.Genome Res. 2005; 15: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), suggested the possibility that RalB may promote Sec5/TBK1 association and TBK1 activation by relieving autoinhibitory interactions within the Sec5 protein. We found that Sec5 and Sec5rbd interacted robustly in cells and that activated Ral could effectively block this interaction (Figure 5A). In contrast, expression of activated Ral did not detectably modulate the interaction between TBK1 and Sec5rbd (Figure 5B). This suggests that while RalB and TBK1 have independent interaction interfaces on Sec5rbd, RalB can sterically hinder Sec5 self-association. Intriguingly, the Sec5/Sec5rbd interaction was also blocked by expression of TBK1 but in a manner that was dependent on TBK1 kinase activity (Figure 5C). Both wild-type and kinase-dead TBK1 coprecipitated equivalently well with Sec5rbd (Figure 5D), indicating that the capacity of TBK1 to dissociate Sec5/Sec5rbd complexes was not a consequence of competitive interactions. However, TBK1 can directly phosphorylate Sec5rbd (Figure 5E), raising the possibility that TBK1 kinase activity may stabilize an “open conformation” of Sec5—possibly facilitating feedback amplification of TBK1 activation. The cumulative relationships described above suggest a two-step model for Ral-induced TBK1 activation, in which RalB/Sec5 complex formation reveals a cryptic TBK1-interaction domain that recruits TBK1 into a kinase activation complex. Consistent with the capacity of RalB to modulate dynamic TBK1 protein/protein interactions, we found that RalB activation was sufficient to promote the formation of high molecular weight TBK1 complexes, as assessed by size exclusion chromatography that cofractionated with a subpopulation of Sec5 in MDCK cells (Figure 5F). These combined observations indicate a physiologically relevant mechanistic relationship among RalB, Sec5, and TBK1 in which RalB drives TBK1 activation directly through Sec5 to support cancer cell survival. Both genetic and biochemical analysis has firmly positioned TBK1 as a central component of the innate immune response pathways that connect detection of viral invasion to induction of host defense gene expression programs (Balachandran et al., 2004Balachandran S.

Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). Given the observation that RalB can promote TBK1 activation through Sec5, we investigated the contribution of RalB and Sec5 to the TBK1-dependent host defense response. Exposure of telomerase-immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) to polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic mimic of viral dsRNA, resulted in the activation of endogenous RalGTPases within 5–10 min (Figure 6A), suggesting Ral activation is an immediate early response to innate immune signaling triggered by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and/or MDA5 (Alexopoulou et al., 2001Alexopoulou L.

However, the mechanisms by which precursors integrate these signals to make timely fate choices remained undefined. Here we show that direct nuclear signaling by a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibits the responses of precursors to astrocyte differentiation factors while maintaining their neurogenic potential. Upon neuregulin-induced activation and presenilin-dependent cleavage of ErbB4, the receptor's intracellular domain forms a complex with TAB2 and the corepressor N-CoR. This complex undergoes nuclear translocation and binds promoters of astrocytic genes, repressing their expression. Consistent with this observation, astrogenesis occurs precociously in ErbB4 knockout mice. Our studies define how presenilin-dependent nuclear signaling by a receptor tyrosine kinase directly regulates gene transcription and cell fate. This pathway could be of importance for neural stem cell biology and for understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."

Yeast proteasomes contain two deubiquitinating enzymes, Ubp6 and Rpn11. Rpn11 promotes protein breakdown through its degradation-coupled activity. In contrast, we show here that Ubp6 has the capacity to delay the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by the proteasome. However, delay of degradation by Ubp6 does not require its catalytic activity, indicating that Ubp6 has both deubiquitinating activity and proteasome-inhibitory activity. Delay of degradation by Ubp6 appears to provide a time window allowing gradual deubiquitination of the substrate by Ubp6. Rpn11 catalyzes en bloc chain removal, and Ubp6 interferes with degradation at or upstream of this step, so that degradation delay by Ubp6 is accompanied by a switch in the mode of ubiquitin chain processing.

We propose that Ubp6 regulates both the nature and magnitude of proteasome activity. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for intracellular protein degradation in eukaryotes. Substrates of this pathway acquire a covalently linked polyubiquitin chain through the action of a cascade of ubiquitin activating and conjugating enzymes. This ubiquitin chain serves as the recognition motif for a multisubunit protease known as the proteasome, which processively degrades the substrate into polypeptides while releasing ubiquitin for reuse (Pickart and Cohen, 2004Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Proteasomes and their kin: proteases in the machine age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The proteasome is an approximately 2.5 MDa protein complex consisting of at least 33 distinct subunits in yeast (Pickart and Cohen, 2004Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Proteasomes and their kin: proteases in the machine age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Its proteolytic active sites are housed at the center of the structure in a barrel-shaped subcomplex (Groll et al., 1997Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Structure of 20S proteasome from yeast at 2.4 A resolution.Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar) known as the core particle (CP, or 20S complex). At either axial end of the CP, a second subcomplex known as the regulatory particle (RP, or 19S complex or PA700) may bind. The RP comprises two subcomplexes of its own: the base and the lid (Glickman et al., 1998Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. A subcomplex of the proteasome regulatory particle required for ubiquitin-conjugate degradation and related to the COP9-signalosome and eIF3.Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The base is proximal to the CP and contains, among other proteins, six ATPases that are thought to form a ring structure that abuts the CP. The proteasome displays a number of characteristics unusual for a protease. First, its proteolytic active sites are sequestered within the hollow cylindrical chamber of the CP. Providing access to this internal chamber are narrow gates at either end of the CP, and gating appears to be modulated by the Rpt2 subunit of the base (Pickart and Cohen, 2004Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Proteasomes and their kin: proteases in the machine age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). These features presumably serve to prevent the unregulated destruction of intracellular proteins, and also impose a requirement for substrate unfolding, as most folded proteins are too large to pass through the open translocation channel leading to the CP. Protein unfolding is apparently mediated by the six ATPases of the base. Multiple ubiquitin receptors have been identified, some of which are core proteasomal subunits while others are substoichiometric proteasome-associating factors (Elsasser and Finley, 2005Elsasser S. Finley D. Delivery of ubiquitinated substrates to protein-unfolding machines.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). At some point after recognition, the ubiquitin chain is removed from the substrate to facilitate substrate degradation and to minimize degradation of ubiquitin. This function is carried out by deubiquitinating enzymes that reside in the proteasome. In budding yeast S. cerevisiae, at least two deubiquitinating enzymes are thought to contribute to deubiquitination by the proteasome: Rpn11 and Ubp6 (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J.

Rpn11, a metalloprotease, is a core structural component of the lid. Point mutations in its metal-coordinating site impair substrate degradation, indicating a positive role for Rpn11 in protein degradation (Verma et al., 2002Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H.

A cryptic protease couples deubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The second proteasomal deubiquitinating enzyme, Ubp6, has been classified as a proteasome-associated protein, largely on the basis of its ready dissociation from the proteasome in the presence of high salt concentrations (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Loegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Ubp6, a cysteine protease, is an abundant component of proteasomes (Verma et al., 2000Verma R. Chen S.

Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and in contrast to Rpn11, Ubp6 associates with the base. An N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl) of Ubp6 mediates this interaction. Binding of Ubp6 to the proteasome activates Ubp6's catalytic activity over 300-fold (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Loegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), indicating an intimate functional relationship between Ubp6 and the proteasome. However, the precise role of Ubp6 in proteasome function has remained uncertain. Some reports have assigned Ubp6 little or no role in proteasome-mediated deubiquitination or degradation, while others have argued that Ubp6, like Rpn11, facilitates proteasome-mediated degradation. Here, we describe the first detailed analysis of how Ubp6 affects the degradation of a physiological substrate of the proteasome. We report that Ubp6 delays the breakdown of proteins by the proteasome and that a major component of its inhibitory effect is noncatalytic in nature. Negative regulation of degradation by Ubp6 was observed in vivo and in vitro, and on different test substrates. During the degradation delay that Ubp6 imposes, substrate deubiquitination proceeds on proteasomes, but the mode of deubiquitination is altered from that seen in the absence of Ubp6: degradation-linked “en bloc” chain removal by Rpn11 is replaced by progressive deubiquitination by Ubp6. Thus, Ubp6 uses catalytic and noncatalytic mechanisms to modulate proteasome function, and the coordinated activity of multiple proteasomal deubiquitinating enzymes controls substrate fate. To study the potential role of Ubp6 in proteasome function, we developed an in vitro system for proteasome-mediated degradation of a model substrate. Ubiquitination of the short-lived cell cycle regulator cyclin B was achieved via a reaction requiring E1, Ubc4 (E2), immunopurified APC (E3), ubiquitin, and ATP (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of ubiquitinated cyclin B with proteasomes purified from ubp6Δ mutants, we observed that the rate of cyclin B degradation was much greater than that of wild-type proteasomes (Figure 1A). Significantly, the slower degradation of cyclin B exhibited by wild-type proteasomes was accompanied by progressive removal of ubiquitin groups from the substrate. We verified the absence of Ubp6 in proteasomes purified from the ubp6Δ strain (Figure 1B), and that the amounts of proteasome were comparable between the two preparations (Figure 1C). We next sought to determine whether the observed difference in cyclin B degradation was due specifically to Ubp6. We examined proteasomes by Coomassie blue staining (Figure 1D) and native gel electrophoresis (data not shown) and found no evidence for either an unexpected compositional difference or a gross structural abnormality in mutant proteasomes (see also Guterman and Glickman, 2004Guterman A. Glickman M.H. Complementary roles for Rpn11 and Ubp6 in deubiquitination and proteolysis by the proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activity of mutant proteasomes against the peptide substrate suc-LLVY-AMC, which is hydrolyzed in an RP-dependent but ubiquitin-independent manner, was comparable to wild-type (Figure 1E), indicating that delay of cyclin B degradation by Ubp6 was not due to suppression of the core proteolytic activity of the proteasome, nor to closing the gate into the CP. Finally, when bacterially expressed purified Ubp6 was added back to proteasomes lacking Ubp6, we observed a marked delay of cyclin B degradation (Figure 1F), indicating that Ubp6 itself is the inhibitory component of wild-type proteasomes. Inhibition of degradation by recombinant Ubp6 (Figure 1F) was accompanied by progressive deubiquitination, as seen with wild-type proteasomes (Figure 1A). Rpn11 is known to promote deubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (Verma et al., 2002Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Role of Rpn11 metalloprotease in deubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome.Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, Yao and Cohen, 2002Yao T. Cohen R.E. A cryptic protease couples deubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). To verify that Rpn11 was active in our system, we treated ubp6Δ proteasomes with the metal chelator o-phenanthroline (o-PA), an inhibitor of Rpn11. o-PA strongly inhibited deubiquitination and degradation of cyclin B (Figure 1G). In contrast, o-PA treatment had no effect on LLVY-hydrolysis by proteasomes (data not shown). Thus, in contrast to Ubp6, Rpn11 promotes cyclin B degradation. Chemical inhibitors of the proteasome were used to confirm that the rapid disappearance of cyclin B in the absence of Ubp6 represents cyclin B degradation by proteasomes as opposed to a possible unknown component of our samples. For these experiments, we utilized epoxomicin, an inhibitor of the proteolytic active sites of the CP. Epoxomicin preferentially targets the chymotrypsin-like activity of the CP; at high concentrations, such as used here, epoxomicin can inhibit all three proteolytic sites, although complete proteasome inhibition is generally not observed (Kisselev et al., 2006Kisselev A.F. Callard A. Goldberg A.L. Importance of the proteasome's different proteolytic sites and the efficacy of inhibitors varies with the protein substrate.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8582-8590Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The yield of deubiquitinated cyclin B reaction products from ubp6Δ proteasomes after a 10 min incubation was greatly increased by epoxomicin, verifying that disappearance of cyclin B involved proteasome-mediated degradation (Figure 2A). A diminished effect of epoxomicin was observed when the same experiment was carried out using proteasomes containing Ubp6, reflecting a reduced rate of cyclin B breakdown in the absence of epoxomicin (Figure 2A). These Ubp6-dependent differences could be recapitulated by endogenous Ubp6 present in wild-type proteasomes (Figure 2B). The cyclin B used in our in vitro assay may be linked through not only lys-48 (K48) of ubiquitin but also K11 and K63 (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We previously reported that K48 of ubiquitin was not required for in vitro degradation of ub-cyclin B (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We extend those results here with a side-by-side comparison of wild-type and ubp6Δ proteasomes; in both cases, proteasomes deubiquitinate and degrade cyclin B without regard for the presence of K48 ubiquitin linkages in its attached ubiquitin chains (Figure 2C). Thus, although K48-linked ubiquitin chains may be the dominant chain type promoting degradation in vivo, this linkage is not required for rapid proteasomal degradation in vitro. For many substrates, the requirement for K48 in protein degradation may reflect properties of the E3 enzymes involved in chain synthesis. Finally, we noticed that for reactions lacking Ubp6, epoxomicin stabilized, in addition to unmodified cyclin B, a second major species, which is apparently monoubiquitinated cyclin B (Figures 2A–2C). These results suggest that in the absence of Ubp6, while a majority of ub-cyclin B is fully deubiquitinated by Rpn11 prior to degradation, a significant fraction is left incompletely deubiquitinated, and the resulting monoubiquitinated species is apparently rapidly degraded. In vivo, ubiquitin undergoes accelerated degradation by the proteasome in the absence of Ubp6 (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Loegh H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52102-52115Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Figure 5D). We have proposed that when Ubp6 is absent, one or more substrate bound ubiquitin groups are translocated into the CP and degraded along with their substrate (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Loegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), but until now there had been no biochemical basis to account for accelerated ubiquitin turnover. We propose that increased turnover of monoubiquitinated degradative intermediates as suggested by Figure 2 may contribute significantly to the rapid degradation of ubiquitin in vivo in the absence of Ubp6. Our in vitro data predict accelerated degradation of at least some proteasomal substrates in vivo in the absence of Ubp6. To test this idea, we used chromosomal integration to render the biosynthetic enzymes Trp1 and Ura3 unstable by appending an N-terminal segment that directs these proteins to the N-end rule pathway for degradation (Varshavsky, 2005Varshavsky A. Regulated protein degradation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 283-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Accordingly, growth of such strains in the absence of the relevant metabolite should reflect the rate of degradation of the respective reporter protein. Strains harboring proteolytic defects should stabilize the reporters, and thus display increased growth relative to wild-type. Ubr1, the E3 of the N-end rule pathway, governs ubiquitination of the reporter proteins. As expected, the ubr1Δ mutant displays a strong growth advantage over wild-type when cultured on media lacking tryptophan (Figure 3A) or uracil (data not shown). Although such assays have typically been used to characterize degradation defects, we reasoned that if significant growth were detectable in wild-type strains, the assay could also be used to identify mutants with increased degradation rates. Indeed, when ubp6Δ mutants were tested, they displayed a dramatic growth defect relative to wild-type (Figure 3A), consistent with a proteasome hypermorphic effect. Additionally, a ubr1Δ ubp6Δ double mutant retained the robust growth phenotype of the ubr1Δ single mutant, ruling out a protein synthesis defect as the cause of the poor growth of the ubp6Δ strain (data not shown). Ura3 reporter strains that are wild-type for UBP6 showed no growth in the absence of uracil, precluding the corresponding comparison (data not shown). The results from Figure 3A suggested that the reporter proteins were turned over more rapidly in the ubp6Δ strain. To test this idea directly, we conducted cycloheximide-chase analyses in strains harboring both reporter constructs. In the wild-type strain we observed rapid degradation of both reporters, with half-lives on the order of several minutes (Figure 3B). In the ubr1Δ mutant, both reporters were highly stabilized (Figure 3B). In contrast, in the ubp6Δ mutant, the Ura3 reporter disappeared more rapidly than in wild-type, and showed a decreased steady-state level (Figure 3B). Steady-state levels of the Trp1 reporter were also depressed in the ubp6Δ mutant (Figure 3B), falling below the level of detection. The level of a control protein, proteasome subunit Rpn5, remained constant throughout, indicating the specificity of these effects. In addition to N-end Rule substrates, we examined the short-lived transcription factor Gcn4, expressed from its own promoter in untagged form. Again, we observed accelerated degradation in the ubp6Δ mutant, with a concomitant decrease in steady-state levels (Figure 3C). Thus, multiple short-lived proteins are turned over more rapidly in vivo in the absence of Ubp6. To determine which functional elements of Ubp6 are required for degradation delay, we generated and tested a number of Ubp6 mutants (Figure 4A). An N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl) is necessary and sufficient to mediate binding to the proteasome, but is not required for the catalytic activity of purified Ubp6 (Leggett et al., 2002Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Loegh H. Finley D. Multiple associated proteins regulate proteasome structure and function.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Ubl domain rendered Ubp6 noninhibitory in the cyclin B degradation assay (Figure 4B), suggesting that Ubp6 must be bound to the proteasome to inhibit cyclin B degradation. The Ubl domain by itself also had no effect on cyclin B degradation (Figure 4E). Thus, the ability of Ubp6 to delay degradation of cyclin B jointly requires the Ubl and C-terminal domains of the protein. Although efficient degradation of ubiquitin conjugates by the proteasome is thought to require removal of ubiquitin groups prior to translocation of the substrate into the CP, premature removal of ubiquitin chains could result in dissociation of the substrate and antagonize its degradation (Lam et al., 1997Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Editing of ubiquitin conjugates by an isopeptidase in the 26S proteasome.Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Such a scenario could provide a straightforward means by which deubiquitinating activity at the proteasome could inhibit protein breakdown. The joint requirements of the Ubl and C-terminal domains of Ubp6 for inhibiting cyclin B degradation are consistent with this view. However, a catalytically inactive point mutant of Ubp6 (Ubp6-C118A) proved competent for degradation delay (Figure 4B). Thus, Ubp6 does not prevent cyclin B degradation simply through premature deubiquitination. To substantiate this conclusion, we verified that Ubp6-C118A is completely devoid of deubiquitinating activity against the model substrate Ub-AMC (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), but retains wild-type binding affinities for the proteasome (data not shown; Chernova et al., 2003Chernova T.A. Allen K.D. Wesoloski L.M. Shanks J.R. Chernoff Y.O. Wilkinson K.D. Pleiotropic effects of Ubp6 loss on drug sensitivities and yeast prion are due to depletion of the free ubiquitin pool.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52102-52115Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As an alternate approach to assay noncatalytic inhibition, we utilized ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone (Ub-VS), an irreversible active site inhibitor of Ubp6. Although it completely eliminated catalytic activity of wild-type Ubp6 as measured by Ub-AMC hydrolysis, inhibition of cyclin B degradation by Ubp6 persisted (Figure S2). This finding also indicates that degradation delay by Ubp6-C118A cannot be attributed to nonproductive ubiquitin chain binding at the active site of the mutant enzyme. Indeed the large excess of substrate over Ubp6 (see Experimental Procedures) is inconsistent with a model in which Ubp6 delays degradation by sequestering substrate. Taken together, these data show that Ubp6 has two distinct functions, one catalytic and one noncatalytic. Although these functions are distinct, each requires both the Ubl domain and the C-terminal domain. We suggest that the Ubl domain serves in both cases to target Ubp6 to the proteasome, and that both functions are obligatorily executed on the proteasome. Although Ubp6-C118A was, like wild-type Ubp6, competent to delay cyclin B degradation, the fate of cyclin B over the time course of the incubation was affected by the loss of deubiquitinating activity in the mutant enzyme. When wild-type Ubp6 was used for reconstitution, a progressive reduction in electrophoretic mobility of cyclin B immunoreactive material was seen, whereas these mobility shifts were not observed with Ubp6-C118A (Figure 4B). These data imply that the mobility shifts represent trimming of ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains bound to cyclin B, and that the trimming reaction is mediated predominantly or exclusively by the deubiquitinating activity of Ubp6. To quantify the extent of degradation delay by Ubp6, we utilized a recently developed method of quantitative mass spectrometry (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Quantitative analysis of in vitro ubiquitinated cyclin B1 reveals complex chain topology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). After a 20 min incubation, approximately half of the total cyclin B was degraded by ubp6Δ proteasomes (Figure 4C). High molecular weight ubiquitin-cyclin B conjugates were almost completely eliminated by this time, but degradation would not be expected to go to completion because a fraction of the input cyclin B had not been ubiquitinated. Addition of purified Ubp6 or Ubp6-C118A resulted in approximately 70% inhibition of degradation at this time point (Figure 4C), which may underestimate the Ubp6 inhibitory effect, since the course of degradation seemed to be nearing completion in the control sample. The linkage of Rpn11 activity to substrate degradation can be abrogated by proteasome inhibitors, presumably because they act downstream of Rpn11 (Verma et al., 2002Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Role of Rpn11 metalloprotease in deubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome.Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, Yao and Cohen, 2002Yao T. Cohen R.E. A cryptic protease couples deubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Thus, to visualize the activity of Rpn11 on cyclin B, we used proteasome inhibitor treated ubp6Δ proteasomes, as in Figure 2. This figure showed, as described above, that the effect of Ubp6 on cyclin B disappearance is mediated by an altered rate of proteasome-mediated degradation. However, since the results of Figure 4 indicate that the deubiquitination seen during degradation delay is mediated by Ubp6, and not by Rpn11, it appears that Ubp6 inhibits the proteasome at a point in the reaction pathway such that Rpn11-mediated chain removal is prevented. In the presence of epoxomicin, Rpn11 can be seen to cleave substrate-linked chains at or near their base, resulting in the production of a prominent band of unmodified substrate protein (Verma et al., 2002Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J.

A cryptic protease couples deubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar; Figure 2). When we compared the reaction products from wild-type and ubp6Δ proteasomes pretreated with epoxomicin, we observed in ubp6Δ reactions a greater amount of unmodified cyclin B, reflecting substrate deubiquitinated but not degraded by the proteasome (Figures 2A–2C). In the presence of Ubp6, a lesser amount of unmodified cyclin B was stabilized by the inhibitor; instead, the majority of the cyclin B remained as higher molecular weight species, most likely reflecting partial deubiquitination. The increased yield of unmodified cyclin B in the presence of ubp6Δ proteasomes as compared to wild-type indicates that Rpn11-dependent chain removal from substrate is suppressed in the presence of Ubp6. However, it remains unclear whether Ubp6 directly inhibits Rpn11 or some other activi"

In adult skin, quiescent multipotent progenitors express Tcf3 and commit to a hair cell fate in response to Wnt signaling. We find that embryonic skin progenitors also express Tcf3. Using an inducible system in mice, we show that upon Tcf3 reactivation, committed epidermal cells induce genes associated with an undifferentiated, Wnt-inhibited state and Tcf3 promotes a transcriptional program shared by embryonic and postnatal SCs. Further, Tcf3-repressed genes include transcriptional regulators of the epidermal, sebaceous gland and hair follicle differentiation programs, and correspondingly, all three terminal differentiation pathways are suppressed when Tcf3 is induced postnatally. These data suggest that in the absence of Wnt signals, Tcf3 may function in skin SCs to maintain an undifferentiated state and, through Wnt signaling, directs these cells along the hair lineage.

In response to Wnt signaling, β-catenin is stabilized and can associate with the Tcf/Lef1 family of DNA binding proteins to transactivate downstream target genes. Increasing evidence underscores a major role for Wnt signaling in stem cell (SC) biology (Reya and Clevers, 2005Reya T. Clevers H. Wnt signalling in stem cells and cancer.Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (2856) Google Scholar). Loss of function studies in the mouse intestine show that Tcf4 is essential for establishing epithelial crypts (Korinek et al., 1998Korinek V. Barker N. Moerer P. van Donselaar E. Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Depletion of epithelial stem-cell compartments in the small intestine of mice lacking Tcf-4.Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar), and gain-of-function studies suggest that Tcf4 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling act in concert to maintain the progenitor pool and inhibit differentiation (van de Wetering et al., 2002van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D.

Similarly, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is active in the progenitor cells of the hippocampus (Lie et al., 2005Lie D.C. Colamarino S.A. Song H.J. Desire L. Mira H. Consiglio A. Lein E.S. Jessberger S. Lansford H. Dearie A.R. Gage F.H. Wnt signalling regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis.Nature. 2005; 437: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). In vitro, Wnt signaling expands the pools of hematopoietic SCs (Willert et al., 2003Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates J.R. Nusse R. Wnt proteins are lipid-modified and can act as stem cell growth factors.Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). While Tcfs/β-catenin signaling is important in progenitor proliferation, it is also used by SCs to specify certain lineages at the expense of others. In skin, β-catenin/Lef1 signaling promotes hair-shaft differentiation, and, at excessive levels, tumors of this cell lineage arise (Gat et al., 1998Gat U. DasGupta R. Degenstein L. Fuchs E.

Analogously, elevated Wnt signaling instructs neural SCs to adopt a sensory neuronal fate (Lee et al., 2004Lee H.-Y. Kleber M. Hari L. Brault V. Suter U. Taketo M.M. Kemler R. Sommer L. Instructive role of Wnt/{beta}-catenin in sensory fate specification in neural crest stem cells.Science. 2004; 303: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), coaxes skeletal progenitors toward osteoblast rather than chondrocyte differentiation (Day et al., 2005Day T.F. Guo X. Garrett-Beal L. Yang Y. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mesenchymal progenitors controls osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation during vertebrate skeletogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar), and promotes Paneth cell differentiation in the intestine (van Es et al., 2005van Es J.H. Jay P.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Whether SCs proliferate or differentiate in response to Wnt signaling is likely to depend upon factors that influence the levels and activities of Tcf/Lef1/β-catenin complexes and their associated proteins. Despite the well-established link between Wnt signaling and SC biology, however, little is known about the functional significance and the underlying mechanisms involved in this link. Whether Lef1/Tcf proteins function in SCs in the absence of Wnt signaling is even less clear, although some evidence suggests that they can do so in other situations (Brannon et al., 1999Brannon M.

Beta-catenin directly displaces Groucho/TLE repressors from Tcf/Lef in Wnt-mediated transcription activation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, for example, interaction of dTcf with the Groucho/TLE family of transcriptional repressors antagonizes Wnt/Wingless signaling (Cavallo et al., 1998Cavallo R.A. Cox R.T. Moline M.M. Roose J. Polevoy G.A. Clevers H. Peifer M. Bejsovec A. Drosophila Tcf and Groucho interact to repress Wingless signalling activity.Nature. 1998; 395: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Similarly, forced Groucho/TLE expression in Xenopus embryos can block activation of β-catenin target genes necessary for axis formation (Roose et al., 1998Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. The Xenopus Wnt effector XTcf-3 interacts with Groucho-related transcriptional repressors.Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In mammalian cell lines, Lef1 has been shown to occupy a site in the c-Myc enhancer that is accompanied by TLE and five other chromatin repressor proteins, while stabilization of β-catenin displaces the TLE/chromatin repressor complex and recruits chromatin activators without displacing Lef1 (Sierra et al., 2006Sierra J. Yoshida T. Joazeiro C.A. Jones K.A. The APC tumor suppressor counteracts β-catenin activation and H3K4 methylation at Wnt target genes.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that in the absence of stabilized β-catenin, Lef1/Tcfs may be functionally important in regulating gene expression. Consistent with this notion are gene-targeting studies on Tcf3, a Lef1/Tcf family member that has been increasingly viewed as a transcriptional repressor. In mice, Tcf3 ablation results in gastrulation defects that resemble a Wnt gain-of-function phenotype (Merrill et al., 2004Merrill B.J. Pasolli H.A. Polak L. Rendl M. Garcia-Garcia M.J. Anderson K.V. Fuchs E. Tcf3: a transcriptional regulator of axis induction in the early embryo.Development. 2004; 131: 263274Google Scholar), and the headless phenotype displayed by Tcf3-deficient zebrafish is complemented by an N-terminally truncated Tcf3 lacking its β-catenin binding domain (Kim et al., 2000Kim C.H. Oda T. Itoh M. Jiang D. Artinger K.B. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Driever W. Chitnis A.B. Repressor activity of Headless/Tcf3 is essential for vertebrate head formation.Nature. 2000; 407: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In adult skin, Tcf3 is naturally expressed in the hair-follicle bulge, which is thought to be a niche for the multipotent stem cells that are required for hair cycling and epidermal wound repair (Cotsarelis et al., 1990Cotsarelis G. Sun T.T. Lavker R.M.

Gat U. DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Tcf3 and Lef1 regulate lineage differentiation of multipotent stem cells in skin.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1688-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In contrast to many SC niches, the bulge maintains a sizeable pool of infrequently cycling cells, which become activated at the start of each hair growth phase. At this time, the new hair germ appears at the base of the bulge and shows Wnt reporter gene (TOPGAL) activity and nuclear β-catenin (DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Multiple roles for activated LEF/TCF transcription complexes during hair follicle development and differentiation.Development. 1999; 126: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Merrill et al., 2001Merrill B.J.

When levels of stabilized β-catenin are genetically elevated, SC activation and hair growth occur precociously (Gat et al., 1998Gat U. DasGupta R. Degenstein L. Fuchs E.

Blanpain C. Nowak J.A. Guasch G. Lewis L. Fuchs E. Defining the impact of beta-catenin/Tcf transactivation on epithelial stem cells.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1596-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested that Tcf3 might repress proliferation in the bulge and that Wnt signaling acts to stimulate SC activation. During the growth phase of the hair cycle, Tcf3 is expressed not only in the quiescent bulge SCs but also in the outer basal layer of the newly formed outer root sheath (ORS) (DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Multiple roles for activated LEF/TCF transcription complexes during hair follicle development and differentiation.Development. 1999; 126: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells are thought to represent mobilized SCs on route to the base of the hair follicle (Oshima et al., 2001Oshima H. Rochat A. Kedzia C. Kobayashi K. Barrandon Y.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1340-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). An ORS/bulge morphology can be achieved by expressing Tcf3 in the epidermis of transgenic mice, suggesting that Tcf3 may specify some of these characteristics (Merrill et al., 2001Merrill B.J. Gat U. DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Tcf3 and Lef1 regulate lineage differentiation of multipotent stem cells in skin.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1688-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same phenotype can be obtained by expressing ΔNTcf3 lacking the β-catenin interacting domain, suggesting that Tcf3 might function independently of Wnt signaling in determining these features (Merrill et al., 2001Merrill B.J. Gat U. DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Tcf3 and Lef1 regulate lineage differentiation of multipotent stem cells in skin.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1688-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The questions of whether and how Tcf3 functions to regulate gene expression in follicle SCs reside at the nexus of defining the physiological importance of Tcfs and Wnt signaling in SC and cell lineage determination. To resolve this issue, we first showed that Tcf3 is expressed in early embryonic skin, which is composed of multipotent progenitors, and that it is downregulated concomitant with fate specification. We then engineered mice that enable us to control the expression of Tcf3 and either sustain it embryonically or switch it back on postnatally. We then conducted microarray profilings and molecular analyses, which reveal Tcf3 as a key transcriptional regulator of both embryonic and adult skin progenitors. We show that, surprisingly, Tcf3 temporally represses transcriptional regulators of epidermal and sebaceous gland differentiation, two lineages not known to be regulated by Wnt signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that when the Tcf3 signature is applied to postnatal epidermis in vivo, all three programs of terminal differentiation are repressed and the epithelium transforms into a relatively undifferentiated state that resembles that of stem cells. If Tcf3 is truly an indicator of progenitor status in the skin, it should be expressed not only in adult bulge SCs but also in unspecified embryonic epidermis. To test this possibility, we used a monospecific Tcf3 antibody (Merrill et al., 2001Merrill B.J. Gat U. DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Tcf3 and Lef1 regulate lineage differentiation of multipotent stem cells in skin.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1688-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and examined E13.5 epidermis, which exists as a single layer of multipotent progenitor cells that express the keratinocyte-specific marker keratin 5 (K5). Anti-Tcf3 localized to the nuclei of these progenitors, which colabeled with antibodies against proliferating nuclear antigen, Ki67 (Figures 1A and 1B). This contrasted with the inverse relation observed between Tcf3 and Ki67 in the bulge (DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Multiple roles for activated LEF/TCF transcription complexes during hair follicle development and differentiation.Development. 1999; 126: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L. Fuchs E. Self-renewal, multipotency, and the existence of two cell populations within an epithelial stem cell niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). As development proceeded, Tcf3 progressively waned, and by P1, it was no longer detected in the epidermal basal layer. In developing hair follicles, Tcf3 was first detected in a small cluster of cells located in the ORS (Figure 1A, brackets). This site coincided with the base of strong anti-β4 integrin staining, i.e., below the site at which the sebaceous gland will bud, at or shortly after birth. Notably, this position also corresponded to the future site of the follicle bulge, a multipotent SC reservoir in postnatal skin (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L. Fuchs E. Self-renewal, multipotency, and the existence of two cell populations within an epithelial stem cell niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). This intriguing finding suggested that the adult SC compartment is established early, at a time when the progenitor cells in the basal layer of the epidermis become more restricted and cease de novo hair follicle morphogenesis. Postnatally, the zone of Tcf3(+) cells in anagen-phase follicles expanded downward along the ORS (Figure 1C, P1–P5). Many but not all of these Tcf3(+) cells were Ki67(−). Conversely, most Ki67(+) cells in the follicle were Tcf3(−). This was especially true for the Mx cells at the base of the follicle. Figure 1D summarizes the expression data. When taken together with our prior studies in postnatal skin (DasGupta and Fuchs, 1999DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Multiple roles for activated LEF/TCF transcription complexes during hair follicle development and differentiation.Development. 1999; 126: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Merrill et al., 2001Merrill B.J.

Tcf3 and Lef1 regulate lineage differentiation of multipotent stem cells in skin.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1688-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), these findings support the view that Tcf3 is expressed in skin progenitor cells, whether they are embryonic and proliferative or postnatal and quiescent. To understand Tcf3's role in epidermal progenitor cells, we first needed to identify the genes that are affected by its expression. To this end, we devised a strategy to control Tcf3 levels in postnatal basal epidermal cells that are committed and have turned off endogenous Tcf3 expression. We began by engineering ten founder mice to express the tetracycline-sensitive transactivator, rtTA2S-M2-VP16 (rtTA), under the control of the keratin 14 (K14) promoter active in embryonic and postnatal basal cells (Vasioukhin et al., 1999Vasioukhin V.

Tetracycline-dependent gene regulation: combinations of transregulators yield a variety of expression windows.Biotechniques. 2002; 32 (798, 800): 796PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). The most tightly regulated transactivator mouse was then mated to a second line engineered to express Tcf3 under the control of a tetracycline regulatory element (TRE). To distinguish transgenic from endogenous Tcf3, we used an amino terminal C-myc epitope tag, previously shown not to interfere with Tcf3 function in vivo (Merrill et al., 2001Merrill B.J. Gat U. DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Tcf3 and Lef1 regulate lineage differentiation of multipotent stem cells in skin.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1688-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Mice doubly transgenic for K14-rtTA and TRE-mycTcf3 exhibited strict tetracycline (doxycycline, Dox)-mediated regulation of mycTcf3 (Figure 2B). Within 3 hr after Dox injection, mice expressed Tcf3 throughout the epidermis, follicle ORS, and sebaceous glands, and by 24 hr, expression was maximal. Soon after (∼48 hr), phenotypic changes began to appear, which are addressed below. By immunofluorescence, induced Tcf3 levels in the basal layer appeared to reach a maximum by ∼10–12 hr following Dox administration. To quantify the induction levels, we FACS-purified basal cells from embryonic, Tcf3-uninduced, and Tcf3-induced (10 hr) neonatal epidermis and performed immunoblot analyses on equal numbers of basal cells. As shown in Figure 2C, the overall levels of induced Tcf3 rose to three to four times the endogenous levels found in embryonic epidermis. Moreover, the Tcf3 protein generated by transgene expression was of the expected size. Primary epidermal keratinocytes (MK) cultured from these mice showed similar kinetics of induction, following addition of Dox to the medium (Figure 2D). By immunoblot analyses, Tcf3 was not detected in uninduced MK, but within 3 hr after induction, the protein was readily detected (Figure 2E). To identify the genes affected by Tcf3, we performed microarray analyses on isolated epidermal mRNAs purified from mice that were injected with Dox for 6, 12, and 24 hr. One hundred and fifty genes scored as ≥2× up- or downregulated within 6 hr after Dox induction of Tcf3 expression, and by 12–24 hr, this number rose to ∼300 genes (Figure 2F). Table S1 provides comprehensive lists of the ≥2× up- and downregulated probesets. Table 1 lists Tcf3-affected genes which were analyzed further. Since gene repression must overcome endogenous levels of mRNAs which vary in stabilities, we also included a few genes known to be relevant to skin epithelial lineages but whose probesets scored as only 1.9× downregulated.Table 1Genes Induced or Suppressed following Tcf3 InductionmRNAs Induced by Tcf3Acy3(7.5), Air(2.1), Ak1(2.5), Angptl4(7.5)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Apeg1(2.8), Bcl2l11(2.1), Bcor(2.3), Bmp6(3)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Bmf(2.1)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Cdkn1c-p57(3.7), Cldn7(8), Cldn3(2), Cspg4(2), Ctsz(2.5), Edn2(4)#Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Fgf11(2.8), Hic2(3), Igfbp6(2), Insl6(2.5), Klf9(2) #Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Krt2-8(11.3), Krt1-16 (7), Krt1-18 (4.6), Krt2-7(3.2), Krt2-17(26), Lcn2(8.6), Ndrg1(2.1), Npdc1(2.6), P2rx4(2.1), Pcbp4(2.1), Ptger1(6.5), Ptprs(2), Rhoc(3.2), Slc2a6(13), Smarcd3 (2.3), Snai3(2.3), Sncg(2), Tbx1(2.1)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Tcfcp2l1(2.3), Tle6(2.3)#Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Zdhhc2(7)mRNAs Repressed by Tcf3Lipid Metabolism/Epidermal Barrier FormationAcsl1(2.1), Acsl4(2.1), Adh7(2.1), Akr1d1(4), Alox12(2.3), Alox12e(2.5), Edg8(2.3), Elov5(1.9), Elovl6(2.5)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Faah(1.9)#Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Fa2h(5.7)#Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Galnt7(2.5), Gal3st1(2), Ipmk(2), Itpr2(2.1), Lpl(2.1)#Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Lrp4(2.5), Mgll(2.1)#Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Mlstd1(4.6), Mrc2(5.7), Palmd(2.3), Pank1(2.3), Panx3 (5.3), Pctp(3), Pld1(2), Pla2g4a(2.1)#Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Pnpla5(2.1), Ptgs1(3)#Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Satb1(2)&Denotes genes with conserved TCF binding motifs within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Soat1(2.6)#Denotes genes with conserved PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Ugt1a2(2.1)Transcription/Nuclear FactorsKlf5(1.9)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Mlze(3.5)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Peli1(2.5), PPARγ(4)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Pou3f1(2), Satb1(2)&Denotes genes with conserved TCF binding motifs within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Trp63(2.8)Wnt Signaling/TargetsAxin2(2.1)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Ccnd2(1.9)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Dkkl1(2.5), Scube2(2.6), Sostdc1(5.3)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site., Tnfrsf19(1.9)Adhesion/MigrationCol8a1(2.1), Daf1(2.3), Leprel1(2.5), Mmp2(2.1)∗Denotes genes with conserved TCF and PPAR binding sites within 10 kb of the transcription initiation site.

https://openalex.org/W2114708447,"The nuclear p68 RNA helicase (referred to as p68) is a prototypical member of the DEAD box family of RNA helicases. The protein plays a very important role in early organ development. In the present study, we characterized the tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 under platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation. We demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of p68 at Y593 mediated PDGF-stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We showed that PDGF treatment led to phosphorylation of p68 at Y593 in the cell nucleus. The Y593-phosphorylated p68 (referred to as phosphor-p68) promotes β-catenin nuclear translocation via a Wnt-independent pathway. The phosphor-p68 facilitates β-catenin nuclear translocation by blocking phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β and displacing Axin from β-catenin. The β-catenin nuclear translocation and subsequent interaction with the LEF/TCF was required for the EMT process. These data demonstrated a novel mechanism of phosphor-p68 in mediating the growth factor-induced EMT and uncovered a new pathway to promote β-catenin nuclear translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2027639590,"Clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) are generally considered a uniform population of endocytic machines containing mixed constitutive and regulated membrane cargo. Contrary to this view, we show that regulated endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) occurs preferentially through a subset of CCPs. Significantly, GPCR-containing CCPs are also functionally distinct, as their surface residence time is regulated locally by GPCR cargo via PDZ-dependent linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. Such cargo-regulated CCPs show delayed recruitment of dynamin and can undergo an abortive event in which clathrin coats separate from the plasma membrane without concomitant receptor endocytosis.

As these studies relied primarily on analysis of biochemical preparations or fixed specimens, which essentially provide snapshots of a highly dynamic process, it is not possible to exclude the alternative possibility that compositional heterogeneity simply reflects differing rates of cargo recruitment to an otherwise uniform CCP population. If CCP subsets truly differ in cargo composition, the critical question is whether they also differ in functional properties. If so, are functional differences intrinsic to the CCPs themselves, implying the need for a secondary sorting mechanism segregating cargo between pre-existing CCP subsets, or are they dictated by the membrane cargo contained therein? We addressed these questions using TIR-FM to examine the dynamics of individual GPCR-containing CCPs in living cells. By visualizing individual CCPs over their entire lifetimes, we establish that endocytosis of GPCR-arrestin complexes occurs preferentially by a subset of CCPs. Further, coated pit subsets differ in functional properties imposed locally by the presence of the GPCR cargo itself, suggesting a kinetic mechanism to specialize the early endocytic pathway and reduce competition between distinct membrane cargos. To focus on the role of PDZ interactions in regulating GPCR endocytosis, we first asked if the PDZ ligand derived from the β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) was sufficient to modulate endocytosis of a distinct GPCR that does not bind PDZ proteins. This ligand, which is well-characterized biochemically (He et al., 2006He J. Bellini M. Inuzuka H. Xu J. Xiong Y. Yang X. Castleberry A.M. Hall R.A. Proteomic analysis of beta1-adrenergic receptor interactions with PDZ scaffold proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2820-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), modulates β1AR endocytosis in transfected HEK293 cells and in cardiomyocytes that naturally express this GPCR (Xiang et al., 2002Xiang Y. Devic E. Kobilka B. The PDZ binding motif of the beta 1 adrenergic receptor modulates receptor trafficking and signaling in cardiac myocytes.J. Biol.

Differential regulation of receptor internalization by MAGI-2 and PSD-95.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41310-41317Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fusion of the β1AR PDZ ligand to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the ∂-opioid receptor confers PDZ binding to the resulting chimeric receptor (termed db1) (Gage et al., 2005Gage R.M. Matveeva E.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 3305-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Addition of an alanine residue at the C terminus of db1, which abolishes PDZ binding (Gage et al., 2005Gage R.M. Matveeva E.A. Whiteheart S.W. von Zastrow M. Type I PDZ ligands are sufficient to promote rapid recycling of G Protein-coupled receptors independent of binding to N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor.J. Biol.

Agonist-induced internalization of FLAG-tagged receptors was observed by live TIR-FM imaging in HEK293 cells after labeling using an antibody that does not perturb regulated endocytosis or recycling (Cao et al., 1998Cao T.C. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. Regulated endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors by a biochemically and functionally distinct subpopulation of clathrin-coated pits.J. Biol.

Cells with comparable surface expression of receptors were chosen for imaging and analysis, as confirmed by estimating the average initial surface fluorescence values of the cells expressing each receptor (Figures 1A and 1B). Agonist addition resulted in rapid internalization of both db1 and ala receptors, seen as a decrease in surface fluorescence (Figure 1A). After 15 min of agonist treatment, ∼68% of db1 remained on the plasma membrane, while only ∼20% of surface ala remained (Figures 1A and 1C). As expected for first-order kinetics of internalization, the surface receptor fluorescence showed an exponential decrease (R2 = 0.9811 for db1 and 0.9967 for ala) over the 15 min of agonist treatment (Figure 1D). As db1 recycles more robustly than ala, due to its ability to interact with PDZ domain-containing proteins (Gage et al., 2005Gage R.M. Matveeva E.A. Whiteheart S.W. von Zastrow M. Type I PDZ ligands are sufficient to promote rapid recycling of G Protein-coupled receptors independent of binding to N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3305-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), enhanced recycling of db1 might contribute to the observed difference in internalization kinetics. To address this, initial endocytic rates were estimated by measuring the decrease in surface receptor fluorescence at 3 s intervals over the initial 150 s after agonist addition. Importantly, surface fluorescence values of db1-expressing cells diverged significantly from those expressing ala by 27 s after agonist treatment (Figure 1E), when recycling is negligible. Exponential curve fits of the initial 50 time points indicated that db1 was internalized with a half-life of ∼156 s (R2 = 0.988), compared to ∼52 s for ala (R2 = 0.991), revealing a 3-fold reduction in average receptor endocytic rate. We next sought to identify the step at which PDZ-domain interactions inhibit internalization of db1. Cells coexpressing low levels of arrestin-3 (β-arrestin-2) fused to GFP (Barak et al., 1997Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. A beta-arrestin/green fluorescent protein biosensor for detecting G protein-coupled receptor activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and either db1 or ala were imaged to visualize early events of receptor-arrestin clustering in the plasma membrane. Pronounced clustering of both receptors occurred rapidly after agonist addition and coincided with the appearance of arrestin in the same clusters with virtually complete colocalization (Figures 2A and 2B). Importantly, the average times required for the initial appearance of surface receptor-arrestin clusters did not differ significantly between db1 and ala (Figure 2C) and were far shorter than the t1/2 for endocytosis of either receptor (Figure 1E). Thus, PDZ interactions do not detectably impair GPCR-arrestin complex formation or clustering. Even if a small effect on the lateral clustering rate was missed, such an effect could not explain the observed difference in GPCR endocytic rates. Similarly, cells coexpressing clathrin-GFP and either GPCR were imaged to assess the effect of PDZ interactions on GPCR accumulation in CCPs. Agonist-induced clustering of both GPCRs occurred rapidly in previously formed clathrin spots (Figure S1A), consistent with receptor recruitment into pre-existing CCPs (Santini et al., 2002Santini F.

Although all GPCR clusters colocalized with CCPs labeled by clathrin-GFP, both GPCRs concentrated preferentially in a subset of CCPs (Figure 2D). For either db1 or ala, the fraction of CCPs containing detectable amounts of the activated GPCR was ∼40% of the total (Figure 2E, db1 and ala), comparable to previous results from fixed cells (Cao et al., 1998Cao T.C. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. Regulated endocytosis of G protein-coupled receptors by a biochemically and functionally distinct subpopulation of clathrin-coated pits.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Importantly, examination of individual CCPs in time-lapse movies verified that this segregation was maintained over their entire lifetime, from initial formation to endocytic scission (Figure S1B). This confirms, in live cells, the existence of CCP subsets differing in GPCR content. Strikingly, overexpression of arrestin with either receptor greatly increased colocalization with clathrin (Figure 2E), suggesting that selective concentration of GPCR-arrestin complexes in CCP subsets is a saturable phenomenon limited by the endocytic adaptor arrestin. At the ultrastructural level, in cells expressing endogenous arrestins, only ∼33% of all observed coated pit profiles contained gold-labeled db1 (Figure 2F), consistent with the existence of CCP subsets. Together, these results indicate that both db1 and ala undergo rapid agonist-induced concentration in a subset of CCPs. The PDZ-dependent endocytic delay of db1 thus cannot be explained by kinetic effects on receptor-arrestin complex formation or lateral redistribution into CCPs. Cells coexpressing arrestin-GFP together with tagged GPCRs were imaged to directly visualize events in regulated receptor endocytosis. Agonist-induced receptor-arrestin clusters were relatively immobile on the plasma membrane until endocytosis, characterized by an abrupt change in mobility leading to one of three events. The first involved rapid disappearance of the cluster (Figures 3A and 3B, top row), consistent with a vesicular scission event allowing rapid movement of GPCR-arrestin complexes out of the TIR-FM illumination field, prior to or concomitant with arrestin dissociation. A second type of event involved a sudden lateral shift of the cluster, which coincided with, or was closely followed by, disappearance of arrestin but not the GPCR (Figures 3A and 3B, middle row). This was interpreted as endocytic scission of the receptor-arrestin complex, followed immediately by the dissociation of arrestin before the receptor-containing vesicle moved out of the TIR-FM field. Supporting this, the receptor spot showed high mobility after loss of arrestin, with both apparent Brownian motion and larger translocation steps characteristic of peripheral endocytic vesicles (Figure 3B). A third type of event was characterized by a receptor-containing spot, devoid of arrestin, abruptly budding from a receptor-arrestin cluster and gaining high mobility (Figures 3A and 3B, bottom row). Notably, in all these events, receptor endocytosis clearly coincided with loss of arrestin fluorescence (also see Movie S1). Hence, disappearance of arrestin was used as a convenient and reliable visual index of endocytic scission. Kymographs of arrestin fluorescence confirmed rapid appearance of arrestin clusters after agonist addition in cells coexpressing either receptor. In cells coexpressing ala, arrestin clusters disappeared fast, with virtually no residual clusters observed by TIR-FM within 1 min after agonist addition. In contrast, arrestin clusters persisted throughout the duration of the imaging period in cells coexpressing db1 (Figure 3C), indicating a significant PDZ-dependent delay in internalization. To exclude potential confounding effects of receptor recycling and re-endocytosis (Tsao and von Zastrow, 2000Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. Type-specific sorting of G protein-coupled receptors after endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), surface residence times of individual arrestin clusters (from initial formation to disappearance from the TIR-FM field) were calculated from the time-lapse series. The average residence time of arrestin clusters in cells expressing db1 (representing coated pits containing db1-arrestin complexes) was about 3-fold longer than that of ala-arrestin clusters (Figure 3D). Similar results were obtained by analysis of receptor clusters (not shown), confirming that PDZ interaction is sufficient to significantly prolong the surface residence times of db1-arrestin complexes. To assess the generality and relevance to a GPCR that naturally contains a PDZ ligand, we analyzed the human β2-adrenergic receptor (termed hß2) that harbors a C-terminal PDZ ligand distinct from that found in the β1AR (Hall et al., 1998Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 2820-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Addition of an HA epitope to this sequence (termed hß2HA) abolishes PDZ binding (Cao et al., 1999Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. A kinase-regulated PDZ-domain interaction controls endocytic sorting of the beta2-adrenergic receptor.Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and yielded a control receptor. Similar to the ∂-opioid chimeras, hß2 clustered rapidly upon agonist addition and concentrated in a subset of CCPs (not shown). Strikingly, the average residence time of arrestin clusters in cells expressing hß2 was comparable to that in db1-expressing cells, and was significantly longer than that observed in cells expressing hß2HA (Figure 3D). Most arrestin clusters were internalized within 90 s of their formation in cells expressing either ala or hß2HA, while >90 s was required in cells expressing db1 or hß2 (Figure 3E). When cumulative frequencies of surface lifetimes were plotted, the curves for the PDZ binding receptors (db1 and hß2) were right-shifted compared to receptors that do not bind PDZ proteins (ala and hß2HA), indicating a delay in their internalization (Figure 3F). Curve fits further confirmed this effect. The t1/2 for endocytosis in cells expressing ala or hß2HA were 47 s (R2 = 0.9828) or 54 s (R2 = 0.9705), whereas the t1/2 in cells expressing db1 or hß2 were about 3-fold higher at 152 s (R2 = 0.9948) or 124 s (R2 = 0.987), respectively (Figure 3F). To further verify that longer-lasting clusters observed in the case of PDZ binding receptors represented arrested CCPs, we tested whether labeled receptors in these clusters were accessible from the cell surface. To do this, we took advantage of the strict Ca2+ dependence of M1 antibody binding to the FLAG epitope. Cells coexpressing db1 and arrestin-GFP were surface labeled with fluorescent M1 anti-FLAG in the presence of ∼1 mM Ca2+, which is sufficient for M1 binding. After agonist-induced clustering of receptor-arrestin complexes, chelation of extracellular Ca2+ by addition of EDTA to the culture medium produced a rapid and complete loss of receptor labeling in all receptor spots identifiable as surface clusters, while arrestin fluorescence remained unchanged (Figure 2G, Movie S2). In contrast, the small fraction of receptor spots that were highly mobile, indicative of internalized vesicles or peripheral endosomes in the TIR-FM field, did not lose their antibody labeling. This confirms that the longer-lasting GPCR clusters visualized by TIR-FM truly represent surface-accessible CCPs. Altogether, our results indicate that PDZ interactions of clustered receptors are necessary and sufficient to specifically prolong the lifetimes of GPCR clusters in CCPs to a degree that is consistent with the observed differences in receptor endocytic rates. This effect does not require G protein coupling to receptors, as a similar 3-fold delay was observed for endocytosis of db1-arrestin clusters even when Gi was inactivated using pertussis toxin (Figure 3H). As GPCRs segregate nonuniformly among CCPs, we first examined whether the delay in db1 endocytosis was a result of db1 clustering in a pre-existing subset of long-lasting CCPs. To test this, CCP dynamics were visualized in the absence of clustered GPCRs, using clathrin-GFP. Consistent with previous reports (Ehrlich et al., 2004Ehrlich M. Boll W. Van Oijen A. Hariharan R.

Cell. 2005; 16: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), three modes of endocytosis were observed: rapid disappearance of clathrin fluorescence, disappearance of spots followed by their immediate reappearance or “blinking,” and splitting/budding of spots (Figure 4A). The lifetimes of 416 CCPs, from their appearance to endocytic scission, were calculated and binned into 18 s bins. The majority of CCPs internalized between 18 and 36 s after formation (Figure 4B), comparable to what was observed with ala clusters (not shown), suggesting that the “default” kinetics of CCP endocytosis is not affected by non-PDZ binding GPCRs. Importantly, a cumulative graph of the lifetimes fit to a monophasic distribution (Figure 4C), where almost all CCPs were internalized within 60 s after their appearance. Thus, long-lived CCPs do not exist in the absence of clustered receptors, ruling out the possibility that db1 is sorted into a pre-existing subset of long-lasting CCPs. To investigate the alternative hypothesis that PDZ-interacting receptors alter the dynamics of CCPs, we tested whether the dynamics of CCPs changed after agonist-induced clustering of db1. The surface lifetimes of individual CCPs were measured in the same cells before agonist addition and after agonist-induced clustering of receptor-arrestin complexes. Cumulative graphs showed a pronounced effect of agonist on CCP lifetimes in cells expressing db1, in contrast to control cells expressing ala (Figure 4D). When binned, CCP surface lifetimes in cells expressing ala fit to a single Gaussian distribution that was not affected by agonist addition, with <5% outside the normal distribution in either case (Figures 4E and 4G). CCP lifetimes fit to a nearly identical distribution in cells expressing db1 imaged prior to agonist addition. After agonist addition, however, ∼35% CCPs moved outside the Gaussian distribution due to prolonged surface residence (Figures 4F and 4G), comparable to the fraction of CCPs containing activated receptors. This indicates that PDZ-interacting GPCRs locally alter the dynamics of the CCP subset containing concentrated receptors. Interestingly, the residual values representing this prolonged CCP subset fit to a normal distribution around a higher mean of ∼72 s (Figure 4G). This argues against a simple first-order process prolonging surface lifetimes of PDZ-interacting CCPs (which would produce a near-exponential residual plot) and suggests, instead, that the PDZ-delayed CCP subset is subject to a distinct endocytic timing mechanism (see below). A potential caveat is that multiple CCPs may cluster within the resolution limit of our optical system in response to GPCR activation (Santini et al., 2002Santini F. Gaidarov I. Keen J.H. G protein-coupled receptor/arrestin3 modulation of the endocytic machinery.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this case, individual endocytic events occurring asynchronously might fail to produce a pronounced decrease in fluorescence, causing an overestimate of CCP lifetimes. This predicts, however, that longer-lasting clathrin-GFP spots, due to the presence of multiple CCPs, would have substantially higher fluorescence compared to short-lived clusters representing individual CCPs. No such correlation was observed between clathrin fluorescence and CCP lifetimes in agonist-treated db1-expressing cells (Figure 5A, correlation coefficient of −0.041). Further, when CCPs were separated based on whether their lifetimes were greater or less than 54 s, the average fluorescence values between the two populations were nearly identical (Figure 5B). Thus, the endocytic delay observed is not an artifact of altered CCP organization, but reflects a receptor-dependent process altering the surface lifetimes of individual CCPs. After initiation of CCP formation, CCP maturation is characterized by continued assembly of the clathrin lattice, evident in TIR-FM images as a progressive"

These findings suggest a crucial role for the RANKL/RANK/OPG axis in osteoclast development. A number of transmembrane proteins undergo proteolysis and are released from the plasma membrane, a process called ectodomain shedding. The biologic and pathologic significance of ectodomain shedding varies between substrate proteins. For example, cytokines such as TNF-α and epidermal growth factor are released from local environments and exert their activity in paracrine and endocrine signaling by ectodomain shedding (13Kriegler M.

Culture media and cell lysates were treated using the same procedure as for culture media of TM8B2. Determination of Cleavage Sites of RANKL—pSG5-RANKL were transfected to TM8B2 cells. Seventy hours after transfection, 200 ml of the culture medium was collected, and soluble RANKL was recovered using an OPG-Fc column. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene membrane, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The band was excised, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd. (Hokkaido, Japan). ELISA—Primary osteoblasts were seeded in 48-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml. If needed, cells were infected with retrovirus vectors as mentioned above. After 24 h of incubation, some cultures were treated with 10-8 m 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 10-6 m PGE2 for 72 h. The concentration of RANKL in the culture media and cell lysates (homogenized in 200 μl of TNE buffer per well) was determined by ELISA system developed using a TRANCE DuoSet ELISA development kit (R&D Biosystems). Coculture of Primary Osteoblasts and Bone Marrow Macrophages—Bone marrow macrophages were obtained from tibias of 5-8 weeks-old C57/BL6 mice by flushing the bone marrow with α-MEM, and cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 10 ng/ml M-CSF (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) for 16 h, and non-adherent cells were collected. For the coculture, primary osteoblasts were seeded in 48-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml. If needed, cells were infected by a retrovirus, as described above. After 24-h incubation, macrophages were seeded on the primary osteoblasts at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml and treated with 10-8 m 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 10-6 m PGE2 for 5 days. Osteoclasts were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (3Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (3571) Google Scholar), and the cell number was counted. For separate culture, primary osteoblasts were cultured on the cell culture insert (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and bone marrow macrophages were seeded on the bottom of 24-well plates. Osteoclast Formation Assay by Soluble RANKL Generated by MMP14—293T cells were transfected with several combinations of pcDNA3.1-V5HisA, pcDNA3.1-RANKL-V5HisB, and pcDNA-mMMP14-V5HisA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and 48 h after transfection, culture media were collected. Bone marrow macrophages were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of the culture media and α-MEM containing 10% FBS, supplemented with M-CSF at 10 ng/ml for 4 days. Osteoclast Formation Assay, Survival Assay, and Pit Formation Assay of Macrophages of MMP14-deficient Mice—The MMP14-deficient mice were generated and backcrossed to the C57/BL6 strain as previously described (30Ohtake Y. Tojo H. Seiki M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3822-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Livers and spleens were harvested from newborn MMP14-deficient mice and wild-type littermates, and cells were strained using a cell strainer. The obtained cells were incubated in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 200 ng/ml M-CSF (Wako) for 4 days in 10-cm Petri dishes, and then M-CSF-dependent macrophages were recovered by trypsinization. For the osteoclast formation assay, macrophages were seeded in 48-well plates at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml and treated with 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 100 ng/ml RANKL (Wako) for 6 days. For the survival assay and the pit formation assay, macrophages (2 × 105 cells/ml) were cocultured with primary osteoblasts (1 × 105 cells/ml) in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 10-8 m 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 10-6 m PGE2 on culture dishes precoated with 0.2% collagen gel matrix (Nitta Gelatin, Osaka, Japan). When osteoclasts were formed after 7-day culture, they were released from the dishes by treatment with 0.2% collagenase in phosphate-buffered saline, and collected by centrifugation. For the survival assay, cells were cultured on 48-well plates for 4 h, and osteoclasts were isolated by removing the osteoblasts by 0.1% collagenase and 0.2% dispase in phosphate-buffered saline. Purified osteoclasts were further incubated in α-MEM containing 10% FBS for 20 h. For the pit formation assay, cells were seeded on the dentin slices (Wako) precoated with FBS, and incubated in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 10-8 m 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 10-6 m PGE2 for 24 h. Then the cells were removed by ultrasonication after adding 1 m NH4OH. Resorption pits were visualized by staining with 0.5% toluidine blue and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Histology—Tibias of 2- to 3-week-old male MMP14-deficient mice, and wild-type littermates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and decalcified in 10% EDTA. Paraffin-embedded samples were sectioned at 5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. Observers who were blinded to the origin of the images counted the number of osteoclasts on the trabecular bone surface and measured total length of the trabecular bone using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test for the alkaline phosphatase assay and a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test for the real-time PCR and ELISA. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Screening of MMPs and ADAMs as RANKL Sheddases—We previously developed a RANKL shedding activity screening system using an expression vector encoding a fusion protein of secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) with the C-terminally truncated form of RANKL, which contains the stalk region, transmembrane domain, and intracellular domain of RANKL (tRANKL-SEAP) (20Hikita A. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Fukuda A. Wakeyama H. Yasuda H. Nakamura K. Oda H. Miyazaki T. Tanaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41700-41706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Expression vectors of various MMPs or ADAMs were transfected to 293T cells together with tRANKL-SEAP plasmids, and the alkaline phosphatase activity of the culture media was measured. In this assay system, increased alkaline phosphatase activity in the medium indicates an increase in RANKL shedding (Fig. 1A). Several MMPs and ADAMs exhibited tRANKL-SEAP shedding activity, and ADAM10, MMP14 (membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP), MT2, MT3, and MT5-MMP had relatively stronger activity (Fig. 1B). In contrast, MMP13 (Fig. 1B), MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, MMP11, MMP23, and MMP28 (data not shown) had no tRANKL-SEAP shedding activity. MMP14 and ADAM10 Are Major RANKL Sheddases in TM8B2 Cells—To confirm the ability of these proteinases to cleave full-length RANKL, they were overexpressed in the mouse bone marrow stromal cell line TM8B2 together with full-length RANKL. Soluble RANKL was recovered from the culture media using an OPG-Fc recombinant protein column and subjected to Western blot analysis. When RANKL (C-terminally tagged with V5 and 6× His) was overexpressed in TM8B2 cells (∼39 kDa), there were two different molecular mass products (25 and 24 kDa) in the culture media (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal sequences of the two bands are shown in Fig. 2B. These two bands were differentially diminished by various metalloproteinase inhibitors (Fig. 2A). When TM8B2 cells were treated with FR255031, which inhibits several MMPs but not TNF-α secretases (31Ishikawa T. Nishigaki F. Miyata S. Hirayama Y. Minoura K. Imanishi J. Neya M. Mizutani T. Imamura Y. Naritomi Y. Murai H. Ohkubo Y. Kagayama A. Mutoh S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 144: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), only the lower band disappeared. On the other hand, treatment with FR217840, which not only inhibits several MMPs, but also inhibits TNF-α secretion (32Ishikawa T. Nishigaki F. Miyata S. Hirayama Y. Minoura K. Imanishi J. Neya M. Mizutani T. Imamura Y. Ohkubo Y. Mutoh S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 508: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), both of the bands disappeared. These results suggest that the upper band is produced by ADAM family proteinase(s) and the lower band by MMP(s). ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM19 cleaved full-length RANKL, but only ADAM10 produced soluble RANKL with the same molecular weight as the upper band observed in TM8B2 cells (Fig. 2C). ADAM17 did not cleave full-length RANKL. MMP14, MT2, MT3, and MT5-MMP generated soluble RANKL with the same molecular weight as the lower band. MT4- and MT6-MMP did not increase the soluble RANKL detected in the culture media (data not shown). Real-time PCR showed that the MMP14 mRNA level was much higher than that of MT2-, MT3-, or MT5-MMP in TM8B2 cells and primary osteoblasts (Fig. 2D), suggesting that MMP14 is mainly involved in the production of the lower band. The mRNA level of ADAM10 was comparable to that of MMP14 in these two cells (data not shown). To determine the role of ADAM10 and MMP14 in the constitutive shedding of RANKL in TM8B2 cells, we constructed expression vectors of siRNA for ADAM10 and MMP14 (siADAM10 and siMMP14) (Fig. 2E). We constructed two different siADAM10 and siMMP14 vectors, and all of them effectively suppressed expression of the target molecules (Fig. 2E). The upper band of soluble RANKL diminished when the RANKL construct was transfected to TM8B2 cells along with siADAM10 plasmids; the lower band diminished with siMMP14 (Fig. 2F); and only the upper band was faintly observed when both siADAM10 and siMMP14 were transduced (Fig. 2G). The faint band completely disappeared in the presence of FR217840, but not FR255031 (Fig. 2G). These results indicated that ADAM10 and MMP14 are two major RANKL sheddases in TM8B2 cells. MMP14 Cleaves RANKL in Primary Osteoblasts—We next examined the RANKL sheddases in primary osteoblasts. When primary osteoblasts were stimulated with 1α,25(OH)2D3, PGE2, and IL-1, two bands appeared in the culture media with the same molecular masses (∼22 and 21 kDa) as those observed in TM8B2 cells transfected with full-length RANKL without epitope tag (Fig. 3A and data not shown), but the lower band was more prominent. The expression of MMP14 was also much higher than that of MT2-, MT3-, or MT5-MMP in osteoblasts, suggesting that MMP14 is the major RANKL sheddase in primary osteoblasts (Fig. 2D). We constructed retrovirus vectors of siMMP14 that efficiently suppressed MMP14 expression in primary osteoblasts (Fig. 3B). When osteoblasts were infected with siMMP14 retrovirus, the lower band was diminished in the culture medium and membrane-bound RANKL was increased in the cell lysate (Fig. 3A). The concentration of soluble RANKL in the culture media and membrane-bound RANKL in the cell lysates was also measured by ELISA. A significant decrease in soluble RANKL and an increase in membrane-bound RANKL was observed by MMP14 knockdown (Fig. 3C), consistent with the results of Western blot analysis. Conversely, overexpression of MMP14 in primary osteoblasts increased the lower band of soluble RANKL in the culture media and reduced membrane-bound RANKL in the cell lysates (Fig. 3, D and E). To further confirm the role of MMP14 in RANKL shedding in osteoblasts, we analyzed primary osteoblasts obtained from MMP14 knock-out mice. When primary osteoblasts of MMP14-deficient mice were stimulated with 1α,25(OH)2D3, PGE2, and IL-1, only the upper band of soluble RANKL was observed in the culture medium (Fig. 3F). The amount of soluble RANKL was markedly reduced in the medium, and membrane-bound RANKL was increased (Fig. 3G). RANKL Shedding Negatively Regulates Osteoclastogenesis—To determine the role of MMP14 in the osteoclastogenic activity of osteoblasts, we cocultured osteoblasts infected with siMMP14 retrovirus with bone marrow macrophages. The siMMP14 retrovirus-infected osteoblasts, in which RANKL shedding activity was suppressed and membrane-bound RANKL was increased, stimulated osteoclastogenesis more effectively than control cells (Fig. 4A). Conversely, overexpression of MMP14 in primary osteoblasts suppressed osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that membrane-bound RANKL induces osteoclastogenesis more efficiently than soluble RANKL, and the ectodomain shedding of RANKL by MMP14 negatively regulates osteoclastogenesis. We then examined the osteoclastogenic activity of the soluble RANKL generated by MMP14. The culture media of 293T cells transfected with RANKL and MMP14 expression vectors were collected 48 h after transfection, and bone marrow macrophages were cultured in media supplemented with 10 ng/ml M-CSF (Fig. 4C). When macrophages were cultured in media recovered from the empty vector or RANKL expression vector-transfected cell cultures, mature osteoclasts did not form, even in the presence of M-CSF. In contrast, the culture media from the cells transfected with both RANKL and MMP14 expression vectors induced osteoclast formation, indicating that the soluble RANKL generated by MMP14 had osteoclastogenic activity. When primary osteoblasts overexpressing MMP14 by retrovirus vectors and bone marrow cells were cultured separately using cell culture inserts, which allow the passage of culture media but prevent cell-cell contact, and were stimulated with 1α,25(OH)2D3, PGE2, and IL-1, very few osteoclasts were formed (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that the amount of endogenous soluble RANKL generated in primary osteoblasts is not sufficient to induce osteoclastogenesis in our assay system. We finally analyzed the osteoclastogenic activity of MMP14-deficient osteoblasts. When normal bone marrow macrophages were cocultured with osteoblasts from MMP14-deficient mice, osteoclasts were formed more efficiently than in cocultures with wild-type osteoblasts (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, bone marrow macrophages from MMP14-deficient mice differentiated into mature osteoclasts with the same efficiency as wild-type cells (Fig. 5B), and their bone-resorbing activity and survival rate were comparable (Fig. 5C). Consistent with these in vitro observations, soft x-ray images of MMP14-deficient mice displayed osteoporosis (Fig. 6A). Histologic sections showed thin cortical bone, decreased cancellous bone, and increased osteoclasts on the trabecular bone surface, which agreed with a previous report (33Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). These data suggested that the increased osteoclast number in MMP14-deficient mice is due to the increase in membrane-bound RANKL in osteoblasts.FIGURE 6Severe osteopenia and increased osteoclastogenesis in MMP14-deficient mice.

For example, TNF-α is cleaved by some proteinases such as TNF-α converting enzyme and released into the circulatory system to exhibit strong systemic effects (13Kriegler M. Perez C. DeFay K. Albert I. Lu S.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 14Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L.

Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). In contrast, Fas ligand, which is a strong apoptosis inducer, has reduced effects in its soluble form (19Schneider P. Holler N. Bodmer J.L. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). RANKL is a member of the TNF family of cytokines, and recent studies indicate that RANKL is essential in skeletal homeostasis for regulating the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. Membrane-bound RANKL is proteolytically processed to generate the soluble form, but the specific proteinases involved in RANKL shedding and its physiologic and pathologic importance are not known. Western blot analysis revealed that there are two different cleaved products in the supernatants of both TM8B2 bone marrow stromal cells and primary osteoblasts, and the lower band was the major band in primary osteoblasts (Fig. 3A). The N-terminal sequence of the upper band coincides with the constitutive cleavage site previously reported in COS7 cells, and that of the lower band coincides with the putative MMP cleavage site. The lower band was decreased in the presence of an MMP inhibitor FR255031, and both bands were diminished by treatment with FR217840, which inhibits both MMPs and ADAMs. Previous studies also demonstrated that various MMPs and ADAMs have RANKL shedding activity (17Lum L.

Therefore, we first analyzed the RANKL shedding activity of several MMPs and ADAMs using the previously reported RANKL shedding assay (20Hikita A. Kadono Y. Chikuda H. Fukuda A. Wakeyama H. Yasuda H. Nakamura K. Oda H. Miyazaki T. Tanaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41700-41706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MMP7, MMP19, ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM17, ADAM19, MMP14, MT2, MT3, MT4, MT5, and MT6-MMP had tRANKL-SEAP shedding activity. Among these proteinases, ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM19, MMP14, MT2, MT3, and MT5-MMP cleaved full-length RANKL. Although ADAM9 and ADAM19 had RANKL shedding activity, the molecular weights of the cleaved products were different from those constitutively generated in TM8B2 cells and primary osteoblasts. Among MT-MMPs, MMP14 was predominantly expressed in TM8B2 and primary osteoblasts. MMP7 was reported to cleave RANKL in vitro or under overexpressing conditions and has an important role in prostate cancer-induced osteolysis (34Lynch C.C. Hikosaka A. Acuff H.B. Martin M.D. Kawai N. Singh R.K. Vargo-Gogola T.C. Begtrup J.L. Peterson T.E. Fingleton B. Shirai T. Matrisian L.M. Futakuchi M. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 485-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although MMP7 had tRANKL-SEAP shedding activity, it did not cleave full-length RANKL in our assay system. Blobel and co-workers (17Lum L. Wong B.R. Josien R. Becherer J.D. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13613-13618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ADAM17 (TNF-α converting enzyme) cleaves a partial fragment of RANKL protein, but not full-length RANKL (35Schlondorff J. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and we confirmed that ADAM17 did not cleave full-length RANKL. Although MMP13 deficiency leads to skeletal abnormalities (37Inada M. Wang Y. Byrne M.H. Rahman M.U. Miyaura C. Lopez-Otin C. Krane S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17192-17197Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), it did not cleave tRANKL-SEAP or full-length RANKL. These data, in combination with the results of siRNA experiments, led us to speculate that ADAM10 and MMP14 were major RANKL sheddases in TM8B2 cells and osteoblasts, although it is possible that other proteinases are involved in RANKL shedding in some pathologic conditions in which they are up-regulated. The functional difference between MMP14-cleaved RANKL and ADAM10-cleaved RANKL is currently under investigation. In the culture media of primary osteoblasts, the lower molecular weight product was much more predominant than the higher molecular weight product, indicating that MMP14 is the major RANKL sheddase in primary osteoblasts. This was further confirmed by the results obtained from MMP14 knockdown osteoblasts and MMP14-deficient osteoblasts, in which the lower molecular weight band was almost completely diminished and the concentration of soluble RANKL was severely reduced. Reduced MMP14 expression in primary osteoblasts by siRNA or its deficiency in MMP14 knock-out mouse osteoblasts reduced RANKL shedding and increased membrane-bound RANKL, which led to increased osteoclastogenic activity in the cells. Although soluble RANKL produced by MMP14 induced osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow macrophages, the culture medium of primary osteoblasts treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 and PGE2 did not induce osteoclastogenesis (38Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki T. Yamaguchi A. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2600-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), even when MMP14 was overexpressed. This was probably due to an insufficient amount of soluble RANKL, because the concentration of the soluble RANKL in the culture media was <1 ng/ml (data not shown), and the amount of recombinant soluble RANKL necessary to induce osteoclastogenesis in vitro was >10 ng/ml. Still, it is possible that when the expression of RANKL is highly up-regulated, soluble RANKL has substantial effects on general bone metabolism. Gao et al. reported that parathyroid hormone(1Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L.

Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 485-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) not only increases RANKL but also decreases MMP14 production in human osteoblasts, which might result in the efficient up-regulation of bone resorption by increasing membrane-bound RANKL in the cells (39Guo L.J. Xie H. Zhou H.D. Luo X.H. Peng Y.Q. Liao E.Y. Endocr. Res. 2004; 30: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In MMP14-deficient mice, generalized osteopenia was observed. Although this might be partially due to the reduced bone formation, as previously reported (33Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), the osteoclast number was much higher in these mice, possibly due to the increased membrane-bound RANKL in the osteoblasts. In fact, the serum level of soluble RANKL in MMP14 knock-out mice was undetectable, even when they were injected with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (data not shown). These phenotypes are not due to cell autonomous defects in osteoclast precursors, because there were no abnormalities in osteoclast differentiation from MMP14-deficient macrophages or bone-resorbing function of mature osteoclasts. We were unable to determine the role of ADAM10 in in vivo RANKL shedding or skeletal homeostasis, because ADAM10-deficient animals die at E9.5 due to defects in heart and central nervous system development (40Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lubke T. Lena Illert A. von Figura K. Saftig P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, future studies using cell-specific knock-out of ADAM10 are required. To conclude, we identified MMP14 as a major endogenous RANKL sheddase in primary osteoblasts. RANKL shedding negatively affects local osteoclastogenesis by reducing membrane-bound RANKL in the skeletal environment. We thank R.

Here we characterized the effects of ABT-737, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-w with markedly higher affinity than previously reported compounds, on human MM cells. ABT-737 induces apoptosis in MM cells, including those resistant to conventional therapy. Examination of purified patient MM cells demonstrated similar results, without significant toxicity against normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MM bone marrow stromal cells. Importantly, ABT-737 decreases the viability of bortezomib-, dexamethasone-(Dex) and thalidomide-refractory patient MM cells. Additionally, ABT-737 abrogates MM cell growth triggered by interleukin-6 or insulin-like growth factor-1. Mechanistic studies show that ABT-737-induced apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3, followed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Combining ABT-737 with proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, melphalan or dexamethasone induces additive anti-MM activity. Taken together, our study provides the rationale for clinical protocols evaluating ABT-737, alone and together with botezomib, mephalan or dexamethasone, to enhance MM cell killing, overcome drug resistance conferred by Bcl-2 and improve patient outcome in MM."
https://openalex.org/W1989070672,"Claudins are tight junction proteins that play a key selectivity role in the paracellular conductance of ions. Numerous studies of claudin function have been carried out using the overexpression strategy to add new claudin channels to an existing paracellular protein background. Here, we report the systematic knockdown of endogenous claudin gene expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and in LLC-PK1 cells using small interfering RNA against claudins 1-4 and 7. In MDCK cells (showing cation selectivity), claudins 2, 4, and 7 are powerful effectors of paracellular Na+ permeation. Removal of claudin-2 depressed the permeation of Na+ and resulted in the loss of cation selectivity. Loss of claudin-4 or -7 expression elevated the permeation of Na+ and enhanced the proclivity of the tight junction for cations. On the other hand, LLC-PK1 cells express little endogenous claudin-2 and show anion selectivity. In LLC-PK1 cells, claudin-4 and -7 are powerful effectors of paracellular Cl- permeation. Knockdown of claudin-4 or -7 expression depressed the permeation of Cl- and caused the tight junction to lose the anion selectivity. In conclusion, claudin-2 functions as a paracellular channel to Na+ to increase the cation selectivity of the tight junction; claudin-4 and -7 function either as paracellular barriers to Na+ or as paracellular channels to Cl-, depending upon the cellular background, to decrease the cation selectivity of the tight junction. Claudins are tight junction proteins that play a key selectivity role in the paracellular conductance of ions. Numerous studies of claudin function have been carried out using the overexpression strategy to add new claudin channels to an existing paracellular protein background. Here, we report the systematic knockdown of endogenous claudin gene expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and in LLC-PK1 cells using small interfering RNA against claudins 1-4 and 7. In MDCK cells (showing cation selectivity), claudins 2, 4, and 7 are powerful effectors of paracellular Na+ permeation. Removal of claudin-2 depressed the permeation of Na+ and resulted in the loss of cation selectivity. Loss of claudin-4 or -7 expression elevated the permeation of Na+ and enhanced the proclivity of the tight junction for cations. On the other hand, LLC-PK1 cells express little endogenous claudin-2 and show anion selectivity. In LLC-PK1 cells, claudin-4 and -7 are powerful effectors of paracellular Cl- permeation. Knockdown of claudin-4 or -7 expression depressed the permeation of Cl- and caused the tight junction to lose the anion selectivity. In conclusion, claudin-2 functions as a paracellular channel to Na+ to increase the cation selectivity of the tight junction; claudin-4 and -7 function either as paracellular barriers to Na+ or as paracellular channels to Cl-, depending upon the cellular background, to decrease the cation selectivity of the tight junction. Tight junctions are cell-cell interactions that provide the primary barrier to the diffusion of solutes through the paracellular pathway, creating an ion-selective boundary between the apical and basolateral extracellular compartments (see reviews in Refs. 1Anderson J.M.

The integral membrane proteins of the tight junction include occludin, a 65-kDa membrane protein bearing four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, and claudins, a family with at least 22 homologous proteins of 20-28 kDa that share a common topology with occludin (4Furuse M.

LLC-PK1 cells express four endogenous claudins, claudin-1, -3, -4, and -7. In LLC-PK1 cells, claudin-2, -15, -16 selectively increase the permeability of cation through the tight junction with no significant effects on anions (13Van Itallie C.M. Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M.

When exogenous claudins are added to the tight junction, they constitute new charge-selective channels leading to a physiological phenotype that combines the contributions of both endogenous and exogenous claudins in the cell. A biochemical inventory of claudin-claudin interactions is not yet available, although the principle of specificity has been demonstrated in mouse L-fibroblasts (15Furuse M. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). In addition, although efforts have been made to demonstrate the oligomerization properties of claudin-4 in cultured insect cells (16Mitic L.L. Unger V.M. Anderson J.M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), there are few data documenting the oligomerization states of claudins or whether claudins can co-oligomerize to form additional functional units. FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) studies suggest that claudin molecules assembled in tight junctions have limited mobility (17Sasaki H. Matsui C. Furuse K. Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Furuse M. Tsukita S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), consistent with their known interactions with proteins in the tight junction scaffold (18Hamazaki Y. Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M.

However, the assembly of claudins into oligomers is likely to occur before delivery to the cell surface. To date, all studies of claudin function have been carried out using the overexpression strategy, adding new claudin channels to an existing paracellular protein background. To complement these data, we have studied the function of claudin when cells become deficient in a specific claudin. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has proven to be a powerful tool to suppress gene expression in mammalian cells through a process known as RNA interference (21Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar, 22Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). In this study, we have systematically knocked down the endogenous expression of claudins 1-4 and 7 in MDCK cells and claudins 4 and 7 in LLC-PK1 cells using siRNA and probed their function. We have also rescued the loss of each claudin function by exogenously expressing its siRNA-resistant counterpart from a different species. Antibodies and Cell Lines—The following antibodies were used in this study: rabbit polyclonal anti-claudin-1, anti-claudin-2, anti-claudin-3, anti-claudin-7, and mouse monoclonal anti-claudin-4 and anti-occludin antibodies (Zymed Laboratories); fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Chemicon); and horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Amersham Biosciences). MDCK II cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium (MEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin; 293T cells and LLC-PK1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. Construction of Canine Gene Sequences of Claudins—The mRNA sequences of claudin-2 and -3 of Canis familiaris are available from the GenBank™ (accession numbers AF358907 and AF358908 for claudin-2 and claudin-3, respectively). To obtain the sequences of dog claudins 1, 4, and 7, the coding region of mouse claudin-1 (accession number AF072127), claudin-4 (AF087822), and claudin-7 (AF087825) were used to Blast search the dog genome project (managed by the Human Genome Project at the Sanger Center, Cambridge, UK). The genomic sequence with highest alignment score was retrieved for each claudin. Claudin-1 was located on chromosome 34 (spanning 2 exons from 25389105 to 25391013 and from 25393206 to 25402578). Claudin-4 was located on chromosome 6 (spanning 1 exon from 9222975 to 9224222). Claudin-7 was located on chromosome 5 (spanning 3 exons from 35195628 to 35195793, 35196098 to 35196265, and 35197000 to 35197230). Fragments of canine claudin-1, -4, or -7 mRNA sequence (coding region) were stitched from the extracted exons to form a more complete sequence. This sequence was then realigned to the original mouse claudin sequence (see alignments in supplemental Figs. S1-S5); the overall percentages of nucleotide similarity to mouse claudins were 89% for dog claudin-1, 83% for dog claudin-4, and 89% for dog claudin-7. Search for Porcine Gene Sequences of Claudins—As the genomic sequence of pig (Sus scrofa) is not yet complete within the public research domain, we have searched the PEDE (Pig EST Data Explorer) data base for the mRNA sequences of porcine claudins. PEDE is a data base of porcine EST (expressed sequence tag) collections derived from full-length cDNA libraries and maintained by the Animal Genome Research Program in Japan. To obtain the sequences of pig claudins-4 and 7, the coding region of mouse claudin-4 (GenBank™ accession number AF087822) and claudin-7 (AF087825) were used to Blast search the PEDE data base. The full-length cDNA sequence with highest alignment score was retrieved for claudin-4 (PEDE designation, 20050322C-005301; length, 1394 bp) and claudin-7 (PEDE designation, 20050322C-001624; length, 1251 bp). The coding region of pig claudin was then realigned to the original mouse claudin sequence (see alignments in supplemental Figs. S6 and S7), and the overall percentages of nucleotide similarity to mouse claudin was 83% for pig claudin-4; 86% for pig claudin-7. Molecular Cloning and Retrovirus Production—The following full-length mammalian claudins were cloned into the retroviral vector pQCXIH (a gift from Dr. Joan Brugge, Harvard Medical School): mouse claudin-2 (GenBank™ accession number AF072128), mouse claudin-4 (AF087822), and mouse claudin-7 (AF087825). For siRNA studies, the siRNA hairpin oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and annealed and cloned into the Moloney murine leukemia virus retrovirus backbone downstream of the human small nuclear RNA U6 promoter to create the pSIREN-claudin siRNA constructs. Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped retroviruses were produced in 293T cells and used to infect MDCK cells at a titer of 1 × 106 colony-forming units/ml, as described previously (14Hou J. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Protein Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Confluent cells were dissolved in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture; Pierce). After shearing with a 23-gauge needle, lysates (containing 15 μg of total protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by blocking with 3% nonfat milk, incubation with primary antibodies (1:1,000) and the horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000), and exposure to an ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). Molecular mass was determined relative to protein markers (Bio-Rad). Immunolabeling and Confocal Microscopy—Cells grown on Transwell inserts (Corning) were fixed with cold methanol at -20 °C followed by blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubation with primary antibodies (1:300) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies (1:200). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, slides were mounted with Mowiol (Calbiochem). Confocal analyses were performed using the Nikon TE2000 confocal microscopy system equipped with Plan-Neofluar ×40 (numeric aperture 1.3 oil) and ×63 (numeric aperture 1.4 oil) objectives and krypton-argon laser (488 and 543 lines). For the dual imaging of FITC and rhodamine, fluorescent images were collected by exciting the fluorophores at 488 nm (FITC) and 543 nm (rhodamine) with argon and HeNe lasers, respectively. Emissions from FITC and rhodamine were detected with the band-pass FITC filter set of 500-550 nm and the long-pass rhodamine filter set of 560 nm, respectively. All images were converted to JPEG format and arranged using Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe). Electrophysiological Measurements—Electrophysiological studies were performed on cell monolayers grown on porous filters (Transwell), as described previously (14Hou J. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Voltage and current clamps were performed using the EVC4000 Precision V/I clamp (World Precision Instruments) with Ag/AgCl electrodes and an agarose bridge containing 3 m KCl. Transepithelial resistance (TER) was measured using the Millicell-ERS and chopstick electrodes (Millipore). The TER of the confluent monolayer of cells was determined in buffer A (145 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and the TER of blank filters was subtracted. Dilution potentials were measured when buffer B (80 mm NaCl, 130 mm mannitol, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) replaced buffer A on the apical side or basal side of filters. Electrical potentials obtained from blank inserts were subtracted from those obtained from inserts with a confluent growth of cells. The ion permeability ratio (PNa/PCl) for the monolayer was calculated from the dilution potential using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (23Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 184Google Scholar). The absolute permeability values of Na+ (PNa) and Cl- (PCl) were calculated using the Kimizuka-Koketsu equation (24Kimizuka H. Koketsu K. J. Theor. Biol. 1964; 6: 290-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—The significance of differences between groups was tested by analysis of variance (Statistica 6.0, Statsoft 2003). When the all-effects F value was significant (p < 0.05), post hoc analysis of differences between individual groups was made with the Neuman-Keuls test. Values were expressed as mean ± S.E. unless stated otherwise. Knocking Down Claudin Gene Expression in MDCK Cells— The small nuclear RNA promoter (U6) is used for directing expression of siRNAs because it is active in a wide variety of cell types and efficiently directs the synthesis of small noncoding transcripts bearing well defined termini. The siRNA hairpin oligonucleotides were designed and cloned with the strategy described previously (Fig. 1A; Ref. 21Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). Each oligonucleotide contains a unique complementary 19-nucleotide sequence within the coding region of a canine claudin. Claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, and -7 were each screened with 7 to 10 siRNA sequences spanning their gene coding regions. Each of the siRNA sequences showed different degrees of suppression of claudin expression when assessed by both Western blotting and immunostaining. Only a small number of siRNA sequences suppressed both detectable staining on Western blots (Fig. 1B) and detectable claudin immunostaining (>95% loss, Fig. 1C). Two sequences with these activities were identified for each claudin and used in subsequent studies (sequences shown on supplemental Figs. S1-S5). Loss of Claudin Function and Paracellular Ion Conductance—To examine the paracellular ion transport in the absence of claudin function, we stably expressed the identified siRNAs in MDCK cells against claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, and -7. As we aimed to have claudin expression suppressed by siRNAs during a prolonged period in MDCK cells, so that they could become fully polarized and form tight junctions, we utilized a retroviral expression system to drive siRNA expression. Each individual siRNA construct was used to infect MDCK cells (with empty vector-infected MDCK cells as control), and the infected cells were seeded onto Transwell inserts to become polarized. On day 9 post-polarization, cell monolayers were subjected to electrophysiological measurements and immunostained in order to visualize the loss of claudin expression. Although all siRNAs were active in protein expression, we observed dramatic changes in paracellular permeability only with claudin-2, -4, and -7. To control for up- or down-regulation of nontargeted claudins, we assayed the protein levels of the remaining four claudins (among the five endogenous claudins studied: claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, and -7) in the absence of claudin-2, -4, or -7 and found no differences compared with empty vector controls (data not shown). Consistent with previous findings (10Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 12Yu A.S. Enck A.H. Lencer W.I. Schneeberger E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17350-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), MDCK II cells are leaky, having a TER value of 78.0 Ω·cm2 (measured in 145 mm NaCl and shown in Fig. 2A and Table 1). Loss of claudin-2 expression dramatically increased TER to 248.3 Ω·cm2 (p < 0.001, n = 3); in contrast, loss of claudin-4 or -7 expression significantly decreased TER to 53.7 and 43.0 Ω·cm2, respectively. To determine the ion selectivity (PNa versus PCl), we applied an apical-to-basal chemical gradient (145 mm NaCl at the apical side to 80 mm at the basal side) to the MDCK monolayers and recorded the diffusion potential. The base-line value of ion selectivity (PNa/PCl) in MDCK cells was 6.14 ± 0.19, consistent with the cation selectivity reflected by the diffusion potential of +10.83 ± 0.12 mV (with the apical side as zero reference). These results are similar to published values (11Wen H. Watry D.D. Marcondes M.C. Fox H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8408-8417Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12Yu A.S. Enck A.H. Lencer W.I. Schneeberger E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17350-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Loss of claudin-2 expression significantly lowered the diffusion potential to +4.03 ± 0.03 mV and PNa/PCl to 1.74 ± 0.01 (p < 0.001, n = 3; Fig. 2, B and C, and Table 1). In comparison, a loss of claudin-4 or -7 expression led to a significant increase in the diffusion potential (to +13.10 ± 0.15 or +13.03 ± 0.23 mV, respectively) and in PNa/PCl (to 13.89 ± 1.13 or 13.65 ± 1.72, respectively). Calculation of the permeability value of Na+ (PNa) and Cl- (PCl) indicated that claudin-2, -4, and -7 are powerful modulators of PNa. Removal of claudin-2 from MDCK cells depressed the permeation of Na+ (a significant drop of PNa to 4.70 ± 0.01 from the control level of 20.23 ± 0.09 × 10-6 cm/s; Fig. 2D and Table 1). On the other hand, removal of claudin-4 or -7 up-regulated PNa (to 31.68 ± 0.16 and 39.69 ± 0.31 × 10-6 cm/s, respectively). Interestingly, the permeability of Cl- was not affected by the knocking down of these claudins. Inhibiting the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (1 mm ouabain) had no effects on PNa or PCl in either control or siRNA-expressing cells, indicating a paracellular pathway for ion flux. The remaining claudins in MDCK cells (claudin-1 and -3) were not paracellular ion effectors (Table 1). This experiment was repeated and confirmed independently with three separate monolayers. A similar effect was also seen for each claudin with the second selected siRNA sequence.TABLE 1Paracellular ion conductance in MDCK cells and LLC-PK1 cells depleted with claudinsGroupTERDilution potentialPNa/PClPNaPClΩ·cm2mV10–6 cm/s10–6 cm/sMDCK + empty vector78.0 ± 2.310.83 ± 0.126.14 ± 0.1920.23 ± 0.093.30 ± 0.09MDCK + claudin1_siRNA80.0 ± 3.510.50 ± 0.295.67 ± 0.4119.48 ± 0.213.46 ± 0.21MDCK + claudin2_siRNA248.3 ± 3.54.03 ± 0.031.74 ± 0.014.70 ± 0.012.70 ± 0.01MDCK + claudin2_siRNA + claudin2_mouse64.7 ± 0.99.80 ± 0.124.76 ± 0.1223.33 ± 0.114.90 ± 0.11MDCK + claudin3_siRNA65.3 ± 1.511.17 ± 0.126.74 ± 0.2424.58 ± 0.113.66 ± 0.11MDCK + claudin4_siRNA53.7 ± 2.313.10 ± 0.1513.89 ± 1.1331.68 ± 0.162.31 ± 0.16MDCK + claudin4_siRNA + claudin4_mouse65.3 ± 0.311.27 ± 0.186.95 ± 0.3724.67 ± 0.163.57 ± 0.16MDCK + claudin7_siRNA43.0 ± 2.613.03 ± 0.2313.65 ± 1.7239.69 ± 0.312.99 ± 0.31MDCK + claudin7_siRNA + claudin7_mouse73.0 ± 0.610.23 ± 0.155.28 ± 0.1921.13 ± 0.124.01 ± 0.12LLC-PK1 + empty vector61.3 ± 1.5–7.97 ± 0.030.305 ± 0.0027.03 ± 0.0323.06 ± 0.03LLC-PK1 + claudin4_siRNA118.0 ± 5.3–3.00 ± 0.060.66 ± 0.016.21 ± 0.039.35 ± 0.03LLC-PK1 + claudin4_siRNA + claudin4_mouse69.3 ± 3.3–7.47 ± 0.030.334 ± 0.0026.65 ± 0.0319.95 ± 0.03LLC-PK1 + claudin7_siRNA261.7 ± 1.81.47 ± 0.031.22 ± 0.013.85 ± 0.013.16 ± 0.01LLC-PK1 + claudin7_siRNA + claudin7_mouse94.0 ± 3.5–6.77 ± 0.070.376 ± 0.0045.34 ± 0.0414.19 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Rescue of Claudin Function in MDCK Cells—To selectively rescue the loss of function of claudins in MDCK cells, we stably expressed an siRNA-resistant claudin (mouse claudin-2, -4, and -7) in MDCK cells lacking the relevant endogenous claudin. The mouse cDNA sequence chosen to rescue dog claudin-2 contained two mismatches compared with the dog claudin-2 siRNA sequence (Fig. 3A), the mouse claudin-4 cDNA sequence contained four mismatches to the dog claudin-4 siRNA sequence, and the mouse claudin-7 cDNA sequence contained one mismatch to the dog claudin-7 siRNA sequence. The protein expression of all three dog claudins was effectively restored with their mouse counterparts (Fig. 3B, Western blot, and 3C, immunostaining), further proving that the siRNA-mediated gene regulation is highly specific and can differentiate a single nucleotide mismatch (1-bp mutation at position 3 of the siRNA sequence of dog claudin-7 against the mouse claudin-7 cDNA sequence; Fig. 3A). Similarly, Brummelkamp et al. (21Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar) showed that a 1-bp mutation at either position 2 or 9 of the 19-nucleotide siRNA sequence against CDH1 abolished its ability to knock down CDH1 gene expression. Forced expression of the siRNA-resistant mouse claudin-2 in claudin-2-deficient MDCK cells restored the elevated TER (248.3 Ω·cm2) to near the control level (64.7 Ω·cm2), resulting in the return of the dilution potential to its base line (Table 1). The reexpression of claudin-2 accounted for a profound increase in PNa from 4.70 ± 0.01 in the claudin-2-deficient background to 23.33 ± 0.11 (close to the control value of 20.23 ± 0.09 × 10-6 cm/s), thus providing strong evidence that claudin-2 contributes to a paracellular cation channel. The elevated Na+ permeability in cells with depleted endogenous claudin-4 or -7 declined to the baseline level (24.67 ± 0.16 × 10-6 in claudin-4 rescue; 21.13 ± 0.12 × 10-6 cm/s in claudin-7 rescue), when the expression of claudin-4 or -7 was restored by the mouse isoform. The function of claudin-4 and -7 contrasted with that of claudin-2 in that both claudin-4 and -7 blocked paracellular cation permeation. Loss of Claudin Function in LLC-PK1 Cells—Our data on claudin-7 function contrast with those of a recent study performed in LLC-PK1 cells using the overexpression strategy, which showed that claudin-7 simultaneously decreases the paracellular Cl- conductance and increases the paracellular Na+ conductance (25Alexandre M.D. Lu Q. Chen Y.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2683-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The discrepancy could result from the different paracellular protein background, in that MDCK cells showed cation selectivity (PNa/PCl, 6.14 ± 0.19; diffusion potential, +10.83 ± 0.12 mV), whereas LLC-PK1 cells showed anion selectivity (PNa/PCl, 0.305 ± 0.002; diffusion potential, -7.97 ± 0.03 mV). LLC-PK1 cells express endogenous claudins-1, -3, -4, and -7, with very little expression of claudin-2 (maintained at a very low level close to the background (25Alexandre M.D. Lu Q. Chen Y.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2683-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)). The lack of endogenous claudin-2 expression in LLC-PK1 cells explains the low paracellular Na+ permeability (7.03 ± 0.03 × 10-6 cm/s) compared with that in MDCK cells (20.23 ± 0.09 × 10-6 cm/s). Our data (in MDCK cells) had ruled out the possibilities of claudin-1 and -3 as paracellular ion effectors. Thus we focused upon the function of claudin-4 and -7 in LLC-PK1 cells. The same strategy as described above in MDCK cells was employed to select effective siRNA sequences against porcine claudin-4 and -7 (two effective siRNA sequences for each claudin, labeled in supplemental Figs. S6 and S7). Loss of claudin-4 or -7 expression significantly up-regulated the TER value (Table 1; claudin-4 knockdown, 118.0 Ω·cm2; claudin-7 knockdown, 261.7 Ω·cm2; versus control, 61.3 Ω·cm2; p < 0.001, n = 3) and the value of diffusion potential (claudin-4 knockdown, -3.00 ± 0.06 mV; claudin-7 knockdown, +1.47 ± 0.03 mV; versus control, -7.97 ± 0.03 mV; p < 0.001, n = 3), causing the siRNA-expressing cells to lose their anion selectivity. Calculation of the permeability value of Na+ (PNa) and Cl- (PCl) indicated that claudin-4 and -7 were powerful channels of PCl. Loss of claudin-4 or -7 function from LLC-PK1 cells resulted in a dramatic drop of the permeation of Cl- (PCl to 9.35 ± 0.03 in claudin-4 knockdown cells and to 3.16 ± 0.01 in claudin-7 knockdown cells; from the control level of 23.06 ± 0.03 × 10-6 cm/s). Exogenous expression of the siRNA-resistant mouse claudin-4 or -7 in LLC-PK1 cells lacking the endogenous claudin selectively rescued the loss-of-function phenotype of claudin-4 or -7, showing a reciprocal trajectory of paracellular ion permeabilities (see data in Table 1 and sequence comparisons in supplemental Figs. S6 and S7). The MDCK and LLC-PK1 epithelial cell lines have been particularly useful in the study of tight junction as an in vitro cell culture model of renal tubule epithelium (1Anderson J.M. Van Itallie C.M. Fanning A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Cereijido M. Robbins E.S. Dolan W.J. Rotunno C.A. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 853-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 27Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Chavez D.R. Cereijido M. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 86: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 28Gumbiner B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have elucidated the paracellular pathways of the tight junction in these cells and the role of claudins by expression of individual claudins. A major limitation of this approach is that MDCK cells and LLC-PK1 cells already possess a background of multiple claudins. The recorded changes of paracellular conductance cannot reflect the property of each individual claudin but the deviation relative to the background. Our study aimed to systematically knock down the endogenous claudin expression in MDCK cells and LLC-PK1 cells using siRNA (against claudin-1, -4 and -7, respectively). An epithelium experiencing a loss of claudin expression should show a reciprocal paracellular permeability change to the same epithelium overexpressing the claudin in order to confirm an assignment of function. Using siRNA silencing, we found that in MDCK cells claudin-2, -4, and -7 are powerful effectors of paracellular cation permeation (PNa) with no effects on anion (PCl). Removal of claudin-2 depressed the permeation of Na+ and caused the MDCK cell to lose its cation selectivity (PNa/PCl drops from >6 to close to 1.7). On the other hand, loss of claudin-4 or -7 expression elevated the permeation of Na+ and increased the permeability of the tight junction for cations (PNa/PCl jumps from 6 to >13). The expression of siRNA-resistant isoforms of claudin-2, -4, or -7 selectively rescued the loss of function of these claudins in MDCK cells, indicating that the changes in paracellular ion permeation caused by removing a specific claudin truly reflect the property of this claudin in the MDCK context. Given that our conclusions of the functions of claudin-2 and -4 are consistent with previous overexpression findings (claudin-2, Refs. 13Van Itallie C.M. Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Am. J.

Physiol. 2002; 283: C142-C147Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 10Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), our studies provide strong evidence that claudin-2 functions to increase, and claudin-4 to decrease, the cation permeation. However, our data on claudin-7 function contrast with those of a recent study performed in LLC-PK1 cells using the overexpression strategy, which showed that claudin-7 concurrently decreases the paracellular Cl- conductance and increases the paracellular Na+ conductance (25Alexandre M.D. Lu Q. Chen Y.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2683-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy and complement our studies performed in MDCK cells, we have generated LLC-PK1 epithelial cells with suppressed gene expression of claudin-4 or -7 by RNA interference. Knockdown of claudin-4 or -7 depressed the paracellular permeation of Cl- in LLC-PK1 cells and caused the cells to lose their anion selectivity. The expression of siRNA-resistant isoforms of claudin-4 or -7 selectively rescued the loss of function of these claudins in LLC-PK1 cells, indicating that claudin-4 and -7 function as paracellular channels to Cl- in LLC-PK1 cells. Further studies are needed to reconcile the contrasting conclusions on claudin-7 function drawn by us and by Alexandre et al. (25Alexandre M.D. Lu Q. Chen Y.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2683-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), although overexpression of foreign claudins in an existing tight junction context could interfere with the structural makeup of the tight junction, especially when claudins are fused to green fluorescent protein to form a large protein moiety. Moreover, the use of constitutively expressing stable cell lines generates a large amount of clonal variation in TER and dilution potentials. So as to obtain convincing results by this method, a sufficiently large number of independent clones may need to be examined to reach a statistical conclusion. Nevertheless, the discrepancy highlights the importance of physiological measurements in both the presence and absence of a particular claudin in a given cell context. The yin and yang of function of claudin-4 and -7 are particularly interesting. Claudin-4 and -7 function either as paracellular barriers to Na+ or as paracellular channels to Cl-, depending upon the cellular background, to modulate the ion selectivity of the tight junction. This mode of claudin function is in fact consistent with the established theory that claudins form charge-selective pores and confer the ion selectivity to the tight junction (9Colegio O.R. Van Itallie C.M. McCrea H.J. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C142-C147Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 13Van Itallie C.M. Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1078-F1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Hou J. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These charge-selective pores appear to be less discriminative than the conventional ion channels positioned in the cell membrane. The extracellular loops of claudins are enriched with charged amino acids, which could contribute to the ion selectivity of claudins, as highlighted by our previous studies on claudin-16 (paracellin-1) and its mutants bearing point mutations of the charged amino acids in the extracellular loop (14Hou J. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5109-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). When claudin-4 or -7 forms ion-selective pores, the positive charges in the extracellular loops facing the pores may hinder the passage of cations (Na+) while permitting anions (Cl-) to go through. Intriguingly, claudin-4 and -7 function as paracellular barriers to Na+ in MDCK cell but as paracellular channels to Cl- in LLC-PK1 cells. It is likely that: 1) the protein composition of the tight junction differs between these two cell types, thus providing alternative partners with which claudin-4 and -7 may interact; or 2) the cellular regulatory pathways differ between the two cell lines, thereby creating alternative protein modifications of claudins (e.g. protein phosphorylation, as highlighted by WNK4 phosphorylating claudins 1-4 in MDCK cells and selectively up-regulating paracellular Cl- transport; see below). Our studies have created a platform for the examination of the regulation of claudin function in MDCK cells. The paracellular pathway is highly regulated by a wide range of physiologic inputs, including hormones, cytokines, myosin activity, and many cell signaling pathways (see review in Ref. 32Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 403-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Because claudins function as effectors of ion transport at the end of regulatory pathways, there must be transducing proteins that modulate the function of claudins and thus link the physiologic inputs to the final effectors. WNK4 is an interesting candidate, first discovered as the gene linked to pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), a rare Mendelian form of hypertension (33Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodeme S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson-Williams C. Desitter I. Gunel M. Milford D.V. Lipkin G.W. Achard J.M. Feely M.P. Dussol B. Berland Y. Unwin R.J. Mayan H. Simon D.B. Farfel Z. Jeunemaitre X. Lifton R.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). Studies have shown the serine-threonine kinase WNK4 phosphorylates claudins 1-4 in MDCK cells and that its gain-of-function mutant selectively increases paracellular anion permeability (PCl) (34Kahle K.T. MacGregor G.G. Wilson F.H. van Hoek A.N. Brown D. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Boulpaep E.L. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2004; 101: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The effect of WNK4 on paracellular ion transport is abolished by missense mutations that impair WNK4 kinase activity (34Kahle K.T. MacGregor G.G. Wilson F.H. van Hoek A.N. Brown D. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Boulpaep E.L. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14877-14882Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), suggestive of WNK4-mediated phosphorylation of claudins in the paracellular pathway. It will be informative to study WNK4 and its mutant forms in MDCK cells lacking a specific claudin and to identify the functional substrate of the kinase in the paracellular pathway. This may contribute to our understanding of the roles of claudins in renal diseases and herald novel treatments.

While the resting and activated states of multiple receptors are well characterized, elaboration of the structural properties of the desensitized state, a state that is by definition inactive, has proven difficult. Here we use electrical, chemical, and crystallographic experiments on the AMPA-sensitive GluR2 receptor, defining the conformational rearrangements of the agonist binding cores that occur upon desensitization of this ligand-gated ion channel. These studies demonstrate that desensitization involves the rupture of an extensive interface between domain 1 of 2-fold related glutamate-binding core subunits, compensating for the ca. 21° of domain closure induced by glutamate binding. The rupture of the domain 1 interface allows the ion channel to close and thereby provides a simple explanation to the long-standing question of how agonist binding is decoupled from ion channel gating upon receptor desensitization.

The rupture of the domain 1 interface allows the ion channel to close and thereby provides a simple explanation to the long-standing question of how agonist binding is decoupled from ion channel gating upon receptor desensitization. Chemical communication across cell membranes is commonly mediated by ligand-gated ion channels and cell-surface receptors. In many instances, diffusible ligands (agonists) bind to the extracellular domain of the receptor, induce specific conformational changes, and stabilize the activated state. Once activated, the agonist either unbinds from the receptor and the receptor returns to the apo, resting state (deactivation), or the agonist bound receptor undergoes one or more additional conformational changes that decouple the action of agonist binding from receptor activation, i.e., the receptor is desensitized by or insensitive to the activating action of agonist. While there are a number of receptors for which we have atomic-scale views of resting and activated states (Armstrong et al., 2003Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E.

Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels activated by the binding of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Activation triggers the opening of cation-permeable channels, thereby transducing a chemical signal derived from the presynaptic release of glutamate to an electrical signal that results in depolarization of the postsynaptic cell (for recent reviews, see Dingledine et al., 1999Dingledine R.

The portion of the iGluRs involved in glutamate binding includes two discontinuous polypeptide segments, called S1 and S2 (Stern-Bach et al., 1994Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O.

Molecular dissection of the agonist binding site of an AMPA receptor.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Figure S1). Structural studies on GluR2 S1S2 have shown that the ligand-binding domains assemble as a pair of dimers in the full-length, tetrameric receptor (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000Armstrong N. Gouaux E.

Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Activation of the GluR2 receptor involves binding of glutamate to the agonist-binding domain clamshell, followed by closure of the clamshell by approximately 21° (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Mechanisms for activation and antagonism of an AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptor: Crystal structures of the GluR2 ligand binding core.Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Because the ligand-binding domains are braced against each other in a back-to-back fashion, this simple domain closure is transduced to the ion channel domain, leading to opening of the conductive pore (Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Deactivation is simply the reverse of this process, i.e., reopening of the clamshell, closure of the conductive pathway, and release of glutamate. Current understanding of the molecular mechanism of desensitization, by contrast, is limited to observations that disruption of the nondesensitized dimer interface, as exemplified by many GluR2 S1S2 structures (Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), modulates the rate and extent of receptor desensitization. We are motivated to map the conformational changes that occur upon desensitization to understand how agonist binding is decoupled from ion channel activation, not only because the GluR2 receptor undergoes desensitization on a millisecond timescale, exhibiting less than a few percent of the “peak” or nondesensitized current at steady state (see for example Horning and Mayer, 2004Horning M.S.

Neurosci. 2002; 15: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but also because this rapid decrease in ion channel activity may play an important role in modulating synaptic currents. Traditional methods for stabilizing receptors in specific conformational states include the judicious application of mutations or the use of small-molecule agonists, antagonists, or allosteric modulators. Indeed, such techniques were crucial in establishing that the domain 1–domain 1 dimer interface in the GluR2 S1S2 crystal structures represented the nondesensitized state of the receptor (Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). By contrast, tools such as sodium thiocyanate, which stabilize the desensitized state of AMPA receptors (Bowie and Smart, 1993Bowie D. Smart T.G.

Here we apply disparate experimental approaches, including chemical modification, electrophysiology, and crystallography, to independently probe the conformational rearrangements of the extracellular glutamate-binding core subunits that accompany receptor desensitization. To minimize undesired, nonspecific reactions between thiol-directed chemical-modifying reagents and endogenous cysteine residues, we modified the full-length rat GluR2 (flip) (Sommer et al., 1990Sommer B. Keinänen K. Verdoorn T.A. Wisden W. Burnashev N. Herb A. Köhler M. Takagi T. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Flip and flop: A cell-specific functional switch in glutamate-operated channels of the CNS.Science. 1990; 249: 1580-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). We first deleted the entire amino-terminal domain (ATD). Justification for this deletion comes from studies showing that GluR2 receptors in which the ATD has been genetically removed retain ligand-binding affinities, agonist potencies, and kinetic properties similar to the wild-type receptor (Horning and Mayer, 2004Horning M.S.

Second, we mutated native, free cysteine residues in the S1S2 ligand-binding core (C425A, C436V) and the transmembrane domains of this ATD-deleted construct to either isosteric amino acids or to noncysteine amino acids present at equivalent positions in related glutamate receptors (C528Y, C589S). Of the remaining cysteine residues, two form a disulfide bond within S1S2 (C718/C773) and the third (C815) is intracellular. We refer to the ATD-deleted receptor with the three native cysteines as the GluR2 ΔATD construct, a construct that has a glutamate dose-response curve, measured by two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC), similar to the wild-type receptor (Figure S1). The GluR2 S1S2 ligand-binding core constructs contain all native cysteine residues. The nondesensitized state of the GluR2 receptor is stabilized by extensive contacts between interdigitated residues at the 2-fold related domain 1–domain 1 interface of the S1S2 ligand-binding core (Horning and Mayer, 2004Horning M.S.

To probe whether sites within the dimer interface become more accessible upon desensitization, we examined the rate of modification of the Glu486 to Cys mutant (E486C) using sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methane thiosulfonate (MTSES) (Akabas et al., 1992Akabas M.H.

Derivatization of E486C with MTSES generates an anionic side chain that is larger than glutamate. Because previous studies have shown that even conservative mutation of residues located within the dimer interface generally increases the extent of receptor desensitization (Horning and Mayer, 2004Horning M.S.

Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that modification of E486C with MTSES would also increase the extent of receptor desensitization, thereby decreasing the magnitude of “steady-state” or “plateau” current, as measured by TEVC in the presence of saturating concentrations of glutamate. To probe the cysteine accessibility of E486C under conditions that populate either the nondesensitized or desensitized states of the GluR2 receptor, we measured apparent reaction rates with MTSES under three different conditions: (1) 10 μM 6,7-dinitro-2,3-quinoxalinedione (DNQX), a competitive antagonist that will stabilize the closed-channel, nondesensitized state (Honoré et al., 1988Honoré T. Davies S.N. Drejer J. Fletcher E.J. Jacobsen P. Lodge D. Nielsen F.E. Quinoxalinediones: Potent competitive non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists.Science. 1988; 241: 701-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar); (2) 1 mM glutamate, a full agonist that will populate the closed-channel, desensitized state; and (3) 1 mM glutamate and 100 μM cyclothiazide (CTZ) (Partin et al., 1993Partin K.M. Patneau D.K. Winters C.A. Mayer M.L. Buonanno A.

Tang C.-M. Benzothiadiazines inhibit rapid glutamate receptor desensitization and enhance glutamatergic synaptic currents.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3904-3915Crossref Google Scholar), a combination of agonist and modulator that will stabilize the open channel, nondesensitized state (Figures 1B–1D). We found that MTSES modification of E486C is slow in the presence of either DNQX or glutamate and CTZ, with second-order rate constants of 101 and 15.9 M−1s−1, respectively (Figure 1E). We suggest that the slow rate of reaction of MTSES in the presence of cyclothiazide is due to the fact that cyclothiazide stabilizes the dimer interface in a compact conformation, rendering E486C relatively inaccessible to modification. It is possible that CTZ inhibited the MTSES reaction via direct steric effects because modeling the E486C cysteine into the GluR2/CTZ cocrystal structure shows that the cysteine sulfhydryl is ∼6 Å from CTZ (Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In contrast to the slow MTSES reaction rates measured under the glutamate/CTZ and DNQX conditions, the MTSES reaction rate in the presence of glutamate was 3312 M−1s−1, ∼33 times faster than in the presence of DNQX (Figure 1E). The fact that the rate of MTSES modification of E486C is at least ∼33-fold faster under conditions that populate the desensitized state than it is under conditions that populate the nondesensitized state supports two important conclusions. First, the slower reaction rate in the absence of glutamate suggests that the dimer interface is compact or occluded in the resting state, a conclusion that has, until now, been speculative. Second, the faster reaction rate of E486C under conditions that favor the desensitized state suggests that the thiol moiety is more accessible in the desensitized state. Therefore, we suggest that the domain 1–domain 1 dimer interface “opens up” and is more accessible upon transition from the non desensitized state to the desensitized state. Indeed, similar MTSES experiments on K493C, a residue that forms a salt bridge with E486 across the dimer interface in the nondesensitized conformation, yield rates of reaction of 10, 34.9, and 3016 M−1 s−1 in the closed-channel, nondesensitized state (+DNQX), the open-channel, nondesensitized state (+glutamate/CTZ), and the closed-channel, desensitized state (+glutamate), respectively, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that residues in the domain 1–domain 1 dimer interface become more accessible upon receptor desensitization. To measure the separation distance between residues in the dimer interface upon desensitization, we carried out a series of chemical modification experiments using thiol-directed bifunctional crosslinkers of four different lengths, together with three single cysteine mutants of the GluR2 ΔATD construct (Figures 2A and 2B). We hypothesized that the shorter crosslinkers will block desensitization because they will restrain the domain 1–domain 1 interface to a nondesensitized or nondesensitized-like conformation, while the longer crosslinkers will have no effect on the extent of receptor desensitization because they will not be “pulled” to their fully extended conformation upon receptor desensitization. In other words, the shorter crosslinkers will potentiate glutamate-induced equilibrium currents, while the crosslinkers that are long enough to span the desensitized conformation will not potentiate equilibrium currents. Near the “top” of the dimer interface is G739C, and all four crosslinkers potentiated glutamate-induced currents (Figure 2C). In the case of G743C, the three shortest crosslinkers potentiated equilibrium currents. However, following reaction with the longest crosslinker, the glutamate-induced equilibrium currents were actually smaller than the currents observed prior to modification. At K493C, the two shortest crosslinkers potentiated equilibrium currents, but the third shortest (18 Å) did not potentiate currents (Figure 2C; Table S1). The extent of crosslinker-induced potentiation for the three cysteine mutants ranged from 7- to 33-fold with K493C exhibiting the greatest effect from crosslinking and G743C exhibiting the least (Figure 2D). The crosslinking data, together with the crystal structure of the nondesensitized state, allow us to estimate the distance that residues 739, 743, and 493 move upon desensitization. Using the GluR2 S1S2-L483Y dimer as a model for the nondesensitized state (Sun et al., 2002Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Mechanism of glutamate receptor desensitization.Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), we modeled cysteines into positions 739, 743, and 493, choosing side chain rotomer conformations that minimized the sulfur to sulfur distances. Subtraction of the extended length of the longest potentiating crosslinker from the distance between the 2-fold related cysteine sulfur atoms yields a lower bound for the distance change accompanying desensitization (Table S1). Specifically, residues 739, 743, and 493 move more than 13.9, 9.1, and 6.9 Å apart, respectively, upon desensitization. Using the lengths of the shortest nonpotentiating crosslinkers we estimate that the distance change upon desensitization for residues 743 and 493 is less than 16.2 and 12.4 Å, respectively. These calculations reveal a pattern in which the largest movements occur at the “top” of the dimer interface and the smallest movements take place near the “bottom.” How do we know that the bifunctional crosslinkers have reacted with the desired cysteine residues and are thus faithfully measuring the conformational changes that occur upon desensitization? Using chemical and electrophysiological methods we certainly cannot prove that the crosslinkers are faithful reporters. Thus, to probe the conformational changes occurring upon desensitization using completely different approaches, we examined additional single cysteine mutants using electrophysiological and crystallographic methods. In the course of analyzing the gating properties of cysteine mutants within or adjacent to the dimer interface by TEVC, we encountered a mutant, S729C, that exhibited unusually small currents (24 nA ± 12 nA; n = 20). Neither increasing the dose of injected cRNA nor increasing the duration of oocyte incubation between cRNA injection and TEVC recording significantly increased the currents elicited by glutamate application. Surprisingly, the current magnitude was increased ∼56-fold, to 1–2 μA, following a 5 min exposure to 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Figure 3A), while the same DTT application had no effect on the parent GluR2 ΔATD construct. Analysis of oocytes injected with S729C cRNA by SDS-PAGE and western blotting demonstrated that under nonreducing conditions the majority of the protein migrated at a position that was consistent with a dimer of GluR2 ΔATD subunits. By contrast, both GluR2 ΔATD and GluR2 ΔATD K493C ran as monomers under nonreducing conditions (Figure 3B). These electrophysiological and biochemical results support the conclusion that S729C receptors spontaneously form a disulfide bond and that the non-native disulfide bond greatly reduces glutamate-induced equilibrium currents. Spontaneous disulfide bond formation by S729C was a particularly remarkable result given that in the L483Y crystal structure the hydroxyl groups of Ser729 are located >12 Å apart, much too large a distance to yield the efficiency of disulfide bonding observed in our experiment. For comparison, the distance between cysteines modeled into position K493C was much less, only ∼5.6 Å, but we observed no spontaneous disulfide bond formation with this mutant (Figure 3B). These observations led us to hypothesize that under ambient oxidizing conditions, subunits of the GluR2 ΔATD S729C receptor were held together by a disulfide bond in an interface not observed in previous crystal structures. To probe the specificity of spontaneous disulfide bond formation between adjacent subunits by way of DTT sensitivity, we examined eight additional cysteine mutants. Seven of the mutation sites were located on the S1S2 surface within ∼20 Å of S729. The eighth site was located in loop 2. Mutants were tested for DTT sensitivity by measuring currents before and after a 5 min exposure to 2 mM DTT (Figure 3C). Six of the mutants exhibited no significant change in glutamate-induced equilibrium currents following DTT exposure. For two mutants, I664C and G725C, DTT application resulted in potentiation of 3.6- and 2.8-fold, respectively. Mapping the effects of DTT modulation to the S1S2 surface showed that the DTT-sensitive phenotype is localized to a domain 2 face that contains the beginning of the second interdomain β strand (G725 and S729) and the loop connecting helices F and G (I664) (Figure 3D). How does the S729C mutation diminish glutamate-induced ion channel activity? Does the mutant stabilize a resting (inactive) state or a desensitized-like state? If S729C receptors were trapped in the resting state or if disulfide bonding compromised the conformational change leading to receptor activation (i.e., domain closure), then we would expect the receptors to have an increased agonist dissociation constant (KD) or agonist potency (EC50) for ligands such as glutamate or AMPA. To directly determine KD values, we carried out 3H-AMPA binding assays. Binding measurements were performed under nonreducing conditions on membranes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing the parent ΔATD and S729C constructs in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to receptors' C termini. Fluorescence measurements and western blots showed that the mutant protein was expressed at substantially lower levels than the ΔATD control and thus accounted for the smaller Bmax value for S729C relative to ΔATD (Figure S2). Nonetheless, we found that S729C retained high-affinity 3H-AMPA binding; the KD values for S729C and ΔATD were 27.2 nM and 36.2 nM, respectively (Figure S2). These values are representative of agonist binding to the desensitized state, as shown previously from measurements carried out in the absence or presence of CTZ (Hall et al., 1993Hall R.A. Kessler M. Quan A. Ambros-Ingerson J. Lynch G.

Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 123-131Google Scholar). To verify that the 3H-AMPA KD measured for nonreduced S729C did not simply reflect binding to a subpopulation of nondisulfide bonded receptors, we measured total 3H-AMPA binding counts for ΔATD and S729C in the absence and presence of 2 mM DTT. This concentration of DTT is sufficient to reduce the disulfide bond for >99% of S729C receptors (data not shown). Inclusion of 2 mM DTT in the binding buffer did not change the total counts measured for S729C, indicating that disulfide bonding does not prevent high-affinity AMPA binding (Figure S2). Evaluation of whether the S729C mutation altered glutamate potency (EC50) in a TEVC experiment was complicated by the fact that the glutamate-induced currents prior to reduction were small (i.e., 20 nA) and that following reduction the currents were subject to rapid rundown. Thus it was not possible to accurately determine a glutamate dose-response curve. To circumvent these problems we made the S729H mutant, with the hope of generating a variant of S729C in which the currents were larger and where the addition of Zn+2 would mimic the S729C disulfide bond. Unfortunately, S729H was insensitive to zinc, perhaps because the histidine residues were improperly oriented for zinc binding. However, introduction of a histidine at"

All vertebrates examined to date are known to express at least two isoforms of non-muscle myosin II, referred to as myosin IIA and myosin IIB. Studies of myosin IIA and IIB in cultured cells and null mice suggest that these isoforms perform distinct functions. However, how each myosin II isoform contributes individually to all the cellular functions attributed to “myosin II” has yet to be fully characterized. Using isoform-specific small-interfering RNAs, we found that depletion of either isoform resulted in opposing migration phenotypes, with myosin IIA- and IIB-depleted cells exhibiting higher and lower wound healing migration rates, respectively. In addition, myosin IIA-depleted cells demonstrated impaired thrombin-induced cell rounding and undertook a more motile morphology, exhibiting decreased amounts of stress fibers and focal adhesions, with concomitant increases in cellular protrusions. Cells depleted of myosin IIB, however, were efficient in thrombin-induced cell rounding, displayed a more retractile phenotype, and maintained focal adhesions but only in the periphery. Last, we present evidence that Rho kinase preferentially regulates phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain associated with myosin IIA.

Nonmuscle myosin II (henceforth, myosin II) is a ubiquitous molecular motor that binds and contracts filamentous actin (F-actin) in an ATP-dependent manner (1Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys.

The forces that are generated by contraction of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton contribute to a diverse array of cellular processes in a variety of cell types, including cytokinesis (3Satterwhite L.L.

The latter is a highly complex process in which cells can participate either as isolated individuals, such as neuroblast migration during development or tumor cell metastasis, or as groups, as exemplified by the coordinated movement of epithelial sheets during dorsal closure or wound healing. The process of cell migration is often described as a cycle of coordinated steps (8Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 9Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R.

Last, the cell undergoes contraction, in which the cell body translocates forward accompanied by tail detachment and retraction. Although myosin II is thought to perform multiple functions during the migration cycle, one aspect of cell migration for which a clear requirement for myosin II-based contractility has been demonstrated is the regulation of focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are integrin-based, large multimolecular assemblies that form a structural bridge between the substrate and the actin cytoskeleton (10Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Efficient migration requires the proper coordination of adhesion assembly in the front and de-adhesion in the rear (11Huttenlocher A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and myosin II shares an intimate relationship with focal adhesions as their assembly, maturation, and dynamics (12Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M.

Development. 1995; 121: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that Drosophila and Dictyostelium harbor only a single myosin II molecule, whereas vertebrates are known to express three distinct myosin IIs, referred to as myosin IIA, IIB, and IIC (1Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 19Golomb E. Ma X. Jana S.S. Preston Y.A. Kawamoto S. Shoham N.G. Goldin E. Conti M.A. Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S.

Res. 1991; 69: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Myosin II is a hexameric molecule comprised of a pair of heavy chains, a pair of essential light chains, and a pair of regulatory light chains (RLCs) 4The abbreviations used are: RLC, myosin regulatory light chain; IIA, nonmuscle myosin IIA; IIB, nonmuscle myosin IIB; IIC, nonmuscle myosin IIC; siRNA, small-interfering RNA; ROCK, Rho kinase. (2Bresnick A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The distinction between the three myosin II molecules is based upon their unique heavy chain isoforms. Interestingly, each isoform performs the same basic molecular function, which is the binding and contraction of F-actin in an ATP-dependent manner, and the activities of all three are thought to be regulated in a similar fashion; that is, through phosphorylation of the RLC (2Bresnick A.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Thus, how each myosin II isoform performs different cellular functions in vivo is not understood. In this study we identified distinct functions of myosin IIA and IIB (hereafter IIA and IIB, respectively) in epithelial cell sheet migration and thrombin-induced cell rounding. Our data demonstrate that these isoforms are differentially required for cell rounding, and each isoform uniquely contributes to the proper regulation of protrusions and adhesions and, thus, proper migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of the RLC associated with IIA or IIB is differentially regulated by Rho kinase, suggesting that at least part of how IIA and IIB perform discrete cellular functions is via selective regulation downstream from different signaling pathways.

Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was from Molecular Probes (#R415), and Y-27632 was from Calbiochem (#688000). Cell Line and Culture Conditions—The cell lines used in this study were the epithelial-derived, lung carcinoma A549 cell line and the epithelial-derived, breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell line. Both lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated for A549) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% C02 at 37 °C. Myosin Heavy Chain Small-inhibitory RNAs (siRNA) Depletion—All sense and antisense siRNA oligos were synthesized by Dharmacon RNA Technologies and annealed. Target sequences for human myosin II isoforms are nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (siIIA#1, TCTTGTGCTACTCTAGGA; siIIA#2, GATCAATCCATCTTGTGCA), nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIB (siIIB#1, GACCACTGTGGACTCTAAA; siIIB#2, GTGGTATTACAGACATTCA), and firefly luciferase (GL2) for negative control. Transfection of siRNA (200 pmol) was performed using Oligofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were ∼30–40% confluent at the time of transfection. Assays were performed on the siRNA-depleted cells 96 h post-transfection, the time of maximum depletion. Cells were allowed to incubate with siRNA at least 24 h before changing media or replating for assays. All phenotypes examined were verified with both sets of siRNA, but all data shown were collected using siIIA#1 and siIIB#1, except where indicated. Wound Healing Assay—Control and siIIA- and siIIB-transfected A549 cells were replated on plastic culture dishes 48 h post-transfection and cultured for an additional 48 h to produce a confluent monolayer. Wounds were made in the monolayer using a Cell Lifter (Costar #3008), producing a wound of ∼250 μm. Loose cells were washed off, and fresh media was added to the cells immediately after wounding. Images were obtained of the wounds at various times after wounding using a Nikon CoolPix 5700 digital camera fitted to the eyepiece port of a Zeiss Axiovert 10 microscope using a MaxView Plus Adapter System from ScopeTronix (#STMVP). Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop CS, and wound widths were measured based on images of a 5-mm micrometer treated in the same manner. Distance migrated was calculated as the difference between the wound width at the time of the image and the initial wound width. Rate of wound closure was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of the plot of distance migrated versus time, combining the results from four separate experiments. Video Microscopy—Videos of wound healing migration were made of wounds that were prepared in the same way as the wound healing assay, except the cells were replated onto fibronectin-coated (50 μg/ml) glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek #P35G-0-10-C). Images of migrating cells were obtained every 5 min for 8 h (control and IIA-depleted cells) or 16 h (IIB-depleted cells) using a Zeiss axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a heated and humidified incubation chamber and a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER cooled charge-coupled device camera (Zeiss). Images were processed using Metamorph Image software (Universal Imaging). Time stamps were adjusted to reflect time after wounding. For videos of isolated cell migration the control, siIIA- and siIIB-transfected A549 cells were replated at low density onto fibronectin-coated (50 μg/ml) glass bottom microwell dishes 48 h post-transfection and cultured for an additional 48 h. Before imaging the medium was changed to Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen #21083-027) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, and antibiotics. Images were acquired every 3 min for 2 h using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope with a heated stage and a Nikon DXM 1200-F digital camera. Images were processed using Metamorph Image software (Universal Imaging). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Control and siIIA- and siIIB-transfected cells were replated on fibronectin-coated (50 μg/ml) 22 × 22-mm coverslips in 6-well plates 48 h post-transfection and cultured for an additional 48 h. Cells were fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7) for 15–20 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by either a 1-h incubation at room temperature or an overnight incubation at 4 °C with the described anti-vinculin, anti-IIA, or anti-IIB antibodies diluted to 1:50–1:100 in blocking buffer followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. F-actin was labeled using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin diluted to 33 nm in blocking buffer and incubated for 5–10 min. Coverslips were mounted onto slides using Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes #P7481) with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize DNA. Images were obtained on a Zeiss AxioImager.D1 coupled with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm monochrome cooled-CCD camera and analyzed with AxioVision software release 4.4. Cell Spreading Assay—Control and siIIA- and siIIB-transfected A549 cells were released into a monocellular suspension using the non-trypsin Cellstripper solution (Cellgro #25-056-CI) 48 h post-transfection and replated (5 × 104) onto fibronectin-coated (50 μg/ml) 22 × 22-mm coverslips in 6-well plates and allowed to spread for an additional 48 h. These cells were then fixed, and F-actin was labeled with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin as described above. For Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibition, wild type cells were incubated with Y-27632 (10 μm) for 2 h before fixation. Images of the phalloidin-stained cells were obtained on a Zeiss AxioImager.D1 coupled with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm monochrome cooled-CCD camera. The cell areas marked by phalloidin were traced and calculated using AxioVision software release 4.4. The histograms represent the combined data from three separate experiments, with 30 cells measured per experiment. Cell Rounding Assay—Control and siIIA- and siIIB-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 104) were replated on fibronectin-coated (50 μg/ml) 22 × 22-mm coverslips in 6-well plates 48 h post-transfection and cultured for an additional 48 h. The cells were starved of serum overnight (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, and antibiotics), which induced a flattened morphology. The cells were then treated with starvation media containing 1 unit/ml human α-thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories) for 30 min and immediately fixed in paraformaldehyde. To visualize the cells, F-actin was labeled with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, as described above. For ROCK inhibition, control siRNA-transfected cells were pretreated with 10 μm Y-27632 for 20 min before thrombin treatment. Images of four random high-power fields were obtained on a Zeiss AxioImager.D1 coupled with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm monochrome cooled-CCD camera, and the percent of rounded cells was determined. Data represent the mean ± S.E. from three separate experiments, with ∼150 cells counted from each experiment. Immunoprecipitation Assay—MDA-MB-231 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated in 10-cm culture dishes and grown to 80% confluency, then starved of serum overnight (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, and antibiotics). Cells were then treated with thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 5 min with or without a 20-min pretreatment of 10 μm Y-27632. After thrombin treatment the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by lysis in buffer C (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na4P2O7 (pH 6.75), 100 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm ATP, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were briefly sonicated, then cleared by spinning for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge 5415 C. For immunoprecipitation, 800–1500 μg of total lysate was diluted to ∼1.5–2 μg/μl with buffer C and incubated with either 5 μg of IIA or 10 μg of IIB antibody on a rocker overnight at 4 °C. After overnight incubation, 25 μl of a 1:3 slurry of prewashed protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (GE Healthcare, formerly Amersham Biosciences #17-0780-01) were added and incubated for an additional 1.5 h on the rocker. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with 300 μl of buffer C, then boiled in 3× SDS sample buffer for 5 min. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. To make the loading across isoforms equivalent, ∼25% of the immunoprecipitate loaded for IIB was loaded for IIA. For quantification of RLC phosphorylated on Ser-19 (P-RLC(Ser-19)) stimulation, the immunoblots were scanned and subjected to densitometry analysis using Odyssey v1.2 software. Loading was corrected by the amount of myosin II heavy chain in each lane. The corrected phosphorylation values from the thrombin ± Y-27632-treated samples were divided by the basal values from the starved, unstimulated samples to determine the -fold thrombin-induced phosphorylation. The data are represented as the mean of three separate experiments plus S.E. In Vivo [32P]Orthophosphate Labeling and Immunoprecipitation Assay—This immunoprecipitation assay was performed the same as above, except after overnight serum starvation the cells were incubated in phosphate-free media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without sodium phosphate (Invitrogen #11971-025) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and antibiotics) for 2 h followed by labeling with 3 ml of phosphate-free media containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (GE Healthcare #PB-13) for 3 h. Cells were treated with thrombin with or without Y-27632 and lysed as described above except without sonication. After separation of the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE, the gel was silver-stained and dried for PhosphorImager analysis. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into myosin IIA and IIB heavy chains, as well as the RLC was quantified using a PhosphorImager 445 SI scanner (GE Healthcare) along with IPLab Gel version 1.5 software (Signal Analytics Corp.). The radioactivity in each band was corrected by the amount of myosin II heavy chain immunoprecipitated, which was determined by densitometry analysis of the silver-stained gel using Odyssey Version 1.2 software. The corrected phosphorylation values from the thrombin ± Y-27632-treated samples were divided by the basal values from the starved, unstimulated samples to determine the -fold thrombin-induced phosphorylation. The data are represented as the mean of five separate experiments plus S.E. Data Analysis—All data were analyzed using Statview 5.0.1 (SAS Institute Inc.). For the wound healing assay the regression for each treatment represents the combined data from four separate experiments. The differences between the regressions for each treatment were compared via analysis of covariance. For the cell spreading assay cell areas are represented both as histograms and as the means ± S.E. The histograms were analyzed first non-parametrically by the global Kruskal-Wallis test incorporating all variables followed by the Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons. All other results presented as the means ± S.E. were analyzed first by analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference to characterize pairwise comparisons. Significance for all tests was assumed at p < 0.05. siRNA Depletion of IIA or IIB Has Opposing Effects on Epithelial Cell Wound Healing Migration—When a wound is introduced into a monolayer of epithelial cells, the cells on both sides of the wound migrate coordinately as sheets in an effort to “close” the wound. To examine the distinct roles of IIA and IIB in epithelial sheet migration, we developed isoform-specific siRNAs to characterize the loss-of-function phenotypes associated with depletion of each isoform. Western blots of whole-cell extracts from cultured A549 cells (Fig. 1A) demonstrate that this cell line expresses both IIA and IIB and that we could successfully deplete one isoform without affecting the levels of the other isoform. To verify that the phenotypes observed with siRNA were specific, we designed two siRNAs for each isoform that targeted different regions of the mRNA transcripts. All phenotypes were reproduced with both siRNAs for each isoform. We first characterized the effect depletion of IIA or IIB had on the ability of epithelial cells to perform wound healing migration. Fig. 1B demonstrates that control cells (A549 cells transfected with siRNA directed against luciferase) reproducibly closed the wound at a rate of 9.0 ± 0.5 μm/h. siRNA depletion of IIA or IIB both resulted in changes in the rate of wound closure but, interestingly, the changes occurred in opposite directions. Specifically, IIA-depleted cells exhibited a 2-fold increase (18.0 ± 1.1 μm/h) in the rate of wound closure, whereas IIB-depleted cells covered the cell-free area at a rate ∼60% that of control cells (5.3 ± 0.6 μm/h). The differences in the rate of wound closure for both the IIA- and IIB-depleted cells were statistically significant from that of the control cells (p < 0.0001). ROCK is a regulator of myosin II activity as it promotes RLC phosphorylation (21Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been used to examine the cellular functions of myosin II. Our data show that inhibition of ROCK with 10 μm Y-27632 resulted in an increase in the rate of A549 wound closure that was significantly different from control but not IIA-depleted cells (22 ± 3 μm/h). Small molecule inhibitors of ROCK in previous studies have had varied effects on cell migration, depending on cell type and migration model. Although ROCK inhibitors have been shown to decrease the transwell migration of PC3 prostatic carcinoma cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (26Somlyo A.V. Bradshaw D. Ramos S. Murphy C. Myers C.E. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 27Somlyo A.V. Phelps C. Dipierro C. Eto M. Read P. Barrett M. Gibson J.J. Burnitz M.C. Myers C. Somlyo A.P. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the increase in A549 cell wound closure rate observed with Y-27632 treatment here is consistent with reports demonstrating that inhibition of ROCK leads to increases in the rate of fibroblast wound migration (28Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). IIA and IIB Distinctly Regulate Cellular Protrusions—In examining videos of control and IIA- and IIB-depleted cells migrating into a wound, we observed marked differences in membrane ruffling and lamellipodial protrusions between the cell types (Fig. 2 and supplemental Videos 1–3). Control cells entering the wound (Fig. 2 and supplemental Video 1) extended a generally broad, less phase-dense lamellipodial skirt that underwent repetitive periods of extension and retraction. IIA-depleted cells, however, exhibited a leading edge that was highly protrusive and one that retracted back toward the cell body less frequently than the control cells (Fig. 2 and supplemental Video 2). The lamellipodia of IIA-depleted cells also extended further into the wound, with extremely broad protrusions that often developed narrower, finger-like projections at the very front. In contrast, IIB-depleted cells exhibited diminished membrane ruffling and did not generate sustained protrusions (Fig. 2 and supplemental Video 3). The distinct lamellipodia exhibited by the control and IIA- and IIB-depleted cells were examined further by fixation of cells migrating into a wound followed by visualization of the actin cytoskeleton via staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. The top panel of Fig. 3 demonstrates that the extended lamellipodia exhibited by control A549 cells contained bundles of F-actin, which most frequently formed parallel to the direction of protrusion (Fig. 3, arrow in top panel). The regions of the lamellipodia around these bundles stained brightly with phalloidin but appeared more diffuse, with little ultrastructure visible in the light microscope (Fig. 3, arrowhead in the top panel). This latter pattern of phalloidin staining is consistent with an organization of F-actin into a fine meshwork and is characteristic of lamellipodial protrusions (28Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). The leading edges of IIA-depleted cells displayed few to no bundles of F-actin, and the lamellipodia were very broad and thin compared with those of the control cells (Fig. 3, middle panel). At the other extreme, the lamellipodia extended by the IIB-depleted cells were small (Fig. 3, arrow in bottom panel). Furthermore, these cells formed prominent bundles of F-actin that ran along the leading edge, parallel to the wound (Fig. 3, arrowhead in bottom panel), rather than orthogonal to the wound as in the control cells. The cytoskeletal dynamics that occur during cell spreading are commonly considered to be similar to the events occurring at the leading edge of migrating cells (29Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar); thus, we also examined the effects of IIA or IIB depletion as well as Y-27632 treatment on the ability of A549 cells to spread on fibronectin. An examination of the distribution of control cell areas after spreading revealed a bell-shaped curve that skewed slightly to the right and averaged 1820 ± 65 um2 (Fig. 4). Consistent with their decreased migration and more retractile morphology, IIB-depleted cells were significantly less well spread than the controls with a mean cell area of 1100 ± 49 um2. In contrast, the spread areas of cells depleted of IIA or treated with Y-27632 were both significantly skewed to the right, demonstrating mean cell areas of 2380 ± 78 and 2620 ± 91 um2, respectively. These cell-spreading phenotypes correlate strongly with the migration and protrusion phenotypes observed in the wound healing assay. Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of Rho-ROCK signaling and myosin II activity result in increased cellular protrusions all around the cell, lead"
https://openalex.org/W1988487570,"In most organisms, low ethanol doses induce increased activity, while high doses are sedating. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we isolated Drosophila mutants with altered ethanol responsiveness. Mutations in white rabbit (whir), disrupting RhoGAP18B, are strongly resistant to the sedating effects of ethanol. This resistance can be suppressed by reducing the levels of Rho1 or Rac, implicating these GTPases in the behavioral response to ethanol. Indeed, expression of constitutively active forms of Rho1 or Rac1 in adult flies results in ethanol resistance similar to that observed in whir mutants. The whir locus produces several transcripts, RA–RD, which are predicted to encode three distinct RhoGAPs that share only the GAP domain. The RC transcript mediates the sedating effects of ethanol, while the RA transcript regulates its stimulant effects. Thus, distinct RhoGAPs, encoded by the same gene, regulate different manifestations of acute ethanol intoxication."
https://openalex.org/W2101336273,"Cells in tendon deposit parallel arrays of collagen fibrils to form a functional tissue, but how this is achieved is unknown. The cellular mechanism is thought to involve the formation of intracellular collagen fibrils within Golgi to plasma membrane carriers. This is facilitated by the intracellular processing of procollagen to collagen by members of the tolloid and ADAMTS families of enzymes. The carriers subsequently connect to the extracellular matrix via finger-like projections of the plasma membrane, known as fibripositors. In this study we have shown, using three-dimensional electron microscopy, the alignment of fibripositors with intracellular fibrils as well as an orientated cable of actin filaments lining the cytosolic face of a fibripositor. To demonstrate a specific role for the cytoskeleton in coordinating extracellular matrix assembly, cytochalasin was used to disassemble actin filaments and nocodazole or colchicine were used to disrupt microtubules. Microtubule disruption delayed procollagen transport through the secretory pathway, but fibripositor numbers were unaffected. Actin filament disassembly resulted in rapid loss of fibripositors and a subsequent disappearance of intracellular fibrils. Procollagen secretion or processing was not affected by cytochalasin treatment, but the parallelism of extracellular collagen fibrils was altered. In this case a significant proportion of collagen fibrils were found to no longer be orientated with the long axis of the tendon.

The results suggest an important role for the actin cytoskeleton in the alignment and organization of the collagenous extracellular matrix in embryonic tendon. Collagen fibrils are indeterminate in length, range in diameter from 10-500 nm (depending on the tissue and stage of development), and are some of the largest protein polymers in animals. The fibrils are comprised of individual triple helical collagen molecules arranged in a pseudo quarter-staggered array to produce fibrils with a 67-nm periodic axial repeat (the D-periodicity) (1Chapman J.A. Tzaphlidou M. Meek K.M. Kadler K.E. Electron Microsc. Rev. 1990; 3: 143-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the fibrils is beginning to be understood, but the mechanism of how cells orchestrate the three-dimensional arrangement of fibrils in different tissues remains elusive. Tendon contains the simplest fibrillar architecture in that virtually all the fibrils are aligned in the same direction, along the long axis of the tendon. The parallel arrangement of the fibrils is determined early in tendon development and appears to be coordinated by tendon fibroblast cells that actively synthesize large amounts of collagen (2Birk D.E. Trelstad R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Collagen is synthesized as a proform, known as procollagen (3Bellamy G. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1138-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 4Schofield, J. D., and Prockop, D. J. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 97, 175-195Google Scholar), which contains N- and C-propeptides that are removed to facilitate fibril formation (5Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Processing of procollagen to collagen occurs partly within the extracellular matrix and partly inside tendon fibroblasts (6Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Tendon fibroblasts in situ have a highly convoluted three-dimensional shape, in contrast to fibroblasts in cell culture which are flattened, and are associated with intracellular and extracellular collagen fibrils (7Yang G.C. Birk D.E. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1986; 97: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Specifically, collagen fibrils can be found completely enclosed within tendon cells in vivo and also within plasma membrane structures that protrude from the surface of the cell, known as fibripositors (6Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The fibripositors are co-aligned with the collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix and with the long axis of the tendon. These observations led to the hypothesis that collagen fibrils are formed inside the late secretory pathway of tendon fibroblasts by the processing of procollagen to collagen and are secreted via fibripositors by a mechanism that produces a parallel arrangement of collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix (8Canty E.G. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the cytoskeleton of the cell could therefore be involved in the parallelism of extracellular collagen fibrils (9Olsen B.R. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 73-74Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The role of microtubules and actin filaments in cells actively producing procollagen has been investigated. Using colchicine to disassemble microtubules, procollagen secretion was inhibited in bone (10Ehrlich H.P. Ross R. Bornstein P. J.

Using cytochalasin B to disassemble actin filaments in cranial bone explants, heterogeneous effects on procollagen secretion were observed (10Ehrlich H.P. Ross R. Bornstein P. J.

To test the hypothesis that the cytoskeleton controls the formation and secretion of collagen fibrils through fibripositor-like structures in developing tendon, the effect of the disruption of microtubules (using nocodazole and colchicine) and actin filaments (using cytochalasin B) was investigated. The secretion of procollagen was investigated using a previously established pulse-chase protocol for embryonic tendon explants, the relative numbers of cell-associated collagen fibrils were determined by serial section transmission electron microscopy, and direct visualization of actin filaments and microtubules was achieved by electron tomography. Pulse-Chase Analysis of Procollagen Processing and Secretion— Reagents were obtained from Invitrogen or Sigma unless otherwise stated. Fertile hens eggs were supplied by Joice and Hill Poultry Ltd. (Peterborough, UK) and metatarsal tendons obtained from day 13 chick embryos. Pulse-chase experiments were performed at 37 °C in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/nutrient mix F12 containing Pen-Strep (1% v/v), l-glutamine (2 mm), l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (200 μm), and β-aminopropionitrile (400 μm) and supplemented with Me2SO (0.1% v/v), nocodazole (10 μm, 0.1% v/v Me2SO), cytochalasin (10 μm, 0.1% v/v Me2SO), or colchicine (100 μm) as required. Pulse-chase experiments were performed at 37 °C; tendons were pre-equilibrated for 0.5-3 h, labeled for 10 min with 2.5 μCi/ml of [14C]proline (Amersham Biosciences), and then transferred to unlabeled medium for 15 min to 3 h. Pulse-chase was stopped by transferring the tendons to EDTA (25 mm), Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5) at 4 °C. Tendons subjected to pulsechase analysis in 1-ml aliquots of supplemented medium were then extracted in 100-μl aliquots of salt extraction buffer (NaCl (1 m), EDTA (25 mm), Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5)) containing protease inhibitors and supplemented as required with Nonidet P-40 detergent (1% v/v). A concentrated stock solution of protease inhibitors was made using EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Tendons were extracted in four changes of salt extraction buffer: overnight (S1), 6 h (S2), overnight (S3), 6 h (S4), and overnight in salt extraction buffer containing Nonidet P-40 (N). Extracts were analyzed on 4% precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. The gels were fixed for 2 × 20 min in methanol (10% v/v) with acetic acid (10% v/v) and dried under vacuum. The gels were exposed to a BAS-MS phosphorimaging plate (Fujifilm) that was processed using an FLA3000 phosphorimager (Fujifilm). The relative amounts of procollagen, pCcollagen, pNcollagen, and fully processed collagen (collectively denoted *collagen) in the salt (S1) and detergent (N) extracts were determined by densitometry using AIDA 2.0 software. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Metatarsal tendons were obtained from day 13 chick embryos. Following incubation in nocodazole (10 μm, 0.1% v/v Me2SO), cytochalasin (10 μm, 0.1% v/v Me2SO), or Me2SO (0.1% v/v) for 1 h, tissues were fixed for 2 h at room temperature in glutaraldehyde (2.5% v/v) in sodium cacodylate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.3). After washing three times in sodium cacodylate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.3) for 10 min they were post-fixed in osmium tetroxide (1% w/v) in sodium cacodylate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.3) for 2 h. After washing three times in distilled water for 10 min they were en block stained with aqueous uranyl acetate (0.5% w/v) overnight. The samples were then dehydrated in a graded acetone series and embedded in Spurr's resin. Embryonic mouse tails (15.5 dpc) were incubated in nocodazole (10 μm, 0.1% v/v Me2SO), cytochalasin (10 μm, 0.1% v/v Me2SO), or Me2SO (0.1% v/v) for 30 min or 3 h and fixed in glutaraldehyde (2%) in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.0) for 30 min at room temperature and then for 2 h at 4 °Cin fresh fixative. After washing in phosphate buffer (200 mm) they were fixed in glutaraldehyde (2% v/v) with osmium tetroxide (1% w/v) in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.2) for 40 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing in distilled water they were en bloc stained with aqueous uranyl acetate (1% w/v) at 4 °C overnight. The samples were then dehydrated in a graded acetone series, treated with propylene oxide for 10 min at room temperature, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultrathin (60-70 nm) sections were collected on uncoated copper 200 grids and stained with lead citrate (0.3% in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide) for 1 min. Sections were examined on a FEI Tecnai 12 Biotwin transmission electron microscope and images recorded on 4498 film (Kodak) and digitized using an Imacon Flextight 848 scanner (Precision Camera and Video). Image Analysis—The numbers of transverse sections of lumen containing collagen fibrils within the main body of the cell and within cellular projections (see Fig. 3A) were quantified from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 2The abbreviations used are: TEM, transmission electron microscopy; dpc, days post coitum; LPC, large pleiomorphic carrier; pCcollagen, procollagen lacking the N-propeptides but retaining the C-propeptides; pNcollagen, procollagen lacking the C-propeptides but retaining the N-propeptides. images of embryonic tendons incubated in nocodazole (10 μm, 0.1% v/v Me2SO), cytochalasin (10 μm, 0.1% v/v Me2SO), or Me2SO (0.1% v/v). Using a magnification of ×4800, 6 non-overlapping images per treatment (1-h incubation) for the embryonic chick metatarsal tendon samples and 15-20 separate tendon fascicles per treatment (30 min- or 3-h incubation) from the embryonic mouse tail samples were analyzed. Cellular projections containing collagen fibrils were determined to have a roughly elliptical profile with a diameter of ≤320 nm across the minor axis and to contain no other cellular organelles. Counts were normalized for the number of nuclei profiles observed to obtain relative counts of the numbers of cell-associated fibrils and expressed as the mean ± S.D. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or using a t test as appropriate. To determine the percentage of extracellular fibrils that were sectioned at an oblique angle in transverse sections of embryonic tendons incubated in cytochalasin (10 μm, 0.1% v/v Me2SO) or Me2SO (0.1% v/v) for 3 h, the extracellular collagen fibrils or bundles of fibrils were traced using IMOD (22Kremer J.R. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (3581) Google Scholar, 23Mastronarde D.N. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Oblique fibrils were classified as those in which the length of the fibrillar profile was observed to be more than three times the width of a collagen fibril. The relative areas of the oblique and transverse profiles were then used to calculate the percentage of extracellular fibrils that were oblique rather than transverse in 15-17 separate fascicles per treatment. The results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. and analyzed using a t test. Electron Tomography and Three-dimensional Reconstruction— Embryonic mouse tails (15.5 dpc) were prepared for electron microscopy and serial section reconstruction performed as described (6Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Semi-thick (300 nm) serial sections were also collected on formvar-coated copper slot grids and dosed with 10 nm gold colloid on both surfaces. Orthogonal dual-axis tilt series were collected using a FEI Tecnai F30 intermediate voltage electron microscope operating at 300 kV (University of Colorado, Boulder). Tomograms were generated and contours modeled in IMOD. Disruption of Microtubules Retards Procollagen Secretion and Interaction with Processing Enzymes—To investigate the relative contributions of microtubules and actin filaments to the intracellular trafficking and secretion of procollagen, pulse-chase analysis was carried out in freshly dissected chick embryonic metatarsal tendons in the presence of nocodazole or cytochalasin B. Nocodazole prevents the addition of tubulin to microtubules resulting in microtubule depolymerization, and cytochalasin B is a fungal toxin that inhibits actin polymerization and results in actin filament disassembly. This type of pulse-chase experiment has been optimized with a pulse time of 10 min in [14C]proline to specifically label type I procollagen and chase times of up to 3 h, at which point most of the procollagen has been secreted and processed at both the N- and C-propeptides to collagen (6Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Subsequent extractions first remove extracellular proteins using a buffer containing 1 m NaCl and then intracellular proteins in the same buffer supplemented with the detergent Nonidet P-40. Supplementing the cultures with nocodazole resulted in a delay in the processing of procollagen to collagen and in the transfer of labeled type I collagen- and procollagen-processing intermediates from the intracellular detergent extract to the extracellular salt extract (Fig. 1). Cytochalasin B had no effect on the procollagen processing and secretion profile in this system. These results suggest that microtubules are involved in the transport of procollagen through the secretory pathway. To confirm this result the pulse-chase analysis was repeated in the presence of colchicine. Colchicine acts in a similar manner to nocodazole but is soluble in water. Secretion and processing of procollagen were also found to be retarded in the presence of colchicine (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Effect of colchicine on collagen secretion and processing in embryonic chick metatarsal tendon. A, pulse-chase analysis was carried out with or without the addition of colchicine (100 μm) for the chase times indicated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bands corresponding to each of the type I procollagen processing intermediates are indicated (H, procollagen; , pCcollagen; , pNcollagen; -, collagen, where the upper band in each lane corresponds to the α1 chain and the lower band to the α2 chain for each intermediate. B, the relative amounts of labeled procollagen, pCcollagen, pNcollagen, and fully processed collagen (collectively denoted *collagen) in each lane were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The proportion of *collagen in the intracellular (N) extract at each time point (x-axis) was then expressed as a percentage (y-axis) to assess the rate of collagen secretion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Disruption of Actin Filaments Results in Rapid Loss of Fibripositor-like Structures from Embryonic Tendon Fibroblasts in Situ—Chick embryonic tendons (E13) and whole embryonic mouse tails (15.5 dpc) were incubated in medium supplemented with nocodazole or cytochalasin. Transmission electron microscopy revealed no gross morphological differences between tendon fibroblasts following treatment (data not shown), consistent with cell survival during the course of the experiment. To investigate the relationship between collagen fibrils and cellular membranes, the numbers of collagen fibrils observed either within fibripositor-like cellular projections or within the main body of the cell in transverse section were quantified. In samples treated with cytochalasin B the number of cellular projections containing collagen fibrils was significantly reduced (Fig. 3). Continued Inhibition of Actin Polymerization Disturbs the Parallelism of Extracellular Fibrils and Coincides with a Loss of Intracellular Fibril Profiles but Does Not Affect Procollagen Processing or Secretion—Longer (3 h) incubations with cytochalasin B caused gross morphological changes in embryonic mouse tail tendon, including speckling on the surface of the fibrils (Fig. 4A), apparent death of cells surrounding the developing tendons (not shown), and disturbances to the orientation of the extracellular fibril bundles (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the number of cellular projections containing collagen fibrils and the number of collagen fibrils observed in the main body of the cell were reduced in both embryonic mouse tail tendon (Fig. 4C) and chick embryonic tendon (not shown). To investigate whether procollagen processing and secretion would be affected by longer incubations with cytochalasin B, the pulse-chase experiment was repeated using preincubation times of 1, 2, and 3 h. Surprisingly, incubation times of up to 3 h had no effect on the pulse-chase profile (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Prolonged incubation with cytochalasin does not affect procollagen processing or secretion. Pulse-chase analysis was carried out in the presence of cytochalasin (10 μm) after a 1-, 2-, or 3-h preincubation time as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The chase time was 30 min. Similar results were obtained for a 1-h chase time. Bands corresponding to each of the type I procollagen processing intermediates are indicated (H, procollagen; , pC collagen; , pN collagen; -, collagen where the upper band in each lane corresponds to the α1 chain and the lower band to the α2 chain for each intermediate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Intracellular Fibrils as Well as Fibripositor Structures Are Aligned with the Tendon Axis—To show the coalignment of intracellular collagen fibrils and fibripositors, membrane-associated collagen fibrils were tracked through a 250-section series (corresponding to a tissue depth of 21.4 μm). These were then classified as fibripositor-associated (blue) or intracellular (green) fibrils. Those located within the main body of the cell but connected to a fibripositor were also identified (green). The results showed that the intracellular fibrils and those in fibripositors were aligned with the long axis of the tendon (Fig. 6). Collagen Fibrils inside a Fibripositor Are Parallel to Cytoskeletal Actin Filaments—Automated electron tomography of serial semi-thick (300 nm) sections of mouse tail tendon (15.5 dpc) was used to obtain a detailed three-dimensional image of the cytoskeletal elements surrounding the base of a fibripositor. This is not possible with lower resolution techniques such as light microscopy or by electron microscopy of thin sections, which shows superimposed details in projection. Electron tomography permitted examination of the three-dimensional arrangement of the cytoskeleton in the vicinity of the fibripositor. Furthermore, using serial semi-thick sections in combination with electron tomography it was possible to obtain structural information from a suitable volume of tissue. Three longitudinal serial sections through a tendon fibroblast from developing mouse tail tendon, which included the base of a fibripositor and surrounding features, were analyzed. Features of interest within the three-dimensional volume were reconstructed by tracing individual components in serial 1-nm virtual slices to produce a model (Fig. 7A). Collagen fibrils present within the fibripositor were recognized by their distinctive 67-nm D-periodicity (Fig. 7B). Actin filaments were readily identified (Fig. 7C), but because of numerous branch points the filaments appeared as short segments (Fig. 7D) coursing alongside the fibripositor membrane. The reconstructed region of the cell also contained a microtubule that pointed from the centriole to the plasma membrane (bottom left to top right of Fig. 7A, centriole and plasma membrane not shown). Notably, a large pleiomorphic carrier (LPC) was associated with the microtubule via two attachment points (Fig. 7F). Tracking through serial virtual slices (not shown) indicated that the material inside the LPC was fibrous in nature, and the size of the largest compartment (∼500 nm in length) indicates that it could readily accommodate procollagen or processed collagen molecules. In this study we have shown that microtubules and actin filaments play distinct and assignable roles in tendon fibripositor cells; microtubule disruption retards secretion, whereas actin filaments stabilize the structure of the fibripositor. Microtubules have been implicated in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi (24Vaughan K.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Golgi to plasma membrane (25Toomre D. Keller P. White J. Olivo J.C. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 21-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hirschberg K. Miller C.M. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E.D. Phair R.D. Lippincott_Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1485-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) trafficking as well as in the organization of the Golgi complex (27Thyberg J. Moskalewski S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they are important for the spatial distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex within the cell (28Lane J. Allan V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The result that procollagen secretion is slowed by microtubule disruption could therefore be attributed to protein traffic disruption at any point in the secretory pathway. Interestingly, secretion was not prevented by microtubule disruption, and the percentage of labeled collagen secreted by 3 h of chase was just below that of the control sample. This is consistent with previous observations that drug-induced disruption of microtubules only moderately disturbs protein traffic (27Thyberg J. Moskalewski S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It seems likely that disruption of microtubules alters the organization of the secretory pathway, creating a logistical hurdle to protein secretion. This can also affect the microtubule-dependent targeting of post-Golgi carriers to the plasma membrane (26Hirschberg K. Miller C.M. Ellenberg J. Presley J.F. Siggia E.D. Phair R.D. Lippincott_Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1485-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). It may be the case that procollagen or processing intermediates secreted into the salt-extractable extracellular matrix in the absence of microtubules do not follow the default pathway for secretion and would not result in the formation of a functional tissue due to mistargeting. The observation of a microtubule-associated LPC containing fibrous material is reminiscent of early electron microscopy studies in which ∼500-nm-long secretory vacuoles, often found associated with microtubules, were implicated in the post-Golgi trafficking and maturation of procollagen (20Cho M.I. Garant P.R. Anat. Rec. 1981; 199: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Trelstad R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Leblond C.P. Anat. Rec. 1989; 224: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the transport and processing of procollagen does not depend on an intact actin microfilament system. However, the observed decrease in the number of fibripositors within 30 min of incubation with cytochalasin B is consistent with rapid disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. These data indicate that the structure of the fibripositor depends on actin filaments; the decrease in fibripositor counts could correspond to a decrease in the total numbers of fibripositors/cell or a decrease in the length of all fibripositors. Actin filaments are structural components of a number of other cellular protrusions, including microvilli (35Bretscher A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 337-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), filopodia (36Faix J. Rottner K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), invadopodia (37Marx J. Science. 2006; 312: 1868-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 38Weaver A.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2006; 23: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), and Drosophila bristles (39Guild G.M. Connelly P.S. Ruggiero L. Vranich K.A. Tilney L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3620-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Tilney L.G. DeRosier D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18785-18792Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Electron tomography indicated that fibripositor formation or stabilization may be accomplished by the formation of a bundle of filaments at one side of the membrane encasing the collagen fibrils. Longer incubations in cytochalasin B also resulted in a decrease in the relative numbers of membrane-bounded fibril cross-sections within the main body of the cell. Again this may be due to a decrease in the number or length of internal collagen fibrils or because these fibrils are no longer aligned with the tendon long axis. The loss of parallelism of extracellular collagen fibrils and fibril bundles after cytochalasin treatment implicates the actin cytoskeleton and cell shape in the maintenance of the ordered arrangement of extracellular collagen fibrils via fibripositors. How tendon fibroblasts orchestrate the localized and directional assembly of actin filament bundles is as yet unknown. Conceptually, this could occur through any number of cell signaling pathways, potentially mediated by mechanotransduction (41Ingber D.E. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 42Banes A.J. Tsuzaki M. Yamamoto J. Fischer T. Brigman B. Brown T. Miller L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 349-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) or diffusion of growth factors from surrounding tissues (43Tickle C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 449-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, the best molecular candidates for this function are probably members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Both Cdc42 (44Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3728) Google Scholar) and Rif (Rho in filopodia) (45Pellegrin S. Mellor H. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 129-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 46Ellis S. Mellor H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have been implicated in the formation of filopodia in cultured fibroblasts, and it may be the case that they are also involved in fibripositor dynamics. Identification of the molecular mechanism of fibripositor formation, whether involving signaling pathways, cytoskeletal proteins, or cell matrix-interacting proteins, will require the development of a robust cell culture-based system in which the levels of candidate molecules can be knocked down or up-regulated. Unfortunately, such a system is presently unavailable because embryonic tendon cells released from tissue and placed in culture rapidly lose fibripositors, presumably because of flattening of the cytoskeleton as the cells adhere to culture plates (data not shown). It is possible that fibripositors have further functions in addition to the secretion of preassembled collagen fibrils. They could be involved in the alignment of extracellular collagen fibrils not just through fibril deposition but potentially by reordering and pulling on extracellular fibrils to prevent them turning out of a parallel arrangement. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that depolymerization of actin filaments led to a loss of parallelism of some of the extracellular collagen fibril bundles. The disappearance of the fibripositors and intracellular fibrils and the concomitant rearrangement of existing extracellular fibrils after cytochalasin treatment suggests that fibripositors, or the fibrils contained within a fibripositor, stabilize the parallelism of the extracellular matrix. Alternatively, the observed disorganization of the collagen fibril bundles after cytochalasin treatment could be related to additional effects on neighboring tissues or changes in cell shape. Furthermore, it may be the case that fibripositors are involved in collagen fibril remodeling; an alternative hypothesis for the presence of intracellular collagen fibrils in different tissues, particularly in periodontal ligament and periosteum, is that they are taken up by phagocytosis and digested, a process that involves matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsin family enzymes (47van der Everts V. Zee E. Creemers L. Beertsen W. Histochem. J. 1996; 28: 229-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In periosteal fibroblasts no intracellular collagen fibrils were observed after treatment of bone explants with cytochalasin B for 24 h (48Everts V. Beertsen W. Coll. Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In support of the view that some or all the intracellular collagen fibrils observed in embryonic tendon are being turned over rather than deposited, no adverse effect on procollagen processing or secretion was observed in the presence of cytochalasin B in our experiments. However, these data could be interpreted to mean that secretion and processing of procollagen is able to proceed as normal even without using the default fibripositor pathway for secretion. If collagen fibril remodeling occurs in developing tendons it would be of interest to determine what proportion of extracellular collagen fibrils are degraded after synthesis. Perhaps the entire population of thin collagen fibrils observed in the extracellular bundles of embryonic tendons are sequentially removed and subsequently replaced by a population of longer and wider collagen fibrils. In this model the embryonic fibrils would act as a template for the formation of mature tendons with mechanical properties suitable for the demands placed on the tissue after birth/hatching. Interestingly, immunoreactivity for type XIV collagen, which is located on the surface of collagen fibrils (49Keene D.R. Lunstrum G.P. Morris N.P. Stoddard D.W. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), disappears from developing chick tendons at hatching (50Young B.B. Gordon M.K. Birk D.E. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This corresponds to the time when fibril diameters switch from a unimodal (narrow diameter) to a multimodal distribution (51Fleischmajer R. Perlish J.S. Timpl R. Olsen B.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 1425-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)."

Here we report that mice lacking Eps8, a regulator of actin dynamics, are resistant to some acute intoxicating effects of ethanol and show increased ethanol consumption.

We propose that proper regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is a key determinant of cellular and behavioral responses to ethanol. Alcoholism affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. Resistance to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol is a risk factor for the development of alcoholism and is genetically determined, at least in part (Schuckit and Smith, 2000Schuckit M.A. Smith T.L. The relationships of a family history of alcohol dependence, a low level of response to alcohol and six domains of life functioning to the development of alcohol use disorders.J. Stud. Alcohol. 2000; 61: 827-835PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol resistance might provide important clues about alcohol addiction. One of the most sensitive targets of ethanol in the brain is the excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR), whose activity is inhibited by ethanol (Hoffman et al., 1989Hoffman P.L. Rabe C.S. Moses F. Tabakoff B. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and ethanol: inhibition of calcium flux and cyclic GMP production.J.

Additionally, many of the adaptive responses to ethanol in the brain are ascribed to compensatory changes in NMDAR activity (Carpenter-Hyland et al., 2004Carpenter-Hyland E.P. Woodward J.J.

Ethanol and NMDA receptor signaling.Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 2000; 14: 69-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NMDAR is localized in dendritic spines of central neurons, where it is part of a multimolecular complex (NMDAR complex) comprising nearly a hundred proteins involved in the scaffolding, regulation, and signal transduction of the receptor (Husi et al., 2000Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Proteomic analysis of NMDA receptor-adhesion protein signaling complexes.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Activity-dependent changes in the composition of the complex are important in the regulation of the NMDAR and are part of the biochemical and structural changes involved in synaptic plasticity (Sheng and Kim, 2002Sheng M. Kim M.J. Postsynaptic signaling and plasticity mechanisms.Science. 2002; 298: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The NMDAR complex is attached to the actin cytoskeleton (Wyszynski et al., 1997Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Competitive binding of alpha-actinin and calmodulin to the NMDA receptor.Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), which is also dynamically remodeled in response to synaptic activity (Dillon and Goda, 2005Dillon C. Goda Y. The actin cytoskeleton: integrating form and function at the synapse.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 25-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Whether actin dynamics and associated regulation of the NMDAR complex play a role in ethanol-related behavior is still an open question. The Eps8 family of proteins comprises four members: Eps8, Eps8L1, Eps8L2, and Eps8L3 (Offenhäuser et al., 2004Offenhäuser N. Borgonovo A. Disanza A. Romano P. Ponzanelli I. Iannolo G. Di Fiore P.P.

Cell. 2004; 15: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The best characterized member of the family, Eps8, is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics via at least two different mechanisms. On the one hand, Eps8 contributes to the activation of Rac by growth-factor receptors (Innocenti et al., 2002Innocenti M. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Faretta M. Tocchetti A. Di Fiore P.P. Scita G.

In the nematode C. elegans, where only one Eps8 family member is present, its deletion causes dramatic phenotypes and lethality, indicating an important role in organismal homeostasis (Croce et al., 2004Croce A. Cassata G. Disanza A. Gagliani M.C. Tacchetti C. Malabarba M.G. Carlier M.F. Scita G. Baumeister R. Di Fiore P.P.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conversely, mice carrying a genetic deletion for Eps8 (Eps8-KO mice) are healthy and fertile, with no overt phenotype (Scita et al., 1999Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P. Giardina G. Gutkind S. Bjarnegard M. Betsholtz C. Di Fiore P.P. EPS8 and E3B1 transduce signals from Ras to Rac.Nature. 1999; 401: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This is likely due to functional redundancy with other members of the family. Indeed, Eps8L1 and Eps8L2 share all known biochemical features of Eps8 and are coexpressed with Eps8 in all tissues, with the notable exception of the central nervous system (CNS) (Offenhäuser et al., 2004Offenhäuser N. Borgonovo A. Disanza A. Romano P. Ponzanelli I. Iannolo G. Di Fiore P.P. Scita G. The eps8 family of proteins links growth factor stimulation to actin reorganization generating functional redundancy in the Ras/Rac pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These observations led us to evaluate the role of Eps8 in behavior. Here we report that Eps8 regulates acute ethanol sensitivity and ethanol consumption in mice, and we provide evidence for mechanisms linking actin dynamics to behavioral responses to ethanol. We investigated the effects of the loss of Eps8 on the development and function of the CNS. Eps8-KO mice did not show detectable abnormalities in brain architecture (data not shown). Thus, we assessed the basic behavioral and neurological profile of Eps8-KO mice using a modified SHIRPA protocol (Irwin, 1968Irwin S. Comprehensive observational assessment: Ia. A systematic, quantitative procedure for assessing the behavioral and physiologic state of the mouse.Psychopharmacologia. 1968; 13: 222-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). No differences with respect to wild-type mice were recorded (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). However, in a secondary screen, we discovered that Eps8-KO mice show decreased sensitivity to the hypnotic (sedative) effects of ethanol. After ethanol administration, Eps8-KO mice regained their righting reflex significantly faster than their wild-type littermates (Figure 1A). In addition, significantly higher doses of ethanol were needed to induce the loss of righting reflex in Eps8-KO mice (Figure 1B). We next tested sensitivity to the motor-incoordinating effects of ethanol using the accelerated rotarod (Rustay et al., 2003Rustay N.R. Wahlsten D. Crabbe J.C. Assessment of genetic susceptibility to ethanol intoxication in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 2917-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Eps8-KO mice showed a normal learning curve (Figure S1A), demonstrating that motor learning was not impaired. However, when challenged with increasing concentrations of ethanol, Eps8-KO mice remained on the rotarod significantly longer than wild-type mice (Figure 1C), demonstrating that motor coordination is less affected by ethanol in Eps8-KO compared to wild-type mice. Sensitivity to ethanol is heterogeneous across tasks (Crabbe et al., 2005Crabbe J.C. Metten P. Cameron A.J. Wahlsten D. An analysis of the genetics of alcohol intoxication in inbred mice.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2005; 28: 785-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, we also tested whether low concentrations of ethanol, known to stimulate locomotor activity in the open field, would differentially affect Eps8-KO mice. Ethanol administration induced a significant increase in locomotor activity in both wild-type and Eps8-KO mice (Figure 1D). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed an effect of ethanol treatment versus saline in both wild-type mice (F1,90 = 15.46, p < 0.001 for treatment; F9,90 = 0.48, p < 0.888 for time; and F9,90 = 2.99, p < 0.0037 for the interaction between the factors) and Eps8-KO mice (F1,90 = 24.24, p < 0.0001 for treatment; F9,90 = 4.09, p < 0.002 for time; and F9,90 = 1.87, p < 0.0665 for the interaction between the factors). Interestingly, we did not observe resistance to the locomotor-stimulatory effect of 1.5 g/kg ethanol in Eps8-KO mice. On the contrary, two-way ANOVA showed that locomotor activity was slightly more enhanced by ethanol in Eps8-KO with respect to wild-type mice (F1,180 = 6.56, p = 0.0113 for genotype; F9,180 = 1.75, p = 0.08 for time; and F9,180 = 3.40, p = 0.0007 for the interaction between the factors) (Figure 1D). Thus, Eps8-KO mice are resistant to some, but not all, of the acute effects of ethanol. Plasma ethanol concentrations were not appreciably different between wild-type and Eps8-KO mice after acute administration of ethanol (Figures S1B and S1C), indicating that altered ethanol clearance and/or metabolism are not the underlying causes of the reduced ethanol sensitivity of Eps8-KO mice. Studies of inbred or genetically modified mice have shown a positive correlation between resistance to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol and preference for this drug (Bowers, 2000Bowers B.J. Applications of transgenic and knockout mice in alcohol research.Alcohol Res. Health. 2000; 24: 175-184PubMed Google Scholar, Li et al., 1993Li T.K. Lumeng L. Doolittle D.P. Selective breeding for alcohol preference and associated responses.Behav. Genet. 1993; 23: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested Eps8-KO mice for ethanol consumption using the two-bottle choice paradigm (Belknap et al., 1993Belknap J.K. Crabbe J.C. Young E.R. Voluntary consumption of ethanol in 15 inbred mouse strains.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1993; 112: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Eps8-KO mice displayed both increased consumption and preference (Figures 1E and 1F). Two-way ANOVA showed an effect of ethanol concentration (F3,18 = 88.4, p < 0.0001) and genotype (F1,118 = 20.21, p < 0.0001) and an interaction between these factors (F3,118 = 4.11, p = 0.0082) for ethanol consumption. For the preference ratio, we found a highly significant effect of ethanol concentration (F3,116 = 37.5, p < 0.0001) and genotype (F1,116 = 15.24, p = 0.002), but no interaction between these factors (F3,116 = 1.02, p = 0.3853). Differential taste reactivity might influence ethanol consumption (Crabbe et al., 1996Crabbe J.C. Phillips T.J. Feller D.J. Hen R. Wenger C.D. Lessov C.N. Schafer G.L. Elevated alcohol consumption in null mutant mice lacking 5-HT1B serotonin receptors.Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We therefore tested Eps8-KO mice for consumption of sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami solutions (Bachmanov et al., 1996Bachmanov A.A. Reed D.R. Tordoff M.G. Price R.A. Beauchamp G.K. Intake of ethanol, sodium chloride, sucrose, citric acid, and quinine hydrochloride solutions by mice: a genetic analysis.Behav. Genet. 1996; 26: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mutant mice displayed a reduced consumption of sweet solutions containing either high-caloric sucrose (Figure S2A) or noncaloric saccharine (Figure 1G). No significant change was observed in the consumption of other tastants (Figures S2B–S2E), indicating that ablation of Eps8 does not lead to a general impairment in taste perception. An association between sweet preference and ethanol consumption has been reported (Kampov-Polevoy et al., 1999Kampov-Polevoy A.B. Garbutt J.C. Janowsky D.S. Association between preference for sweets and excessive alcohol intake: a review of animal and human studies.Alcohol Alcohol. 1999; 34: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), possibly due to the sweet taste of ethanol-containing solutions. Thus, the negative correlation observed in Eps8-KO mice was unexpected. Nevertheless, to formally exclude the possibility that altered taste accounted for increased ethanol preference, mice were tested for the consumption of a 10% ethanol solution containing saccharine as a sweetener. Eps8-KO mice still displayed a significantly increased preference for ethanol (Figure 1H), demonstrating that altered sweet perception does not account for the increased ethanol consumption. Finally, Eps8-KO mice did not show altered consumption of nicotine-containing solutions (Figure S2F), indicating that lack of Eps8 does not have a general impact on addictive behavior. Several brain areas have been implicated in ethanol-related behavior, including the mesolimbic reward circuit, hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. To gain insight into which areas of the CNS are involved in Eps8 function in ethanol-related behavior, the expression of Eps8 in adult mouse brain was determined. Eps8 was expressed in several brain areas at low/moderate levels (data not shown). High levels of expression were confined to a few scattered neurons in layers II and III of the cerebral cortex (Figure 2A) and in the hippocampus (Figure 2B), two areas classically implicated in higher cognitive functions. In addition, Eps8 was highly expressed in scattered neurons in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala (Figure 2C) but was below detectability in brain areas involved in the mesolimbic reward circuit, such as the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, and bed nucleus stria terminalis. Thus, Eps8 either is not appreciably expressed or is expressed at low levels in brain areas implicated in the motivational reward leading to increased ethanol consumption. Conversely, Eps8 expression was particularly elevated in the cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) and molecular layers (Figure 2D), suggesting that the resistance of Eps8-KO mice to the motor-incoordinating effects of ethanol might be related to the function of Eps8 in the cerebellum. The above results prompted us to focus on the cerebellum. In sections of the granule cell layer, we detected abundant expression of Eps8 in cerebellar glomeruli, with a pattern of expression coinciding with that of F-actin (Figure 3A), which in cerebellar glomeruli is known to be concentrated in the postsynaptic granule cell articulations (Capani et al., 2001Capani F. Ellisman M.H. Martone M.E. Filamentous actin is concentrated in specific subpopulations of neuronal and glial structures in rat central nervous system.Brain Res. 2001; 923: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By immunoelectron microscopy, Eps8 was localized postsynaptically in the dendritic articulations of CGNs (Figure 3B), while it was absent from presynaptic mossy fibers. Biochemical fractionation of adult cerebellum further indicated that Eps8 was present in both the synaptosomal and postsynaptic density fractions (Figure 3C), consistent with the observation that Eps8 is localized both presynaptically in the molecular layer and postsynaptically in the glomeruli of the granule cell layer (Figure 2D). The presence of Eps8 in the postsynaptic density fraction prompted us to investigate whether Eps8 and NMDAR are physically associated in vivo. In the adult cerebellum, three NMDAR subunits are expressed (Yamada et al., 2001Yamada K. Fukaya M. Shimizu H. Sakimura K. Watanabe M. NMDA receptor subunits GluRepsilon1, GluRepsilon3 and GluRzeta1 are enriched at the mossy fibre-granule cell synapse in the adult mouse cerebellum.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 2025-2036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in Eps8 immunoprecipitates from adult cerebellum of wild-type mice (but not Eps8-KO mice), all three NMDAR subunits could be readily recovered (Figure 3D). This interaction was specific in that no coimmunoprecipitation between Eps8 and GluR1, a subunit of the AMPA receptor also present in the postsynaptic density fraction, was detected (Figure 3D). Similarly, Eps8—and the other two NMDAR subunits, NR2C and NR1—could be recovered in NR2A immunoprecipitates, but not in GluR1 immunoprecipitates (Figure 3E). Thus, Eps8 is part of the NMDAR complex, where it interacts, directly or indirectly, with the NMDAR. Given the functional redundancy in the Eps8 family, it was important to establish whether Eps8 is the only member expressed in CGNs. Eps8 mRNA was readily detected by quantitative PCR in CGNs obtained by laser capture from adult cerebellum (Figure 3F). In contrast, there was no detectable expression of Eps8L2 and Eps8L3 and only trace amounts of Eps8L1 mRNA (Figure 3F). Collectively, these data indicate that Eps8 is enriched in postsynaptic structures in CGNs, where it is part of the NMDAR complex. In addition, the lack (or very low expression) of redundant members of the Eps8 family in CGNs makes these cells a good model system in which to analyze the effects of Eps8 on cellular processes related to ethanol responses. Based on the above results, and in order to understand the impact of Eps8 ablation on CGN responses to ethanol, we measured excitatory synaptic transmission by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CGNs in acute cerebellar slices. Voltage-clamp recordings showed identical passive properties (membrane capacitance and input resistance) in wild-type and Eps8-KO CGNs (Table S2), indicating that basal parameters were not altered. Next, we recorded composite excitatory postsynaptic currents (cEPSCs) after low-frequency mossy-fiber stimulation (0.1 Hz) in the presence of bicuculline, an antagonist of inhibitory GABA receptors. To isolate the non-NMDA (−60 mV) and NMDA (+60 mV) components, two different holding potentials were used. The non-NMDA cEPSC component showed similar amplitude and rising and decay kinetics in wild-type and Eps8-KO CGNs (Figures 4A–4C; Tables S3 and S4). In contrast, the NMDA cEPSC component was ∼2-fold higher in Eps8-KO CGNs due to increased current amplitude and slower decay kinetics (Figures 4D–4F; Table S4). To exclude the possibility that altered NMDA currents were due to alterations in neurotransmitter release we (1) recorded miniature EPSCs (minis; Figure 4A, inset), which reflect spontaneous release of neurotransmitter quanta, and (2) compared EPSC coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean), which is altered by changes in release probability. Neither minis nor EPSC parameters were changed in Eps8-KO CGNs (Table S5), indicating that neurotransmitter release is normal in the cerebellum of Eps8-KO mice. Finally, we tested the effect of ethanol perfusion on cEPSCs. One hundred micromolar ethanol inhibited both non-NMDA and NMDA currents in wild-type and Eps8-KO CGNs to a similar extent (Figures 4G and 4H). Ethanol perfusion at 400 mM did not result in further significant inhibition of non-NMDA currents. Instead, 400 mM ethanol increased the reduction of the NMDA current in wild-type neurons (from 41% to 92%, in the presence of 100 mM and 400 mM ethanol, respectively). In Eps8-KO CGNs, conversely, there was no additional reduction of NMDA current (∼40% reduction in either 100 mM or 400 mM ethanol, Figures 4G and 4H). Inhibition of NMDA currents by ethanol was immediate and without apparent recovery during the time frame measured (Figure 4I). Finally, analysis of EPSC CV after ethanol perfusion showed no difference with respect to basal conditions in either genotype, indicating that altered presynaptic release is not responsible for the ethanol effect (Table S6). In Eps8-KO CGNs, after the initial reduction of NMDA current elicited by 100 mM ethanol, there was no further reduction at higher concentrations. This suggests the existence of two components in the ethanol-induced reduction of NMDA current: an immediate one, apparently largely Eps8 insensitive, and a gradual one, which relies on the presence of Eps8. While further studies will be needed to verify this possibility, it is worth noting that the immediate component might be connected, in principle, to the reported ability of ethanol to bind and inhibit the NMDAR (Honse et al., 2004Honse Y. Ren H. Lipsky R.H. Peoples R.W. Sites in the fourth membrane-associated domain regulate alcohol sensitivity of the NMDA receptor.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Peoples and Stewart, 2000Peoples R.W. Stewart R.R. Alcohols inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors via a site exposed to the extracellular environment.Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The gradual Eps8-dependent component is most likely linked, as will subsequently become clear, to actin stability. (We note that this does not imply that the hypothesized immediate component is not linked to actin dynamics.) Whatever the case, given the higher charge transfer through the NMDAR in Eps8-KO neurons under basal conditions, application of either 100 or 400 mM ethanol reduced the total current in Eps8-KO neurons to levels present in wild-type neurons before ethanol exposure (Figure 4J). These findings provide a plausible explanation for the resistance of Eps8-KO mice to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol. Converging evidence suggests that the effect of the ablation of Eps8 on ethanol-dependent phenotypes is due at least in part to altered actin dynamics upon NMDAR activation: (1) Eps8 is physically associated with NMDAR (this paper), (2) the major electrophysiological alteration in Eps8-KO CGNs consists of an increase in NMDA currents (this paper), (3) Eps8 regulates actin-cytoskeleton dynamics (Disanza et al., 2004Disanza A.

NMDA receptors in alcoholism.Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 35-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, we directed our attention to the role of Eps8 in NMDAR-induced actin remodeling. First, we established a suitable model system of CGNs cultured in vitro, which, similar to in vivo CGNs, displayed no significant redundancy of expression of Eps8 family members (Figure 5A). In mature cultured CGNs (>10 days in vitro), Eps8 displayed a distribution similar to that observed in vivo, being localized to the soma and, more importantly, to prominent, F-actin-rich clusters along neurites (Figure 5B). These structures probably represent postsynaptic-like structures, as also witnessed by enrichment of the NMDAR in these structures (Figure 5C). Treatment of cultured CGNs with glutamate or NMDA, but not with AMPA, resulted in almost complete loss of F-actin from the postsynaptic-like structures along the neurites (Figure 5D). Moreover, the specific NMDAR inhibitor MK-801, but not the AMPAR inhibitor CNQX, was able to prevent the effect of glutamate or NMDA (Figure 5D). Finally, the depolymerizing effect of glutamate and NMDA was severely reduced in Eps8-KO neurons (Figure 5E), indicating that Eps8 is required for NMDAR-induced actin remodeling. One of the best characterized NMDAR-dependent pathways, which leads to actin remodeling in neurons, relies on an increase in intracellular calcium, which in turn causes the sequential activation of the phosphatases calcineurin and Slingshot, ultimately controlling cofilin phosphorylation status and activity (Bamburg et al., 1999Bamburg J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2065340413,"The gene for E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP1 is located at 8q21, a region frequently amplified in human cancers, including prostate cancer. Recent studies have shown that WWP1 negatively regulates the TGFbeta tumor suppressor pathway by inactivating its molecular components, including Smad2, Smad4 and TbetaR1. These findings suggest an oncogenic role of WWP1 in carcinogenesis, but direct supporting evidence has been lacking. In this study, we examined WWP1 for gene dosage, mRNA expression, mutation and functions in a number of human prostate cancer samples. We found that the WWP1 gene had copy number gain in 15 of 34 (44%) xenografts and cell lines from prostate cancer and 15 of 49 (31%) clinical prostate cancer samples. Consistently, WWP1 was overexpressed in 60% of xenografts and cell lines from prostate cancer. Mutation of WWP1 occurred infrequently in prostate cancer. Functionally, WWP1 overexpression promoted colony formation in the 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell line. In PC-3 prostate cancer cells, WWP1 knockdown significantly suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced TGFbeta-mediated growth inhibition. These findings suggest that WWP1 is an oncogene that undergoes genomic amplification at 8q21 in human prostate cancer, and WWP1 overexpression is a common mechanism involved in the inactivation of TGFbeta function in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2089557515,"Glucocorticoids are extensively used in combination chemotherapy of advanced prostate cancer (PC). Little is known, however, about the status of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in PC. We evaluated over 200 prostate samples and determined that GR expression was strongly decreased or absent in 70–85% of PC. Similar to PC tumors, some PC cell lines, including LNCaP, also lack GR. To understand the role of GR, we reconstituted its expression in LNCaP cells using lentiviral approach. Treatment of LNCaP-GR cells with the glucocorticoids strongly inhibited proliferation in the monolayer cultures and blocked anchorage-independent growth. This was accompanied by upregulation of p21 and p27, down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and c-Myc phosphorylation. Importantly, the activation of GR resulted in normalized expression of PC markers hepsin, AMACR, and maspin. On the signaling level, GR decreased expression and inhibited activity of the MAP-kinases (MAPKs) including p38, JNK/SAPK, Mek1/2 and Erk1/2. We also found that activation of GR inhibited activity of numerous transcription factors (TF) including AP-1, SRF, NF-κB, p53, ATF-2, CEBPα, Ets-1, Elk-1, STAT1 and others, many of which are regulated via MAPK cascade. The structural analysis of hepsin and AMACR promoters provided the mechanistic rationale for PC marker downregulation by glucocorticoids via inhibition of specific TFs. Our data suggest that GR functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate, and inhibits multiple signaling pathways and transcriptional factors involved in proliferation and transformation."

IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) has shown that the proportions of ATP used by the Ca2+-ATPase for transport and for heat generation varies with conditions and that changes in work/heat output by the Ca2+-ATPase are related to changes in the reaction cycle of the Ca2+-ATPase.The reaction cycle of the Ca2+-ATPase is shown in simplified form in Scheme 1 (7Smith W.S. Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Transport of Ca2+ into the SR lumen involves binding of ATP and two Ca2+ ions from cytoplasm to the E1 conformation of the Ca2+-ATPase followed by phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase on Asp-351 (steps 1–3in Scheme 1). On phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase, the two Ca2+ binding sites change to a state in which they are of low affinity and facing the lumen, so that Ca2+ dissociates from the phosphorylated Ca2+-ATPase into the SR lumen (step 4). Dephosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase then allows recycling to E1 (steps 5–7).A number of processes compete with the transport process to reduce the net level of accumulation of Ca2+ below two per ATP molecule hydrolyzed. At high lumenal and low cytoplasmic concentrations of Ca2+, when the concentration of ADP is high, the reaction cycle can be driven backwards, ADP binding to the phosphorylated ATPase, reforming ATP at the expense of moving two Ca2+ ions back across the membrane (steps 4 to 2) (4de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The rate of this process is low when the concentration of ADP is low and when the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm is high (4de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Two other processes can also reduce the efficiency of transport. The first is passive leak of Ca2+ out of the SR lumen down its concentration gradient (steps 8–10). Passive leak of Ca2+ has been observed from Ca2+-loaded SR vesicles (8Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from vesicles reconstituted from purified Ca2+-ATPase (9Inesi G. Nakamoto R. Hymel L. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14804-14809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gould G.W. McWhirter J.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but the rate of this passive is when the cytoplasmic leak slow concentration of Ca2+ is to the saturate Ca2+ cytoplasmic binding for sufficient sites on the ATPase (10Gould G.W. McWhirter J.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11Meissner G. Darling E. Eveleth J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The second process is slippage, in which the phosphorylated, Ca2+-bound intermediate (E2PCa2 in Scheme 1) releases its two Ca2+ ions to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane rather than to the lumenal side (step 11) (8Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). during slippage there is no Because of Ca2+ transport, all the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis will be converted into heat. Conditions favoring maximum heat production by the Ca2+-ATPase, therefore, correspond to those that favor slippage (5de Meis L. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 188: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The SR of fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscles of large mammals such as rabbit contain a 31-residue transmembrane peptide sarcolipin (SLN), which is absent from atrial muscle (14Vangheluwe P. Schuermans M. Zador E. Waelkens E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, in small mammals such as rat, SLN is present in the atria but absent from skeletal muscles In reconstitution (14Vangheluwe P. Schuermans M. Zador E. Waelkens E. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). experiments with Ca2+-ATPase from rabbit skeletal fast-twitch muscle, the presence of SLN led to a reduced level of accumulation of Ca2+ (7Smith W.S. Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and expression of SLN in rat slow-twitch muscle, a muscle that normally lacks SLN, also led to a decreased level of accumulation of Ca2+ by the SR (15Tupling A.R. Asahi M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44740-44746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The effect of SLN on Ca2+ accumulation in reconstituted vesicles was consistent with interaction between SLN and the Ca2+-ATPase, leading to an increased rate of slippage on the Ca2+-ATPase (7Smith W.S. Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This suggests that the presence SLN might increase heat production Ca2+ the of by -ATPase; here we show that this is indeed the case.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dioleoylphosphatidic acid (DOPA) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, and β-d-octyl glucoside and octa(ethylene glycol)-n-dodecyl ether (C12E8) were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem, respectively. SR was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described in Dalton et al. (13Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Concentrations of ATPase were estimated using a specific absorption coefficient of 1.2 liters·g–1·cm–1 for a solution in 1% (v/v) SDS. Rabbit muscle SLN (MERSTRELCLNFTVVLITVILIWLLVRSYQY) was supplied by Peptide Protein Research Ltd. (Wickham, Hants, UK).Reconstitution into Sealed Vesicles—SLN was dissolved in trifluoroethanol, and lipids were dissolved in chloroform. The solutions were mixed in the desired proportion, dried, and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Pipes, 100 mm K2SO4, pH 7.1) containing 40 mm β-d-octyl glucoside to give a final lipid concentration of 7.5 mm. The sample was then sonicated to optical clarity in a bath sonicator. SR was solubilized in buffer A containing C12E8 (6 mg/ml) and 0.1 mm CaCl2. The solubilized SR was mixed with the lipid sample to give a 5000:1 molar ratio of lipid:ATPase. Detergent was removed by the addition of 80 mg of washed SM2 Bio-Beads (mesh size 20–50) followed after 1 h by a second addition of 80 mg of Bio-Beads. After a further hour the sample of reconstituted vesicles was removed from the Bio-Beads and kept on ice until use.Assay of Ca2+ Uptake—Accumulation of Ca2+ by the reconstituted vesicles was measured at 35°C using Antipyrylazo III to monitor the external Ca2+ concentration (13Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The absorption difference 720–790 nm was recorded using an SLM Aminco dual wavelength spectrophotometer. The assay buffer used was 10 mm Pipes, 100 mm K2SO4, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 7.1, containing 70μm Antipyrylazo III with a protein concentration of 0.026 mg/ml. Carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) was added to a concentration of 0.25 μm to make the vesicles permeable to H+. The system was calibrated by the incremental addition of Ca2+ before the addition of ATP to initiate uptake.Assays of ATPase Activity—ATPase activities were determined at 35 °C over a 2-min period using a coupled enzyme assay in a medium containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 2.1 mm ATP, 1.1 mm EGTA, 0.41 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mm NADH, 7.5 units of pyruvate kinase, and 18 units of lactate dehydrogenase with 10 μg of ATPase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of an aliquot of a 25 mm CaCl2 solution to a cuvette containing the ATPase and the other reagents to give the required concentration of free Ca2+, typically 80 μm. The same coupled enzyme assay system was used to measure activities over a 30-min time period but with 2 μg of ATPase.ATPase activities were also measured using a phosphate release assay using the Biomol green phosphate assay reagent from BioMol Research labs. Activities were measured in medium containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 2.1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.86 mm Ca2+, corresponding to a concentration of free Ca2+ of 80 μm. Assays were started by the addition of 5 μg of protein in a total volume of 2.5 ml. At the chosen time intervals, 20-μl samples were taken, added to 100 μl of 100 mm EGTA to stop the reaction, and stored on ice for up to 60 min. Phosphate levels were then determined by mixing with the Biomol reagent, and after a 30-min incubation at 25 °C, the absorbance at 620 nm was read. Free concentrations of Ca2+ were calculated by using the binding constants of Ca2+, Mg2+, and H+ for EGTA given by Godt (16Godt R.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 63: 722-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Heats of Reaction—Heats of reaction were measured using an OMEGA isothermal titration calorimeter from Microcal Inc. using a procedure similar to that used by de Meis (4de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The 1.5-ml calorimeter cell contained the reaction medium (40 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 2.1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.86 mm Ca2+, pH 7.1, and a free Ca2+ concentration of 80 μm), and the reference cell contained water. After equilibration at 35 °C for 20 min, the reaction was started by injecting vesicles (5 μg protein) into the reaction cell, and the heat change was recorded for 30 min. As described by de Meis (4de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the heat change observed in the first 2 min of reaction was discarded since this includes a variety of artifacts, including heats of sample dilution. It was confirmed that vesicles were fully active after equilibration at 35 °C under the conditions used for the calorimetric measurements.RESULTSATPase Activities of Sealed Vesicles—Vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum were prepared as described and contained typically 75% protein as Ca2+-ATPase, the remainder being largely the lumenal protein calsequestrin (7Smith W.S. Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase was reconstituted into sealed vesicles containing SLN by mixing lipid and protein in detergent solution followed by removal of detergent with Bio-Beads (7Smith W.S. Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was reported previously that levels of accumulation of Ca2+ by vesicles containing Ca2+-ATPase were relatively low if the vesicles contained DOPC as the only lipid but increased considerably of the vesicles contained 10 mol % of an ionic lipid (13Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because the concentration of anionic lipid in the native SR membrane is also ∼10 mol % (17Gould G.W. McWhirter J.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), experiments were performed with vesicles containing 10 mol % of the anionic phospholipid DOPA.The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured over 3 min using a coupled enzyme assay at saturating concentrations of Ca2+. As shown in Table 1, activities of sealed vesicles approximately doubled on the addition of the detergent octa(ethylene glycol)-n-dodecyl ether to make the vesicles leaky to ATP. As described previously, this can be attributed to a close to random insertion of the Ca2+-ATPase into the sealed vesicles, so that approximately half the ATPase molecules will be in the wrong orientation in the membrane to bind to ATP from the external medium unless detergent is added to make the vesicles leaky to ATP (13Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Gould G.W. McWhirter J.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Small variations in the sidedness of insertion of the Ca2+-ATPase into the vesicles probably explain the variation in activity observed between different preparations of sealed vesicles. Studies with unsealed membrane preparations suggest that SLN has no effect on saturating ATPase activity measured at concentrations of Ca2+ (7Smith W.S. Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).TABLE 1ATPase activities for reconstituted ATPaseMolar ratio SLN:ATPaseAssayATPase activityIU/mg0Coupled enzyme assay (3 min)2.2+ C12E85.8Coupled enzyme assay (30 min)2.2Phosphate release assay2.310:1Coupled enzyme assay (3 min)3.2+ C12E85.4Coupled enzyme assay (30 min)3.2Phosphate release assay2.9 Open table in a new tab ATPase activities were also measured for sealed vesicles using a phosphate release assay under the conditions used for the heat output measurements. ATPase activities were found to be linear over 60 min both in the absence and presence of SLN (Fig. 1). The measured rates were very similar to those measured using the coupled enzyme assay over a 30-min period (Fig. 1, Table 1). Using the phosphate release assay, the concentration of ADP in the medium increased as a function of time as a result of ATP hydrolysis, whereas in the coupled enzyme assay ADP was reconverted to ATP. Thus, the fact that similar rates were observed in the two assays shows that the level of ADP generated as a result of ATPase activity in the absence of a regenerating system is not sufficient to affect the rate of ATP hydrolysis.FIGURE 1ATPase activities for sealed vesicles. ATPase activities were measured either using a phosphate release assay (○; dashed line) or using a coupled enzyme assay in which ADP generated as a result of ATP hydrolysis is reconverted to ATP (solid line). A, no SLN. B, molar ratio SLN:ATPase 10:1. The vesicles contained a 1:9 molar ratio of DOPA to DOPC and a molar ratio of total phospholipid:ATPase of 5000:1. The assay medium was 40 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 2.1 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.86 mm Ca2+. The reaction was performed at 35 °C with either 5 μg of protein/ml (phosphate assay) or 2 μg of protein/ml (coupled enzyme assay). ATPase activities are listed in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of SLN on Accumulation of Ca2+—As reported previously at 25 °C (7Smith W.S. Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the presence of SLN at 35 °C leads to a decreased level of accumulation of Ca2+ with the effect increasing with increasing molar ratios of SLN to ATPase (Fig. 2). Similar effects are seen for vesicles containing DOPC as the only phospholipid (data not shown). In these experiments FCCP was present to make the vesicles permeable to H+;inthe absence of FCCP the presence of SLN again reduced the level of accumulation of Ca2+, but all the levels of accumulation of Ca2+ were lower than in the presence of FCCP (7Smith W.S. Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Effect of SLN on ATP-dependent accumulation of Ca2+ by reconstituted vesicles. Shown is ATP-dependent accumulation of Ca2+ by reconstituted vesicles containing the given molar ratios of SLN:ATPase. Accumulation of Ca2+ was initiated by addition of 0.8 mm ATP. Samples contained 0.026 mg of ATPase/ml at a total phospholipid:ATPase molar ratio of 5000:1 with a 1:9 molar ratio of DOPA to DOPC. The buffer was 10 mm Pipes, 100 mm K2SO4, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 7.1, containing 70 μm Arsenazo III, and the initial concentration of Ca2+ was 120 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Heat Production by Ca2+-ATPase—The rate of heat release resulting from hydrolysis of ATP was measured for the Ca2+-ATPase reconstituted into sealed vesicles containing 10 mol % DOPA as a function of the molar ratio of SLN to ATPase (Fig. 3). In all cases the heat released increased linearly with time, and the heat released increased with increasing SLN content. The measured heat released was found to be the same within 10% in buffer containing 0.86 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm EGTA, corresponding to a free Ca2+ concentration of 80 μm, and in buffer containing 30 or 100 μm Ca2+ in the absence of EGTA. Table 2 lists the ATPase activities of the reconstituted samples whose heat releases are shown in Fig. 3 together with the calculated heat released per mol of ATP hydrolyzed. The measurements of ATPase activity and heat produced were both performed in the absence of FCCP. Measurements were also made in the presence of FCCP to make the vesicles permeable to H+. It was found that the addition of FCCP resulted in changes in ATPase activity and heat produced of less than 10% (data not shown), showing that the observed effects of SLN could not be attributed to an effect on the permeability of the vesicles to H+. The heat released from reconstituted vesicles containing DOPC as the only phospholipid also increased linearly with time, giving calculated heats released per mol ATP hydrolyzed comparable with those observed for vesicles containing 10 mol % of DOPA (Table 2).FIGURE 3Effect of SLN on heat released by reconstituted vesicles. Heat released (mcal/mg of protein) was measured as a function of time for reconstituted vesicles (5 μg of protein) in buffer (40 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.86 mm Ca 2+, pH 7.1) at 35 °C in the presence of 2.1 mm ATP.

The structure of the transmembrane region of SLN is very similar to that of phospholamban (PLN), and 2+ SLN and PLN appear to bind to the same site on the Ca -ATPase, located in a groove between transmembrane α-helices M2, M4, and M6 (19Buffy J.J. Buck-Koehntop B.A. Porcelli F. Traasethl N.J. Thomas D.D. Veglia G. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Asahi M. Sugita Y. Kurzydlowski K. deLeon S. Tada M. Toyoshima C. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5040-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Binding of the transmembrane domain of PLN to the Ca2+-ATPase results in a reduction in the apparent affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ (21Hughes G. Starling A.P. Sharma R.P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Lee A.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The presence of SLN has also been reported under some conditions to result in a modest decrease in apparent affinity of the Ca2+-ATPase for Ca2+ (15Tupling A.R. Asahi M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44740-44746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Buffy J.J. Buck-Koehntop B.A. Porcelli F. Traasethl N.J. Thomas D.D. Veglia G. J. Mol.

Broadbridge R. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Tupling A.R. Asahi M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44740-44746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).A major difference between SLN and PLN concerns the ways in which their interaction with the Ca2+-ATPase can be modulated. Phosphorylation of PLN by protein kinases leads to a reversal of the effect of PLN on the Ca2+-ATPase, therefore, linking Ca2+-ATPase function to adrenergic activation (24Tada M. Ohmori F. Yamada M. Abe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 319-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This kind of control is not possible for SLN because SLN cannot be phosphorylated (25Wawrzynow A. Theibert J.L. Murphy C. Jona I. Martonosi A. Collins J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In muscles such as the atria of small mammals, where SLN is found together with PLN (20Asahi M. Sugita Y. Kurzydlowski K. deLeon S. Tada M. Toyoshima C. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5040-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), complex interactions between SLN, PLN, and the Ca2+-ATPase are possible because SLN 2+ and PLN can form heterodimers that interact with 2+ the Ca -ATPase, thus linking the effects of SLN on the Ca -ATPase to phosphorylation of PLN (20Asahi M. Sugita Y. Kurzydlowski K. deLeon S. Tada M. Toyoshima C. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5040-5045Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, such interactions are clearly not possible in fast-twitch skeletal muscle that lacks PLN (26Odermatt A. Taschner P.E.M. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the role of SLN in such muscles is not clear.The possibility explored here is that the presence of SLN in fast-twitch skeletal muscle of large mammals is related to the importance of SR in heat generation during nonshivering thermogenesis in animals lacking brown adipose tissue. de Meis et al. (3Bianconi M.L. de Meis L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Oliveira G.M. de Meis L. Arruda A.P. Santos R. da Costa R.M. Benchimol M. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) has shown that ATP is hydrolyzed by SR Ca2+-ATPase both to transport Ca2+ and to generate heat (3Bianconi M.L. de Meis L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Oliveira G.M. de Meis L. Arruda A.P. Santos R. da Costa R.M. Benchimol M. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the process of transport, two Ca2+ ions are pumped from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the SR for each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed (Scheme 1), and the expected ratio of two Ca2+ ions accumulated per ATP molecule hydrolyzed was observed during the first reaction cycle of the ATPase before the lumenal concentration of Ca2+ had increased to a high level (27Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Verjovski-Almeida S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1978; 307: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, when the lumenal concentration of Ca2+ reached millimolar concentrations, the level of Ca2+ accumulated became less than 2:1 with respect to ATP hydrolysis (8Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol.

The process of slippage generates maximum heat from ATP hydrolysis since it corresponds to ATP hydrolysis without performing work. Thus, switching between transport and slippage by the Ca2+-ATPase is “controlled” by the state of the system itself. When the concentration of Ca2+ in the lumen of the SR is low, the level of E2PCa2 will be low, and there will be little slippage; ATP will be used mostly for transporting Ca2+ into the SR lumen. The concentration of Ca2+ in the SR lumen will build up as a result of this transport, leading to a build up of E2PCa and, thus, of slippage and heat production. What this means physiologically is as follows. After the release of lumenal C2+ a to cause muscle contraction, the leve"
https://openalex.org/W2048059963,"Niemann-Pick C disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an endolysosomal accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids. One form of the disease is caused by a deficiency in NPC2, a soluble lysosomal glycoprotein that binds cholesterol. To better understand the biological function of NPC2 and how its deficiency results in disease, we have characterized the structural and functional properties of recombinant human protein. Highly purified NPC2 consists of a complex mixture of glycosylated isoforms, similar to that observed in human brain autopsy specimens. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that of the three potential N-linked glycosylation sites present in the mature protein, Asn-19 is not utilized; Asn-39 is linked to an endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-sensitive oligosaccharide, and Asn-116 is variably utilized, either being unmodified or linked to Endo H-sensitive or Endo H-resistant oligosaccharides. All glycoforms are endocytosed and ameliorate the cholesterol storage phenotype of NPC2-deficient fibroblasts. In addition, the purified preparation contains a mixture of both free and lipid-bound protein. All glycoforms bind cholesterol, and sterol binding to NPC2 significantly alters its behavior upon cation-exchange chromatography. Based on this observation, we developed chromatography-based binding assays and determined that NPC2 forms an equimolar complex with the fluorescent cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol. In addition, we find that NPC2 binds a range of cholesterol-related molecules (cholesterol precursors, plant sterols, some oxysterols, cholesterol sulfate, cholesterol acetate, and 5-α-cholestan-3-one) and that 27-hydroxysterol accumulates in NPC2-deficient mouse liver. Binding was not detected for various glycolipids, phospholipids, or fatty acids. These biochemical properties support a direct and specialized function of NPC2 in lysosomal sterol transport.

Cholesterol is important for a wide variety of physiological processes, including serving as a major component of lipid bilayers and droplets and as a precursor in steroid hormone biosynthesis. One of the major pathways by which cholesterol enters cells is through receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL 2The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; NPC, Niemann-Pick C; DHE, ergosta-5,7,9,(11),22-tetraen-3β-ol; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; LBPA, lysobisphosphatidic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; GC, gas chromatography; bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. 2The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; NPC, Niemann-Pick C; DHE, ergosta-5,7,9,(11),22-tetraen-3β-ol; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; LBPA, lysobisphosphatidic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; GC, gas chromatography; bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. particles. The LDL is delivered to lysosomes where cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed by acid lipase and the liberated free cholesterol is then transported to other subcellular sites for further utilization and also for feedback regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and LDL uptake. Although many of the steps involved in this pathway are well characterized, the mechanism by which free cholesterol exits the lysosome is poorly understood. Studies of two hereditary childhood neurodegenerative disorders with similar phenotypes, Niemann-Pick C (NPC) type 1 and type 2 diseases, have begun to provide insights into lysosomal cholesterol transport. On a cellular level, both diseases are characterized by lysosomal storage of cholesterol and other lipids, including sphingomyelin, glycolipids, and phospholipids. Fibroblasts from individuals with NPC disease accumulate LDL-derived cholesterol in lysosomes and are impaired in homeostatic responses that normally follow LDL uptake (1Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M.

In this study, as a step toward understanding the role of NPC2 in normal and disease processes, we have characterized biochemical and ligand binding properties of functional recombinant human NPC2 produced using a Chinese hamster ovary cell system. The preparation consists of different NPC2 glycoforms that are capable of binding cholesterol, and we find that binding of some ligands induces a marked change in the chromatographic properties of NPC2. Based on this observation, we have developed a new chromatography-based binding assay and have applied this to evaluate ligand structure-activity relationships, to identify potential physiologically relevant ligands, and to evaluate NPC2 as the target of drugs implicated in altered cholesterol transport. Our results suggest that NPC2 may play a role in the cellular transport of a variety of sterols in addition to cholesterol, an observation that may be important in understanding the pathogenic events that take place in the absence of this protein. Materials—Cholesterol was obtained from Nu-Chek (Elysian, MN). Oleate, palmitate, oleoyl lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA, also named bis(monacylglycero)phosphate), and 25-hydroxycholesterol were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 5-α-Cholestan-3-β-ol, 5-β-cholestan-3-β-ol, and 24-hydroxycholesterol were obtained from Steraloids (Newport, RI). Other sterols, lipids, and drugs were from Sigma. Endoglycosidase H-maltose-binding protein fusion protein (Endo Hf, subsequently referred to as Endo H) and PNGase F were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Ten percent bis-tris NuPAGE gels were purchased from Invitrogen. Sypro ruby protein gel stain was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Ezetimibe was obtained by extracting Zetia tablets (Merck/Schering-Plough) with chloroform/methanol followed by preparative TLC. Human NPC2 Purification—Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with the human NPC2 cDNA subcloned into the expression vector pMSXND (17Lee S.J. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3521-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a cDNA expression cassette driven by the mouse metallothionein promoter, a neo expression cassette, and a mouse dihydrofolate reductase expression cassette. Cells were selected with G418 and resistant clones challenged with increasing concentrations of methotrexate. One clone that proliferated in the presence of 800 μm methotrexate, designated NPC2-800 number 7, was used for production of recombinant protein. Serum-free conditioned medium was collected as described (18Lin L. Lobel P. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), except that 50 μm ZnCl2 was included in the medium. For some preparations, cells were cultured in 1050-cm2 roller bottles containing 260 ml of medium at the American Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). In a typical purification, conditioned media from 33 roller bottles (9Kirchhoff C. Osterhoff C. Young L. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar liters) were centrifuged at 5600 × g for 20 min and concentrated to 400 ml using a 5-kDa cut-off tangential flow filtration membrane (CDUF002 LC, Millipore, Bedford, MA). All procedures were conducted at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. The membrane was washed three times with 100 ml of PBS, and the pooled retentate and washes were equilibrated into 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, by diafiltration using a stirred cell equipped with a YM10 membrane (Millipore). The material was applied to a DE52 column (5 × 30 cm; Whatman) and an SP-Sephadex C-25 column (5 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare) attached in series to partially deplete the mixture of contaminating proteins. This ion-exchange depletion step was conducted at room temperature. The flow-through was concentrated and buffer exchanged into 12.5 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, using ultrafiltration. NPC2 was purified, and different glycoforms were partially resolved by chromatography on a Mono S 10/100GL column (GE Healthcare) that was eluted using a linear 20-column volume gradient of 12.5 to 512.5 mm ammonium acetate at a 2 ml/min flow rate. To improve the resolution, multiple runs, corresponding to material obtained from ∼3 roller bottles, were performed for each preparation. Chromatography was conducted using an Akta Explorer high pressure liquid chromatograph (GE Healthcare). Fractions were pooled to encompass the major peaks described in Fig. 1. Glycosylation Site Analysis—Indicated ion-exchange fractions were incubated overnight with Endo H at room temperature in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, under nondenaturing conditions. Parallel samples were denatured in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 10 min followed by addition of 1% Nonidet P-40 and then incubated overnight with PNGase F at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, visualized by Sypro ruby and Coomassie staining, and bands of interest excised from the gel. Protein in gel slices was digested with modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the method used by the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and then stored at 4 °C. Digests were mixed 1:1 with a saturated matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 10 mm ammonium phosphate monobasic or sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing internal peptide standards (bradykinin, MH+ 1060.5692 Da; ACTH clip 18–39, MH+ 2465.1989 Da; ACTH clip 7–38, MH+ 3657.9294 Da; Sigma). Peptides were analyzed using a Voyager DE Pro mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) operated in the reflector mode. Analytical Mono S Chromatography—Samples were brought to a concentration of 1 mg/ml (68 μm) protein in 12.5 ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, using a Centricon YM10. Typically, 50 μg of protein was applied to a Mono S PC 1.6/5 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using a linear 60-column volume (6 ml) gradient of 12.5 to 512.5 mm ammonium acetate at a 0.2 ml/min flow rate. Lipid Analysis and Delipidation—The purified NPC2 fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml prior to organic solvent extraction. In some cases, the solution was mixed with 2 volumes of acetone, 1 mm HCl to extract bound lipids and to precipitate delipidated protein for further use. In other cases, lipids were isolated by extracting the solution twice with an equal volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v). Extracts were dried using a stream of N2 gas, and the material was either analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization following trimethylsilylation as described previously (16Sleat D.E. Wiseman J.A. El-Banna M. Price S.M. Verot L. Shen M.M. Tint G.S. Vanier M.T. Walkley S.U. Lobel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5886-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) or resuspended into a small volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) for further analysis by TLC. Extracts or standards (cholesteryl oleate, triolein, oleate, sn-1,2-diolein, monoolein, cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine, and LBPA) were visualized using iodine vapor after separation using 10 × 20-cm high performance TLC plates (Silica Gel G; Whatman, Hillsboro, OR) and the two-step solvent development method described previously (19Trotter P.J. Storch J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 293-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol Clearance Experiments—Fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator on 16-well glass-bottom slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) in RPMI/glutamax-1 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 15% fetal bovine serum. Cells were refed with fresh media containing delipidated NPC2 (100 nm final concentration of protein isolated from the indicated peak) in the presence and absence of 10 mm mannose 6-phosphate. After 24 h, cells were brought to room temperature, washed three times with PBS for 5 min each, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed three times with PBS, and stained with 50 μg/ml filipin complex (Sigma) and 1 μm SYTOX Green (Invitrogen) in PBS for 60 min. After washing the cells three times with PBS, wells were removed, and the slides were mounted with coverslips in FluoroGuard antifade reagent (Bio-Rad). The slides were viewed under an Olympus-IX81 spinning-disk confocal microscope equipped with X-Cite 120 lamp (EXFO) and Cooke Sensicam QE camera (Applied Scientific Instrumentation). SYTOX Green images were captured using 492/18 nm excitation and 535/40 nm emission filters with a multiwavelength dichroic mirror. Visualization of this nuclear counterstain was used for focusing the microscope prior to visualization of filipin images using 360/40 nm excitation and 465/30 nm emission filters. Binding Experiments—Delipidated NPC2 in 12.5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, was incubated with 1.5 mol eq of the compound of interest for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed by analytical cation-exchange chromatography as described above. Experiments were conducted using 50 μl of 68 μm NPC2 except when using the poorly soluble cholesterol butyrate, cholesterol palmitate, and cholesterol acetate, where the reactions contained 6.8 μm NPC2 in a volume of 500 μl. Control experiments using cholesterol indicated that the larger volume and lower reactant concentrations did not affect the ability to detect binding using the chromatography assay. Test compounds were dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent (typically Me2SO) and the final concentration of organic solvent in the incubation mixture was below 5%. For calculation of binding stoichiometry, we determined the concentration of DHE from its absorbance at 328 nm and calculated its contribution toward absorbance at 280 nm using its reported extinction coefficients of 1.055 × 104 and 1.686 × 104 m–1 cm–1 at 328 and 280 nm, respectively (20Smutzer G. Crawford B.F. Yeagle P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 862: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Mogensen J.E. Wimmer R. Larsen J.N. Spangfort M.D. Otzen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23684-23692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Control experiments adding DHE directly to methanol or to excess NPC2 in aqueous solution indicated that free DHE in organic solvent and DHE associated with NPC2 had similar extinction coefficients at 328 nm. The concentration of NPC2 was determined using the extinction coefficient of 1.686 ×104 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm obtained using the Prot Parameter tool on the Expasy website after correcting for the contribution of DHE. The ratio of DHE/NPC2 was essentially constant in the region of co-elution for all traces analyzed. Competition Binding Assay—Conditions were as described above for the direct binding assay, except that NPC2 (68 μm) was incubated with test ligand (102 μm) for 30 min followed by incubation with DHE (80 μm, 1 μl of a 4 mm solution in ethanol added to the 50-μl reaction mixture). The incubation was continued for another 30 min before conducting analytical cation-exchange chromatography. The integrated peak area of the absorbance at 328 nm was used to estimate DHE associated with NPC2, using three or four independent determinations for each test ligand. Analysis of Mouse Liver Sterols—Procedures involving live animals were conducted in compliance with approved protocols from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Genotyping was conducted as described previously (16Sleat D.E. Wiseman J.A. El-Banna M. Price S.M. Verot L. Shen M.M. Tint G.S. Vanier M.T. Walkley S.U. Lobel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Livers were removed and stored at –80 °C. Analysis of cholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol was conducted as described previously (22Honda A. Salen G. Shefer S. Batta A.K. Honda M. Xu G. Tint G.S. Matsuzaki Y. Shoda J. Tanaka N. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1520-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: coprostanol (50 μg), the anti-oxidant BHT (20 μg), and [2H4]7β-hydroxycholesterol (0.25 μg) (a gift from Dr. Ashok K. Batta) were added to 50–100 mg of minced tissue. The mixture was hydrolyzed at room temperature for 1 h in 1 n ethanolic NaOH, and the sterols were extracted exhaustively with hexane. One-tenth of the material was removed and used for cholesterol measurement by GC. The remainder was dried, redissolved in 1 ml of toluene, and applied to a 2-ml Sep-Pak silica cartridge (Waters) that had been preconditioned with 1 ml of hexane. Monohydroxylated sterols (e.g. cholesterol) were removed by washing the cartridge with 8 ml of hexane/propanol (98:2 v/v), and the polyhydroxylated sterols were recovered by flushing the cartridges with 5 ml of hexane/propanol (70:30 v/v) and collecting the eluant. The residue was dried, silylated, and subjected to selected ion monitoring GC-MS using a HP5792A mass detector interfaced to a HP6890 capillary GC (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Monitoring of the positive ions was carried out at m/z 413 (24S-hydroxycholesterol; M-90-43), m/z 456 (27- and 7β-hydroxycholesterol; M-90), and m/z 460 ([2H4]7β-hydroxycholesterol; M-90). Commercial standards of the three oxysterols (Steraloids, Newport, RI) were used to calibrate retention times and system response. Purification and Glycosylation Analysis of NPC2—Purification of recombinant human NPC2 protein produced using a Chinese hamster ovary cell expression system yielded six major peaks following cation-exchange chromatography at pH 4.5 (Fig. 1). The total recovery of NPC2 protein in all peaks was ∼6–7 mg per liter of conditioned medium. Analysis using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, inset) and linear MALDI-TOF MS (data not shown) indicated that peak 1 consisted of a heterogeneous mixture of isoforms with an average molecular mass of 18.9 kDa. Peaks 2–4 consisted of two principal isoforms, each heterogeneous, with average molecular masses of 18.5 and 17.7 kDa. Peaks 5 and 6 consisted of a heterogeneous isoform with an average molecular mass of 16.3 kDa. (Note that NPC2 migrates anomalously by SDS-PAGE. Thus, the molecular weights listed here and in Fig. 1 that were obtained by MS analysis are not in accordance with the predicted molecular weights obtained by comparison with the standards shown in Fig. 2.) All bands consisted of NPC2 as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown), and SDS-PAGE and Western blotting revealed that the minor peaks present in Fig. 1 eluting between major peaks 1 and 6 also consisted of NPC2 isoforms. Edman degradation demonstrated that all had the same amino terminus (EPV...) starting at the predicted signal sequence cleavage site as found in NPC2 purified from human brain (8Naureckiene S. Sleat D.E. Lackland H. Fensom A. Vanier M.T. Wattiaux R. Jadot M. Lobel P. Science. 2000; 290: 2298-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Peptide mass finger-printing revealed that all isoforms ended at the sequence predicted from the NPC2 cDNA sequence, indicating the absence of carboxyl-terminal processing (see below). Given that the average molecular mass calculated for the mature NPC2 protein is 14,579 Da and masses were obtained from MS analysis, this indicates the presence of post-translational modifications ranging from 1.7 to 4.3 kDa on the different NPC2 isoforms. PNGase F digestion collapsed all isoforms to a uniform mass of ∼15 kDa, indicating that the heterogeneity observed by SDS-PAGE was because of differences in glycosylation (Fig. 2). This was further investigated using a combination of glycosidase digestion and peptide mass fingerprinting. Our conclusions regarding the glycosylation state of the three potential N-linked glycosylation sequences on NPC2 are summarized in Table 1, and the evidence for these assignments is detailed below.Table 1Glycosylation site utilization of NPC2PeakAsn-19Asn-39Asn-1161—MC2—MM > C3—MC > M4—MM > C5—M—6—M— Open table in a new tab Our strategy to identify the precise sites and nature of the modifications was based on the following. Human NPC2 contains three asparagines at residues 19, 39, and 116 (numbering based on the sequence of the mature protein) in the context of a potential glycosylation sequence NX(S/T). These residues are encompassed by the theoretical tryptic peptides 17–32, 33–49, and 116–132 that have calculated monoisotopic MH+ ions of 1843.9, 1859.9, and 2070.0 Da, respectively. If no post-translational modifications are present, PNGase F or Endo H treatment would have no effect on these peptides, and peptides of the predicted masses should be observed. If a potential glycosylation site is occupied, this would shift the mass upward considerably, resulting in the disappearance of the predicted peptide from the observed mass window. However, deglycosylation with PNGase F removes essentially all mammalian N-linked oligosaccharides and converts the oligosaccharide-linked Asn to Asp. Thus, a PNGase F-treated glycopeptide will have a mass 1.0 Da greater than that of the corresponding unmodified peptide. Similarly, if an N-linked glycan is susceptible to Endo H, which cleaves high mannose and some hybrid oligosaccharides between the inner two GlcNAc residues, digestion of a glycosylated peptide would yield a GlcNAc-linked Asn, which has a mass 203.1 Da greater than the corresponding unmodified peptide. Thus, by comparing the changes in the migration of the glycosidase-treated NPC2 isoforms following PNGase F and Endo H treatment, and then further digesting the proteins with trypsin and analyzing the peptides using mass spectrometry (MS), it is possible to determine whether a given Asn is glycosylated and also the nature of the modification. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that NPC2 isoforms present in peak 1 shifted slightly following Endo H digestion and markedly following PNGase F digestion (Fig. 2). MS analysis of in-gel tryptic digests of all bands derived from untreated, PNGase F-treated, and Endo H-treated peak 1 revealed that the peptide encompassing Asn-19 was present with the predicted MH+ of 1843.9 Da, demonstrating that this potential glycosylation site is not utilized (Fig. 3). In contrast, the unmodified peptide encompassing Asn-39 was not detected, whereas PNGase F and Endo H treatments generated the appropriate MH+ + 1 and MH+ + 203.1 fragments of 1860.9 and 2063.0 Da, respectively, demonstrating that Asn-39 was modified with an Endo H-sensitive oligosaccharide (Fig. 4). For Asn-116, an ion corresponding to the unmodified tryptic peptide 116–132 was not found (Fig. 5A) in any spectra, but the predicted MH+ + 1 of 2071.0 Da appeared in the PNGase F-treated sample (Fig. 5B). PNGase F-treated peak 1 also contained a 3424.7-Da singly charged ion that corresponds to the MH+ + 1 of peptide 105–132, an incompletely cleaved tryptic fragment that encompasses Asn-116 (Fig. 5D). The unmodified peptide 105–132 was not detected (Fig. 5C). Finally, in the Endo H-treated peak 1 tryptic digests, the predicted MH+ + 203.1 peaks corresponding to GlcNAc-modified peptides 105–132 or 116–132 were not detected (Fig. 6A and data not shown). This indicates that Asn-116 on the NPC2 isoform present in peak 1 is linked to an Endo H-resistant oligosaccharide.FIGURE 4MALDI-TOF analysis of Asn-39-containing peptides. Peptide 33–49 of human NPC2 containing the second potential site Asn-39 was examined as described in Fig. 3. Relevant regions of the spectra are shown for untreated (A and C), PNGase F-treated (B), and Endo H-treated (D) material.

Although previous studies indicated that the tumor suppressor p53 is critically involved in mediating both responses, how a cell decides which pathway to take is not well established. The zinc-finger-containing transcription factor, Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), is a crucial mediator for the checkpoint functions of p53 after γ-irradiation and does so by inhibiting the transition from the G1 to S and G2 to M phases of the cell cycle. Here, we determined the role of KLF4 in modulating the apoptotic response following γ-irradiation. In three independent cell systems including colorectal cancer cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts in which expression of KLF4 could be manipulated, we observed that γ-irradiated cells underwent apoptosis if KLF4 was absent. In the presence of KLF4, the degree of apoptosis was significantly reduced and cells resorted to checkpoint arrest. The mechanism by which KLF4 accomplished this antiapoptotic effect is by activating expression of the cell cycle arrest gene, p21WAF1/CIP1, and by inhibiting the ability of p53 to transactivate expression of the proapoptotic gene, BAX. Results of our study illustrate an unexpected antiapoptotic function of KLF4, heretofore considered a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, and suggest that KLF4 may be an important determinant of cell fate following γ-radiation-induced DNA damage."

A new study suggests that a reaction-diffusion mechanism also plays a key role. Establishment of left-right asymmetry in vertebrates involves cilia as essential components in the breaking of symmetry, an asymmetric signaling cascade, and a midline barrier that helps to maintain asymmetry. A new study suggests that a reaction-diffusion mechanism also plays a key role. The vertebrate body plan is inherently left-right asymmetric, with internal organs such as the heart, stomach, and intestines having both asymmetric structure and asymmetric positions within the body cavity. Strikingly, however, these gross anatomical asymmetries arise in early embryos that are bilaterally symmetrical along the mediolateral axis. A decade ago, nothing was known about the molecular or genetic underpinnings of left-right asymmetric morphogenesis, and no genes with left-right asymmetric expression had been identified. Since then, however, several discoveries have led to an emerging picture of how left-right asymmetry is initiated, stabilized, propagated, and translated into asymmetric organogenesis during development of vertebrate embryos. The first breakthrough was the identification of a cascade of asymmetrically expressed signals present in the developing chick embryo during gastrulation, long before overt asymmetric morphogenesis (Levin et al., 1995Levin M. Johnson R.L. Stern C.D. Kuehn M. Tabin C. Cell. 1995; 82: 801-814Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (660) Google Scholar). These signals included asymmetric expression of the gene Sonic hedgehog (Shh) on the left side of the chick embryo, which induced expression of Nodal (a TGFβ family member), first in a small domain adjacent to a structure known as Hensen's Node at the rostral end of the primitive streak and subsequently in a broad domain throughout the left lateral plate. The discovery of this pathway was a turning point and provided the first molecular marker for left-right asymmetry that could be used to follow left-right patterning prior to overt asymmetric morphogenesis. It also provided a broad outline of the process of left-right patterning: the establishment of asymmetric domains of gene expression during gastrulation in small regions near the node, followed by broad asymmetric signaling throughout the left lateral plate mesoderm. Crucially, this study also identified Nodal as a key left-sided signal. A number of additional genes have been added to this general framework (see reviews by Levin, 2005Levin M. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, Raya and Belmonte, 2006Raya A. Belmonte J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar; and references therein). Many of these have proven, rather surprisingly, to be specific to particular classes of vertebrates (Mammalia, Amphibia, Aves, etc.), including the asymmetric expression of Shh at the node in birds. Two key proteins, which are conserved in their expression and activated downstream of Nodal, are the highly divergent TGFβ family member Lefty (encoded by the two closely related genes Lefty1 and Lefty2) and the transcription factor Pitx2. Neither is expressed in the Nodal domain adjacent to the node, but both are activated in response to Nodal signaling throughout the left lateral plate. Lefty1 also is expressed on the left side of the midline in the floor plate of the neural tube. If there are extensive domains in which signals are asymmetrically expressed on the right and left sides of the embryo, then there needs to be a mechanism for keeping them separate from one another. The idea that the midline acts as a barrier during left-right specification was first proposed by Danos and Yost, 1996Danos M.C. Yost H.J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar to explain the results of experiments where the midline was experimentally manipulated or excised. Similar conclusions were reached by analysis of cross-signaling between twin embryos (Levin et al., 1996Levin M. Roberts D.J. Holmes L.B. Tabin C. Nature. 1996; 384: 321Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and subsequently in experiments using mouse mutants where the midline is compromised (reviewed in Levin, 2005Levin M. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Analysis of mice deficient in Lefty1 gave molecular teeth to the midline barrier model and suggested that the barrier is formed, at least in part, by the activation of this gene (Meno et al., 1998Meno C. Shimoni A. Saijoh Y. Yashiro K. Mochida K. Ohishi S. Noji S. Kondoh H. Hamada H. Cell. 1998; 94: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The fact that the earliest asymmetrically expressed genes are active at the node (Levin, 2005Levin M. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) drew attention to this structure as a location where the initial left-right decision might be made. Notably, the cells on the ventral surface of the mouse embryo node each have a monocilium projecting from their apical surface. A variety of genetic conditions in which the left-right orientation of internal organs is randomized have in common defects in cilia formation (Levin, 2005Levin M. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, Tabin, 2005Tabin C. J. Mol. Histol. 2005; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Raya and Belmonte, 2006Raya A. Belmonte J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Shiratori and Hamada, 2006Shiratori H. Hamada H. Development. 2006; 133: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, Hirokawa et al., 2006Hirokawa N. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Takeda S. Cell. 2006; 125: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These convergent facts were put into a coherent context with the demonstration that the node cilia are motile (Nonaka et al., 1998Nonaka S. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Takeda S. Harada A. Kanai Y. Kido M. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1998; 95: 829-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar), and that they all rotate in a consistent clockwise direction generating a unidirectional leftward flow of extracellular fluid. The rotating cilia are able to generate fluid flow, in part, because they are all tilted toward the posterior. Mice unable to assemble cilia or with immotile cilia lack this flow and have randomized organ situs. Moreoever, artificial generation of directional flow was shown to be sufficient to specify downstream left-right asymmetric signaling and morphogenesis (Nonaka et al., 2002Nonaka S. Shiratori H. Saijoh Y. Hamada H. Nature. 2002; 418: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The “nodal flow” hypothesis (Nonaka et al., 1998Nonaka S. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Takeda S. Harada A. Kanai Y. Kido M. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1998; 95: 829-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar) emerging from these studies explains from first principles that a symmetric field of cilia, all rotating in the same direction, sets in motion a leftward flow of extracellular fluid, thereby breaking the bilaterally symmetric landscape of the early embryo. A contentious question concerns the mechanism by which movement of fluid across the node is translated into asymmetric patterns of gene expression (see the contrasting reviews by Raya and Belmonte, 2006Raya A. Belmonte J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Hirokawa et al., 2006Hirokawa N. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Takeda S. Cell. 2006; 125: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, Shiratori and Hamada, 2006Shiratori H. Hamada H. Development. 2006; 133: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, Levin, 2005Levin M. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed: asymmetric deformation of mechanosensory cilia, or the “two cilia” hypothesis, and the unidirectional transport of a morphogen. The two cilia model posits two classes of cilia, one generating a leftward flow and the second responding to it (Brueckner, 2001Brueckner M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 101: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Tabin and Vogan, 2003Tabin C. Vogan K.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea of a second class of mechanosensory cilia that sense nodal flow, mutations in PKD2, a gene implicated in polycystic kidney disease, disrupt cilia-based mechanoreception in the mouse embryo and also disrupt early left-right signaling. PKD2 appears to encode a cilia-gated calcium ion release channel. A subset of cilia at the node do indeed express PKD2, and moreover, intracellular calcium ion release can be detected at the left, but not the right, periphery of the node. However, mathematical modeling of fluid dynamics in the mouse embryo node suggests that, even in the presence of directional flow, the magnitude of shear stresses and flow velocities produced should be equivalent across the node and hence unable to asymmetrically deform cilia (discussed in Raya and Belmonte, 2006Raya A. Belmonte J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The alternative hypothesis of morphogen transport (suggested candidate morphogens include Fgf8, GDF1, and Nodal) has also been challenged on theoretical grounds, arguing that such small molecules would not be redistributed as demanded by the morphogen model. A variant on this hypothesis, which circumvents the biophysical issues, is based on the finding that Shh and retinoic acid are encapsulated in an Fgf-dependent process into membrane wrapped Nodal Vesicular Parcels (NVPs), which are indeed asymmetrically transported by the flow across the node (reviewed in Hirokawa et al., 2006Hirokawa N. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Takeda S. Cell. 2006; 125: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, in spite of careful analysis, there is no hint of left-right asymmetric Shh or retinoid signaling at the node. Thus, this model requires the ad hoc, and so far unsubstantiated, proposition of a noncanonical vertebrate Hedgehog signaling pathway. Moreover, this model leaves unexplained the genetic identification of PKD2 and inversin, both expressed in node cilia, as early determinants of left-right asymmetric gene expression in the mouse embryo (reviewed in Tabin and Vogan, 2003Tabin C. Vogan K.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, Tabin, 2005Tabin C. J. Mol. Histol. 2005; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Other objections can be raised to each of these models (reviewed in Tabin, 2005Tabin C. J. Mol. Histol. 2005; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and, at this juncture, the issue of how nodal flow is interpreted remains unresolved. Nonetheless, genetic data strongly point to node cilia as the structures responsible for breaking symmetry in the mouse embryo. Similarly, it is striking that all known mutations producing situs inversus totalis in humans also implicate a ciliary mechanism for breaking symmetry, making it extremely likely that the nodal flow hypothesis, in one form or another, is the correct explanation for the initiation of left-right asymmetry in mammals. With the discoveries of nodal flow, the downstream signaling cascade, and the midline barrier, the overall scheme by which left-right patterning is set up in mammals seemed clear. Now, a new study by Nakamura et al., 2006Nakamura T. Mine N. Nakaguchi E. Mochizuki A. Yanamoto M. Yashiro K. Meno C. Hamada H. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar in this month's Developmental Cell forces us to change the way we think about each of these steps in light of the realization that Nodal acts through a modified reaction-diffusion mechanism to direct left-right asymmetry. Reaction-diffusion systems were first conceived to provide a theoretical mechanism to create stable positional values across a responsive developmental field. A reaction-diffusion system comprises two diffusible molecules: an activator that positively regulates production of both molecules and a feedback inhibitor that negatively regulates the activator but does not regulate itself (Turing, 1952Turing A.M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B. 1952; 237: 37-72Crossref Google Scholar). Under these conditions, self-enhancing and laterally inhibiting properties emerge that reinforce initial discontinuities in a homogeneous system to yield sharp, discrete patterns. The left-side determinant Nodal is capable of inducing its own expression, whereas its downstream target Lefty acts as a feedback inhibitor of Nodal activity (see reviews by Raya and Belmonte, 2006Raya A. Belmonte J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Levin, 2005Levin M. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Based on this information, several groups realized that Nodal and Lefty could, in principle, constitute a reaction-diffusion system (Saijoh et al., 2000Saijoh Y. Adachi H. Sakuma R. Yeo C.Y. Yashiro K. Watanabe M. Hashiguchi H. Mochida K. Ohishi S. Kawabata M. et al.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 35-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, Chen and Schier, 2002Chen Y. Schier A.F. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2124-2128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Hamada et al., 2002Hamada H. Meno C. Watanabe D. Saijoh Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). For a reaction-diffusion system to be effective, the inhibitor must diffuse more quickly than the activator. Based on studies using tagged exogenous proteins, it does indeed appear that the Lefty protein spreads farther than Nodal (Sakuma et al., 2002Sakuma R. Ohnishi Y. Meno C. Fujii H. Juan H. Takeuchi J. Ogura T. Li B. Miyazono K. Hamada H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, Nakamura et al., 2006Nakamura T. Mine N. Nakaguchi E. Mochizuki A. Yanamoto M. Yashiro K. Meno C. Hamada H. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), although the actual relative speeds of diffusion remain to be verified in real time. Nodal and Lefty most accurately fit the formulation of a reaction-diffusion system in the left lateral plate where Nodal induces itself and its inhibitor Lefty. The self-enhancing autoinduction component of this system can explain the rapid spread of Nodal throughout the lateral plate (Figure 1D). Moreover, the transient nature of Nodal expression in the lateral plate can potentially be explained by the subsequent diffusion of the inhibitor, Lefty2, through the tissue (Figure 1E). The longer range diffusion of Lefty2 from the left lateral plate to the right side also may explain the block in the contralateral activation of downstream left-side targets such as the transcription factor Pitx2. The effectiveness of this feedback system in maintaining unilateral signaling is potentiated by mediolateral differences in the responsiveness of different tissues to Nodal signaling. The intermediate mesoderm does not respond at all to Nodal signaling, creating a spatial gap that puts distance between high levels of Nodal and Lefty in the left lateral plate and the potentially responsive lateral plate on the right side. Given that Lefty diffuses further than Nodal, inhibition over activation is favored on the contralateral side (Figure 1D). The perinodal region is only capable of inducing Nodal in response to Nodal signaling. Conversely, Lefty1 but not Nodal is induced along the entire midline in response to Nodal. The localized induction of the inhibitor, but not the activator, deviates from a pure reaction-diffusion mechanism. However, it creates a source of inhibitor between the activator and the contralateral tissue that acts as a midline barrier, enhancing the fidelity of the system (Figure 1B). The Nakamura et al., 2006Nakamura T. Mine N. Nakaguchi E. Mochizuki A. Yanamoto M. Yashiro K. Meno C. Hamada H. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar study focuses on an additional property of reaction-diffusion systems: the ability to convert small differences in signaling between two distinct regions into a robust difference through local activation and long-range inhibition. The temporal expression patterns of Nodal show that, initially, this key signal is activated almost as strongly on the right as on the left in the perinodal region (as judged by in situ hybridization). This suggests that the activity of cilia (whether mediated by a transported morphogen or by a mechanosensory mechanism) may not yield unilateral signaling but rather may produce signaling that is only slightly biased toward one side (Figure 1A). Only the left side triggers subsequent expression of Nodal in the lateral plate mesoderm. To explain the conversion of this initial bias in signaling to robust left-side determination, Nakamura et al., 2006Nakamura T. Mine N. Nakaguchi E. Mochizuki A. Yanamoto M. Yashiro K. Meno C. Hamada H. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar developed a self-enhancement, lateral inhibition in silico model of Nodal and Lefty behavior. In this model, the slight difference in Nodal expression across the node is translated into a transient induction of Nodal in both the left and right lateral plate mesoderm. Quickly, however, autoinduction in the lateral plate mesoderm and lateral inhibition across the entire embryo produces robust unilateral expression of Nodal on the left side. The induction of the inhibitor Lefty1 in the midline is an important component in achieving this. Mathematical modeling indicates that Lefty1 is more important in this regard than Lefty2 produced in the left lateral plate mesoderm. The simulations carried out by Nakamura and colleagues indicate that an initial difference in the intensity of Nodal signaling as small as a 3:2 ratio between the left and right sides would be sufficient to generate asymmetric gene expression (Figure 1C). If such a reaction-diffusion mechanism is really responsible for amplifying the initial difference in left and right perinodal expression of Nodal, then there are a number of testable predictions. For example, increasing the level of Nodal initially expressed on the right side, increasing the amount of the inhibitor Lefty produced on the left, or simply removing the left lateral plate mesoderm should all reverse the bias and result in right-sided expression of Nodal in the right lateral plate while blocking Nodal expression in the left. These predictions were experimentally tested and the outcomes were indeed as predicted (Nakamura et al., 2006Nakamura T. Mine N. Nakaguchi E. Mochizuki A. Yanamoto M. Yashiro K. Meno C. Hamada H. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, while surgical removal of the left-side source of Nodal signaling resulted in activation of Nodal expression in the right lateral plate mesoderm, it failed to do so if the node itself was also removed, verifying that the initiation of Nodal expression requires signaling from the node itself. Appreciation of the role of reaction-diffusion and the regulation of gene expression in the lateral plate mesoderm mechanistically explains the phenotypes of several mouse mutants that had been confusing. These include the phenotypic differences between mice deficient in the ability to produce cilia (such as Kif3a, Kif3b, Polaris, and Winn mutants) and those with immotile cilia (such as the iv mutant). That Nodal and Lefty form a reaction-diffusion system changes how we view previous advances in the field. For instance, although the midline is certainly involved in preventing inappropriate expression of left-sided genes on the right, it should probably not be called a “barrier.” More accurately, the midline is essential for allowing lateral inhibition to reach from the left lateral plate mesoderm to the right. In its absence, it is not Nodal leaking across from the left lateral plate that triggers right-side gene expression, but rather it is intrinsic right-side Nodal activity that is not inhibited. The midline plays this transduction role both actively (by expressing Lefty1 but not Nodal, thereby amplifying inhibitory activity) and passively (in the sense that long-range Lefty2 activity cannot reach the contralateral side if the midline tissue is physically disrupted). Our view of the fluid flow produced by rotating cilia must also change, as it is now apparent that this mechanism is very inefficient, yielding a very small difference in Nodal activity. It is through the reaction-diffusion system that broad, distinct asymmetric gene expression patterns are produced that convey asymmetric specification. Without reaction-diffusion, the cilia would be ineffectual and the two are therefore inexorably linked into a single mechanism for generating asymmetry. For years, the overriding goal has been to identify the mechanism by which symmetry is first broken. However, the focus on breaking symmetry as the key issue with downstream events being viewed as of secondary importance reflects our intellectual conceit that we could intuit the most critical step of a process before even knowing the nature of the pathway. It is now apparent that the mechanism by which bilateral symmetry is broken is not, in fact, conserved, and at least from an evolutionary standpoint the initial breaking of bilateral symmetry within the embryo does not appear to be the key event. In many taxa, molecular left-right asymmetries are observed well before cilia are present (reviewed in Tabin, 2005Tabin C. J. Mol. Histol. 2005; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Levin, 2005Levin M. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). For example, in chick embryos, there is asymmetric expression of an activin receptor on the right side of the primitive streak long before markers of ciliary motility are expressed. Even more striking, in the frog Xenopus, left-right asymmetric expression of an H+/V-ATPase occurs at the four-cell stage. Similarly, there is asymmetric phosphorylation of Syndecan-2 by PKC-γ, and evidence for asymmetric gap junction signaling prior to cilia formation in Xenopus. Importantly, all of these early, pre-cilia molecular asymmetries regulate later morphological asymmetry in amphibians. If cilia are not responsible for breaking symmetry in all vertebrates, and the data, especially from Xenopus, make it clear that they are not, then what mechanisms are used instead? A few ingenious alternatives have been proposed based on the action of gap junctions and ion transporters (Levin, 2005Levin M. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), but these seem somewhat ad hoc in their required assumptions. An attractive possibility might involve the action of directional motor proteins, such as those involved in ciliogenesis, working on chiral intracellular cytoskeletal components polarized with respect to the orientation of the cell itself. Indeed, there is some evidence for the importance of microtubule and actin cytoskeletal organization and microtubule-dependent motor proteins acting as obligate determinants of left-right asymmetry early in Xenopus development (Qiu et al., 2005Qiu D. Cheng S.M. Wozniak L. McSweeney M. Perrone E. Levin M. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 176-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the molecular determinants of left-right asymmetry are maternally inherited in Xenopus and some other vertebrates. A precedent for this comes from the snail Limnaea peregra, where the snail embryo coils either left or right based on the genotype of its mother (Freeman and Lundelius, 1982Freeman G. Lundelius J.W. Wilhelm Roux's Archives. 1982; 191: 69-83Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Frogs and birds are closer phylogenetically to mammals than are fish, and yet the evidence supporting the cilia mechanism in both mammals and fish is compelling. This leaves only two possibilities: the cilia mechanism evolved independently in fish and mammals, which seems extremely unlikely, or the cilia mechanism operated in a common vertebrate ancestor but was subsequently lost in the amphibian and avian lineages and replaced by nonciliary mechanisms. Regardless, it is clear that left-right asymmetry can be achieved in some vertebrates without using cilia and Nodal flow. In contrast to the apparent diversity in symmetry-breaking mechanisms in vertebrates, there is a striking conservation in the role played by Lefty and Nodal. The small bilateral perinodal domains of Nodal, the midline domain of Lefty, and the left lateral plate domains of both of these genes are present in frog and chick embryos even though the initiation event appears to differ. Moreover, the expression of these genes is conserved not only in vertebrates but in all deuterostomes including cephalochordates (amphioxus), urochordates (ascidians), and echinoderms (reviewed in Duboc and Lepage, 2006Duboc V. Lepage T. J. Exp. Zoolog. B Mol. Dev. Evol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tissue layer and even the side of the embryo where Nodal and Lefty are active can vary, but the general pattern of broad unilateral expression is universal (Figures 1F–1H). These data suggest that the reaction-diffusion mechanism produced by the coupled regulation of Nodal activation and the Lefty feedback inhibitor is evolutionarily conserved. It seems to be at the root of left-right asymmetry in deuterostomes, enabling broad left-right specification after a variety of symmetry-breaking mechanisms induce an initial small left-right bias in signaling. Notably, the small bilateral domains of Nodal seen in the vertebrate perinodal region and similarly observed in the early ascidian embryo (Figure 1G) are not found either in amphioxus or in echinoderms. Similarly, these species do not display midline expression of Lefty. Hence, in these taxa, the lateral-inhibition self-enhancement mechanism apparently does not amplify a small initial asymmetry. Thus, the reaction-diffusion mechanism first may have evolved in the context of a robust symmetry-breaking mechanism to promote the spread of Nodal throughout a unilateral domain while blocking its spread contralaterally. Once this primary role was established, the properties of the system were such that they could subsequently be co-opted for amplifying small differences. In evolutionary terms, the system was “preadapted” for this second task, allowing other less robust mechanisms of symmetry breaking, such as cilia-generated nodal flow, to be used as a trigger while still ensuring a robust outcome. The discovery of the cilia mechanism has been important for explaining the etiology of situs defects in patients with immotile cilia (Kartagener's syndrome). However, from a developmental perspective, the goal is to understand how nature is able to produce organisms with distinct left and right anatomies. We now know that there are multiple ways of getting asymmetry rolling. It was the evolutionary innovation of the Nodal-Lefty reaction-diffusion system that was the key step in making our asymmetric body plan possible."

Crystal structures are reported for Rnl2 at discrete steps along this pathway: the covalent Rnl2-AMP intermediate; Rnl2 bound to an adenylylated nicked duplex, captured immediately following step 2; and Rnl2 at an adenylylated nick in a state poised for step 3. These structures illuminate the stereochemistry of nucleotidyl transfer and reveal how remodeling of active-site contacts and conformational changes propel the ligation reaction forward. Mutational analysis and comparison of nick-bound structures of Rnl2 and human DNA ligase I highlight common and divergent themes of substrate recognition that can explain their specialization for RNA versus DNA repair."

Previous studies of our group suggest UbcH10 expression as a valid indicator of the proliferative and aggressive status of thyroid carcinomas. Therefore, to better understand the process of ovarian carcinogenesis, and to look for possible tools to be used as prognostic markers in these neoplasias, we decided to extend the analysis of the UbcH10 expression to the ovarian neoplastic disease. We found that the UbcH10 gene was upregulated in some ovarian carcinoma cell lines analysed. Then, immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that UbcH10 expression significantly correlates with the tumor grade and the undifferentiated histotype of the ovarian carcinomas. Furthermore, a significant relationship between UbcH10 expression and overall survival was observed. Finally, the block of UbcH10 protein synthesis by RNA interference inhibited the growth of ovarian carcinoma cell lines, suggesting a role of UbcH10 overexpression in ovarian carcinogenesis. Therefore, all these data taken together suggest the possibility to use UbcH10 detection as a marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of these neoplastic diseases and open the perspective of a therapy of some ovarian carcinomas based on the suppression of the UbcH10 synthesis and/or function."

https://openalex.org/W2091370217,"Progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) involves spatial and temporal occurrences of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereby tumour cells acquire a more invasive and metastatic phenotype. Subsequently, the disseminated mesenchymal tumour cells must undergo a reverse transition (mesenchymal-epithelial transition, MET) at the site of metastases, as most metastases recapitulate the pathology of their corresponding primary tumours. Importantly, initiation of tumour growth at the secondary site is the rate-limiting step in metastasis. However, investigation of this dynamic reversible EMT and MET that underpins CRC morphogenesis has been hindered by a lack of suitable in vitro models. To this end, we have established a unique in vitro model of CRC morphogenesis, which we term LIM1863-Mph (morphogenetic). LIM1863-Mph cells spontaneously undergo cyclic transitions between two-dimensional monolayer (migratory, mesenchymal) and three-dimensional sphere (carcinoid, epithelial) states. Using RNAi, we demonstrate that FZD7 is necessary for MET of the monolayer cells as loss of FZD7 results in the persistence of a mesenchymal state (increased SNAI2/decreased E-cadherin). Moreover, FZD7 is also required for migration of the LIM1863-Mph monolayer cells. During development, FZD7 orchestrates either migratory or epithelialization events depending on the context. Our findings strongly implicate similar functional diversity for FZD7 during CRC morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1997000025,"Cyclic adenosine 3′5′ monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) cooperate with phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase (PI3K) signals in the control of growth and survival. To determine the molecular mechanism(s) involved, we identified and mutagenized a specific serine (residue 83) in p85αPI3K, which is phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro by PKA. Expression of p85αPI3K mutants (alanine or aspartic substitutions) significantly altered the biological responses of the cells to cAMP. cAMP protection from anoikis was reduced in cells expressing the alanine version p85αPI3K. These cells did not arrest in G1 in the presence of cAMP, whereas cells expressing the aspartic mutant p85D accumulated in G1 even in the absence of cAMP. S phase was still efficiently inhibited by cAMP in cells expressing both mutants. The binding of PI3K to Ras p21 was greatly reduced in cells expressing p85A in the presence or absence of cAMP. Conversely, expression of the aspartic mutant stimulated robustly the binding of PI3K to p21 Ras in the presence of cAMP. Mutation in the Ser 83 inhibited cAMP, but not PDGF stimulation of PI3K. Conversely, the p85D aspartic mutant amplified cAMP stimulation of PI3K activity. Phosphorylation of Ser 83 by cAMP–PKA in p85αPI3K was also necessary for estrogen signaling as expression of p85A or p85D mutants inhibited or amplified, respectively, the binding of estrogen receptor to p85α and AKT phosphorylation induced by estrogens. The data presented indicate that: (1) phosphorylation of Ser 83 in p85αPI3K is critical for cAMP–PKA induced G1 arrest and survival in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts; (2) this site is necessary for amplification of estrogen signals by cAMP–PKA and related receptors. Finally, these data suggest a general mechanism of PI3K regulation by cAMP, operating in various cell types and under different conditions."

The LOXL3 protein contains four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains in the N terminus in addition to the C-terminal characteristic domains of the LOX family, such as a copper binding domain, a cytokine receptor-like domain and residues for the lysyl-tyrosyl quinone cofactor. Using BLASTN searches, we identified a LOXL3 variant LOXL3-sv1 that lacked the sequences corresponding to exons 1, 2, 3, and 5 of LOXL3. LOXL3-sv1 showed an exon-intron structure distinct from LOXL3, additionally containing an 80-bp sequence corresponding to intron 3 of LOXL3 in the 5′-UTR and a 561-bp sequence corresponding to the 3′-flanking genomic region of exon 14 in the 3′-UTR. LOXL3-sv1 was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 392 amino acids that contains the C-terminal domains required for amine oxidase activity but lacks the N-terminal SRCR domains 1, 2, and 3.

Trackman P.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 5: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). LOX oxidizes the epsilon amino groups of peptidyl lysines to reactive aldehydes. The resulting aldehyde groups then undergo spontaneous condensation with unreacted epsilon amino groups or neighboring aldehyde groups, converting collagen or elastin monomers into insoluble fibers (2Eyre D.R. Paz M.A. Gallop P.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 717-748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Smith-Mungo L.I. Kagan H.M. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The LOX-mediated cross-linkage of collagen or elastin monomers is an essential step for the biogenesis of fibrillar extracellular matrix in most tissues. Recent molecular cloning has revealed the existence of a human LOX family consisting of the five paralogues LOX, LOXL, LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 (4Mariani T.J. Trackman P.C. Kagan H.M. Eddy R.L.

Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each LOX paralogue contains a copper-binding domain, residues for lysyl-tyrosyl quinone (LTQ) and a cytokine receptor-like (CRL) domain in the carboxyl (C) termini. The amino (N)-terminal regions of the LOX family members, in contrast, show little sequence homology except that LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 contain four repeated copies of scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains in their N termini. The SRCR domains, known to mediate the protein-protein interactions for cell adhesion and cell signaling, are found either on the cell surface proteins or secreted proteins (9Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The presence of SRCR domains within LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4 indicates that these three paralogues probably have different functions from LOX and LOXL. Several new functions, such as tumor suppression, cellular senescence, and chemotaxis, have been attributed to LOX (11Giampuzzi M. Botti G. Cilli M. Gusmano R. Borel A. Sommer P. Di Donato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29226-29232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Li W. Liu G. Chou I.N. Kagan H.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 78: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The importance of LOX has been further emphasized by the findings that impaired LOX activity contributes to a number of different diseases including atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysms, pulmonary or hepatic fibrosis, cutis laxa, and hypertrophic scars (14Decitre M. Gleyzal C. Raccurt M. Peyrol S. Csiszar K. Sommer P. Lab. Investig. 1998; 78: 143-151PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ricard-Blum S. Bresson-Hadni S. Guerret S. Grenard P. Volle P.J. Risteli L. Grimaud J.A. Vuitton D.A. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 172-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, it has yet to be determined how altered LOX activity contributes to the pathogenesis of these diverse disorders. The presence of LOX family proteins, each containing the functional motifs to be an active amine oxidase, suggests that differential regulation of the LOX paralogues is probably responsible for the diverse functions currently attributed to the single enzyme LOX. In an attempt to identify more human LOX paralogues, we searched the expressed sequence tag (EST)-databases using the BLAST program. We report a LOXL3 variant LOXL3-sv1 that shows distinct exon-intron structure and tissue specificity from LOXL3. LOXL3-sv1 consists of 10 exons, lacking exons 1, 2, 3, and 5 of LOXL3. Further, this novel variant functions as an active amine oxidase toward elastin and different types of collagens with variable activities. All the amine oxidase activities of LOXL3-sv1 are sensitive to β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an irreversible inhibitor of LOX. EST Data Base Search—The human LOXL3 cDNA sequence was used to search the human EST data base by the BLASTN program. EST clones showing significant sequence homology to human LOXL3 were purchased from Open Biosystems and were completely sequenced using an ABI 310 automated DNA sequencer. Analysis of the Transcription Initiation Site—Approximately 2 μg of human testis total RNA (Clontech) was reverse-transcribed using 1 pmol of a random primer (Promega) and Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reverse-transcribed cDNA was then amplified in 30 PCR cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 54–58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) with a predenaturation at 94 °C for 4 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min, using Taq polymerase (Takara). In each PCR analysis, a forward primer 5′-tcctttttgaagtgctcccc-3′ (F1), 5′-aagagagtccacaccgcg-3′ (F2), 5′-caagcagggttccttaag-3′ (F3), or 5′-ggattctttccctgcttgt-3′ (F4) was used with a common reverse primer 5′-caacggcgggtcgaat-3′ (R1). The PCR amplicons were subjected to electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gel. RT-PCR Analysis in Human Tissues—Human Multiple Tissue cDNA Panels (Clontech) were PCR-amplified with primers specific to LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 using Taq polymerase (Takara). The LOXL3-specific primers were 5′-agcgaaaagagggtcaac-3′ and 5′-ctgaggcttcgactgttg-3′, and the LOXL3-sv1-specific primers were 5′-aagcctagttcaaggacaca-3′ and 5′-agatccatccttttaggctc-3′. The LOXL3-specific primers were designed to amplify the region corresponding to nucleotide positions 733–978 of LOXL3 while the LOXL3-sv1-specific primers were designed to amplify the region corresponding to nucleotide positions 2471–2938 of LOXL3-sv1. Thermocycling consisted of 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s with a predenaturation at 94 °C for 4 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel. Expression and Purification of the LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 Proteins—The LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 cDNAs were RT-PCR-amplified from human testis total RNA (Clontech) using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant proteins LOXL3-p1, LOXL3-p2, and LOXL3-sv1 were designed to start the open-reading frame at Arg2, Leu233, and Met362 of LOXL3, respectively. The sequences of oligonucleotide primers used for construction of the expression plasmids are available upon request. A unique restriction site, either NheI or HindIII, was introduced in each primer for convenient subcloning. All the recombinant proteins were designed to contain an additional Met-Ala-Ser sequence at the N terminus and a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus. Thermocycling consisted of 30 cycles at 94 °C for 60 s, 58 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s with a predenaturation at 94 °C for 2 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR-amplified DNA fragments were gel-purified and then ligated into pET21b (Novagen) at the NheI and HindIII restriction sites in-frame with the C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The resulting expression constructs were confirmed to contain the desired sequences by DNA sequencing analysis using a Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used for transformation of the pET21-derived expression constructs. The recombinant proteins were expressed, purified, and refolded into an enzymatically active form as previously reported for other LOX family proteins (19Kim M. Kim S. Jung S. Park J. Yoo H. Ko J. Csiszar K. Choi S. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52071-52074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Amine Oxidase Assays—The amine oxidase activity of the LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 recombinant proteins were assessed using a peroxidase-coupled fluorometric assay with the Amplex red hydrogen peroxide assay kit (Molecular Probes) as previously described (20Palamakumbura A.H. Trackman P.C. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 10 μgofthe LOXL3 or LOXL3-sv1 protein and 2 mm of a substrate. Elastin from bovine neck ligament, collagen type I from calf skin, collagen type II from the chicken sternal cartilage, collagen type III from calf skin, and collagen types IV, VI, VIII, and X from human placenta were used as substrates, all purchased from Sigma. Parallel assays were performed in the absence or presence of 1 mm BAPN. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 571 nm and 585 nm. All transfections were repeated in quadruplicate, and the assay results were expressed as the fluorescence increase over that of BAPN controls. Western Blot Analysis—A polyclonal antibody of LOXL3-sv1 was generated by immunizing rabbits with the purified LOXL3-sv1 protein. Rabbits were injected intramuscularly with 300–400 μg of the purified protein in buffer containing 6 m urea, 250 mm imidazole and 10 mm K2HPO4 on days 0, 14, and 21. After the last injection, the rabbits were bled on days 7 and 14, and then antibodies were tested by ELISA assay. Antibodies were purified using a protein A-agarose kit (KPL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human tissue specimens were homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm chymostatin. The protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For Western blot analysis, 50 μg of tissue extracts was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 2 h with a 1:1000 dilution of the LOXL3-sv1 antibody or preimmune serum. Bands were visualized using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). GAPDH was used as an internal control in each Western blot analysis. Cellular Localization of the LOXL3-sv1 Protein—To construct an expression construct of LOXL3-sv1 in mammalian cells, the full coding sequence of LOXL3-sv1 was PCR-amplified from the EST clone BQ424248 using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The forward primer 5′-actgaattcatggggcagggcatg-3′ contained a unique EcoRI site, and the reverse primer 5′-actgtcgacgataatctggttgct-3′ contained a unique SalI site for convenient subcloning. The PCR-amplified DNA fragments were then ligated into pFLAG-CMV-5b (Sigma) in-frame with the C-terminal FLAG tag. The resulting plasmid pFLAG-LOXL3-sv1 was transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin. At post-transfection of 36 h, the cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were stained for 90 min using a 1:200 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma) in the blocking buffer. The monolayers were then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate monoclonal rat anti-mouse IgG1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in the blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature before final washing and examination. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (1:1000) (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopic analysis was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning microscope. Promoter Analysis—For construction of reporter plasmids, the 5′-flanking regions of exons 1 and 4 were separately PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA using Taq polymerase (Takara). For promoter assays of LOXL3, a 1378-bp fragment from nucleotide positions –1 to –1378 was amplified. For promoter assays of LOXL3-sv1, a series of fragments from the 5′-flanking region of exon 4 were PCR-amplified. The sequences of oligonucleotide primers are available upon request. The PCR primers contained either a KpnI or BglII restriction site for convenient subcloning. The PCR-amplified genomic DNA fragments were ligated into a promoter-less luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega) at KpnI and BglII restriction sites. For promoter assays, HEK 293 cells and primarily-cultured human skin fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml of penicillin. The cells were plated at a density of 4.5 × 105 cells/well on a 6-well plate 1 day prior to transfection. A total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA containing either a LOXL3 or LOXL3-sv1 promoter construct was co-transfected with 1 μg of the pRSV-LacZ vector expressing the β-galactosidase gene into the cultured cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pGL3-Basic and pGL3-SV40 plasmids were also used as controls. The cells were harvested 36 h after transfection in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Luciferase activities of the reporter constructs were determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega), and β-galactosidase assays were performed with a β-galactosidase assay system (Promega). The luciferase activity of each construct was normalized for differences in transfection efficiency based on the results of the β-galactosidase assays. All transfections were repeated in quadruplicate, and the results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Exon-Intron Structure of LOXL3-sv1—Searches of the human EST databases for the sequences similar to those of the LOX family genes resulted in identification of five ESTs showing alternative exon-intron splice patterns of LOXL3. Three ESTs (BE731785, BE302919, and BG479178) corresponded to a previously reported splice variant that lacks exons 5 and 8 of the 14 exons of LOXL3 (21Jonasson P. Liljeqvist S. Nygren P.A. Stahl S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2002; 35: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Two of the ESTs (BE302955 and BQ424258) were novel variants of LOXL3 lacking the sequence corresponding to exon 5. Because only partial sequences of ESTs are, in general, available in the databases, we performed complete sequencing of the ESTs from commercial sources. Complete sequencing of BQ424248 revealed that this novel variant (LOXL3-sv1) consisted of 10 exons, lacking exons 1, 2, 3, and 5 of LOXL3 (Fig. 1A). At the 5′-end, of particular interest, the LOXL3-sv1 cDNA contained an additional 80-bp sequence from the 5′-flanking intronic region of exon 4. At the 3′-end, the LOXL3-sv1 cDNA contained an additional 561 bp sequence corresponding to the 3′-proximal genomic region of exon 14 (Fig. 1B). To further define the transcription initiation site of LOXL3-sv1, RT-PCR analysis was performed with primers derived from intron 3 using total RNA from the human testis (Fig. 2A). The most 5′-end primer that produced an expected size of DNA was the F3 primer derived from the sequence at positions +4,273 to +4,293 (Fig. 2B). The primers derived from the 5′-upstream region of position +4,273 where corresponds to the 5′-end of EST BQ424248 did not produce any detectable bands in the RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2B), indicating that the probable transcription initiation site of LOXL3-sv1 is located in the region between positions +4182 and +4273. The exon-intron structure analysis revealed that the LOXL3-sv1 mRNA was at least 2,993 bp in length, encoding a 392 amino acid-long polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 44 kDa. The 5′-UTR of the LOXL3-sv1 mRNA was at least 466 bp in length, the coding region was 1,179 bp, and the 3′-UTR was 1,348 bp. The methionine residue at codon 362 in LOXL3 was used as the initiation codon in the deduced amino acid sequence of LOXL3-sv1. The LOXL3-sv1 polypeptide did not contain the SRCR domains 1, 2, and 3 of LOXL3, but did include the characteristic C-terminal domains of the LOX family, including the copper binding domain, the residues for the LTQ cofactor, and the CRL domain (Fig. 3). RT-PCR Analysis—To assess the expression of LOXL3-sv1 and LOXL3 in human tissues, RT-PCR analysis was performed with poly(A)+ RNA from sixteen different human tissues. The forward and reverse primers for the LOXL3-sv1-specific amplicon were derived from the extended 3′-UTR sequence present only in the LOXL3-sv1 mRNA. The PCR primers for the LOXL3-specific amplicon were derived from the sequences of exons 4 and 5, respectively. The LOXL3-specific band was more predominantly detected in the heart, placenta, lung, and small intestine, while the LOXL3-sv1-specific band was more highly detected in the kidney, pancreas, spleen, and thymus (Fig. 4), indicating distinct tissue specificity between LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1. Amine Oxidase Activity of LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1—In an effort to express and purify enzymatically active forms of LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1, we constructed a series of expression plasmids by subcloning variable lengths of LOXL3 cDNAs into an E. coli expression plasmid pET21b (Fig. 5A). Upon induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C, the hexahistidine-tagged recombinant proteins, except for LOXL3-p1, were expressed at high levels from the expression constructs. Fractionation of the cell lysates into different cellular compartments, such as cytoplasmic extracts, periplasmic extracts and inclusion body fractions, revealed that most of the recombinant proteins were expressed within inclusion bodies. The insoluble recombinant proteins were denatured by urea during purification and were, subsequently, refolded by step-wise dialysis in the presence of N-lauroylsarcosinate and Cu2+. The apparent sizes of the expressed recombinant proteins were in good agreement with the deduced molecular mass; 60 kDa for LOXL3-p2 and 46 kDa for LOXL3-sv1 (Fig. 5B). These recombinant proteins were determined to be more than 95% pure on SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 5B). However, it was not clear why the LOXL3-p1 construct did not show any detectable expression, but it might be because of the presence of rare codons, such as CCC (Pro11, Pro50, Pro53, Pro173, Pro181, Pro183, and Pro220) and AGG (Arg51, Arg192, and Arg224), in the N terminus of LOXL3, which are infrequently used in E. coli. Clusters of rare codons were shown to cause translation errors and reduction of the expression level in E. coli (21Jonasson P. Liljeqvist S. Nygren P.A. Stahl S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2002; 35: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The refolded recombinant LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 proteins were assessed for amine oxidase activity toward collagen and elastin using a peroxidase-coupled fluorometric assay. Elastin and collagen types I, II, III, IV, VI, VIII, and X were tested as substrates for the amine oxidase assays. The LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 proteins showed significant levels of amine oxidase activity toward all the tested substrates in a BAPN-sensitive manner. In amine oxidase activity, both LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 showed a similar pattern of substrate specificity toward the tested substrates, both presenting higher activities toward collagen types IV, X, and I and lower activities toward collagen type VI (Fig. 5C). However, subtle differences in the substrate specificity were also noticed. LOXL3 showed the highest activity toward collagen type VIII, while LOXL3-sv1 presented the highest activity toward collagen type IV (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that both LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 function as amine oxidases with similar but different substrate specificity. Previously, we showed that serial deletion of the N-terminal SRCR domains did not affect the amine oxidase activity in LOXL4, a close paralogue of LOXL3 (19Kim M. Kim S. Jung S. Park J. Yoo H. Ko J. Csiszar K. Choi S. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52071-52074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The conserved C-terminal domains of LOXL4 were sufficient to confer the amine oxidase function on LOXL4, though an artificial substrate benzylamine was used for the assays (19Kim M. Kim S. Jung S. Park J. Yoo H. Ko J. Csiszar K. Choi S. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52071-52074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our current results with LOXL3-sv1 further confirm that truncation or deletion of the SRCR domains does not affect the amine oxidase function of the LOX family proteins toward even physiological substrates of LOX, such as collagen and elastin. Western Blot Analysis—The predicted length of the polypeptide encoded by LOXL3-svl was 392 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 44 kDa. In an attempt to determine the expression of LOXL3-sv1 at the protein level in vivo, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the purified LOXL3-sv1 protein, which reacted to both the purified recombinant LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 proteins in vitro (data not shown). Human testis, placenta, lung, and colon tissues were tested for Western blot analysis. A band with an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa was detected, though at variable levels, in all the tested human tissues, indicating that LOXL3-sv1 is probably expressed at the protein level in vivo (Fig. 6). In the lung tissue, however, the LOXL3-sv1 protein was detected in a much lesser extent (Fig. 6). These results are comparable with the RT-PCR results (Fig. 5) that also showed a moderate level of the LOXL3-sv1 expression in the testis, placenta, and colon but almost no expression of LOXL3-sv1 in the lung. The full-length form of LOXL3 with an expected molecular mass of 83 kDa was not detected in any tissues tested. Instead, a band with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa was detected in the colon and placental tissues (Fig. 6). Additionally, a smaller band with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa was detected only in the colon (Fig. 6). No apparent bands were seen in blots with preimmune serum (data not shown). Cellular Localization—To assess the cellular localization of LOXL3-sv1, the mammalian expression construct pFLAG-LOXL3-sv1 containing the open reading frame of LOXL3-sv1 in-frame with the C-terminal FLAG tag was transfected into HEK 293 cells. Immunofluorescence staining of the transfected cells with a FLAG epitope-specific antibody displayed subcellular signals of LOXL3-sv1 in the cytoplasm and the extracellular spaces (Fig. 7, A and B). The LOXL3-sv1 staining was not co-localized with the propidium iodide staining (Fig. 7C), indicating that the LOXL3-sv1 protein was not present in the nuclei of the transfected cells. Promoter Analysis—To establish whether the 5′-flanking region of exon 4 of LOXL3 is sufficient for transcriptional initiation of LOXL3-sv1, we generated a series of reporter constructs containing different portions of the 5′-proximal intronic region of exon 4 (Fig. 8A). The 5′-flanking region of exon 1 was also tested for promoter activity. The promoter activity was monitored by transient transfection in HEK 293 cells and primarily cultured human skin fibroblasts. The pGL3-SV plasmid containing the strong T-antigen promoter of SV40 was used as a positive control, whereas a promoter-less plasmid pGL3-Basic was used as a negative control. The luciferase activity of each construct was expressed as a ratio to that of the promoter-less control. In HEK 293 cells, the P1 construct containing a 1,378 bp fragment of the 5′-proximity of exon 1 showed ∼3 times higher luciferase activity than the P2 construct containing a 1,383 bp fragment from the 5′-flanking region of exon 4 (Fig. 8B). In contrast, the P2 construct showed higher luciferase activity than the P1 construct in human skin fibroblast cells (Fig. 8B), implying differential activation of these two promoters in different cell types. Of particular interest, the P3 construct that lacks the 277-bp sequence corresponding to the 5′-end of the P2 construct showed higher luciferase activity than the P2 construct in both HEK 293 and skin fibroblast cells, indicating possible existence of a transcription repressor element in the deleted region. The P4 construct containing a 344-bp fragment from the 5′-proximity of the P3 construct presented only slightly higher luciferase activity that the promoter-less negative control in both cell types, suggesting that the promoter element for LOXL3-sv1 resides in the region at positions + 3168 to + 4273. In searches of potential transcription factor binding sites, the 5′-flanking region of exon 1, which corresponds to the promoter region for the expression of LOXL3, did not reveal any typical TATA or CAAT boxes (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, the 5′-flanking region of exon 4, that possibly functions as the promoter region of LOXL3-sv1, contained a TATA box at positions +3196 to +3203 (TATATAAA) (supplement Fig. S2). Both promoter regions contained a number of potential transcription factor binding sites including a STAT-3 site, a STAT-6 site, and GATA 1 site. Potential binding sites for AP2, NF-κB, c-Rel s, and SP1 were identified only in the 5′-flanking region of exon 1 (supplemental Fig. S1). The 5′-flanking region of exon 4 contained several other potential transcription factor binding sites including p53, ras-responsive element, Pit 1, and PAX binding sites (supplemental Fig. S2). Human LOXL3 was previously identified in BLASTN searches of the GenBank™ databases (7Maki J.M. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Jourdan-Le Saux C. Tomsche A. Ujfalus A. Jia L. Csiszar K. Genomics. 2001; 74: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Huang Y. Dai J. Tang R. Zhao W. Zhou Z. Wang W. Ying K. Xie Y. Mao Y. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). LOXL3 is composed of 14 exons that encode a 753-amino acid long polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 83 kDa. An alternative splice variant of LOXL3 with truncated SRCR domains was previously reported (22Jourdan-Le Saux C. Tomsche A. Ujfalus A. Jia L. Csiszar K. Genomics. 2001; 74: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The previously reported variant lacked the sequences corresponding to exons 5 and 8, but contained all the other exonic sequences (22Jourdan-Le Saux C. Tomsche A. Ujfalus A. Jia L. Csiszar K. Genomics. 2001; 74: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), indicating that the variant arose by alternative splicing under the control of the same promoter. However, functional characterization of the previously identified variant has never been pursued. Our newly identified variant LOXL3-sv1 showed an exon-intron structure distinct from LOXL3, lacking exons 1, 2, 3, and 5. Furthermore, LOXL3-sv1 mRNA contained additional sequences at both 5′ and 3′ termini; an 80-bp sequence corresponding to the intronic region proximal to the 5′-end of exon 4 in the 5′-UTR and a 561-bp sequence from the 3′-flanking genomic region of exon 14 in the 3′-UTR. The presence of these additional sequences in LOXL3-sv1 cDNA indicates that two alternative promoters probably exist for expression of LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1. Using luciferase promoter assays, we showed that a strong promoter element exists in the 5′-flanking intronic region of exon 4 (LOXL3-sv1 promoter). This is a distinct promoter element from the promoter region located in the 5′-proximal region of exon 1 (LOXL3 promoter). The promoter region of LOXL3 contains no typical canonical elements, TATA and CAAT boxes, in the proximity of the transcription initiation site but displays high CpG-rich sequences containing several potential AP-2 binding sites and single SP-1 site. The absence of TATA and CAAT boxes with a high CpG content in the promoter region, usually characteristic of eukaryotic housekeeping genes (24Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (372) Google Scholar), were also noticed in other LOX family genes (5Kim Y. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7176-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Jourdan-Le Saux C. Tronecker H. Bogic L. Bryant-Greenwood G.D. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12939-12944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, the LOXL3-sv1 promoter contains a TATA box in the 5′-flanking region of exon 4 at positions + 3196 to + 3203 and, further, displays a different profile of potential transcription factor binding sites from the LOXL3 promoter. This divergence in promoter structure suggests that differential regulation of those two alternative promoters may be responsible for different expression of LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1. In fact, the LOXL3-sv1 promoter exhibited higher luciferase activity than the LOXL3 promoter in skin fibroblasts, whereas the LOXL3 promoter revealed much higher activity than the LOXL3-sv1 promoter in HEK 293 cells, indicating that the LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 promoters are possibly subject to a cell-specific regulatory mechanism for the differential activation. Processing of the LOX family proteins has been reported for LOX and LOXL (25Cronshaw A.D. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Hulmes D.J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Borel A. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Kessler E. Gleyzal C. Hulmes D.J.S. Sommer P. Font B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48944-48949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The enzymatically active form of LOX with a molecular mass of 32 kDa results from extracellular proteolytic cleavage by procollagen C-protease, also known as bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-1, between residues Gly168 and Asp169 (25Cronshaw A.D. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Hulmes D.J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). BMP-1 was also shown to proteolytically cleave the LOXL precursor. The bovine LOXL protein was cleaved by BMP-1 at Gly130-Asp131 and Ser354-Asp355, resulting in two processed forms of LOXL (26Borel A. Eichenberger D. Farjanel J. Kessler E. Gleyzal C. Hulmes D.J.S. Sommer P. Font B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48944-48949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The BMP-1 cleavage site is exactly conserved in the human LOXL3 protein at Gly447-Asp449. Proteolytic cleavage at this potential BMP-1 recognition site is expected to result in a protein of a calculated molecular mass of 35 kDa. However, in our studies with the LOXL3-sv1 antibody that reacts to both LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1, the 35 kDa protein was not detected in any tissues tested. Instead, a band with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa was detected in the colon tissue. Given the possibilities of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, the 40-kDa protein may possibly correspond to the BMP1-processed form of LOXL3. Indeed, a couple of possible N-glycosylation sites are present within the predicted amino acid sequence of LOXL3 at residues 481–484 (Asn-Ile-Thr-Glu) and 625–628 (Asn-Gly-Thr-Lys), though further characterizations are required to determine the nature of this 40-kDa protein. An additional band of 67 kDa was also detected in the colon and placental tissues. This additional band probably corresponds to a colon and placenta -specific processed form of LOXL3. Other processing mechanisms, involving either another protease or another recognition sequence, may be responsible for the appearance of the 67 kDa protein in the colon and placental tissues. The LOX family members have been suggested to play functionally different roles through distinct substrate-specificity in the biogenesis of extracellular matrices. For instance, in immuno-histochemical analysis of human tissues, LOX was co-localized with fibrillar collagens, such as types I and III, whereas LOXL2 was associated with collagen type IV (27Csiszar K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 70: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that LOX is involved in the formation of fibrillar collagen fibers while LOXL2 is more likely responsible for the collagen fibers associated with basement membranes. In a carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis model, expression of LOX and collagen type I increased in parallel throughout the onset of liver fibrosis, whereas expression of LOXL and collagen type III coincidently increased early in the development of liver fibrosis (28Kim Y. Peyrol S. So C. Boyd C.D. Csiszar K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), indicating different substrate specificities for LOX and LOXL even toward similar types of collagen substrates. Further, using Lox and Loxl knock-out mice, mouse Lox and Loxl have been shown to play functionally different roles, possibly with distinct substrate and tissue specificities (29Hornstra I.K. Birge S. Starcher B. Bailey A.J. Mecham R.P. Shapiro S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14387-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 31Liu X. Zhao Y. Gao J. Pawlyk B. Starcher B. Spencer J.A. Yanagisawa H. Zuo J. Li T. Nat. Genetics. 2004; 36: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In our amine oxidase assays, both LOXL3-sv1 and LOXL3 showed a BAPN-inhibitable amine oxidase activity toward all the tested physiological substrates, such as elastin and seven different types of collagen (types I, II, III, IV, VI, VIII, and X), with subtle differences in substrate specificity. For instance, LOXL3-sv1 showed the highest activity toward collagen type IV, a basement membrane-specific collagen, while LOXL3 presented the highest activity toward collagen type VIII, a network-forming collagen predominantly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (32Plenz G.A.M. Deng M.C. Robenek H. Volker W. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 166: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results suggest that LOXL3-sv1 may be involved in collagen type IV-mediated functions, such as cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and growth, whereas LOXL3 possibly play a role in the maintenance of vessel wall integrity. Both LOXL3-sv1 and LOXL3 showed a relatively higher amine oxidase activity toward collagen types I and X than the other tested substrates, although to a lesser extent than toward collagen types IV and VIII. Collagen type I is the major structural protein in the extracellular matrix of skeletal tissues (33Rauch F. Glorieux F.H. Lancet. 2004; 363: 1377-1385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar), and collagen type X is also known to be critical in endochondral bone formation (34Shen G. Ortod. Craniofacial Res. 2005; 8: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The higher amine oxidase activities of LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 toward these collagen types, thus, suggest a possible functional role for these two variants of amine oxidase in bone development or maintenance. Co-localization studies with these collagen types in human tissues will be helpful for further understanding of the functional roles of these amine oxidases in the biogenesis of extracellular matrices. In summary, our findings indicate that alternative promoter activation possibly leads to expression of LOXL3-sv1 that functions as an amine oxidase with distinct tissue and substrate specificity from LOXL3. Recently, LOXL3 was reported to interact with Snail to down-regulate the expression of E-cadherin in carcinoma progression (35del Peinado H. Olmeda D. Csiszar K. Fong K.S. Vega S. Nieto M.A. Cano A. Portillo F. Carmen Iglesias-de la Cruz M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3446-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). However, the Snail-interacting parts of LOXL3 have yet to be determined. The absence of three N-terminal SRCR domains in LOXL3-sv1 suggests that LOXL3-sv1 possibly has a different interactive profile from LOXL3. Further elucidation of the interactive properties of LOXL3 and LOXL3-sv1 will provide significant insight into understanding the functional differences between these two variants of amine oxidase.

https://openalex.org/W2061937077,"We developed a new bacterial expression system that utilizes a combination of attributes (low temperature, induction of an mRNA-specific endoribonuclease causing host cell growth arrest, and culture condensation) to facilitate stable, high level protein expression, almost 30% of total cellular protein, without background protein synthesis. With the use of an optimized vector, exponentially growing cultures could be condensed 40-fold without affecting protein yields, which lowered sample labeling costs to a few percent of the cost of a typical labeling experiment. Because the host cells were completely growth-arrested, toxic amino acids such as selenomethionine and fluorophenylalanine were efficiently incorporated into recombinant proteins in the absence of cytotoxicity. Therefore, this expression system using Escherichia coli as a bioreactor is especially well suited to structural genomics, large-scale protein expressions, and the production of cytotoxic proteins. We developed a new bacterial expression system that utilizes a combination of attributes (low temperature, induction of an mRNA-specific endoribonuclease causing host cell growth arrest, and culture condensation) to facilitate stable, high level protein expression, almost 30% of total cellular protein, without background protein synthesis.

Therefore, this expression system using Escherichia coli as a bioreactor is especially well suited to structural genomics, large-scale protein expressions, and the production of cytotoxic proteins. MazF is an Escherichia coli toxin possessing single-stranded RNA- and ACA-specific endoribonuclease activity (1Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) that selectively degrades almost all cellular mRNAs in vivo, resulting in a precipitous drop in total protein synthesis and leading to complete cell growth arrest. However, when a gene encoding a target protein is engineered to transcribe an ACA-less mRNA, its transcript is stably co-expressed and translated in MazF-induced cells (2Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Codon degeneracy enables alteration of an ACA triplet to a cleavage-resistant sequence without changing the protein amino acid sequence, regardless of its position in the reading frame. MazF growth-arrested cells are “quasi-dormant” because they can be coaxed out of metabolic quiescence by exposure to an appropriate trigger (in this case through exposure to an ACA-less mRNA). Remarkably, the host cell translation machinery remains functional, enabling the expression of recombinant proteins at high levels without significant background cellular protein synthesis. In fact, despite being growth-arrested, MazF-induced cells retain the full spectrum of biosynthetic functions necessary to support mRNA transcription and translation (2Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here we exploit the properties of MazF to develop an E. coli expression system that can sustain high level, virtually pure target protein production under condensed culture conditions, creating an E. coli bioreactor for production of a target protein without any cellular protein synthesis. In fact, culture condensation imparts dramatic cost savings without sacrificing protein yield. In addition, unlike any existing expression technology in bacteria or eukaryotes, this expression system supports high level incorporation of toxic amino acid analogs (e.g. selenomethionine). The applications for this bioreactor are multifold and of particular utility for large scale structural genomics projects that employ both NMR and x-ray crystallography and for production of cytotoxic proteins. Culture Condensation—E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pACYCmazF and pColdI(SP-4)envZB(-ACA) was grown in 1000 ml of M9-glucose medium at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.5, the culture was chilled in an ice-water bath to quickly reach 15 °C and incubated at 15 °C for 45 min to acclimate the cells to cold shock conditions. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of chilled M9-glucose medium containing 1 mm IPTG. 2The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; UTR, untranslated region; F-Phe, p-fluoro-l-phenylalanine. Three ml of this 100-fold condensed culture was transferred into a 25-ml culture flask. The remaining 7 ml was appropriately diluted with chilled M9 medium containing 1 mm IPTG to make 3 ml of 50-, 40-, 30-, 20-, 10-, and 1-fold condensed cultures. Each culture was transferred into a 25-ml culture flask and incubated in a water bath shaker at 15 °C for 21 additional hours to induce both MazF and EnvZB. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended such that each sample comprised an extract from an equal number of cells/ml, and equal volumes were loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Incorporation of Amino Acid Analogs—EnvZB and CspA were expressed in order to demonstrate the efficiency of incorporation of selenomethionine and p-fluoro-l-phenylalanine (F-Phe), respectively. For selenomethionine incorporation, E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with both pACYCmazF and pColdI(SP-4)envZB(-ACA) was grown in 200 ml of M9-glucose medium at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.5, the culture was shifted to 15 °C for 45 min to acclimate the cells to cold shock conditions. Cells were harvested and suspended with 5 ml of M9-glucose medium containing Lys (100 μg/ml), Phe (100 μg/ml), Thr (100 μg/ml), Ile (50 μg/ml), Leu (50 μg/ml), and Val (50 μg/ml) (40× concentrated culture). Cultures were incubated at 15 °C for 15 min to inhibit endogenous methionine biosynthesis, and then 25 μl of 12 mg/ml seleno-l-methionine (final concentration of 60 μg/ml) and 5 μl of 1 m IPTG (final concentration of 1 mm) were added to the culture. Both CspA and EnvZB were expressed at 15 °C for 21 h. For the incorporation of F-Phe, 50 μl of 6 mg/ml F-Phe was added immediately after concentrating. In contrast to selenomethionine labeling conditions, endogenous phenylalanine biosynthesis was not prevented during F-Phe incorporation. Incorporation of 15N—E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pACYCmazF and pColdI(SP-4)envZB(-ACA) was grown in 1000 ml of M9-glucose medium at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.5, the culture was shifted to 15 °C for 45 min to acclimate the cells to cold shock conditions. IPTG (1 mm) was added to induce expression of both MazF and EnvZB followed by a 3-h incubation at 15 °C to eliminate isotope incorporation into background cellular proteins. Cells were harvested and resuspended with 50 ml of [15N]M9-glucose medium (1 g of [15N]NH4Cl/liter) containing 1 mm IPTG (20× concentrated culture). EnvZB was expressed at 15 °C for 15 h. pColdI(SP-2) and pColdI(SP-4) Vectors Support Sustained, High Level Target Protein Expression— We originally developed pCold vector backbone to facilitate high yield protein expression under low temperature conditions to enhance the stability of expressed proteins (3Qing G. Ma L.C. Khorchid A. Swapna G.V. Mal T.K. Takayama M.M. Xia B. Phadtare S. Ke H. Acton T. Montelione G.T. Ikura M. Inouye M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). pColdI features include a cspA promoter and translation-enhancing element to drive high levels of target protein transcription and translation upon cold shock; a His6 tag sequence; a factor Xa cleavage site; and an amino-terminal His-Met-encoding sequence comprising an NdeI site that enables the in-frame insertion of any target gene. With the goal of enhancing expression levels when a target protein is coinduced along with a second plasmid expressing MazF, the plasmid pColdI(SP-4) 3pColdI(SP-4), as well as pColdII(SP-4), pColdIII(SP-4), and pColdIV(SP-4), is now available from TaKaRa-Bio, Inc. was created from the plasmid designated pColdI(SP-2). Both pColdI(SP-2) and pCold-I(SP-4) were engineered to resist cleavage by MazF. The pCold-I(SP-2) vector was modified such that all of the ACAs were removed from the relevant 5′-sequences (2Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Subsequent removal of a single ACA from the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of pColdI(SP-2) resulted in the pColdI(SP-4) vector. The efficacy of pColdI(SP-4) relative to its pColdI(SP-2) progenitor was first tested by assessing both the levels and duration of expression of the test protein eotaxin, a 74-amino acid human chemokine (Fig. 1A). New synthesis of eotaxin from either pColdI(SP-2) or pColdI(SP-4) was assessed for up to 7 days after its coinduction with MazF by monitoring [35S]methionine incorporation by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Eotaxin synthesis rates from pColdI(SP-4) gradually increased from day 1 to 3, peaked between days 3 and 4, and were sustained at that level through the final 7-day time point. In contrast, eotaxin expression levels from pColdI(SP-2) were relatively modest initially, increased only marginally, peaked later (day 5), and sustained peak expression through the 7-day time point. Therefore, pColdI(SP-4) supports higher levels of eotaxin expression, suggesting that removal of ACAs at the 3′-UTR of the vector would generally enhance expression levels. In addition, these results demonstrated that quasi-dormant E. coli cells are able to translate proteins for at least 7 days despite being completely growth-arrested. The efficacy of both plasmids was then tested with three additional proteins: EnvZB, the 161-residue ATP-binding domain of the E. coli EnvZ histidine kinase; a 72-residue human protein of unknown function designated HR91 by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (NESG); and another 139-residue NESG human target protein of unknown function called HR969. In contrast to eotaxin, HR91 (Fig. 1B), EnvZB (Fig. 1C), and HR969 (Fig. 1D) expression efficiency was somewhat better but almost identical in pColdI(SP-4) versus pColdI(SP-2). The expression patterns also differed from eotaxin; they peaked earlier (0.5-1 day) and then gradually decreased through day 7. Therefore, the eotaxin results did not reflect a general trend, but instead, the target protein appeared to dictate the expression characteristics and protein synthesis rates from either the original pColdI(SP-2) or the modified pColdI(SP-4) vector. However, because synthesis rates of new target proteins are never worse, and sometimes even better, when using pColdI(SP-4), we selected this modified vector for the remainder of the expression studies described in this study. Next, we used HR969 to examine the cumulative levels of target protein present in the cell during the 5-day incubation by analyzing total cellular proteins by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1E). The levels of HR969 protein accumulated steadily to the 5-day time point, representing ∼30% of the total cellular protein, notably without any discernible changes in the density of any other cellular proteins; this is consistent with Fig. 1D, where no background cellular protein synthesis was observed during the 5-day incubation. We obtained comparable results for both EnvZB and HR91 (data not shown), indicating that the pColdI(SP-4) expression vector supported enhanced, sustained, and stable recombinant protein production during the 5-day reaction. Expression Can Occur under Highly Condensed Culture Conditions without Significant Reduction in Target Protein Yields— Because cell growth is completely inhibited upon MazF induction, we examined whether cell cultures could tolerate substantial condensation for protein production without affecting the protein yield. E. coli BL21 cultures harboring pACYCmazF and pColdI(SP-4)envZB were subjected to normal induction conditions. However, the cells were first pelleted and resuspended in medium to achieve cell concentrations 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, and 100-fold higher than normal inducing conditions (A600 of 0.5, corresponding to ∼3 × 108 cells/ml). The total cellular protein profiles of samples containing equivalent cell numbers were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2). Overall, the cells tolerated concentration remarkably well and continued to express and translate high levels of target protein. In fact, after 21 h of induction, EnvZB represented the most abundant stainable protein in the full range of concentrated cultures that we analyzed. Concentration did not reduce protein yield; the amounts of EnvZB produced for the uncondensed sample (∼3 × 108 cells/ml) compared with the 40-fold (∼1 × 1010 cells/ml) sample were almost identical. Only upon culture condensation of 50-fold or greater was a reduction in EnvZB protein levels observed. Therefore, MazF-induced cells in a quasi-dormant state can withstand substantial (40-fold) condensation without a reduction in the yield of target protein. Condensed Culture Conditions Support High Efficiency Selenomethionine Incorporation without Toxicity—The ability to produce high levels of a single protein in condensed cultures may have applications for structural analysis of proteins by x-ray crystallography or NMR. Heavy atoms are used as phasing centers for multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) in synchrotron crystallography (4Hendrickson W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 637-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Selenium addition to proteins through in vivo (5Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M.

Ishitani R. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2002; 2: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) incorporation of precursor selenomethionine is the most common approach to enable MAD phasing. However, in vivo selenomethionine incorporation into E. coli proteins is cytotoxic and leads to growth inhibition. Alternatively, the E. coli in vitro translation system is technically difficult to construct in the laboratory and expensive if purchased commercially. We projected that selenomethionine-induced cytotoxicity and growth inhibition should not be an issue for the condensed expression approach because these cells are already growth-arrested. More importantly, upon MazF and target protein coinduction in condensed cultures, we have demonstrated that the target protein alone accounts for virtually all of the new protein synthesis. Therefore, there should be negligible background synthesis of other cellular proteins that typically contribute to cytotoxicity when they are also selenomethionine-labeled along with the target protein. Using 40-fold condensed culture conditions (the maximal condensation for the highest yield), we assessed whether selenomethionine substitution affected the yield of target protein and also measured the efficacy of selenomethionine replacement into EnvZB (Fig. 3A). The amount of selenomethionine-containing EnvZB (lane 4) was almost identical to that in the control experiment done under the same conditions but without selenomethionine (lane 3), indicating that selenomethionine incorporation did not adversely affect EnvZB protein production in our expression system. Histidine-tagged EnvZB was then purified, and the molecular mass of wild type versus selenomethione-substituted EnvZB was analyzed using mass spectroscopy (Fig. 3, B and C). Calculation of mass increase indicated that ∼90% of the methionines (on average 6.3 of the 7 methionine residues, excluding the initiation methionine) were substituted with selenomethionine. Effective Fluorophenylalanine Substitution without Toxicity— Replacement of phenylalanine residues in a protein with F-Phe can be implemented for the structural analysis of a protein by 19F NMR (8Drake S.K. Bourret R.B. Luck L.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13081-13088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bourret R.B. Drake S.K. Chervitz S.A. Simon M.I. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, as with selenomethionine substitution, F-Phe substitution is cytotoxic. We followed the expression of the CspA in a manner analogous to that demonstrated for selenomethionine EnvZB. CspA was expressed with pCold-I(SP-4)cspA for 21 h with and without the addition of F-Phe (Fig. 4A). The addition of F-Phe did not adversely affect CspA production in our expression system. We then affinity-purified the 86-residue CspA product and used mass spectroscopy to determine the extent of F-Phe substitution (Fig. 4, B and C). Although endogenous Phe biosynthesis was not inhibited, substantial incorporation of F-Phe (∼60-70% of total Phe residues) was observed, indicating that toxic F-Phe can be efficiently incorporated into a protein without affecting its yield. Condensed Expression Cultures Support Very High Efficiency 15N Incorporation—Because concomitant expression of MazF with a target protein results in an extremely high signal-to-noise ratio upon [35S]methionine labeling, our condensed expression system may be ideal for 15N and 13C isotope labeling of proteins for NMR structural analysis. To test this possibility, EnvZB was expressed in a 20-fold condensed culture containing [15N]NH4Cl. A control culture was also prepared in the identical manner, except that the medium instead contained [14N]NH4Cl. We observed no difference in protein yields between [15N]NH4Cl and [14N]NH4Cl incorporation experiments (data not shown). Both proteins were then affinity-purified, and their tryptic peptides were analyzed by mass spectroscopy. We chose the tryptic peptide YGNGWIK from EnvZB (which contains 10 nitrogen atoms and 40 carbon s) for comparative analysis using mass spectroscopy. The control peptide has three distinct masses due to the presence of naturally abundant 13C (∼1%, Fig. 5A). Of the three peaks, the major peak I contains only 14N and 12C, and peaks II and III contain one and two 13C atoms, respectively, in the peptide. Assuming that the peak heights are proportional to the amount of peptide in the peaks, the level of the naturally abundant 13C is estimated to be 1.0%. The analysis of the peptide from 15N-labeled EnvZB shows two distinct peak profiles (Fig. 5B); the peak profile at the left is identical to the pattern in Fig. 5A, indicating that these peaks were derived from EnvZB produced before isotope labeling. This background 14N-labeled EnvZB is estimated to comprise ∼20% of the total EnvZB produced under these conditions. Seven major peaks constitute the 15N-labeled peptides. Major peak 5 represents a mixture of the peptide consisting of 9 15N, 1 14N, 0 13C, and 40 12C atoms and the peptide containing 8 15N, 2 14N, 1 13C, and 39 12C atoms. Peak 4 comprises a mixture of two peptides: one contains 8 15N, 2 14N, 0 13C, and 40 12C atoms, and the other contains 7 15N, 3 14N, 1 13C, and 39 12C atoms. On the other hand, peak 6 consists of two peptides, 10 15N, 0 14N, 0 13C, and 40 12C atoms and 9 15N, 1 14N, 1 13C, and 39 12C atome. On the basis of the peak distribution due to the naturally abundant 13C (Fig. 5A), peptide one containing 10 15N atoms represents 6% of the total peptides analyzed; peptide two (9 15N), 38%; peptide three (8 15N), 31%; and peptide four (7 15N), 15%. These results demonstrate that ∼90% of the peptides produced after the addition of [15N]NH4Cl contain at least 7 15N atom substitutions out of the 10 total nitrogen atoms. There are several major attributes of the new expression system described in this study. First, we have demonstrated that target protein synthesis can occur for at least 7 days, indicating that recycling of the components required for translation (tRNA and ribosomes) undoubtedly occurs. Therefore, there appears to be no theoretical limit to the size of the protein that can be synthesized by our expression system. Second, with the goal of reducing the cost of the amino acid substitution and isotope labeling steps for x-ray crystallography and NMR structure applications, we first demonstrated that a 40-fold culture condensation step (to >1010 cells/ml) does not significantly reduce protein yields (the expressed protein comprises 20-30% of total cellular proteins or the yield of as high as 1-1.5 mg/ml for target protein). Third, the cost efficiencies afforded by this condensed expression method result in a decrease (to only 2.5% the expense of typical incorporation experiments) in the cost of medium containing highly expensive isotope-labeled amino acids, amino acid analogs, or carbon sources (such as deuterated [13C]glucose). Finally, in contrast to any existing in vivo protein expression technology, incorporation of cytotoxic amino acid analogs using our condensed expression system does not result in cell toxicity. The toxicity of selenomethionine, fluorophenylalanine, or any other amino acid analogs limits the level of incorporation into proteins, whereas without toxicity there should be no limit to incorporation. The ability of the cells to tolerate culture condensation and avoid amino acid analog cytotoxicity stems from the unique physiological state of the E. coli cells upon MazF expression. MazF-induced quasi-dormant cells are not actively growing, because MazF acts to selectively degrade virtually all cellular mRNAs. Therefore, almost no background protein synthesis occurs, so that selenomethionine or other cytotoxic amino acid analogs are not incorporated into any cellular proteins. This enables the production of pure target protein with high levels of selenomethionine or other amino acid analogs without the secondary cytotoxic effects. Although this expression system requires the construction of an ACA-less target gene (thus encoding an ACA-less mRNA), there are two approaches that would quickly and economically address this requirement. If the target gene contains only a few ACA sequences, these sequences can be altered by oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis so that they are no longer cleavable by MazF. However, if a gene is large and/or has many ACA sequences, the best approach is to chemically synthesize the entire gene using one of the commercially available gene synthesis technologies (e.g. Codon Devices, Cambridge, MA (10Tian J. Gong H. Sheng N. Zhou X. Gulari E. Gao X. Church G. Nature. 2004; 432: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar)). This general approach has several advantages. First, the gene sequences are guaranteed for accuracy so that the subsequent sequence verification step that typically follows PCR mutagenesis is no longer necessary. Second, the synthetic gene can be directly inserted into a vector of choice, eliminating the need for a cloning step. Third, in an effort to improve translation efficiency, the gene sequence can be optimized to the codon usage preferences of the particular organism used for expression. Finally, the time and manpower savings more than offset the modest cost of whole gene synthesis. As with new technologies in general, the cost should continue to fall as the methods used for gene synthesis are further improved. In fact, we expect that this technology will completely replace PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis for creation of ACA-less genes in the next few years, when the cost of synthesizing a gene for a 200-residue protein may drop to less than $200. Our expression system generates high signal-to-noise ratios without a purification step because essentially only the target protein is labeled with isotopes, as background cellular protein synthesis is virtually absent. Therefore, NMR structural studies of the protein may be carried out without purification. This attribute is especially attractive for membrane proteins. Furthermore, this system enables us to explore the potential for stabilizing the folded state of a protein by compartmentalization inside the living cell using in-cell NMR spectroscopy (11Serber Z.

Their binding reactions are sensitive to variations in salt and pH but the basis of the respective dependence has not been clear. We investigated the binding reaction between PSD-95 PDZ3 and a peptide corresponding to a native ligand with protein engineering in conjunction with stopped-flow and equilibrium fluorimetry and found that the two conserved residues Arg-318 and His-372 were responsible for the salt and pH dependencies, respectively. The basis of the salt-dependent variation of the affinity was explored by mutating all charged residues in and around the peptide-binding pocket. Arg-318 was found to be crucial, as mutation to alanine obliterated the effect of chloride on the binding constants. The direct interaction of chloride with Arg-318 was demonstrated by time-resolved urea denaturation experiments, where the Arg-318 → Ala mutant was less stabilized by addition of chloride as compared with wild-type PDZ3. We also demonstrated that protonation of His-372 was responsible for the increase of the equilibrium dissociation constant at low pH. Both chloride concentration and pH (during ischemia) vary in the postsynaptic density, where PSD-95 is present, and the physiological buffer conditions may thus modulate the interaction between PSD-95 and its ligands through binding of chloride and protons to the “molecular switches” Arg-318 and His-372, respectively.

In the post-genomic era there will be ever-increasing focus on protein-protein interactions (1Sali A. Glaeser R. Earnest T. Baumeister W. Nature. 2003; 422: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 3Burgoyne N.J. Jackson R.M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2006; 22: 13335-13342Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar) because of their critical role in cellular function and the growing sequence and structure databases. Indeed, most processes in the cell are governed by more or less specific protein-protein interactions. Often the binding is tuned by cellular or extracellular conditions such as pH, ionic strength, and molecular crowding, and also by specific molecules acting allosterically on the protein or competing with the “natural” ligand. Many proteins or protein domains, have evolved to interact with other proteins and form complexes, and one of the most common of these protein-protein interaction modules is the PDZ domain, which is present in several hundred human proteins (4Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 5Hendriks W. van Ham M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2003; 30: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are often found within multi-domain scaffolding proteins, and they bind mainly to the C termini of their target proteins (6Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H.

Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 10Tochio H. Hung F. Li M. Bredt D.S. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PDZ domains have been shown to be rather promiscuous with regard to their ligand, and they have overlapping ligand specificities (6Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 7Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most well studied PDZ domains is PDZ3 from PSD-95. 3The abbreviations used are: PSD-95, postsynaptic density protein-95; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. 3The abbreviations used are: PSD-95, postsynaptic density protein-95; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. The three-dimensional structure of this protein with and without its target ligand has been solved (11Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The canonical PDZ domain consists of about 90-100 amino acids forming six β strands (βA to βF) and two α helices; αA and αB neatly arranged in a spherical structure (Fig. 1a). Peptide binding takes place between the βB strand and αB helix in an antiparallel manner as shown in Fig. 1a. As judged by the crystal structure, PDZ3 binds its target peptide, which ends Lys-Gln-Thr-Ser-Val-COO- (numbered -4 to 0 from left to right) via a number of interactive forces. A series of hydrogen bonds from the carboxylate-binding loop stabilize the C-terminal carboxylate in the binding pocket. In addition, the carboxylate of the C-terminal valine interacts with Arg-318 of PDZ3 via a water molecule (11Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In other PDZ domains, the residue corresponding to the Arg-318 is either lysine or arginine (9Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 12Tochio H. Zhang Q. Mandal P. Li M. Zhang M. Nat. Struct.

The threonine at position -2 of the peptide points into a pocket containing the His-372 of αB. The crystal structure suggests that a hydrogen bond is formed between the N-3 nitrogen of His-372 and the hydroxyl group of the threonine (11Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). This histidine residue is conserved among PDZ domains that recognize type I peptide ligands (i.e. with the three final residues being (Ser/Thr)-X-(Val/Leu), where X is any residue) (15Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The pH and ionic strength of the solution affect the affinity between PDZ domains and their ligands. The variation of the rate constants of PSD-95 PDZ3 binding to a peptide (dansyl-KQTSV-COO-) with pH (mainly koff) and ionic strength (mainly kon) has previously been observed (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. Engström Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) but not explained. Another study addressed the variation of the equilibrium free energy on NaCl concentration for mouse α1-syntrophin PDZ domain binding to target peptides (VKESLVCOO- and SIESDV-COO-) but did not find what caused the observed effect (14Harris B.Z. Lau F.W. Fujii N. Guy R.K. Lim W.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2797-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this work we have explored the basis for the pH and salt dependence of the rate and equilibrium binding constants of PSD-95 PDZ3. Our results show that the observed variation in on-rate constant seen in the PDZ3-peptide interaction with varying ionic strength (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) is not because of screening of long-range forces according to the Debye-Hückel theory (17Moore W.J. Basic Physical Chemistry. Prentice-Hall International, Inc., London1983: 370-373Google Scholar). Instead we found that chloride ion exerts an inhibitory effect on the PDZ3-peptide interaction through direct interaction with Arg-318. In addition we show that His-372 is responsible for the pH dependence of the binding reaction. Numbering of the residues in PDZ3 wild-type and mutants is as in the crystal structure (11Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The cDNA for wild-type PDZ3 (16Gianni S. Larsson M.

This “wild-type” was either with or without a tryptophan in position 337 (previously referred to as position 31 (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C.

The plasmids encoding the mutants R318A, R318A/F337W, E331A, H372A, E373A, E373A/F337W, and K380A were made by inverted PCR using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) and the wild-type PDZ3 cDNA as a template. Expression and Purification of PSD-95 PDZ3 Wild-type and Mutants—BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with plasmid encoding wild-type PDZ3, the pseudo-wild-type F337W, and the mutants H372A, R318A, R318A/F337W, E331A, E373A, E373A/F337W, and K380A. The resultant transformants were grown on ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml) plates overnight at 37 °C. Colonies on the plate were used to inoculate 10 ml of pre-cultures, which in turn were used to inoculate 850 ml of 2× TY growth medium (16 g tryptone, 10 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl/liter). The cultures were grown in a rotary shaker at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.45. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Induced cultures were grown at 37 °C for three hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The resuspended pellets were ultrasonicated, centrifuged at 38,500 × g for 1 h and filtered through 0.45- and 0.22-μm filters. The filtered sample was loaded onto a nickel(II)-charged chelating Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and washed with 300 ml of the same buffer. The bound protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.9, in aliquots of 9 ml. Fractions containing PDZ were then filtered, diluted three times, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose ion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). Elution was done with a gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing PDZ domain were pooled together, and their purity was checked by SDS-PAGE. The identity of the pooled sample was acknowledged by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The concentration of the PDZ domain was determined by absorbance measurements using extinction coefficients determined by amino acid analysis. Far UV circular dichroism studies on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter and urea denaturation (for R318A/F337W and E373A/F337W) were performed to verify that the purified PDZ domains were folded. Pre-steady State and Equilibrium Measurements—The peptide KQTSVcoo- that corresponds to the C terminus of the protein CRIPT was previously synthesized with a dansyl group in the N terminus as described (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. Engström Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The following buffers were used in the binding experiments: potassium acetate, pH 5.7 and Tris-HCl, at pH 8.5 (25 °C) or pH 9.0 (10 °C). The salt dependence of the binding rate and equilibrium constants was determined in presence of different potassium salts: chloride, fluoride, potassium phosphate, and nitrate in separate experiments. Equilibrium measurements were performed by measuring the increase in dansyl fluorescence upon binding at 25 °C, pH 8.5, in an SLM 4800 spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments, IL). Excitation was at 345 nm and emission at 551 nm. To determine the equilibrium constants for the dansylated peptide at different salt concentration, the PDZ concentration was varied at constant concentration of peptide (3 or 5 μm). The fluorescence of the dansyl group was not affected by the addition of salt. Experimental procedures for pre-equilibrium binding kinetics were as described previously (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. Engström Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, all measurements were done at 10 °C at pH 9.0 using Tris-HCl buffer on an SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Fluorescence was monitored using either the increase in dansyl emission (excitation at 345 nm, emission > 475 nm) or the decrease in tryptophan emission (excitation at 280 nm, 465 nm > emission > 320 nm), when using both the tryptophan in the protein and the dansyl on the peptide as probes in the case of the pseudo-wild-type PDZ3/F337W (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. Engström Å. J. Biol.

Kinetic unfolding and refolding experiments were performed in the stopped-flow by mixing protein with buffer-urea solutions and monitoring the change in emission around 330 nm (bandpass filter) upon excitation at 280 nm. Experimental unfolding and refolding traces followed single exponential kinetics. Data Analysis—Chloride was analyzed as being a competitive inhibitor of the peptide according to Scheme 1. P is the PDZ3, L1 is the peptide, and L2 is the chloride. KCl was added to PDZ3-peptide complex (5 and 10 μm, respectively), and the resulting fluorescence was recorded at equilibrium.

The dependence of the on-rate constant kon on salt concentration was analyzed according to Equation 5. konapp=kon×1/(1+[chloride]/KDchloride)(Eq. 5) konapp is the apparent rate constant at a certain chloride concentration, and kon is the rate constant in absence of chloride. Fitting of the data were performed using Kaleidagraph version 4.0 (Synergy software). The PDZ used in this study was similar to that in Gianni et al. (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except that the present construct contained eight extra residues (MHHHHHPR) at the N terminus. The stability of these His-tagged variants was similar to that of the previously used PDZ3 domain, which lacked the His-tag, as judged from urea denaturation curves and circular dichroism studies (not shown). Moreover, two variants were used as wild type, one with an engineered tryptophan (PDZ3/F337W) and the other without (PDZ3). The Trp in position 337 acts both as a fluorescent probe in urea denaturation experiments and as a Förster resonance energy transfer donor in binding experiments with dansylated peptide. We have previously demonstrated that the binding kinetics of the PDZ3/F337W variant is similar to those of wild-type PDZ3 (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. Engström Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The binding constants of the His-tagged PDZ3 were also similar to those obtained using PDZ3 without His tag. The numbering of residues in this paper is in accordance with the crystal structure of PSD-95 PDZ3 (11Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1BE9). Effects of Different Anions on the Interaction—We found previously that the association rate constant, kon, for the PDZ3-peptide binding reaction decreases as the ionic strength of the buffer is increased (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. Engström Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As a first step toward determining whether the effect of ionic strength on the on-rate constant of the wild-type PDZ3 is actually because of screening of long-range charge-charge interactions as stipulated by Debye-Hückel theory or whether binding is hindered by specific interaction of the anion with the protein, competition binding assays at equilibrium were performed, where the respective salts KNO3, KCl, KF, and potassium phosphate (mainly K2HPO4) were added to dissociate the PDZ3-peptide complex (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, KNO3 and KCl dissociated the complex but KF did not, at least not to the same degree, and K2HPO4 even increased the signal slightly. We then performed pre-equilibrium binding experiments with three different anions: chloride, fluoride, and phosphate. Wild-type PDZ3 was rapidly mixed with dansylated peptide in the stopped-flow spectrometer, and the resultant change in fluorescence was recorded with time. The concentration of PDZ3 was varied at a constant peptide concentration, and observed rate constants, kobs, were obtained by fitting a single exponential function to the data (16Gianni S. Larsson M. Calosci N. Malatesta F. Eklund L. Ngang C.C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Jemth P. Engström Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34805-34812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These experiments were repeated at different constant concentrations of the three anions tested (Fig. 3). No or little effect on the on-rate constant was seen with fluoride and phosphate even when the ionic strength of phosphate was increased up to 2 m (Fig. 3). The hydration energy of the chloride ion is lower than that of fluoride (19Collins K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5553-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Fluoride therefore is hydrated by water to a higher degree, and the resulting ion is larger than the solvated chloride. Thus, chloride will penetrate the surface of the protein more than fluoride. The observed effect of the three different anions on the on-rate and calculated equilibrium constants (from koff/kon) was of the order Cl-≫F->HPO42- , i.e. the largest ion had the smallest effect. These results indicated that the chloride ion might be competing with the ligand for binding to PDZ3 and that long-range electrostatic forces did not mediate the binding of the peptide to PDZ3. The effect of chloride on kon rather than koff is easily explained if chloride acts as a competitive inhibitor that is in a fast pre-equilibrium with the PDZ domain. The observed on-rate constant konapp would then equal the true kon multiplied by the unbound fraction of PDZ3 according to Equation 5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The apparent KD of chloride for PDZ3 was determined as 360 ± 60 mm by plotting the on-rate constant versus chloride ion concentration and fitting to Equation 5 (Fig. 4 and Table 1) in fair agreement with the KD determined from the competition experiment. However, the weaker effect of fluoride and phosphate on the rate and equilibrium constants may not be because of their inability of specific interaction with the protein but their higher kosmotropic (“structure making”) ability to stabilize the protein-ligand complex, as given by the Hofmeister series (20Baldwin R.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2056-2063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 22Lewith S. Arch. Exp. Pathol.

Observed rate constants, kobs, were obtained by fitting a single exponential function to the data (Equation 3). Equation 4 was fitted to kobs versus PDZ3 concentration to obtain kon and koff for the binding reaction. This experiment was then repeated at different salt concentrations. b, log kon versus the square root of the ionic strength. There is an apparent linear dependence of kon when chloride is used as an anion. The effect on kon is small when fluoride and phosphate are used as anions, even at 2 m ionic strength in phosphate. c, log koff versus square root of the ionic strength.

All charged amino acid residues close to the binding pocket, based on the crystal structure (11Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), were therefore mutated to alanine to obtain the following mutants: R318A, R318A/F337W, E331A, E373A, E373A/F337W, and K380A. Arg-318 is linked to the carboxylate of the peptide C-terminal valine via an ordered water molecule (11Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Glu-373 of the αB helix corresponds to Asp-143 of the mouse α1-syntrophin PDZ that is known to form a salt bridge with a lysine residue at position -4 of its peptide (23Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Kinetic experiments similar to those for the wild type were done on the mutants (Table 2). In addition, equilibrium-binding experiments were performed by varying the concentration of PDZ3 wild type and mutants at a constant peptide concentration. Equilibrium data were fitted to Equation 2 to obtain a KD value for the respective interaction. The KD values of the different mutants varied roughly 3-fold, whereas the kon remained fairly constant on mutation (except for R318A) when the experiments were performed in buffer without addition of extra salt, giving the changes in free energy on binding, relative to the wild type as shown in Table 2. We went ahead to perform kinetic and equilibrium binding experiments of the different mutants at various [Cl-]. We expected that if chloride exerted a direct action on a certain residue and if that interaction were the basis for the salt effect, then there would be less or no variation in the binding constants on chloride concentration for an alanine mutant. Equilibrium binding experiments corroborated the hypothesis; KD values appeared to increase with chloride concentration, except for the R318A mutant (Fig. 4a). But both accuracy and precision in the equilibrium constant were lower than for the rate constants, and in particular the on-rate constant kon was accurate and precise. The kinetic rate constants of the different mutants at different [Cl-] are shown in Fig. 4. The kon of the R318A (or R318A/F337W) mutant was indeed constant (∼2.0 μm-1 s-1) with increasing [Cl-], whereas there were no significant differences between the chloride concentration dependencies of kon for the E331"
https://openalex.org/W2039092261,"Latency transition of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) occurs spontaneously in the absence of proteases and results in stabilization of the molecule through insertion of its reactive center loop (RCL) as a strand in β-sheet A and detachment of β-strand 1C (s1C) at the C-terminal hinge of the RCL. This is one of the largest structural rearrangements known for a folded protein domain without a concomitant change in covalent structure. Yet, the sequence of conformational changes during latency transition remains largely unknown. We have now mapped the epitope for the monoclonal antibody H4B3 to the cleft revealed upon s1C detachment and shown that H4B3 inactivates recombinant PAI-1 in a time-dependent manner. With fluorescence spectroscopy, we show that insertion of the RCL is accelerated in the presence of H4B3, demonstrating that the loss of activity is the result of latency transition. Considering that the epitope for H4B3 appears to be occluded by s1C in active PAI-1, this finding suggests the existence of a pre-latent conformation on the path from active to latent PAI-1 characterized by at least partial detachment of s1C. Functional characterization of mutated PAI-1 variants suggests that a salt-bridge between Arg273 and Asp224 may stabilize the pre-latent conformation. The binding of H4B3 and of a peptide targeting the cleft revealed upon s1C detachment was hindered by the glycans attached to Asn267. Conclusively, we have provided evidence for the existence of an equilibrium between active PAI-1 and a pre-latent form, characterized by reversible detachment of s1C and formation of a glycan-shielded cleft in the molecule.

The serpins constitute a family of proteins of which the majority are inhibitors of serine proteases (1Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Of decisive importance for the inhibitory mechanism is the surface-exposed reactive center loop (RCL) 5The abbreviations used are: RCL, reactive center loop; HBS, Hepes-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; LMW-uPA, low molecular weight uPA; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; s, strand in a β-sheet; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. between β-strands s5A and s1C (Fig. 1). The scissile P1-P1′ bond in the RCL is attacked by the serine protease, but at the enzyme-acyl intermediate stage, where the active site serine of the protease and the P1 residue of the serpin are linked by an ester bond, the N-terminal part of the RCL inserts as s4A thereby pulling the protease to the opposite pole of the serpin and distorting its active site. The required energy stems from stabilization of the serpin in the “relaxed” conformation with an inserted RCL, as compared with the “stressed,” active conformation with a surface-exposed RCL. The conformational changes associated with the insertion of s4A in serpins are well described by x-ray crystal structure analyses and include rearrangements in a region around s1A, s2A, hD, and hE referred to as the flexible joint region (reviewed in Ref. 2Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and antithrombin III are unique among serpins as they can spontaneously adopt the relaxed conformation without prior cleavage of the RCL. This is referred to as latency transition and involves insertion of the N-terminal part of the intact RCL as s4A while the C-terminal part and the connected s1C is stretched out on the surface of the molecule (3Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 4Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. Mushunje A. Zhou A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, during latency transition, full insertion of s4A requires the detachment of s1C and passage of the RCL through the gate region between the s3C/s4C and s3B/hG loops (Fig. 1). For PAI-1, latency transition is accelerated by the monoclonal antibody 33B8, which recognizes an epitope overlapping with part of the flexible joint region and binds preferentially to relaxed forms of PAI-1 (5Gorlatova N.V.

Because latency transition is irreversible, the effect of 33B8 cannot be explained by stabilization of the latent conformation. It was therefore hypothesized that 33B8 accelerates latency transition by binding to and stabilizing an intermediate, pre-latent conformation existing on the path from active to latent PAI-1 (5Gorlatova N.V.

This pre-latent form would exist in an unfavorable equilibrium with the active form and be characterized by sufficient insertion of N-terminal residues from the RCL at the top of β-sheet A for the high affinity 33B8 epitope to form (5Gorlatova N.V.

The positioning of s1C at the C terminus of the RCL in the putative pre-latent PAI-1, however, remains elusive, although it has been suggested to be distorted by the strain imposed by inserting part of the RCL (8Hägglöf P. Bergström F. Wilczynska M. Johansson L.B. Ny T. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Stoop A.A. Eldering E. Dafforn T.R. Read R.J. Pannekoek H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, the time-dependent loss of PAI-1 activity was found to be accelerated by the monoclonal antibody H4B3. To elucidate the underlying mechanism we characterized its effect in detail by fluorescence spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis. Binding of H4B3 was found to induce the conversion of PAI-1 to a form in which the RCL was inserted, consistent with an antibody-mediated acceleration of latency transition similar to what has been described for 33B8. The access of H4B3 to its binding area was demonstrated to require at least partial detachment of s1C, suggesting that this is a structural feature of pre-latent PAI-1. To obtain further information about the course of events during latency transition, we have isolated a peptide from phage displayed libraries with affinity exclusively for the latent conformation of human recombinant PAI-1. The binding sites for this peptide and for the monoclonal antibody MAI-12 were found to overlap with the epitope for H4B3. Considering that neither the peptide nor MAI-12 accelerated latency transition a map of their binding sites allowed us to clarify the features of H4B3 binding that govern its PAI-1-neutralizing effect. We also performed a functional analysis of the generated panel of PAI-1 variants with substitutions in the mapped binding regions and thereby identified a new region important for the functional stability of PAI-1. Finally, the binding profiles of the isolated peptide and antibodies to glycosylated and non-glycosylated PAI-1 in both stressed and relaxed conformations provide information about the orientation of the N-linked glycosylation on Asn267 in latent PAI-1. PAI-1—We will refer to amino acid residues in PAI-1 by the numbering system of Andreasen et al. (10Andreasen P.A. Riccio A. Welinder K.G. Douglas R. Sartorio R. Nielsen L.S. Oppenheimer C. Blasi F.

The DNA coding for a PAI-1 murine/human chimera consisting of the murine sequence from the N terminus to residue 122, the conserved human and murine sequence between residues 123 and 142, and the human sequence from residue 143 to the C terminus was constructed using overlap extension PCR (13Horton R.M.

Elastase activity was irreversibly inhibited after 5 min at 37 °C by adding 4 mm Pefablock SC (Roche).

Rabbit polyclonal anti-PAI-1 antibodies were those described (27Offersen B.V. Nielsen B.S. Høyer-Hansen G. Rank F. Hamilton-Dutoit S. Overgaard J. Andreasen P.A. Am. J.

A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated monoclonal anti-M13 phage antibody was from Amersham Biosciences. Measurements of the Specific Inhibitory Activity of PAI-1—To measure the specific inhibitory activity of PAI-1, i.e. the fraction of PAI-1 capable of inhibiting the proteolytic activity of uPA, PAI-1 was serially diluted in HBS supplemented with 0.25% gelatin (HBS-G), resulting in PAI-1 concentrations between 0.01 and 20 μg/ml (0.22 nm and 0.45 μm). One volume of 0.25 μg/ml (4.6 nm) uPA in HBS-G was added to each well, followed by incubation for at least 5 min. The remaining uPA activity was determined by adding the chromogenic substrate S-2444 (pyro-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide, Chromogenix, Sweden) for 30 min and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. The specific inhibitory activity of PAI-1 was calculated from the amount of PAI-1 that inhibited 50% of the uPA. Determining the Rate of PAI-1 Latency Transition—PAI-1 was incubated at 37 °C in HBS-G at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. At various time points, the specific inhibitory activity of PAI-1 was determined as described above and the half-life for latency transition was calculated from semilogarithmic plots of the specific inhibitory activity versus time. The effect of H4B3 and paionin-3 on latency transition was assessed in a similar assay with the following modifications. The temperature was lowered to 23 °C to reduce the rate of latency transition; the concentration of PAI-1 was 5 μg/ml (112 nm); H4B3 (200 nm)or paionin-3 (10 μm) were present during the incubation; and the concentration of uPA was 0.1 μg/ml (1.9 nm). Fluorescence Labeling of Recombinant PAI-1—Labeling of the P9-Cys in PAI-1(S340C) with N-((2-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (Molecular Probes) and the P9-Cys in PAI-1(W177F/S340C) with N,N′dimethyl-N-(acetyl)-N′-methyl(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylene diamine (Molecular Probes) created the fluorescent molecules PAI-1P9-NBD and PAI-1(W177F)P9-NBD and was carried out essentially as described (11Blouse G.E.

The labeling efficiency was ∼0.8-1.0 mol of probe/mol of PAI-1. Incorporation of the fluorescent probes at this position on PAI-1 was shown previously to have no adverse effects on PAI-1 activity for either variant (11Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O.

Latent PAI-1, which typically accumulated during the labeling reaction, was subsequently removed by affinity chromatography on immobilized β-anhydrotrypsin as described (11Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Latent PAI-1P9-NBD was prepared by incubation of a 0.5 μm concentration at 37 °C for 24 h in a buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, with the addition of 0.02% NaN3. Complete conversion to the latent state was verified by the absence of complex formation when the latent preparation was reacted with a molar excess of uPA and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence Emission Spectroscopy—Emission spectra of the binding interactions between labeled PAI-1 variants and H4B3 were carried out in a SPEX-3 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller maintaining the measurement and incubation temperatures at 25 °C. Fluorescence experiments were carried out using semi-micro (0.2 × 1.0-cm) quartz cuvettes and in a reaction buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4. The excitation wavelength used for studying the fluorescence of PAI-1P9-NBD was 480 nm, and the emission spectra were scanned from 500 to 650 nm using a bandwidth of 5 nm for both the excitation and emission beams. Emission spectra for PAI-1P9-NBD (50 nm) were recorded prior to and after the addition of H4B3 (500 nm) and a 40-60-min incubation at 25 °C. Results are presented as the averaged spectra of three to nine independent acquisitions. All individual emission spectra were collected as averages of three emission scans using a 0.5-s integration over a 1.0-nm step resolution and corrected for background fluorescence in the absence of PAI-1P9-NBD and dilution effects, which were typically less than 2%. Spectra of latent PAI-1P9-NBD (50 nm) were collected as described above, whereas reactions of PAI-1P9-NBD (50 nm) with uPA (0.5 μm) were recorded after a 10-min incubation with the protease. Kinetic experiments following the time-dependent fluorescence change in NBD fluorescence were carried out with PAI-1P9-NBD (100 nm) or PAI-1(W177F)P9-NBD (100 nm) and H4B3 (500 nm). Single emission spectra were collected rapidly to limit acquisition time by using modified excitation and emission bandwidths of 10 and 5 nm, respectively, while maintaining the 0.5-s integration over a 1.0-nm step resolution. Integrated fluorescence data were subsequently normalized as ΔFobs/ΔFmax, where ΔFobs is the observed integrated fluorescence change at each indicated time point and ΔFmax represents the total change in fluorescence following reaction with a 2-fold molar excess of uPA. Integrated fluorescence results are presented as the average of two independent experiments. H4B3 Binding to PAI-1 Captured on Vitronectin—Maxisorp wells were coated with vitronectin (0.5 μg/ml in 100 mm NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 9.6) and blocked with HBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (HBS-B). Active PAI-1, purified on immobilized β-anhydrotrypsin as described (11Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), or latent PAI-1 at the indicated concentrations were incubated in the wells and detected with either H4B3 (1 μg/ml in HBS-B) and a HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse serum (DAKO, diluted 2,000-fold in HBS-B), or a polyclonol rabbit anti-PAI-1 antibody and a HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit serum (DAKO, diluted 2,000-fold in HBS-B). Antibody Epitope Mapping—Monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibody H4B3 or MAI-12 was coated in 96-well plates (5 μg/ml in 100 mm NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 9.6) followed by blocking with HBS supplemented with 5% skimmed milk powder (HBS-M). Dilution series of PAI-1 variants, reactive center-cleaved PAI-1, or PAI-1-uPA complex (0.01-150 nm in HBS-M) were incubated for 1 h and bound PAI-1 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PAI-1 antibody as described above. All assays were done in triplicate and the obtained binding curves fitted to a one-site binding hyperbola using Prism 4.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) to calculate the EC50 value. Isolation and Identification of PAI-1-binding Peptides by Screening of Phage-displayed Peptide Libraries—PAI-1-binding peptides were selected from phage-displayed peptide repertoires in the formats X7, CX7C, CX10C, and CX3CX3CX3C (30Koivunen E. Wang B. Dickinson C.D. Ruoslahti E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 346-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. E. Koivunen, University of Helsinki, Finland. Monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibodies mAb-1 or mAb-5 (5 μg/ml in 100 mm NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 9.6) were coated in Immunotubes (Maxisorp, Nunc, Denmark) and the tubes were blocked with HBS-M. Alternation of antibodies for the immobilization of PAI-1 was used to prevent enrichment of antibody-binding peptides. PAI-1 expressed from E. coli was immobilized in the antibody-coated tubes and ∼1011 colony-forming units from each peptide repertoire added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in HBS-M supplemented with 10% glycerol. After extensive washing, bound phage was eluted with an HCl/glycine buffer, pH 2.2, and neutralized (30Koivunen E. Wang B. Dickinson C.D. Ruoslahti E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 346-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The eluted phage was propagated in E. coli TG-1 cells and concentrated from the culture supernatant by precipitation with NaCl and polyethylene glycol. Peptides displayed on individual phage were identified by DNA sequencing as described previously (31Hansen M. Wind T. Blouse G.E. Christensen A. Petersen H.H. Kjelgaard S. Mathiasen L. Holtet T.L. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38424-38437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ELISAs for Measuring PAI-1-Phage Binding—Before the ELISA, PAI-1 variants other than PAI-114-1B and PAI-1(W177F) were incubated for 16-20 h at 37 °C to obtain latent material. In one type of ELISA, His6-tagged PAI-1 expressed from E. coli was immobilized in wells of Ni-NTA HisSorb Strips (Qiagen, Germany). PAI-1 at the indicated concentrations was immobilized and incubated with ∼109 colony-forming units/ml of phage in HBS supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of monoclonal antibodies as stated for each experiment. The wells were washed with HBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (HBS-T) and bound phage was detected with a HRP-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences; diluted 5,000-fold in HBS-B). After a final wash, wells were developed by adding 0.5 mg/ml ortho-phenylenediamine (KemEnTech, Denmark) in 50 mm citric acid, pH 5, supplemented with 0.03% H2O2. When suitable color had developed, the reactions were quenched with 1 volume of 1 m H2SO4 and the plates read at 492 nm in a microplate reader. In a second type of ELISA, PAI-1 expressed from E. coli, HEK293T cells, or HT-1080 cells was immobilized on the solid phase by the use of monoclonal antibodies. Antibody (5 μg/ml in 100 mm NaHCO3/Na2CO3, pH 9.6) was coated in wells of a 96-well Maxisorp plate (Nunc, Denmark) followed by blocking with HBS-M. PAI-1 at the indicated concentrations and phage (∼109 colony-forming units/ml) were incubated for 1 h each in the antibody-coated wells, and bound phage was detected as described above. To ensure that equal amounts of the individual PAI-1 variants were bound to the wells, a parallel ELISA was performed with 1 μg/ml polyclonal rabbit anti-PAI-1 antibody instead of phage and with HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit serum (DAKO, Denmark, diluted 2,000-fold in HBS-B) instead of anti-M13 antibody. SDS-PAGE—PAI-1 variants (150 μg/ml in HBS) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of H4B3 (300 μg/ml) before addition of 300 μg/ml LMW-uPA (Abbott, Denmark). The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide, 1.5 μg PAI-1 per lane) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The Monoclonal Antibody H4B3 Neutralizes PAI-1 by Accelerating Latency Transition—Incubating either human or murine PAI-1 with H4B3 accelerated the conversion of PAI-1 to an inactive form unable to inhibit the proteolytic activity of uPA (Fig. 2A). The half-life of inactivation mediated by 200 nm H4B3 at 23 °C was 26 ± 4 and 18 ± 2 min (n = 3) for human and murine PAI-1, respectively, compared with >300 min for both in the absence of antibody. Similar to the reported observations using the monoclonal antibody 33B8 (7Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D. Debrock S. Vleugels N. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17511-17517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the rate of H4B3-induced activity loss was concentration dependent as the half-life in the presence of 100 nm H4B3 was 39 ± 3 and 33 ± 9 min (n = 3) for human and murine PAI-1, respectively (data not shown). For human PAI-1, these values correspond to rate constants for latency transition of <0.002, 0.018, and 0.027 min-1 in the presence of 0, 100, and 200 nm H4B3, respectively. To determine whether H4B3 neutralizes PAI-1 by accelerating the latency transition in a manner analogous to that found for the monoclonal antibody 33B8 (7Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D. Debrock S. Vleugels N. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17511-17517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we took advantage of previous work demonstrating that labeling of the P9 position of PAI-1 (Ser340) with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent NBD probe produces a PAI-1 variant (PAI-1P9-NBD) in which the RCL insertion occurring during latency transition may be followed by fluorescence spectroscopy (29Shore J.D.

Full insertion of the P9-NBD-labeled RCL as s4A thus results in a sizable fluorescence increase, which is consistent with transfer of the probe from a solvent exposed to a more hydrophobic environment. Fig. 2B illustrates the fluorescence emission spectrum of the PAI-1P9-NBD variant prior to, and following the binding of a molar excess of H4B3 for 40-60 min. Association of PAI-1P9-NBD and H4B3 resulted in a maximal enhancement of the fluorescence for the NBD probe by ∼35% with an associated 12-nm blue shift in the peak emission from 539 nm in the absence of H4B3 to 527 nm in its presence.

We show here that treatment of human NPC1-/- fibroblasts with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist TO-901317 increases ABCA1 expression and activity in human NPC1-/- fibroblasts, as indicated by near normalization of efflux of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine and a marked increase in efflux of cholesterol mass to apoA-I. LXR agonist treatment prior to and during apoA-I incubation resulted in reduction in filipin staining of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes, as well as cholesterol mass, in NPC1-/- cells. HDL species in human NPC disease plasma showed the same pattern of diminished large, cholesterol-rich α-1 HDL particles as seen in isolated heterozygous ABCA1 deficiency. Incubating NPC1-/- fibroblasts with the LXR agonist normalized the pattern of HDL particle formation by these cells. ABCG1, another LXR target gene involved in cholesterol efflux to HDL, also showed diminished expression in NPC1-/- fibroblasts and increased expression upon LXR agonist treatment. These results suggest that NPC1 mutations can be largely bypassed and that NPC1 protein function is non-essential for the trafficking and removal of cellular cholesterol if the down-stream defects in ABCA1 and ABCG1 regulation in NPC disease cells are corrected using an LXR agonist.

These findings indicate that impaired regulation of ABCA1 leading to low plasma HDL-C is an integral feature of NPC disease. To our knowledge NPC disease represents the first known condition of decreased HDL formation and low HDL-C as a consequence of impaired ABCA1 regulation, rather than mutation. The relationship of impaired ABCA1 regulation and HDL formation to the neurodegeneration and overaccumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in tissues including the liver in NPC disease is currently unknown. Earlier work by Liscum and Faust (15Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17002-17008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had shown that addition of the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol could normalize the rate of cholesterol esterification in human NPC disease fibroblasts, despite concomitant suppression of endogenous cholesterol synthesis in these cells. These results suggested the oxysterol might facilitate the mobilization of stored cholesterol from the late endosome/lysosome compartment to the endoplasmic reticulum. Lange and colleagues (17Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) subsequently showed that addition of oxysterols including 25-hydroxycholesterol to human NPC disease fibroblasts preferentially reduced lysosomal cholesterol and increased endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol, as measured by the pool of cholesterol available for esterification in whole cell homogenates. These investigators also suggested that reduction of endogenous cholesterol synthesis in the presence of oxysterols might deplete plasma membrane cholesterol, resulting in a shift of lysosomal cholesterol to the plasma membrane even in the presence of the NPC1 mutation (17Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Frolov et al. (18Frolov A. Zielinski S.E. Crowley J.R. Dudley-Rucker N. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25517-25525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) reported impaired oxysterol generation in human NPC1 and NPC2 disease fibroblasts, and decreased accumulation of total cholesterol mass and filipin staining of late endosomes/lysosomes in human NPC disease cells incubated with LDL-containing serum in the presence of 25- or 27-hydroxycholesterol. Together, these results suggest that correction of oxysterol-dependent gene regulation normalizes cholesterol trafficking even in the presence of mutations in the genes encoding NPC1 or NPC2. A major regulator of ABCA1 expression is oxysterol-dependent activation of the nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR), which up-regulates ABCA1 to mobilize excess cell cholesterol by forming HDL (19Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 21Francis G.A. Annicotte J.S. Auwerx J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 455-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present studies we tested whether addition of the non-oxysterol agonist of LXR, TO-901317, would correct the regulation of ABCA1 and normalize lipid efflux to apoA-I and HDL particle formation in human NPC disease fibroblasts, in the absence of direct effects of exogenous oxysterols on cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor expression. Our results demonstrate correction of ABCA1 expression and near normalization of ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux, as well as correction of ABCG1 expression and HDL particle formation, even in the presence of NPC1 mutations, with LXR agonist treatment. These results suggest LXR agonists might greatly improve or possibly normalize the trafficking and overaccumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in NPC disease. Materials—Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, LXR agonist TO-901317, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (FAFA), and filipin were purchased from Sigma. [1,2-3H]Cholesterol (48 Ci/mmol), [methyl-3H]choline chloride (75 Ci/mmol), and [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl linoleate (84 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from BioWhittaker, lipoprotein-deficient serum and fetal bovine serum from Hyclone, and 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol from Steraloids, Inc. Preparation of Lipoproteins and ApoA-1—HDL (d = 1.07-1.21 g/ml) and LDL (d = 1.019-1.063) were obtained from pooled plasma of healthy volunteers by standard ultracentrifugation techniques (22Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Geer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The whole protein fraction of HDL was obtained by delipidating HDL, and purified apoA-I was obtained using the method of Yokoyama et al. (23Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) but substituting Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) for DEAE-cellulose. Radiolabeling of LDL using [1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl linoleate was performed as described (24Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), to a specific activity of 16-44 cpm/ng of LDL protein. Plasma for determination of HDL particle species was obtained from a 12-month-old male NPC disease subject homozygous for the I1061T mutation of NPC1 who had hepatosplenomegaly and early neurologic symptoms, and 13-month-old male plus 43-year-old female control subjects following informed consent. Cell Culture—Normal human fibroblasts (NPC1+/+, CRL-2076) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. NPC1 compound heterozygote human fibroblasts containing NPC1 mutations I1061T and P237S (NPC1-/-, GM3123) were purchased from the Human Mutant Cell Repository. NPC1+/+ cells were plated at 15,000 cells/16-mm well, 50,000 cells/35-mm dish, or 400,000 cells/100-mm dish, and NPC1-/- cells were plated at 20,000 cells/16-mm well, 70,000 cells/35-mm dish, or 600,000 cells/100-mm dish, and grown to confluence in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Where indicated confluent cells were loaded with DMEM containing 2 mg/ml FAFA plus 30 μg/ml non-lipoprotein cholesterol for 24 h as previously described (16Choi H.Y. Karten B. Chan T. Vance J.E. Greer W.L. Heidenreich R.A. Garver W.S. Francis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32569-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells loaded with unlabeled or labeled LDL cholesterol were grown for the last 40% to confluence in DMEM containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum to up-regulate LDL receptor expression prior to cholesterol loading. Labeling of Cellular Cholesterol Pools and Phospholipids—Cells in 16-mm wells were labeled with LDL-derived cholesterol by incubation with DMEM containing 1 mg/ml FAFA (DMEM/FAFA) plus 50 μg/ml [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL protein for 24 h. Following cholesterol loading, cells were rinsed twice with PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (PBS/bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C, and incubated an additional 24 h to allow hydrolysis of added LDL and equilibration of LDL-derived cholesterol in DMEM/FAFA, in the absence or presence of 5 μm TO-901317 added from a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS/bovine serum albumin prior to analysis or addition of efflux medium. To label phosphatidylcholine, cells in 35-mm dishes were loaded with non-lipoprotein cholesterol for 24 h and then incubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride in DMEM/FAFA ± TO-901317 during the 24-h equilibration period (16Choi H.Y. Karten B. Chan T. Vance J.E. Greer W.L. Heidenreich R.A. Garver W.S. Francis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32569-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed 5 times with PBS/FAFA prior to addition of efflux medium. Cholesterol and Phospholipid Efflux—Following radiolabeling and equilibration steps, cells were incubated for 24 h in DMEM/FAFA containing 10 μg/ml apoA-I in the absence or presence of 5 μm TO-901317. After incubation, efflux media were collected and cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS/bovine serum albumin and twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were stored at -20 °C until lipid extraction. Efflux media were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Radioactivity in medium was measured directly (for cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol) or the medium was extracted for determination of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine (25Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracted cellular lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography and assayed for radioactivity as previously described (26Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Protein content of extracted cell layers was determined using bovine serum albumin as standard (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol Mass Assay—Cells grown in 60-mm dishes, loaded with 50 μg/ml unlabeled LDL, and equilibrated for 24 h in the absence or presence of 5 μm TO-901317 were incubated with 10 μg/ml apoA-I ± TO-901317 for 24 h. After incubation, media and cells were collected and cells were homogenized by sonication. Phospholipids from media or cell homogenates were digested by phospholipase C to remove the polar head groups, and total lipids were extracted in the presence of tride-canoin as the internal standard. Samples were derivatized with Sylon BFT (Supelco) and analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies, 6890 Series equipped with a Zebron capillary column (ZB-5, 15 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) and connected to a flame ionization detector; Zebron, Palo Alto, CA). The oven temperature was raised from 170 to 290 °C at 20 °C/min, and then to 340 °C at 10 °C/min where the temperature was kept for 24 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas. The gas chromatography was operated in constant flow mode with a flow rate of 4.5 ml of helium/min. The injector was operated in the split mode and was kept at 325 °C, and the detector was kept at 350 °C (28Sahoo D. Trischuk T.C. Chan T. Drover V.A. Ho S. Chimini G. Agellon L.B. Agnihotri R. Francis G.A. Lehner R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1122-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Separation of sterols was identified by comparing their retention times with standards, and calculation of sterol mass in samples was based on the internal standard. Filipin Staining—Cells were grown on coverslips and loaded with 50 μg/ml LDL as described above. The cells were then incubated in the absence or presence of 5 μm TO-901317 during the 24-h equilibration period and during a 24- or 48-h incubation with DMEM/FAFA ± 10 μg/ml apoA-I. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed three times with PBS, and stained with filipin as described (18Frolov A. Zielinski S.E. Crowley J.R. Dudley-Rucker N. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25517-25525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), with slight modification. Cells were incubated in PBS with 1.5 mg/ml glycine for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, and stained with 50 μg/ml filipin in PBS for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes), and filipin fluorescence was detected by fluorescence microscopy on a Leica DM IRE2 microscope equipped with a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter. Western Blot Analysis of ABCA1—Cells in 100-mm dishes were harvested with 3 ml of PBS and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 500 ng/ml aprotonin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride in ethanol, and 2 mm EGTA. The pellet was then homogenized by sonication for three 5-s periods and nucleic acids were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 s at 1,000 × g twice. Crude cellular membrane proteins in the supernatant were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.45 m urea containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.05% dithiothreitol. Twenty to thirty micrograms of crude membrane proteins were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitro-cellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human ABCA1 antibody (1:1000 dilution) from Novus Biologicals and a goat anti-rabbit IgG horse-radish perodixase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000, Sigma). Immunoblots were reprobed with rabbit polyclonal anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (Stressgen) and goat polyclonal anti-actin (Santa Cruz) as loading controls. Chemiluminescence was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of HDL Particles—Fasting blood from the NPC subject and normolipidemic control subjects was collected into EDTA tubes and placed immediately on ice. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To characterize apoA-I-containing particles generated by normal and NPC1 human skin fibroblasts, fibroblast-conditioned media in 35-mm dishes were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet cells and the supernatant was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-4, MWCO 10000, Millipore). Plasma and media samples were kept on ice and used the same day or frozen at -80 °C. Plasma HDL particles were separated according to the method of Asztalos et al. (10Asztalos B.F. Brousseau M.E. McNamara J.R. Horvath K.V. Roheim P.S. Schaefer E.J. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 156: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as previously described. HDL particles in equivalent volumes of concentrated apoA-I-conditioned media were separated according to the method of Castro and Fielding (29Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) except that in the second dimension, voltage was increased from 100 V for 19 h to 125 V for 24 h to increase the separation of the α-migrating HDL species. Briefly, 20-μl samples were separated in the first dimension by 0.75% agarose gel in 50 mm barbital buffer, pH 8.6, at 200 V for 5.5 h at 5 °C. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was performed with a 2-23% polyacrylamide concave gradient gel at 125 V for 24 h at 5 °C in 0.025 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine buffer, pH 8.3. High molecular weight protein standards (7.1-17.0 nm, Amersham Biosciences) were run on each gel. Following electrophoresis, samples were electrotransferred (30 V, 24 h, 4 °C) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad). To locate the standard proteins, the nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S and the position of each protein marked. Membranes were blocked by a 1-h incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 10% nonfat milk at room temperature. ApoA-I-containing particles were detected by blotting the membranes with rabbit polyclonal anti-human apoA-I antibody (Calbiochem) in TBST containing 1% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, and then with 125I-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The specific activity of the secondary antibody was 4.8 × 106 cpm/mg. Membranes were incubated for 3 h in 80 ml of TBST containing 1% nonfat milk and 2.6 μg of antibody, followed by three washes of 5 min each in TBST before autoradiography (30Asztalos B.F. Sloop C.H. Wong L. Roheim P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—cDNA was generated from total RNA isolated from fibroblasts as previously described (16Choi H.Y. Karten B. Chan T. Vance J.E. Greer W.L. Heidenreich R.A. Garver W.S. Francis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32569-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Amplification of cDNA was performed by initially denaturing DNA at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 95 °C for 75 s. For ABCG1 amplification, annealing was at 60.9 °C for 75 s, and extension at 72 °C for 55 s for a total of 33 cycles, with a final extension period of 5 min. ABCG4 amplification was performed using similar conditions except with a total of 29 cycles. An annealing temperature of 56.2 °C over 28 cycles was used for apoE, LCAT, and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) amplification, whereas cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) required 36 cycles and an annealing temperature of 58.5 °C. All cycle numbers were within the linear range of the PCR. PCR products were visualized on a 1.1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. All PCR were performed in tandem with cyclophilin control (16Choi H.Y. Karten B. Chan T. Vance J.E. Greer W.L. Heidenreich R.A. Garver W.S. Francis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32569-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The primers used were: ABCG1, 5′-CACCTCGCACATTGGGATCG (forward), 5′-GCCAGGTAGTAGGCCTTCAG (reverse); ABCG4, 5′-GGTGTCCCTCATGAAGTCCC (forward), 5′-CCTGGCTCAGGATGTAGAGC (reverse); apoE, 5′-CAGCAGATACGCCTGCAGG (forward), 5′-ACTGGCGCTGCATGTCTTCC (reverse); human CETP, 5′-CATCTCCTTCACCCTGAAGC (forward), 5′-GACCCTTGTGATGGGACTCC (reverse); LCAT, 5′-TCCCTGGCTTTGGCAAGACC (forward), 5′-ATGAGGAAGACAGGCTTCCC (reverse); PLTP, 5′-AGTGTCCAATGTCTCCTGC (forward), 5′-AGATCTGCTGGTTGAGGAGG (reverse); cyclophilin 5′-ACCCAAAGGGAACTGCAGCGAGAGC (forward), 5′-CCGCGTCTCCTTTGAGCTGTTTGCAG (reverse). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Significant differences between experimental groups were determined using the Student's t test. Diminished ABCA1 Expression in NPC1-/- Human Fibroblasts Is Corrected by LXR Agonists—We previously demonstrated low basal and cholesterol-stimulated levels of ABCA1 mRNA and protein in human NPC1-/- fibroblasts (16Choi H.Y. Karten B. Chan T. Vance J.E. Greer W.L. Heidenreich R.A. Garver W.S. Francis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32569-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), consistent with impaired oxysterol- and LXR-target gene regulation in this disease. To determine whether exogenous LXR ligands can correct ABCA1 expression in NPC disease cells, NPC1-/- fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of the synthetic non-oxysterol LXR agonist TO-901317 (31Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar) or the oxysterols 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol. As shown previously (16Choi H.Y. Karten B. Chan T. Vance J.E. Greer W.L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 32569-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), ABCA1 protein levels were low in NPC1-/- cells grown to confluence in 10% fetal bovine serum or loaded with non-lipoprotein cholesterol, when compared with NPC1+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 1). Addition of TO-901317 or either of the oxysterols to non-cholesterol-loaded NPC1-/- cells increased ABCA1 protein to levels similar to those seen in cholesterol-loaded or LXR ligand-treated NPC1+/+ cells. Similar changes were seen in ABCA1 mRNA levels assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (data not shown), indicating the effect of the agonists on ABCA1 is at the transcriptional rather than post-transcriptional level. Reprobing the same Western blots for loading controls protein-disulfide isomerase and actin showed variable results between cell lines, for reasons that are unclear but likely related to alteration of other pathways in NPC1-/- cells. These results indicate equivalent loading of lanes for each condition within each cell type, however, and do not alter our conclusion that ABCA1 expression is increased by LXR agonists in NPC1-/- cells. ApoA-I-mediated Efflux of Phosphatidylcholine and LDL-derived Cholesterol Is Increased in NPC1-/- Fibroblasts Treated with LXR Agonist—We previously reported impaired efflux of LDL-derived, whole cell, plasma membrane, and newly synthesized cholesterol as well as the phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin to apoA-I from human NPC1-/- fibroblasts (16Choi H.Y.

Binding of growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 4The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; SH, Src homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RT, Arg-Thr. 4The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; SH, Src homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RT, Arg-Thr. promotes receptor activation and initiates intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately control biological responses such as cell proliferation, cellular adhesion, or apoptosis (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of RTKs is a critical step in modulating their activity and is mediated by endocytosis, receptor ubiquitination, and subsequent lysosomal degradation (2Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Key to this process is the formation of large protein complexes (3Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) capable of removing activated receptors from the plasma membrane via clathrin-dependent or -independent pathways (4Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 7Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The CIN85/CMS (Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domains) family of adaptor proteins participates in the formation of such protein complexes and orchestrates multiple steps in RTK signaling and endocytosis (8Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Both CMS (or its mouse ortholog CD2AP) and CIN85 (mouse ortholog SH3KBP1) contain a coiled-coil domain at the C-terminal end, a proline-rich region, and three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains in the N-terminal end. All three domains are responsible for the multiprotein complex formation (8Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 9Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Int. Immunol. 2003; 15: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). CIN85 and CMS were suggested to promote clustering of multiple Cbl molecules together with their ability to promote oligomerization through their C-terminal coiled-coil regions. These interactions appear to be important for proper internalization and endocytosis of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (10Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 11Szymkiewicz I. Kowanetz K. Soubeyran P. Dinarina A. Lipkowitz S. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39666-39672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). SH3 domains bind proline-rich regions and are essential in the assembly and regulation of many intracellular signaling processes (reviewed in Ref. 12Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Science's STKE. 2003; 2003: RE8PubMed Google Scholar). They are generally composed of ∼60 amino acids in a β-barrel structure made up of five β-strands. This arrangement forms one acidic and two hydrophobic pockets between the two β-sheets involved in the recognition and binding of proline-rich motifs (for a review see Refs. 13Cesareni G. Panni S. Nardelli G. Castagnoli L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Ferreon J.C. Hilser V.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7787-7797Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The majority of SH3 domains characterized to date bind to a proline-rich sequence with a φPXφP(PXXP) motif, where φ is usually a hydrophobic residue (16Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each motif adopts a left-handed type II polyproline (PPII) helix. Proline residues are in trans conformation, and the helical structure shows precisely three residues/turn (17Adzhubei A.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol.

Peptide ligands potentially bind a given SH3 domain in either one of two opposite directions governed by the location of a positively charged residue, usually Arg, which often precedes or follows the PXXP core element (18Feng S.

According to this, the PXXP motif is usually further classified into +XφPXφP (class I) and φPXφp + (class II) (where + is usually an arginine residue). Conversely, all CIN85/CMS SH3 domains, can only recognize a novel proline-arginine motif (PXXXPR) present in the C-terminal region of Cbl and Cbl-b (20Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Haglund K.

CD2 is a transmembrane cell surface glycoprotein expressed on T lymphocytes, thymocytes, and natural killer cells, which mediates low affinity cell/cell interactions by binding to related immunoglobulin superfamily proteins (CD58 in humans). It functions to promote T cell adhesion, immune recognition/activation, and motility (9Tibaldi E.V. Reinherz E.L. Int.

This CD2 clustering as well as T-cell polarization and recruitment of CD2 into the central contact zone during formation of an immunological synapse has been shown to be dependent on binding of the CMS mouse ortholog CD2AP to the cytoplasmic domain of CD2 (22Hutchings N.J.

It has recently been shown that Cbl can simultaneously accommodate two SH3 domains from separate CIN85 molecules, promoting the formation of higher order Cbl/CIN85 complexes (24Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I. Rittinger K. Bravo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The study led to the identification of crucial additional residues in the proline-arginine motif of Cbl involved in the formation of a ternary complex with CIN85 N-terminal SH3 and the assembly of the endocytic machinery that governs down-regulation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Cbl-b arginines 904 and 911 make equivalent hydrogen bonds with acidic residues in each SH3 domain, allowing the peptide to bind in class I and II simultaneously. The presence of Arg-904 (class I-like binding) defines the multimerization state of the CIN85 SH3-peptide complexes, indicating why other ligands that also contain the PXXXPR motif but lack the N-terminal arginine, such as PAK, bind with a 1:1 stoichiometry (24Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I. Rittinger K. Bravo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Hoelz A. Janz J.M. Lawrie S.D. Corwin B. Lee A. Sakmar T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that other targets of CIN85 that lack the N-terminal arginine, such as BLNK or CD2, should similarly bind in a 1:1 stoichiometry. CMS is closely related to CIN85; they both interact with Cbl and CD2 and are involved in down-regulation of RTKs (8Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether this unique SH3 recognition mechanism is conserved within the CMS/CIN85 family of adaptors and further investigate the role of the N-terminal arginine in the RXPXXXPR motif, we have solved the crystal structures of the CMS N-terminal SH3 domain (CMSA) in complex with Cbl-b- and CD2-derived peptides. A differential recognition pattern with respect to CIN85 has been characterized by combining the analysis of structural information and mutagenesis in in vivo data. We also aimed at setting up the basis for the atypical proline-rich sequences of Cbl recognition of CMS with respect to CIN85. Protein Overexpression and Purification—The N-terminal SH3 domain from human CMS (CMSA, residues 1-62) was cloned into pET21 and overexpressed without the His tag in the Escherichia coli bv. rosetta (DE3) pLys strain at 37 °C. Purification was performed as previously described for CIN85A (24Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I. Rittinger K. Bravo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Crystallographic Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Prior to crystallization, 3 μmol of corresponding peptide were added to 1.2 μmol of purified CMSA protein (70 mg/ml final concentration). All crystals were obtained at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals were then transferred to stabilization buffer (10% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 90% of reservoir solution) and flashcooled to 110 °K.

All data sets were collected in a Mar 345 imaging plate and a Bruker rotating anode source and were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK software (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Biochemical Assays—Cell transfection with the indicated cDNAs, cell lysis, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldowns, immunoprecipitations, and immunoblotting were essentially performed as described previously (20Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Haglund K. Kowanetz M. Husnjak K. Taylor J.D. Soubeyran P. Engstrom U. Ladbury J.E. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39735-39746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). CMSA/Cbl-b Overall Crystal Structure—To understand the molecular details of the different members of the CIN85/CMS family of adaptor molecules, we have crystallized the N-terminal SH3 domain of CMS (CMSA) in complex with the same Cbl-b-derived peptide used for the crystallization of the CIN85A/Cbl-b complex (24Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I. Rittinger K. Bravo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The refined structure at 1.7 Å of CMSA/Cbl-b shows a ternary complex composed of two CMSA molecules binding, in opposite orientations, to a single Cbl-b peptide molecule (Fig. 1A). One SH3 domain recognizes Lys-907 in the N terminus of the peptide, resembling a classical class I orientation, and the second SH3 domain recognizes Arg-911 in the C terminus, resembling class II. The asymmetric unit contains one CMSA molecule bound to a single Cbl-b peptide, which lies along a crystallographic 2-fold axis. Thus, a crystallographically related CMSA molecule binds the peptide on its opposite side, and electron density maps show an average of two orientations for the peptide (see supplemental figure). Final refined B factors for the peptide, considering occupancy of 0.5 for each orientation, do not differ significantly from the B factors of the CMSAinteracting residues (∼25 Å2). The double orientation of the peptide is possible, because crystallographic contacts are exclusively established by CMSA molecules. CMSA residues 1 and 59-62 are not visible in the electron density maps. Cbl-b residues 902, 903, and 904 were also disordered. The structure of the CMSA molecule displays the typical SH3 domain folding, adopting the characteristic five-stranded β-barrel structure. The peptide, on the other hand, does not display a typical polyproline helix but adopts an extended conformation instead. The structure shows that CMS also has the ability to form heterotrimeric complexes with a Cbl-b derived peptide, as it has recently been reported for CIN85 (24Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I. Rittinger K. Bravo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CMSA/Cbl-b Molecular Interface—In the heterotrimer arrangement, the interactions of the CMSASH3I (class I-like orientation) and CMSASH3II (class II-like orientation) with the Cbl-b peptide are almost identical with 941 and 827 Å2 of buried surface, respectively, and are comparable with values observed for other SH3 domain/peptide structures. However, the interacting surface of the two CMSA molecules is negligible. Only 54 Å2 of the 3918 Å2 total surface of each SH3 is shared, corresponding mainly to both side chains of Glu-35 (from CMSASH3I and CMSASH3II). Hydrophilic specific interactions via side chains are only made by Lys-907 and Arg-911 at the N and C termini of the Cbl-b peptide with both Asp-16 and Glu-17 from CMSASH3I and CMSASH3II respectively and Arg909 with Glu-35 from both CMSA molecules (Fig. 1B). Hydrophobic contacts in the class I orientation are made by Cbl-b Pro-910 with conserved residues of hydrophobic pocket II. In turn, Cbl-b Pro-906 and -908 are embedded within hydrophobic pockets I and II, respectively. Thus, Cbl-b Pro-908 and -910 occupy equivalent positions in the opposed SH3 domains of the heterotrimer. Additionally, there are sequence-unspecific contacts with peptide main chain atoms, such as Pro-910 and Lys-907 carboxylic oxygens interacting, respectively, with Asn-52 from each CMSASH3I and CMSASH3II. Similarly, Pro-908 and Arg-909 carboxylic oxygens interact with Trp-37 from both CMSASH3I and CMSASH3II (Fig. 1B). In Vivo Interactions between Cbl-b and CMS—The structures of the CMSA domain and the peptide derived from Cbl-b containing the PXXXPR motif shows that Cbl-b Lys-907 and Arg-911 residues are important for the interaction between the SH3 domain and its ligand (Fig. 1B). We set out to see the importance of these residues for the interaction between Cbl-b and CMS in the context of full length proteins expressed in cells. To this end, expression vectors encoding HA-tagged Cbl-b wt and Cbl-b K907A, Cbl-b R911A, and Cbl-b K907A/R911A point mutants were transfected and overexpressed in HEK293T cells. Lysates from these cells were then used to test binding to GST-CMSA in GST pulldown assays. Fig. 2A shows that both Cbl-b Lys-907 and Arg-911 play important roles in the interaction, although the Cbl-b K907A mutation abrogated binding to a much lesser extent than Arg-911. Double mutation of both Cbl-b Lys-907 and Arg-911 abolished the binding almost completely. Because of the overall similarity in the PXXXPR motif in Cbl-b and c-Cbl, we then checked whether the corresponding residues in c-Cbl also mediate the interaction with CMSA. Thus, we mutated the equivalent residues Lys-825 and Arg-829 to alanines in c-Cbl and proceeded as for GST pulldown assays with Cbl-b transfections. Interestingly, a very similar profile of binding to Cbl-b was observed. Again both c-Cbl Lys-825 and c-Cbl Arg-829 appear to be important for binding to the CMSA domain. The c-Cbl K825A mutation impaired binding to the SH3 domain slightly, whereas R829A led to a much greater loss in binding, and the double point mutations largely abrogated the interaction of c-Cbl with the N-terminal SH3 domain of CMS (Fig. 2B). Both experiments reproducibly showed the relative importance of these residues to the binding between the PKXXPR motif in Cbl-b/c-Cbl and CMSA. Further on, we were interested to see the roles of Cbl-b Lys-907 and Cbl-b Arg-911, and the corresponding residues in c-Cbl in the binding of full-length Cbl-b/c-Cbl and CMS. To this end, expression vectors encoding HA-tagged Cbl-b wt and K907A, R911A, and K907A/R911A mutants along with FLAGtagged CMS were transfected in HEK293T cells. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Cbl-RF antibody (recognizing the ring finger region of both Cbl-b and c-Cbl) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, FLAG-CMS is co-precipitated quite strongly with wt Cbl-b. This is in sharp contrast to Cbl-b K907A and R911A mutants, where a minimal amount of FLAG-CMS is co-immunoprecipitated with the mutants. This result demonstrates the vital importance of these residues in binding to CMS. The residual binding seen in the case of the Cbl-b K907A/R911A double mutant is most likely because of FLAG-CMS being co-precipitated with endogenous Cbl-b/c-Cbl that is immunoprecipitated by the Cbl-RF antibody. The same assay was performed with the transfection of HAc-Cbl wt, K825A, R829A, and K825A/R829A point mutants together with FLAG-CMS. It can be clearly seen that FLAG-CMS is co-immunoprecipitated with wt c-Cbl; however, the c-Cbl K825A and/or R829A mutation markedly abolished the co-immunoprecipitation of CMS (Fig. 2C, lower panel). Thus, in a similar fashion to Cbl-b, c-Cbl K825A and R829A mutants seem to be important for binding to CMS. The crystal structure of CMSA:Cbl-b suggests a different interaction pattern in class I recognition compared with CIN85A/Cbl-b. Cbl-b Lys-907 in CMSA/Cbl-b occupies an equivalent position as Arg-904 in the CIN85A/Cbl-b structure (see Figs. 1, A and B; and 5). Therefore, we wanted to compare the relative importance of Cbl-b Arg-904 and Cbl-b Lys-907 residues in binding to N-terminal SH3 domains from CMS and CIN85. Fig. 2D shows that GST-CMSA was able to bring down Cbl-b R904A as potently as wild type but pulled down Cbl-b K907A only weakly. In sharp contrast, GST-CIN85A was able to pull down both wild type Cbl-b and Cbl-b K907A mutant equally potently, with a slight reduction with respect to Cbl-b R904A in accordance with a previous observation (24Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I. Rittinger K. Bravo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The structure of CMSA/Cbl-b shows the formation of heterotrimers involving two CMS N-terminal SH3 domains and one Cbl peptide in vitro. To check whether the formation of CMSA/Cbl heterotrimers can also take place in vivo, HEK293T cells were transfected with a FLAG-tagged construct of CMS containing only the three SH3 domain regions, Myc-tagged full-length CMS, and either c-Cbl-849 or Cbl-b-927 constructs that lack the ability to homodimerize. These Cbl mutants were used to ensure that co-precipitation between CMS molecules was a consequence of direct binding of two independent CMS molecules to a single Cbl molecule rather than due to the interaction with homodimeric Cbl molecules (24Jozic D. Cardenes N. Deribe Y.L. Moncalian G. Hoeller D. Groemping Y. Dikic I. Rittinger K. Bravo J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 972-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing c-Cbl-849 or Cbl-b-927 have the ability to co-precipitate full-length CMS using a FLAG antibody (Fig. 2, E and F), indicating that Cbl is mediating the formation of the heterotrimer in cells. We have shown that point mutants of c-Cbl or Cbl-b are significantly impaired in binding to CMS (Fig. 2, A-D). When checking for heterotrimer formation in cells using the same point mutations in the constructs that lack the ability to homodimerize (Cbl-b-927 R911A and c-Cbl-849 R829A), the amount of co-precipitated full-length CMS is markedly diminished (Fig. 2, E and F, respectively). It is important to note that, because we cannot avoid the endogenous Cbl proteins that can mediate the formation of a heterotrimeric complex, we have detected some full-length CMS co-precipitated even in the absence of overexpressed Cbl proteins. Taken together, we can conclude that a complex containing Cbl proteins and two intermolecular SH3 domains of CMS can be formed in cells in the context of full-length CMS proteins. CMSA/CD2 Crystal Structures—Structural and in vivo CMSA/Cbl-b results demonstrate the ability of CMS to form heterotrimeric complexes with Cbl-b-derived peptides in a similar fashion as was reported for CIN85. We wanted to check whether a similar CMS recognition was possible for other atypical polyproline-containing molecules. We observed, in the CMSA/Cbl-b structure, that Lys-907 is involved in the interaction with SH3I (Fig. 1B). However, this residue is only conserved in Cbl-b or c-Cbl proteins, and it is not present in some other CMS/CIN85-interacting proteins such as CD2, SB-1, SLP-65/BLNK, or AIP1 (Fig. 3A). In CD2, the position of the lysine is occupied by a leucine (PLPRPR). The fact that the Cbl-b Lys-907 side chain interacts with the RT loop of SH3I in the CMSA/Cbl-b crystal structure (Fig. 1D) could suggest that a CD2-derived peptide could be predominantly a class II-like interaction. To check this possibility, the crystal structure of the CMSA/CD2-derived peptide complex was solved at 2.9 and 2.2 Å (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table 1). Two different crystals were obtained. Unexpectedly, one of the structures was a heterotrimer of two SH3 domains binding to the peptide in the same mode that Cbl-b-derived peptide is being recognized (Fig. 1C), yet the other structure is of a single SH3 domain recognizing the peptide in a class II orientation. Both CMSA/CD2 and CMSA/Cbl-b heterotrimeric structures display similar peptide recognition modes, with the exception of contacts established by Cbl-b Lys-907 (Leu-328 in CD2) (Fig. 1D).

https://openalex.org/W2130761650,"Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration are substantially controlled by the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ), which can be regulated by the Ser/Thr kinase G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2). In mouse aortic SMCs, however, we found that prolonged PDGFRβ activation engendered down-regulation of GRK5, but not GRK2; moreover, GRK5 and PDGFRβ were coordinately up-regulated in SMCs from atherosclerotic arteries. With SMCs from GRK5 knock-out and cognate wild type mice (five of each), we found that physiologic expression of GRK5 increased PDGF-promoted PDGFRβ seryl phosphorylation by 3-fold and reduced PDGFRβ-promoted phosphoinositide hydrolysis, thymidine incorporation, and overall PDGFRβ tyrosyl phosphorylation by ∼35%. Physiologic SMC GRK5 activity also increased PDGFRβ association with the phosphatase Shp2 (8-fold), enhanced phosphorylation of PDGFRβ Tyr1009 (the docking site for Shp2), and reduced phosphorylation of PDGFRβ Tyr1021. Consistent with having increased PDGFRβ-associated Shp2 activity, GRK5-expressing SMCs demonstrated greater PDGF-induced Src activation than GRK5-null cells. GRK5-mediated desensitization of PDGFRβ inositol phosphate signaling was diminished by Shp2 knock-down or impairment of PDGFRβ/Shp2 association. In contrast to GRK5, physiologic GRK2 activity did not alter PDGFRβ/Shp2 association. Finally, purified GRK5 effected agonist-dependent seryl phosphorylation of partially purified PDGFRβs. We conclude that GRK5 mediates the preponderance of PDGF-promoted seryl phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ in SMCs, and, through mechanisms involving Shp2, desensitizes PDGFRβ inositol phosphate signaling and enhances PDGFRβ-triggered Src activation. Smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration are substantially controlled by the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ), which can be regulated by the Ser/Thr kinase G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2).

With SMCs from GRK5 knock-out and cognate wild type mice (five of each), we found that physiologic expression of GRK5 increased PDGF-promoted PDGFRβ seryl phosphorylation by 3-fold and reduced PDGFRβ-promoted phosphoinositide hydrolysis, thymidine incorporation, and overall PDGFRβ tyrosyl phosphorylation by ∼35%. Physiologic SMC GRK5 activity also increased PDGFRβ association with the phosphatase Shp2 (8-fold), enhanced phosphorylation of PDGFRβ Tyr1009 (the docking site for Shp2), and reduced phosphorylation of PDGFRβ Tyr1021. Consistent with having increased PDGFRβ-associated Shp2 activity, GRK5-expressing SMCs demonstrated greater PDGF-induced Src activation than GRK5-null cells. GRK5-mediated desensitization of PDGFRβ inositol phosphate signaling was diminished by Shp2 knock-down or impairment of PDGFRβ/Shp2 association. In contrast to GRK5, physiologic GRK2 activity did not alter PDGFRβ/Shp2 association. Finally, purified GRK5 effected agonist-dependent seryl phosphorylation of partially purified PDGFRβs. We conclude that GRK5 mediates the preponderance of PDGF-promoted seryl phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ in SMCs, and, through mechanisms involving Shp2, desensitizes PDGFRβ inositol phosphate signaling and enhances PDGFRβ-triggered Src activation.

As a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, the PDGFRβ autophosphorylates on tyrosyl residues upon binding PDGF. Subsequently, the PDGFRβ activates intracellular signaling cascades by tyrosine-phosphorylating and/or scaffolding multiple proteins critical for cellular proliferation and migration (4Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Until they are destroyed in the lysosome, activated PDGFRβs appear to continue signaling (5Wang Y.

Thus, regulation of PDGFRβ signaling prior to receptor degradation attains considerable significance. Along with PDGFRβ tyrosyl dephosphorylation (4Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar), an important mechanism for bridling PDGFRβ signaling involves PDGFRβ phosphorylation on seryl residues (6Bioukar E.B. Marricco N.C. Zuo D.

Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Allosterically activated by agonist-occupied heptahelical (seven-membrane-spanning) receptors, GRKs characteristically phosphorylate these activated receptors and thereby initiate desensitization that is “receptor-specific” (i.e. that affects only the receptor whose activation prompted GRK activity). Only GRKs 2, 5, and 6 are widely expressed at substantial levels in mammalian tissues. With only 58.6% similarity to GRK2 (13Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

In light of the role of GRK2 in regulating PDGFRβ function in fibroblasts, we initiated this investigation to determine whether the PDGFRβ can be regulated in SMCs by GRK5 and whether GRK5 and GRK2 employ similar or distinct mechanisms for PDGFRβ regulation. Recombinant Adenoviruses and Plasmids—The cDNA encoding bovine GRK5 was inserted into the plasmid pSKAC, and adenoviruses were produced in 293 cells, purified on CsCl gradients, and titered as we described previously (9Peppel K.

The Y1009F mutant FPDGFRβ was created from its WT congener by cassette PCR, using the following primers: 5′-cgcgggccatggcctccgatctcccctggacaccagctccgtcctctttactgccgtgcagcccaatg-3′ (underscore denotes the Tyr → Phe mutation, and italic type denotes the 5′ NcoI site) and 5′-cgcggggcggccgcaagcttctacaggaagctatcctctgc-3′ (boldface type denotes the stop codon; underscore and italic type denote HindIII and NotI sites, respectively). Subcloning employed pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) as a shuttle vector, but both the WT and Y1009F mutant PDGFRβ constructs were ultimately subcloned into pcDNA I (Invitrogen). PCR fidelity was verified by dideoxy sequencing. Atherosclerosis Studies in Mice—All animal care conformed to Ref. 59Council National Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

C57Bl/6J mice without (wild type, WT) or with targeted deletion of the apolipoprotein E gene (apoe-/-; Jackson stock number 002052) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and fed normal mouse chow. Nine-month-old mice were sacrificed, and the circulatory system was perfused with lactated Ringer solution at 80 mm Hg pressure. The common carotid arteries were excised, embedded in OCT compound, frozen at -150 °C, and sliced at 5 μm on a cryotome to obtain sections of the distal common carotid, just proximal to the carotid bifurcation (a site commonly involved with atherosclerosis in the 9-month-old apoe-/- mouse) (22Seo H.S.

Sections were fixed and permeabilized with methanol/acetone (50:50) at room temperature for 2 min, washed twice in Dulbecco's PBS for 1 min, and then incubated (25 °C) for 30 min in “blocking buffer”: 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TTBS (0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl). Next, sections were incubated (25 °C, 60 min) in blocking buffer containing 1 μg/ml nonimmune rabbit IgG (nonspecific staining) or rabbit IgG specific for GRK5 (sc-565) or the PDGFRβ (sc-432) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After three washes in TTBS, sections were then incubated (25 °C, 60 min) in blocking buffer containing the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml) and 3 μg/ml anti-rabbit IgG labeled with either Alexa 546 (for the PDGFRβ) or Alexa 488 (for GRK5) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After three additional washes in TTBS, sections were mounted in Gel/Mount™ (Biomeda Corp.) with a glass coverslip. For specimens stained for α-SMC actin, we incubated fixed specimens in blocking buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml Cy3-conjugated 1A4 (Sigma) as well as Hoechst 33342 (as above). Fluorescence photomicrographs were taken with Chroma™ narrow band-pass filters and a Spot CCD camera, with a fixed shutter speed for all specimens. Nuclear and protein fluorescence images were obtained from individual microscopic fields by rotating fluorescence filters. Protein fluorescence was normalized to DNA fluorescence within each image, as we described previously (23Zhang L. Peppel K. Brian L. Chien L. Freedman N.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic specimens were always processed in pairs, so that staining and imaging could be equivalent for both phenotypes. Cell Culture and Adenovirus Infections—New Zealand White rabbits, grk5-/- and littermate WT mice (14Gainetdinov R.R. Bohn L.M. Walker J.K. Laporte S.A. Macrae A.D. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells and embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from grk2-/- and littermate WT mice were grown and transfected as described (8Hildreth K.L. Wu J.H. Barak L.S. Exum S.T. Kim L.K. Peppel K. Freedman N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41775-41782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The grk5-/- mice used in this study were hybrids of the 129/SvJ and C57Bl/6J lines and were generated by mating grk5-/+ mice. Littermate grk5-/- and WT mice were sacrificed simultaneously for SMC production, and all comparisons were made among littermate-derived SMCs. SMCs were used only through passage 7. Infections of SMCs with recombinant adenoviruses were performed at equivalent multiplicities of infection (from 50 to 100), and cells were assayed 48-72 h after infection, as we described previously (9Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In GRK5 “add-back” experiments with grk5-/- SMCs, assays were performed 6 h after adenovirus infection (when GRK5 expression levels were equivalent to those obtaining in WT SMCs). To assay cell surface PDGFRβ expression levels in transfected HEK cells, we used cell surface immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, as we described previously (7Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48261-48269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cell surface PDGFRβ expression levels of all cell lines were within 30% of control cell values; cell lines outside of this range were not used to generate data. Compared with HEK cells co-transfected with empty vector plasmid, HEK cells overexpressing either GRK2 or GRK5 demonstrated equivalent (∼35%) reductions in PDGF-promoted phosphoinositide hydrolysis; GRK expression was 20-40-fold over endogenous levels (data not shown). SMC Migration and [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—SMC migration was assayed with a protocol modified from one we reported previously (10Peppel K. Zhang L. Huynh T.T. Huang X. Jacobson A. Brian L. Exum S.T. Hagen P.O. Freedman N.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1399-1409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SMCs were serum-deprived for 72 h after adenovirus infection, trypsinized, transiently (<5 min) treated with 8% fetal bovine serum (to neutralize the trypsin), and washed with low mitogen medium. Next, SMCs were plated onto Transwell™ membranes (8-μm pores; Costar) in 24-well dishes and allowed to attach for 4 h. PDGF-BB or vehicle was then delivered outside of the Transwell™ membranes, and SMCs were allowed to migrate for 16 h before fixation with methanol. (Pilot studies demonstrated that originally quiescent SMCs do not divide during this time period with PDGF stimulation (data not shown).) SMC nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342, imaged by fluorescence microscopy, and counted electronically, as we reported previously (10Peppel K. Zhang L. Huynh T.T. Huang X. Jacobson A. Brian L. Exum S.T. Hagen P.O. Freedman N.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1399-1409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SMC [3H]thymidine incorporation was assessed during the final 4 h of a 24-h agonist stimulation, as we reported previously (9Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Parallel aliquots of SMCs were subjected to lysis and IB and demonstrated that control and GRK5-overexpressing SMCs expressed equivalent levels of the PDGFRβ (data not shown). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitations—These assays used antibodies and procedures described previously (7Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol.

Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous PDGFRβs used either rabbit or goat anti-PDGFRβ IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), whereas IP of transfected (N-terminal epitope-tagged) PDGFRβ constructs (WT and Y1009F) used anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). IB employed goat anti-PDGFRβ phospho-Tyr1009, -Tyr1021, and -Tyr740 as well as murine or rabbit anti-Shp2 (Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-c-Src and anti-c-Src phospho-Tyr416 (anti-activated c-Src) (Calbiochem), and anti-PDGFRβ phospho-Tyr579 (GeneTex, Inc.). Phosphorylated PDGFRβ and co-immunoprecipitated band densities were normalized to cognate PDGFRβ band densities, as described previously (8Hildreth K.L. Wu J.H. Barak L.S. Exum S.T. Kim L.K. Peppel K. Freedman N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41775-41782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PDGFRβ tyrosyl and seryl phosphorylation were equivalent after 5 or 10 min of PDGF stimulation (data not shown). The efficiency of PDGFRβ IP was greater than 95%, as assessed by PDGFRβ IB performed simultaneously on post-IP supernatants and serially diluted pre-IP SMC lysate aliquots (data not shown). Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—SMCs were metabolically labeled with [3H]inositol and stimulated as indicated to provoke phosphoinositide hydrolysis as we described previously (9Peppel K. Jacobson A.

Fluoroaluminate (Al(F4)-) was used as described (24Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and we calculated the percent conversion of [3H]inositol into inositol phosphates as we described previously (24Freedman N.J.

In assays with mouse SMCs, 2 nm PDGF-AA evoked only 14 ± 2% as much phosphoinositide hydrolysis as 2 nm PDGF-BB (n = 4 SMC lines); thus, 83 ± 2% of our PDGF-BB-dependent mouse SMC phosphoinositide hydrolysis resulted from SMC PDGFRβ activity (4Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore elected not to down-regulate the SMC PDGFRα before stimulating the SMC PDGFRβ in phosphoinositide hydrolysis experiments. SMC Proliferation—SMC proliferation was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the nuclear scaffolding protein lamin (25Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SMCs were plated at 5 × 103/well in low mitogen medium (9Peppel K. Jacobson A. Huang X. Murray J.P. Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) on day 0 in replicate 96-well plates. On day 1, one plate was washed with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized with methanol/acetone (1:1) for 2 min, washed with PBS, and frozen at -80 °C. SMCs on the second plate were refed with low mitogen medium lacking (“basal”) or containing agonists at the indicated concentrations. SMCs were refed on day 6 and then harvested, washed, permeabilized, and frozen as above on day 12. Replicate frozen plates were thawed and incubated (25 °C) for 30 min in “blocking buffer”: 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Next, wells were incubated for 1 h (25 °C) in blocking buffer with 1 μg/ml of either an irrelevant murine IgG2b (nonspecific signal) or an anti-lamin A/C monoclonal IgG2b (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (total signal). Wells were washed with PBS twice and then incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse/horseradish peroxidase in blocking buffer. After two PBS washes, wells were incubated in 50 μl/well substrate solution: 0.1 mg of o-phenylenediamine (Sigma)/ml of 0.03% H2O2. Reactions were terminated when adequate color development was achieved (∼30 min), with 50 μl of 1 m H2SO4. The color of each well was read at 490 nm. Specific A490 was calculated as total - nonspecific; nonspecific signal constituted 20-25% of total signal. Assays were performed in triplicate. The number of SMCs in agonist-stimulated wells was normalized to that in basal wells on day 12 (which, in turn, was ∼10% above the number measured on day 1). In Vitro Phosphorylation with Purified GRK5—Recombinant bovine GRK5 was synthesized in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells, as we have previously reported (13Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GRK5 was purified as before (13Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that elution from the heparin-Sepharose column was with a 100-ml linear gradient of NaCl that was 150-1200 mm in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) and included 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100. Fractions at ∼800 mm NaCl were pooled and diluted with buffer A to reduce the [NaCl] to <150 mm (buffer B). Subsequently, the diluted, purified GRK5 was concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at 0.5 mg/ml in 50:50 (v/v) glycerol/buffer B at -20 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2092547975,"A model has been proposed for the exofacial configuration of the Glut1 glucose transporter in which eight transmembrane domains form an inner helical bundle stabilized by four outer helices. The role of transmembrane segment 12, predicted to be an outer helix in this hypothetical model, was examined by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and the substituted cysteine accessibility method using the membrane-impermeant, sulfhydryl-specific reagent, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS). A previously characterized functional cysteine-less Glut1 molecule was used to produce 21 Glut1 point mutants by changing each residue along helix 12 to a cysteine residue. These mutants were then expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their protein levels, functional activities, and sensitivities to pCMBS were determined. Strikingly, in contrast to all nine other predicted Glut1 transmembrane helices that have been previously examined by this method, none of the 21 helix 12 single-cysteine mutants exhibited significant inhibition of specific transport activity. Also unlike most other Glut1 transmembrane domains in which solvent-accessible residues lie along a single face of the helix, mutations in five consecutive residues predicted to lie close to the exofacial face of the membrane resulted in sensitivity to pCMBS-induced transport inhibition. These results suggest that helix 12 plays a passive stabilizing role in the structure of Glut1 and is not directly involved in the transport mechanism. Additionally, the pCMBS data indicate that the predicted exoplasmic end of helix 12 is completely exposed to the external solvent when the transporter is in its exofacial configuration.

Based on analysis of the protein sequence deduced from a human cDNA clone, Glut1 was the first MFS protein predicted to possess 12 transmembrane helices (9Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M.

A number of experimental observations, most notably a comprehensive glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis study (10Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are consistent with this structural prediction. Several of the 12 predicted transmembrane helices are amphipathic, an observation that led to the suggestion that these helices form an exposed cavity in the membrane-buried portion of the protein that participates in the binding and translocation of glucose across the lipid bilayer (9Mueckler M.

Data suggest that transmembrane segment 3 is an outer helix (19Mueckler M. Roach W. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46876-46881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This model is also largely in agreement with homology modeling of Glut1 based on the high resolution structures recently reported for the Lac permease (20Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar) and glycerol-3-P antiporter (21Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), two members of the major facilitator superfamily from Escherichia coli. Homology modeling of the endofacial configuration of Glut1 based on these structures suggests that helices 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 comprise an inner bundle of transmembrane helices that form a substrate-binding cavity near the center of the bilayer, whereas helices 3, 6, 9, and 12 are predicted to encircle and stabilize this inner helical bundle. Interestingly, experimental data suggest that the exofacial half of helix 4 may not be exposed to the external aqueous environment in the exofacial conformation (22Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), even though it comprises an inner helix in the endofacial conformations of the bacterial transporters. It is thus possible that the endofacial and exofacial helical bundle orientations of these transporters may not be identical.In the current study, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was used along with a membrane-impermeant, sulfhydryl-specific chemical reagent to examine the role of transmembrane segment 12 in the predicted exofacial structure of Glut1. Our results demonstrate that the exofacial end of helix 12 lies in direct contact with the external solvent in the outward-facing configuration of Glut1. Additionally, none of the helix 12 side chains appears to be essential for transport activity. These data suggest that helix 12 does not participate directly in the transport mechanism but likely plays a role in stabilizing Glut1 structure.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Imported female African Xenopus laevis frogs were purchased from Xenopus Express (Homosassa, FL), 2-[3H]deoxyglucose and diguanosine triphosphate were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Megascript™ RNA synthesis kits were purchased from Ambion Inc.

Two days after injection, groups of ∼20 oocytes were incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS) in Barth's saline at 22 °C. The 100× concentrated reagent stock was prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide, and control oocytes were treated with the appropriate concentration of vehicle alone. After a 15-min incubation period, the oocytes were washed four times in Barth's saline and then used for the determination of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake (50 μm, 30 min at 22 °C).Specific Activity Determinations—Membranes were prepared 3 days following injection of 50 ng of mutant RNA/oocyte. Western blot analysis of each of the mutant transporters was performed on ∼1 μg of total membrane protein, and the intensity of the Glut1 band was quantified by scanning densitometry using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager SI. Analysis was performed using the ImageQuant NT program (version 4.0). 2-[3H]Deoxyglucose uptake (pmol/oocyte/30 min) of each mutant was concomitantly determined in each set of experiments. Specific activity was expressed as the 2-deoxyglucose uptake per ng of mutant Glut1 protein expressed per μg of total oocyte membrane protein, and the data were then normalized by assigning the uptake activity of the parental C-less protein a value of 1.0. Purified human erythrocyte membranes were loaded on the same gels as the oocyte membrane samples for use as quantitative standards.Statistical Analysis—Uptake data were analyzed for statistical significance using the two-tailed, unpaired Student t test.RESULTSMutation of all six native cysteine residues of human Glut1 to either serine or glycine residues (C-less Glut1) has no discernable effect on transport activity (28Wellner M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). C-less Glut1 is robustly expressed at the plasma membrane, and thus none of the native Glut1 cysteine residues is required for correct subcellular targeting, structural integrity, or transport activity when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (29Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). C-less Glut1 was used to produce 21 mutant transporters (single-C mutants) in which each amino acid residue within predicted transmembrane helix 12 was individually changed to a cysteine residue (see Table 1). All of the mutated cDNAs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation as well as the absence of spurious mutations within the coding region.TABLE 1Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of helix 12 cDNA encoding cysteine-less human Glut1 was subjected to oligonucleotide-mediated, site-directed mutagenesis, creating a series of 21 mutant cDNAs in which each of the 21 residues within transmembrane helix 12 was individually changed to a cysteine. “Residue no.” refers to the amino acid numbering for human Glut1 given in Ref. 9Mueckler M.

To confirm that the mutants were expressed in the plasma membrane, frozen sections of the injected oocytes were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 15 residues of Glut1 (Fig. 1A). All 21 of the single-C mutants were clearly expressed in the oocyte plasma membrane with efficiencies similar to that of the parental C-less protein. Expression levels for all 21 mutants were then quantitated by immunoblot analysis of purified oocyte membranes (Fig. 1B). In Xenopus oocytes, Glut1 appears as two broad bands by SDS-PAGE, the lower band being an incompletely glycosylated form of the protein present in early Golgi compartments and the upper band representing the fully glycosylated form of the protein that has largely reached the plasma membrane (23Hresko R.C. Murata H. Marshall B.A. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32110-32119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As we have shown previously for other Glut1 transmembrane helices, the expression levels of the individual helix 12 single-C mutants varied somewhat, necessitating that transport data be normalized to the membrane content of mutant protein in order to directly compare the catalytic activities of the mutants with that of their C-less parent. Only the upper bands, corresponding to the fully glycosylated mutants, were quantitated for this purpose.All 21 of the single-C mutants exhibited transport activities similar to that of the C-less parent as determined by the uptake of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose. The raw uptake data are shown in Fig. 2A, and the specific transport activities, normalized to the membrane content of each mutant, are presented in Fig. 2B. Strikingly, the helix 12 residues were insensitive to cysteine substitution with regard to inhibition of transport activity compared with the residues comprising all nine of the other Glut1 helices examined thus far. None of the 21 single-C mutants exhibited transport activity that was statistically less than that of C-less. Cysteine substitution at Thr448 resulted in an ∼50% stimulation of transport activity.FIGURE 22-Deoxyglucose uptake activity of helix 12 single-C mutants. 2-[3H]Deoxyglucose (2-DOG) uptake (50 μm, 30 min at 22 °C) and the plasma membrane content of each single-C mutant were quantitated 2 days after injection of mRNAs.

We previously showed that pCMBS has very close access to the exofacial sugar-binding site (29Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The V165C mutant represents a positive control for reaction with pCMBS (14Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J.

Fig. 3 shows the transport activities observed in the presence of pCMBS normalized for each single-C mutant to the activity measured in the absence of the reagent, i.e. a value of 1 indicates no effect of pCMBS, values greater than 1 indicate stimulation by pCMBS, and values of less than 1 indicate inhibition by pCMBS. Surprisingly, five consecutive residues near the predicted exofacial end of the helix demonstrated significant sensitivity to pCMBS and thus must have been exposed to the external solvent (see Fig. 4).FIGURE 3Effect of pCMBS on transport activity of helix 12 single-C mutants. Three days after injection of mRNAs, groups of 15-20 oocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm pCMBS in Barth's saline at 22 °C for 15 min.

Our observation that none of the helix 12 amino acid side chains is critical for transport activity is consistent with the hypothesis that this helix is not directly involved in substrate binding or transporter conformational changes. In contrast, all eight proposed inner helices possess multiple residues that are sensitive to cysteine substitution with regard to transport activity, including helices 1 (12Heinze M. Monden I.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One mutant, T448C, exhibited a 50% increase in specific transport activity relative to the C-less parent. This residue lies near the predicted cytoplasmic face of helix 12. The reason for this increase is not apparent based on our current knowledge of Glut1 structure, but a similar increase has been observed for several other single-C mutants in other transmembrane helices that have been analyzed by scanning mutagenesis.Surprisingly, however, the predicted exofacial end of helix 12 appears to be completely immersed in the external solvent (see Fig. 4). There are at least three possible explanations for this observation. First, these residues may not reside in the transmembrane helical bundle per se but may instead comprise part of the last exofacial loop of Glut1 in the exofacial conformation, or the end of this helix may extend into the exoplasm in the exofacial conformation. A second possibility is that helix 12 is in fact an “inner” helix in the exofacial configuration of the transporter. This possibility seems unlikely, given the complete lack of effect of cysteine substitution on transport activity for residues within this helix. A third possibility is that the central region and cytoplasmic end of helix 12 lie outside the inner helical bundle, but the helix is kinked in such a way that the exoplasmic end twists into the aqueous cavity. If this last possibility is correct, it is likely that the exoplasmic end of helix 12 lies in the vestibule to the aqueous cavity and plays no role in substrate binding or conformation changes, given the lack of effect of the cysteine mutations.An updated model for the exofacial binding site of Glut1 that summarizes all of the scanning mutagenesis and SCAM (substituted cysteine accessibility method) data available to date is shown in Fig. 5. Note that the orientations of helices 4 and 12 are arbitrary because of the lack of periodicity in their pCMBS sensitivities. Even though helix 4 is shown as an “inner” helix in this simple diagram, it is possible that it lies primarily outside of the inner bundle in the exofacial orientation (22Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One caveat that should be considered concerning these studies is that it is uncertain whether the biophysical properties of Glut proteins are identical in native mammalian cells versus Xenopus oocytes. Molecular modeling of the endofacial conformation of Glut1 based on homology and energy minimalization (30Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys.

Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). However, most of the experimental data for Glut1 pertain to the exofacial conformation, and it will be most interesting to see high resolution structures for one or more members of the MFS to determine how well the experimental data match the crystal structure.FIGURE 5Two-dimensional model for the arrangement of the 12 transmembrane helices of Glut1 and the exofacial sugar-binding site. Proposed low resolution model of the exofacial glucose-binding site as viewed from the exoplasmic face of the membrane. For simplicity all transmembrane segments are drawn as perfect helices perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. The model is consistent with numerous experimental observations (see “Discussion” herein and Ref. 16Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10494-10499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar for further discussion). Glucose is not drawn to scale. The dotted lines represent possible hydrogen bonds formed between glucose hydroxyl groups and various side chains on Glut1. Numbered residues are accessible to pCMBS from the external solvent. The helices shown in gray have not yet been analyzed by scanning mutagenesis.

We now show that a recombinant trimeric N-propeptide interacts with transforming growth factor-β1 and BMP2 and exhibits functional effects in stably transfected cells. The synthesis of N-propeptide by COS-7 cells results in an increase in phosphorylation of Akt and Smad3 and is associated with a marked reduction in type I procollagen synthesis and impairment in adhesion. In C2C12 cells, N-propeptide inhibits the osteoblastic differentiation induced by BMP2. Our data suggest that these effects are mediated by the interaction of N-propeptide with an intracellular receptor in the secretory pathway, because they are not observed when recombinant N-propeptide is added to the culture medium of either COS-7 or C2C12 cells. Both the binding of N-propeptide to cytokines and its functional properties are entirely dependent on the exon 2-encoded globular domain, and a mutation that substitutes a serine for a highly conserved cysteine in exon 2 abolishes its function.

Our findings suggest that N-propeptide performs an important feedback regulatory function and provides a rationale for the prominence of a homotrimeric form of type I procollagen (α1 trimer) during vertebrate development. Fibrillar types I-III procollagens are proteolytically cleaved by procollagen N- and C-proteases that separate nontriple helical NH2- and COOH-terminal propeptides, respectively, from their major central triple helical domains (1Prockop D.J. Sieron A.L. Li S.W. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This proteolytic processing is necessary for the alignment and self-assembly of collagen molecules and for normal collagen fibril formation. Specific sequences in the COOH-terminal propeptides are required for chain recognition and triple helix formation that generate procollagens with the correct chain composition (2Doege K.J.

In addition, the COOH-terminal propeptide has been shown to be chemotactic for endothelial cells and to stimulate migration and production of metalloproteinases by mammary carcinoma cell lines after its release by procollagen C protease (5Palmieri D.

Fragments of the propeptide have also been reported to stimulate extracellular matrix production (7Katayama K. Armendariz-Borunda J. Raghow R. Kang A.H. Seyer J.M. J. Biol.

In contrast, the functions of the NH2-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (N-propeptide) 2The abbreviations used are: N-propeptide, NH2-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen; AP, alkaline phosphatase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; HEK, human embryonic kidney; OI, osteogenesis imperfecta; TGF, transforming growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CICP, COOH-terminal propeptide of human type I procollagen; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: N-propeptide, NH2-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen; AP, alkaline phosphatase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; CRD, cysteine-rich domain; HEK, human embryonic kidney; OI, osteogenesis imperfecta; TGF, transforming growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CICP, COOH-terminal propeptide of human type I procollagen; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. are not well understood (for a review see Ref. 8Bornstein P. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In 1979, Wiestner et al. (9Wiestner M. Krieg T. Hörlein D. Glanville R.W. Fietzek P. Muller P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7016-7023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) purified the N-propeptide from dermatosparactic calf skin, which is deficient in procollagen N-protease, and demonstrated that it functioned to inhibit the synthesis of both types I and III collagen by bovine skin fibroblasts in culture. Subsequently, evidence was provided for the ability of the N-propeptide to inhibit selectively the translation of procollagen mRNA in cell-free systems (10Paglia L. Diaz de Wilczek J. Leon L. Martin G.R. Horlein D. Muller P. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Hörlein D. McPherson J. Goh S.H. Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6163-6167Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, this function, which presumes a cytosolic site of action, was never reconciled with the fact that the N-propeptide is released only in intracellular secretory vesicles and in the extracellular environment (12Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Additional functions proposed for the N-propeptide included inhibition of intracellular fibrillogenesis, facilitation of transcellular transport and secretion of procollagen, and control of extracellular fibrillogenesis (for reviews see Refs. 8Bornstein P. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Bornstein P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 567-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, and 14Martin G.R. Byers P.H. Piez K.A. Adv. Enzymol. 1975; 42: 167-191PubMed Google Scholar), but none of these functions were supported by the phenotype of a mouse with a targeted deletion of exon 2 in the Col1a1 gene. Thus, although exon 2 encodes the majority of the nontriple helical sequence in the N-propeptide, procollagen synthesis, secretion, and proteolytic processing were all normal in these mice (15Bornstein P. Walsh V. Tullis J. Stainbrook E. Bateman J. Hormuzdi S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2605-2613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Excisional skin wound healing was also normal. However, a background-dependent reduction in the expected number of viable homozygous mutant mice that were born in heterozygous crosses was documented. Because compensation by the closely related N-propeptide of type III procollagen, which is synthesized in a very similar spatial and temporal pattern to that of type I procollagen, seemed likely, we determined the levels of proα1(III) mRNA in exon 2-deleted mice. Extensive Northern analyzes of tissues from both pre- and postnatal mice of several ages revealed no differences from controls. 3M. L. Augustine and P. Bornstein, unpublished results. 3M. L. Augustine and P. Bornstein, unpublished results. However, the possibility remains that normal levels of type III N-propeptide could compensate for a lack of type I N-propeptide. In addition, type V procollagen contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) in the proα2 chain of its NH2-terminal propeptide that is homologous to N-propeptide. Type V procollagen is frequently co-expressed with type I procollagen and might therefore also compensate. We then considered the possibility that N-propeptide might not function directly in collagen biogenesis but might rather play a developmental role by interaction with cytokines such as members of the TGFβ and BMP families. This possibility is supported by the presence of a CRD in the sequences encoded by exon 2 in types I-III procollagens that is homologous with the CRDs in chordins in vertebrates and sog in Drosophila (16Abreu J.G. Coffinier C. Larrain J. Oelgeschläger M. deRobertis E.M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 287: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Chordin and sog bind BMPs in vertebrates and Drosophila, respectively, and function to regulate dorsoventral patterning during embryonic development (17Larrain J. deRobertis E.M. Oelgeschläger M. Wessely O. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. deRobertis E.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Larrain et al. (19Larrain J. Bachiller D. Lu B. Agius E. Piccolo S. deRobertis E.M. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 821-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also showed that the N-propeptide derived from Xenopus type IIA procollagen bound BMP4 and that Xenopus type IIA procollagen mRNA had dorsalizing activity when microinjected into Xenopus embryos. These studies are supported by the work of Sandell and co-workers (21Zhu Y. Oganesian A. Keene D.R. Sandell L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the N-propeptide of human type IIA procollagen, which contains the CRD sequence, but not the N-propeptide of type IIB procollagen, a splice variant that lacks the sequence encoded by exon 2, binds BMP2 and TGFβ1. In contrast with the mild phenotype of type I procollagen exon 2-deleted mice, mice with a targeted deletion of exon 2 in type II procollagen were found to die in mid-gestation because of cardiac malformations (22Cheah K.S.E. Wong S.Y.Y. Zhang J.C.L. Leung A.W.L. Chan D. Tam P.P.L. Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: S25Google Scholar). This disparity is not necessarily surprising in view of the very different spatial and temporal patterns of expression of the two procollagens. Thus, the functional significance of their N-propeptides is almost certain to be very different even though their structures and intrinsic mechanisms of action may have similarities. In this study we show that a recombinant trimeric N-propeptide interacts with both TGFβ1 and BMP2. N-propeptide also functions intracellularly, because COS-7 cells that are stably transfected with a cDNA encoding a trimeric form of the N-propeptide show an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt and Smad3, markedly reduce collagen synthesis, and attach poorly to fibronectin-coated plates. Furthermore, the expression of N-propeptide in stably transfected myoblastic C2C12 cells inhibits BMP2-induced differentiation to osteoblasts. These effects cannot be reproduced by addition of purified N-propeptide, or the conditioned medium of N-propeptide-expressing cells, to control COS-7 cells. All activities of N-propeptide can be attributed to the CRD encoded by exon 2, because a protein that lacks this sequence is defective in both functional and direct binding assays. The importance of a native structure of the CRD is highlighted by the finding that a recombinant mouse N-propeptide with a substitution of a serine for a cysteine, patterned after a naturally occurring mutation in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), failed to signal appropriately in stably transfected COS-7 cells. Construction of Mammalian Expression Vectors—The cDNA encoding the N-propeptide of type I procollagen, and an additional 111 amino acids from the major triple helix of the α1(I) chain, was excised from a full-length murine Col1a1 cDNA and cloned in-frame with the DNA encoding a 27-amino acid foldon sequence derived from bacteriophage T4 fibritin protein (23Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion sequence was amplified using primers designed to include an XbaI restriction site and a Kozak consensus translational start sequence at the 5′-end and a BstBI/SfuI site with a GSGS spacer at the 3′-end. The sequence was then cloned into a pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+)B mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). Preservation of the correct reading frame was verified by DNA sequencing. To prepare an N-propeptide construct lacking the amino acids encoded by exon 2, we used the above-described N-propeptide-containing plasmid as a template and a standard site-directed mutagenesis procedure with custom-designed primers to exclude the exon 2 sequence. The resultant PCR-amplified fragment was digested with XbaI and BstBI/SfuI enzymes and cloned into a pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+)B plasmid. The structures of the two peptide fragments are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. We also used a QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create a G to C nucleotide mutation in the N-propeptide construct that resulted in the substitution of a serine for a cysteine at position 52 in the N-propeptide sequence (C52S mutant construct). DNA Transfections—COS-7 and HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and C2C12 cells, a gift from Dr. S. Hauschka (University of Washington), were transfected with the two constructs described in Fig. 1, or with a control vector, using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). In addition, COS-7 cells were transfected with the C52S mutant construct. To establish stably transfected cell lines for each protein, cells were selected with G418 (COS-7, 400 μg/ml; HEK293, 500 μg/ml; and C2C12, 700 μg/ml) for 2 weeks, followed by expansion of isolated clones. Multiple clones were evaluated for protein expression levels by Western blotting with c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and monospecific anti-mouse N-propeptide rabbit polyclonal antibody (prepared in our laboratory). To determine transfection efficiency, some plates were co-transfected with the reporter vector pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). Protein Purification—Individual clones expressing intact N-propeptide, exon 2-deleted N-propeptide, or the C52S mutant were grown to confluence in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS. Cells were serum-starved for 24 or 48 h, the medium was collected, and the proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid HisBind resins (Novagen, Madison, WI). The purity of the proteins was determined by silver staining using a Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad). Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20). The blots were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, washed four times with TBST, and incubated for 40 min with secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of N-propeptide Concentrations by ELISA— 96-Well ELISA plates (Corning Glass) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of serum-deprived conditioned medium from control COS-7 cells or cells expressing one of the three N-propeptides. Plates were washed four times with the PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (Fisher) and blocked with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. An anti-Myc antibody was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed, blocked again, and incubated with anti-mouse AP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate liquid solution (Sigma) was used as a substrate, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Cell Attachment and Detachment Assays—COS-7 cells, transfected with N-propeptide or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide, and control COS-7 cells were trypsinized, and 100 μl of a cell suspension (104 cells) was added to each well of fibronectin-coated, 96-well tissue culture plates. Cells were allowed to attach for1hat37 °C. Unattached cells were removed by washing the plates with PBS, and attachment was quantified by addition of 20 μl of Cell Titer 96 solution, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI.). After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a microplate reader. To quantify the rate of detachment, control COS-7 cells and cells stably expressing either N-propeptide or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide were trypsinized and plated in triplicate in 12-well plates at a density of 6 × 104 cells per well. The cells were grown to 80% confluence, washed twice with PBS, and treated with 0.05% trypsin, and detached cells were counted at different time points. The percentage of detached cells was calculated by dividing the number of detached cells by the number of cells introduced in each well. ELISA for Collagen Synthesis—Control COS-7 cells and N-propeptide or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide-expressing cells were plated and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. When cells reached 80-90% confluence, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured in serum-free medium for an additional 6 or 24 h. This culture medium was then collected and immediately stored at -80 °C for use in ELISAs. The cell number in each dish was then counted to determine the quantity of cells that had contributed to the generation of type I collagen that was secreted into the medium over the 24-h period. ELISA was performed in duplicate using a Metra CICP EIA kit (Metra Biosystems, San Diego). Briefly, aliquots of media from control COS-7 cells and from cells expressing N-propeptide or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide were added to 8-well strips coated with a monoclonal antibody to the COOH-terminal propeptide of human type I procollagen (CICP) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. This antibody cross-reacts with the monkey procollagen synthesized by COS-7 cells. Wells were washed and incubated with rabbit anti-CICP polyclonal antibody followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit AP conjugate. para-Nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was used to quantify CICP in the medium. The results were converted to nanograms/ml using standards provided by the manufacturer and normalized according to the number of cells present at the time of medium collection. Immunoprecipitation of TGFβ1 and BMP2—100 μl of cell culture medium containing N-propeptide or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide was incubated for 2 h at 37°C with a 10-50-fold molar excess of TGFβ1 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or BMP2 (Wyeth, Cambridge, MA). Five μl of an anti-TGFβ1 polyclonal antibody (Promega, Madison, WI), or in the case of BMP2-containing tubes our monospecific anti-mouse N-propeptide polyclonal antibody, was then added to the appropriate tubes, and the solutions were incubated overnight at 4 °C. As negative controls, the conditioned medium from COS-7 cells, or from cells transfected with control plasmid only, was used. 30 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose was added, and the beads were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted, washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton 100, and once with 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8. The beads were then boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the supernatant was electrophoresed in SDS-acrylamide gels, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with monoclonal antibodies to c-Myc in the case of TGFβ1-containing samples or to BMP2 (Sigma) in the case of BMP2-containing samples. Determination of the Levels of Phosphorylated Akt and Smad Proteins in COS-7, HEK293, and C2C12 Cells—Control COS-7 or human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, transfected with an N-propeptide or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide plasmid, were serum-starved for 24 h. Mouse myoblast C2C12 cells were kept in 2% serum overnight. Control cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 or 100 ng/ml BMP2 for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, and protein concentrations were then determined by the BCA method (Pierce). 30-μg aliquots of total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analyses were performed using phospho-Akt, pan-Akt, phospho-Smad2, phospho-Smad3, total Smad2/3, phospho-Smad 1/5/8 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and anti-β-actin (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) antibodies, as described above. When TGFβRI kinase inhibitor (Calbiochem) was used, control COS-7 cells or cells expressing N-propeptide were serum-starved, and different concentrations of inhibitor (4, 8, and 18 nm) were added for 1 h prior to the addition of recombinant TGFβ1 or PDGF-BB to control cells. The cells were incubated for 10 min with PDGF-BB or 1 h with TGFβ1. N-propeptide-expressing cells were incubated with inhibitor for 1 or 4 h or overnight. Cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Apoptosis Assay—Control COS-7 cells and cells expressing N-propeptide or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide were serum-starved for 24 h and labeled with commercially available annexin V-PE (phycoerythrin) for assay of apoptosis (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were washed twice with cold PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in 100 μl of 1× binding buffer. Five μl of annexin V-PE was added, and the cells were incubated in the dark for 15 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Determination of AP Activity in C2C12 Cells—C2C12 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 15% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were stably transfected with the constructs shown in Fig. 1. Single clones were isolated and expanded as described above. To determine AP activity, the cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates. Following a 24-h incubation period, the cells were rinsed with PBS, and growth medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS and 50 ng/ml BMP2 (Wyeth) and the cells were incubated for another 3 days. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton-100 at pH 7.5. The cellular AP activity, a prominent osteoblastic differentiation marker, was determined in cell lysates in a buffer containing 0.1 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (Sigma), pH 10.5, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) as a substrate. Absorbance was recorded at 405 nm. Determination of the AP activity was performed in triplicate, and the values were normalized to total protein concentrations using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Statistical Analysis—A two-tailed Student t test was used for statistical comparisons. Data were considered statistically significant when the p value was less than 0.05. Purification of N-propeptide-Foldon Fusion Proteins—To study the biochemical function of the N-propeptide of type I procollagen, a chimeric gene construct, consisting of cDNA encoding the full-length N-propeptide, and an additional 111 amino acids from the major triple helix of the α1(I) chain, was generated recombinantly. These sequences were fused to a foldon sequence from T4 bacteriophage fibritin that is known to have strong trimerizing properties (Fig. 1A). The rationale for construction of a trimeric N-propeptide is provided under the “Discussion.” The additional 37 Gly-X-Y-triplet sequences were placed NH2-terminal to the foldon sequence to generate a relatively stable triple helix that would fold from the COOH to the NH2 terminus (23Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and thus make it more likely that the orientation of the three globular domains in the trimeric N-propeptide resembled that in the native protein. To evaluate whether the exon 2-encoded CRD is responsible for the biological function of the N-propeptide, we deleted the exon 2 sequence from the above construct. The structure of the resulting fusion protein is shown schematically in Fig. 1B. We also studied the effect of substitution of a serine for a cysteine, a naturally occurring mutation at amino acid 61 (C61S) of the proα1 chain of type I procollagen in a patient with OI. 4J. M. Pace and P. H. Byers, unpublished data. A point mutation was created that changed a Cys to a Ser in the corresponding position (amino acid 52) of the mouse N-propeptide construct. COS-7, HEK293, and C2C12 cells were stably transfected with the N-propeptide, and exon 2-deleted N-propeptide constructs and expression levels of the encoded proteins were evaluated in isolated clones by Western blots of the conditioned media with c-Myc antibody. COS-7 cells were also transfected with the C52S mutant N-propeptide. Expression levels of three recombinant proteins were comparable (data not shown). Conditioned medium from clones with high expression levels, as determined by Western blot with c-Myc antibody (Fig. 2A), was used to purify recombinant proteins by nickel affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2B, silver staining of SDS-acrylamide gels indicated that the purified proteins were homogeneous and free of contaminating proteins. A similar degree of purity was achieved for the mutant N-propeptide (data not shown). In the absence of denaturing agents (native gels), intact trimeric N-propeptide migrates to a position consistent with its molecular weight (Fig. 2C). The amount of each recombinant protein present in conditioned medium was quantified using an ELISA-based assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and used as a basis for comparison in subsequent experiments. The three proteins were present at approximately equal levels (200-300 ng/ml). The Expression of N-propeptide Compromises Attachment and Accelerates Detachment of COS-7 Cells—During culture of stably transfected COS-7 cells, it was noticed that cells that secreted N-propeptide appeared to attach more slowly, as compared with exon 2-deleted or mutant N-propeptide, when plated and to detach more rapidly when passaged. We therefore proceeded to document these changes. Control COS-7 cells or COS-7 cells stably expressing either N-propeptide or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide were cultured on fibronectin-coated plates for 1 h. The unattached cells were removed, and the attachment of cells was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results demonstrate that the rate of attachment of COS-7 cells expressing exon 2-deleted N-propeptide was comparable with that of control COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, the rate of attachment of COS-7 cells expressing N-propeptide was reduced by ∼70%, compared with that of control cells or of cells expressing exon 2-deleted N-propeptide. These data demonstrate that the synthesis and secretion of N-propeptide compromised the ability of COS-7 cells to attach to a substratum. COS-7 cells expressing N-propeptide also detached more rapidly than control or exon 2-deleted cells when exposed to low concentrations of trypsin. The results presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that a 30-s treatment with 0.05% trypsin resulted in detachment of greater than 70% of COS-7 cells expressing N-propeptide, and a 60-s incubation leads to almost 100% detachment of the cells. In contrast, only 10-20 and 30-50% of control or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide-expressing COS-7 cells were detached at the same time points. These data confirm that the expression of N-propeptide leads to an acceleration of the detachment of COS-7 cells when these cells are subjected to mild proteolysis. In the case of both reduced attachment and accelerated detachment, the cause can be attributed to the CRD domain encoded by exon 2. In contrast, no differences in the attachment or detachment of HEK293 or C2C12 cells, expressing N-propeptide or exon 2-deleted N-propeptide, were observed in comparison with the respective control cells. Also, no differences in the attachment or detachment of COS-7 cells expressing C52S mutant N-propeptide were observed (data not shown). Collagen Synthesis Is Reduced in COS-7 Cells That Stably Express N-propeptide—In view of earlier studies that implicated N-propeptide in feedback inhibition of collagen synthesis (9Wiestner M.

However, synuclein gamma (SNCG), previously identified as a breast cancer specific gene (BCSG1), is also highly associated with breast cancer progression. Using transgenic mouse model, we demonstrated a role of SNCG in induction of highly proliferative pregnancy-like phenotype of mammary epithelial cells and branching morphology. SNCG participated in the heat shock protein-based multiprotein chaperone complex for steroid receptor signaling. Expression of SNCG in mammary epithelium resulted in a significant stimulation of ERalpha transcriptional activity. SNCG-induced mammary gland proliferation can be effectively blocked by antiestrogen and ovariectomy, indicating that the induced proliferation is mediated by ERalpha signaling and requires estrogen stimulation. These data indicate the chaperone activity of SNCG on stimulation of steroid receptor signaling in mammary gland and, thus induces extensive mammary gland proliferation and contributes to the hormonal impact on mammary tumorigenesis."

Despite the fundamental role of Csk in controlling cell growth and differentiation, it is unclear what limits this key signaling reaction and controls the production of catalytically repressed Src. To investigate this issue, stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were performed to determine which steps modulate catalysis. Both Src binding and phosphorylation can be monitored by changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Association kinetics are biphasic with the initial phase corresponding to the bimolecular interaction of both proteins and the second phase representing a slow conformational change that coincides with the rate of maximum turnover. The kinetic transients for the phosphorylation reaction are also biphasic with the initial phase corresponding to the rapid phosphorylation and the release of phospho-Src. These data, along with equilibrium sedimentation and product inhibition experiments, suggest that steps involving Src association, phosphorylation, and product release are fast and that a structural change in Csk participates in limiting the catalytic cycle.

The Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) 2The abbreviations used are: SFK, Src family kinase; SH, Src homology; Mops, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol. 2The abbreviations used are: SFK, Src family kinase; SH, Src homology; Mops, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol. play important roles in cellular growth and differentiation. Studies of transgenic mice indicate that SFKs serve key functions in the development of the immune response (1Abraham N. Stojdl D.F. Duncan P.I. Methot N. Ishii T. Dube M. Vanderhyden B.C.

Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 5Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 114-130PubMed Google Scholar). Such findings underscore the need for a thorough understanding of the regulation of these kinases in human disease. All of the members of this kinase family contain three important structural domains: a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain flanked on the N terminus by noncatalytic SH2 and SH3 domains. The activity of the kinase domain of Src, a prototype for the SFKs, is controlled through autophosphorylation in the kinase domain on the activation loop and through phosphorylation in the C-terminal tail segment (6Cole P.A. Shen K. Qiao Y. Wang D. Curr. Opin Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The latter phosphorylation event catalyzed by the Csk (C-terminal Src kinase) represses activity through a substantial conformational change involving all three domains. In the active form of Src, only the SH3 domain interacts with the kinase domain (7Cowan-Jacob S.W. Fendrich G. Manley P.W. Jahnke W. Fabbro D. Liebetanz J. Meyer T. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of the C terminus by Csk induces large segmental movements of the SH2-SH3 domains across the small lobe of the kinase domain, resulting in a high affinity interaction between the phosphorylated tail sequence and the SH2 domain (8Williams J.C. Weijland A. Gonfloni S. Thompson A. Courtneidge S.A. Superti-Furga G. Wierenga R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). In the repressed form, the SH2 domain now makes strong contacts with the large lobe of the kinase domain. This motion induces a closed conformation of Src that is apparently not capable of binding and phosphorylating protein substrates. This modification and subsequent conformational change has profound biological significance for the regulation of all SFKs. For example, mice with targeted disruptions in the Csk gene die in utero at week 9, and cells harvested from these embryos display unusually high SFK activity (11Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Csk is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that shares much homology with the SFKs that it regulates. Csk is also composed of essential kinase, SH2, and SH3 domains, but these domains are organized uniquely with both SH2 and SH3 domains interacting with the small lobe of the kinase domain (12Ogawa A. Takayama Y. Sakai H. Chong K.T. Takeuchi S. Nakagawa A. Nada S. Okada M. Tsukihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14351-14354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Csk is not regulated by autophosphorylation of its activation loop in the kinase domain and does not contain a phosphorylatable C terminus (13Chong Y.P. Mulhern T.D. Cheng H.C. Growth Factors. 2005; 23: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike the SFKs, Csk is considered a constitutively active kinase that does not require any further chemical modifications for activity. In the cell, Csk is cytosolic but can phosphorylate SFKs at the membrane when recruited by an adaptor protein, Cbp (Csk-binding protein) (14Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp.

Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Cbp is a transmembrane protein that may be phosphorylated at a specific tyrosine side chain, a modification that provides a binding site for Csk and colocalizes Csk near membrane-associated SFKs. The binding of Csk and Cbp is driven by the high affinity interaction between phospho-Cbp and the SH2 domain of Csk. This interaction has also been shown to increase the catalytic activity of the tyrosine kinase domain of Csk, further enhancing the repression of SFK activity (16Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have shown that Csk recognizes not only residues directly in the C terminus but also residues in the large lobe of the kinase domain of Src (17Lee S. Ayrapetov M.K. Kemble D.J. Parang K. Sun G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8183-8189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Lin X. Wang Y. Ahmadibeni Y. Parang K. Sun G. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1263-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Several side chains located in helix D outside the active site of Csk in a docking groove are important in maintaining efficient Src phosphorylation kinetics (19Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In a previous study we showed that Csk does not bind with high affinity to Src based on equilibrium sedimentation and single turnover experiments (21Lieser S.A. Aubol B.E. Wong L. Jennings P.A. Adams J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Rather, the low Km for Src stems from a fast phosphoryl transfer step that clamps the substrate into the active site, a mechanism also shown to be operative in another kinase-protein substrate system (22Aubol B.E. Ungs L. Lukasiewicz R. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30182-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Given these findings, it is likely that residues out-side the active site of Csk play a large role in enhancing the phosphoryl transfer step, thereby promoting efficient recognition of poorly interacting substrates. Although Csk has clearly evolved to support a highly efficient phosphoryl transfer step, it is still unclear what factors modulate Src turnover (kcat), the maximum rate constant at which phospho-Src is generated at high Src concentrations. To investigate what controls this parameter, we developed a stopped-flow fluorescence assay to monitor Src association and phosphorylation. Using these techniques, we found that phospho-Src is generated and released rapidly and does not limit turnover. Instead, a slow conformational change associated with the catalyst limits the rate of multiple catalytic turnovers. This represents the first demonstration that a slow structural change in a protein kinase may control the phosphorylation of a physiological substrate target. Materials—ATP, ADP, Mops, MgCl2, KCl, acetic acid, DE52 resin, and liquid scintillant were obtained from Fisher. AMPPNP was purchased from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein Purification—A full-length form of human Csk with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified with a Ni2+-agarose column according to a previously published procedure (23Lin X. Lee S. Sun G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24072-24077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A GST form of Csk (GST-Csk) was also expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified as previously described (24Shaffer J. Sun G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11149-11155Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A mutant form of chicken Src lacking the first 82 residues and possessing a lysine-to-methionine substitution at position 295 was coexpressed with GroEL/ES chaperonin proteins in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified using a Ni2+-agarose column according to a previously published procedure (19Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Csk and Src were determined to be pure by 12% SDS-PAGE. Csk concentrations were determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (25von Gill S.C. Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar). The concentration of Src was determined by complete turnover experiments using catalytic amounts of Csk and excess [32P]ATP. Both Csk and Src were stored at -80 °C in 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT. Steady-state Kinetic Assays—Steady-state kinetic assays for Csk were determined in the presence of 100 mm Mops (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm free Mg2+, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm [γ-32P] ATP (400-600 cpm pmol-1). The assays were typically initiated by the addition of Csk to a mixture of Src, MgCl2, and ATP at 25 °C. The reaction mixtures (20 μl) were quenched with 30% acetic acid (180 μl). A portion of each reaction (180 μl) was then applied to DE 52 columns (3 ml of resin), and washed with 5 ml of 30% acetic acid. The collected flow-though containing phosphorylated substrate was then counted on the 32P channel in liquid scintillant. Control experiments were performed to determine the background phosphorylation (i.e. phosphorylation of Src in the presence of quench). The specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was determined by measuring the total counts of the reaction mixture. The time-dependent concentration of phosphorylated Src was then determined by considering the total cpm of the flow-though, the specific activity of the reaction mixture, and the background phosphorylation. For steady-state kinetic measurements product formation is linear with time, and less than 5% of the substrate was converted to product. Rapid Quench Flow Kinetic Assays—The phosphorylation of Src was monitored using a KinTek Corporation Quench Flow apparatus model RGF-3 following a previously published procedure (26Lieser S.A. Shindler C. Aubol B.E. Lee S. Sun G. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7769-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The experiments were typically executed by loading equal volumes of Csk, [γ-32P]ATP (300-700 cpm pmol-1) and MgCl2 into one sample loop and Src and MgCl2 into the other loop in 100 mm Mops (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT. The reactions were quenched using 30% acetic acid, and phosphoproduct was separated from unreacted [32P]ATP using the column separation assay. Control experiments were performed to determine the background phosphorylation (i.e. phosphorylation of substrate in the presence of quench) using previously published protocols (22Aubol B.E. Ungs L. Lukasiewicz R. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30182-30188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The time-dependent concentration of phosphoproduct was then determined by considering the total cpm of the flow-though, the specific activity of the reaction mixture, and the background phosphorylation. Synthesis of Phospho-Src—Phospho-Src was synthesized using Src (20 μm), GST-Csk (50 nm), and excess ATP (1 mm) in 100 mm Mops (pH 7), 2 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was run for 1 h and dialyzed into 100 mm Mops, 100 mm KCl (pH 7), 2 mm DTT. Phospho-Src was then separated from GST-Csk using a Ni2+-agarose spin column. Stopped-flow Fluorescence Experiments—All of the fluorescence studies were performed using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrometer. For association experiments, Csk in 100 mm Mops (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm free Mg2+ in one 3-ml syringe was mixed with Src in the same buffer conditions from the second 3-ml syringe. For Src phosphorylation experiments, Src and Csk were equilibrated in 100 mm Mops (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm free Mg2+ in one 3-ml syringe and then mixed with ATP in the same buffer conditions from the second 3-ml syringe. Fluorescence changes were monitored using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and a 320-nm cut-on filter fitted between the cell and the photomultiplier tube. Photomultiplier tube voltages were set from 650 to 999, and the slit widths ranged from 0.4 to 10 nm. For the data analyses, the averages of 3-10 individual traces were recorded. All of the experiments were performed at 25 °C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Experiments—The analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-I instrument using an An60Ti rotor. A mixture of Csk (5 μm) and Src (5 μm) in 100 mm Mops (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2 was run in the absence and presence of 50 μm ATP or AMPPNP. Absorbance changes as a function of radial position were measured at a rotor speed of 20,000 at 25 °C. Equilibrium was reached after 14 h at this rotor speed. The data were then analyzed using the Origin software package provided by Beckman. The program Sednterp (28Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) was used to calculate the partial specific volumes and solvent densities of both proteins based on their amino acid sequences. Kinetic Data Analysis—The initial velocity versus substrate concentration data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain kcat and Km values for Src. The production of phospho-Src in the rapid quench flow experiments was fitted to Equation 1, [P]=α[1-exp(-kbt)]+Lt(Eq. 1) where [P] is the concentration of phospho-Src, α is the amplitude of the “burst” phase, kb is the burst phase rate constant, L is the linear rate, and t is time. The Src dependence on the burst phase amplitude was analyzed using Equation 2, α=αmax([S][S]+Km)2(Eq. 2) where αmax is the maximum burst amplitude at infinite Src concentration, and [S] is the total concentration of Src. Equations 1 and 2 were taken from a previous report (29Grant B.D. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2022-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The stopped-flow fluorescence data were fitted to either single or double exponential functions. Phosphoryl Transfer Step Is Fast—The phosphorylation kinetics of Src were monitored using rapid quench flow mixing and a radioactive-based assay. In these experiments, Csk, preequilibrated with [32P]ATP, is mixed with Src, the reaction is mechanically stopped at discrete times with acetic acid, and 32P-Src is measured using scintillation counting. Using 2 μm Csk and 10 μm Src, the production of 32P-Src follows a biphasic time course over the first 5 s (Fig. 1A). The exponential burst phase corresponds to the fast incorporation of 32P into Src in the first enzyme turnover (∼300 ms), whereas the linear phase corresponds to the slower phosphorylation of Src under multiturnover, steady-state conditions. The data were fitted to Equation 1 to obtain the burst phase rate constant (kb) of 8 s-1 and the linear, steady-state phase rate (L) of 0.2 μm/s. The amplitude of the burst phase under these conditions represents 50% of the total enzyme concentration (α = 1 μm), implying that Src binds only a portion of the available active sites in the first turnover. These data indicate that the phosphoryl transfer step is fast and does not limit Src turnover. Active Site Titration of Csk—The burst phase amplitude for Src phosphorylation does not reflect all of the available active sites in solution under our assay conditions (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this reflects some unproductive enzyme or an inability to saturate the active site, we measured the burst amplitude as a function of Src concentration (5-40 μm) at a fixed concentration of Csk (0.5 μm) over a time frame of 0.5-5 s in the rapid quench flow apparatus (Fig. 1B). To achieve accurate measures of the burst amplitude, we focused on attaining data on in the linear phase. Both the linear rates and amplitudes normalized to the total Csk concentration were then plotted as a function of total Src concentration. The linear rates were fitted to a hyperbolic function to obtain kcat and Km values of 0.15 s-1 and 4 μm. To verify these measurements, Csk (100 nm) and varying Src (2-20 μm) were allowed to react for 60 s in manual mixing experiments to obtain v versus [S] plots with kcat and Km values of 0.12 s-1 and 5 μm, respectively (data not shown). The burst amplitudes were fitted to Equation 2 to obtain a maximum, normalized amplitude (α/[E]) of 0.95 ± 0.05. The fitting of the data also provides an estimate of Km for Src (4 μm), which is similar to the value of this parameter measured by both manual and rapid quench flow mixing. The Km can be measured in the pre-steady-state phase using Equation 2, because we showed previously that Src exchanges rapidly with the active site of Csk (26Lieser S.A. Shindler C. Aubol B.E. Lee S. Sun G. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7769-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Overall, these data imply that a minimum of 90% of the Csk active sites are viable and can bind and phosphorylate Src. Phosphorylation Dependence on Complex Formation—In prior studies we showed that mixing stoichiometric amounts of Src and Csk resulted in an equilibrium sedimentation curve reflecting the average monomer molecular mass of the two individual proteins (∼56 kDa), suggesting that a stable complex of Csk and Src does not form appreciably near the Km (26Lieser S.A. Shindler C. Aubol B.E. Lee S. Sun G. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7769-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine whether phospho-Src might bind with higher affinity to Csk and thus provide a means of limiting Src turnover, we incubated an equimolar Csk and Src (3 μm) in the presence of ATP or AMPPNP (50 μm) and then subjected both samples to sedimentation in an analytical ultracentrifuge (Fig. 2A). In the presence of AMPPNP, the fitted molecular mass for the mixture was consistent with the average mass of the two proteins (58 kDa). In control experiments with the free proteins, the molecular masses of Csk and Src are 54 and 62 kDa (data not shown), values consistent with prior reports (26Lieser S.A. Shindler C. Aubol B.E. Lee S. Sun G. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7769-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The sample with ATP was largely indistinguishable from the sample containing AMPNP, implying that phosphorylation does not noticeably improve the affinity of Src under these conditions. If a stable complex were to form under these conditions, we anticipate a sedimentation curve similar to that represented by the dotted lines (116 kDa) in Fig. 2A. Because the extinction coefficients of Src and Csk are equivalent (26Lieser S.A. Shindler C. Aubol B.E. Lee S. Sun G. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7769-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), both proteins contribute equally to the sedimentation curve in Fig. 2A. Furthermore, because the molecular masses of Csk and Src are similar, the Csk-Src mixture can be treated as an approximate monomer-dimer equilibrium whose analysis then sets a lower limit of 100 μm on the Kd for the complex. Because this estimate also applies to the mixture of Csk and phospho-Src, the data indicate that both proteins interact poorly regardless of phosphorylation state. Inhibition with Phospho-Src—To provide further evidence for weak protein-protein interactions, we next investigated the binding affinity of phospho-Src under catalytic conditions. We synthesized and purified phospho-Src and then determined whether this product could inhibit the steady-state phosphorylation reaction (Fig. 2B). Increasing the concentration of phospho-Src up to 8 μm at a constant amount of Src (5 μm) had no impact on the phosphorylation reaction (Fig. 2B). In this assay, less than 10% of the total Src is phosphorylated after a 1-min reaction time so that the band intensities can be used to determine initial velocities. In control experiments where Src was removed from the reaction, no radiolabeled phospho-Src was generated, confirming that none of the labeled phospho-Src in the autoradiograms resulted from impurities in the phospho-Src preparation. If 8 μm phospho-Src does not lower the initial velocity by more than 5%, the error limits for this assay, a KI of ∼90 μm for the product can be estimated. These findings corroborate the sedimentation data and indicate that phospho-Src binds weakly to Csk with a lower limit of ∼90 μm for the KI. Association Kinetics of Csk and Src—Because phospho-Src binds poorly according to the above data, and ADP is not ratelimiting based on previous work (26Lieser S.A. Shindler C. Aubol B.E. Lee S. Sun G. Adams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7769-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we next wondered whether a conformational change in Csk could limit turnover. To address this possibility, the association kinetics of Csk and Src were monitored using a stopped-flow fluorimeter. We found that mixing Csk with varying Src led to a biphasic increase in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3A). The rate constant for the initial fast phase (k1) increases as a function of Src concentration consistent with a simple bimolecular association event. The apparent association (kon) and dissociation rate constants (koff) can be estimated from a plot of observed rate versus Src concentration (30Johnson K.A. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. XX. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1992: 2-61Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). The slope and intercept values of this plot provide kon and koff values of 0.9 μm-1 s-1 and 7 s-1, respectively. The ratio of koff and kon, termed the “kinetic” Kd (koff/kon), is 7.8 ± 2.0 μm, a value much lower than the estimates of the overall Kd (∼100 μm) from equilibrium binding data (Fig. 2). The amplitude for the fast phase varies linearly up to 20 μm Src, the maximum concentration attained in this study. In comparison, the slower phase of this reaction (k2) did not vary significantly over this concentration range. The average rate constant for the slow phase is 0.8 s-1. The overall association kinetics suggest that Src and Csk initially interact rapidly, but a slow conformational change may limit the complete formation of the complex. Changes in Tryptophan Fluorescence Accompany Src Phosphorylation—Because Src is a fluorescent protein that undergoes a large conformational change upon phosphorylation, we wondered whether the Csk reaction could be monitored if the spectral properties of the substrate and phosphoproduct are sufficiently different. To accomplish this, Csk was used to phosphorylate Src in the stopped-flow fluorimeter, and changes in tryptophan emission were collected. In Fig. 4A, Src and Csk in one syringe were mixed with ATP from the second syringe. Using 2 μm Csk, 10 μm Src, and 50 μm ATP, a single exponential fluorescence decrease was observed. Removing ATP or replacing it with ADP resulted in no significant changes in fluorescence beyond a small linear decrease of only 0.3 mV/min most likely because of photobleaching (Fig. 4A). It has been shown previously that the Kd for ADP is 3 μm, indicating that the absence of a fluorescence change in the presence of ADP is not the result of poor binding affinity (31Wong L. Lieser S.A. Miyashita O. Miller M. Tasken K. Onuchic J.N. Adams J.A. Woods Jr., V.L. Jennings P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Omitting either Csk or Src led to no significant changes in fluorescence emission upon mixing with ATP (data not shown), indicating that nucleotide binding to either protein does not cause fluorescence changes on the time frame observed with both proteins. Together, these data suggest that the observed changes in tryptophan fluorescence are associated with an ATP-dependent process requiring both Csk and Src. Fluorescence Changes in Src upon Phosphorylation—To determine the source of the fluorescence change in the phosphorylation reaction, progress curves were repeated using varying concentrations of both proteins. Halving the Csk concentration in Fig. 4A (2 to 1 μm) at constant Src (10 μm) had no effect on the overall amplitude of the reaction (∼20 mV), although the rate constant for the approach to equilibrium decreased. To determine whether Src fluorescence quenching could be the source of the observed changes, the enzyme reaction was performed at varying amounts of Src at fixed Csk. Using low Csk concentrations (0.5 μm), changes in reaction amplitude varied in proportion to the total amount of Src (Fig. 4B). At 2, 5, and 10 μm Src, fluorescence amplitudes of 5, 11 and 20 mV, respectively, were obtained. Thus, unlike Csk, a direct proportional relationship between total Src and fluorescence change was obtained (∼2 mV/μm Src). These data suggest that the phosphorylation of Src by Csk results in quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in Src. Fluorescence Burst in Phospho-Src Production—Because steady-state production of phospho-Src could be readily monitored using catalytic amounts of Csk (Fig. 4), we wondered whether we could also detect product formation in the first enzyme turnover in the stopped-flow instrument. To accomplish this, high Csk concentrations were used (2.5-7.5 μm) at constant Src (10 μm) and ATP (50 μm) concentrations. As shown in Fig. 5A, a fluorescence burst phase was detected prior to a slower linear phase over the first2softhe reaction. The burst rate constants for these transients (8-10 s-1) are similar in value to that obtained using 32P detection in the rapid quench flow apparatus (Fig. 1A). Replacing ATP with ADP led to no significant changes in fluorescence over this time frame, indicating that the burst phase is ATP-dependent. Although the burst rate constant does not vary significantly, both the amplitudes and linear rates increase with increasing Csk concentrations. These fluorescence changes were converted to product concentrations using the total fluorescence change (Fig. 5B) and initial Src concentration. With this conversion, linear concentration-dependent relationships were determined (Fig. 5C). Using 10 μm Src, a rate constant of 0.16 s-1 for the linear steady-state phase was determined, a value consistent with th"
https://openalex.org/W2080198224,"cAMP signaling is postulated to play a role in distal lung epithelial differentiation based on several observations. First, it enhances fibroblast growth factor-induced transdifferentiation of early tracheal epithelium into respiratory epithelium. Second, there are cAMP-responsive elements in the heterologous promoters of Sftpb and Sftpa genes. Third, cAMP augments the effect of dexamethasone in maintaining differentiation of human fetal type II pneumocyte culture. However, this concept has not been thoroughly tested in vivo. In the current study, we modulated cAMP signaling in developing distal lung epithelium in vivo using an inducible transgenic system that expressed a mutant form of Gαs (GαsQ227L). We failed to demonstrate the ability of cAMP to promote distal epithelial maturation during embryonic stages. The results argue against its physiological role in this process. In addition, induction of cAMP signaling at the late pseudoglandular stage but not during the canalicular or saccular stage surprisingly delayed distal differentiation by suppressing the expression of Sftpc, Sftpa, and Aquaporin5 as well as the formation of lamellar bodies. This stage-specific inhibitory effect was observed in the absence of cellular toxicity or changes in branching. Transgenic lungs did not show significant changes in the known pathways that are important for distal differentiation. Therefore, we propose the existence of yet-to-be identified cAMP-sensitive novel regulators of early distal lung epithelial differentiation. Although the delay of differentiation seemed to be reversible at later stages, it still led to pronounced permanent postnatal airspace enlargement due to impaired paracrine function of distal epithelium in regulating alveolar myofibroblast development. cAMP signaling is postulated to play a role in distal lung epithelial differentiation based on several observations.

Development of the murine lung is initiated at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), 2The abbreviations used are: En, embryonic day n;Pn, postnatal day n; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; SP, surfactant-associated protein; EM, electron microscopy; RT, reverse transcription; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; α-SMA, smooth muscle α-actin. 2The abbreviations used are: En, embryonic day n;Pn, postnatal day n; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; SP, surfactant-associated protein; EM, electron microscopy; RT, reverse transcription; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; α-SMA, smooth muscle α-actin. followed by the pseudoglandular (E10.5-16.5), canalicular (E16.5-17.5), saccular (E17.5-P5), and alveolar stages (P5-35) (1Ten Have-Opbroek A.A. Exp. Lung Res. 1991; 17: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Three morphogenic events at the pseudoglandular stage are important for distal lung epithelial development. First, through branching morphogenesis, the lung primordium evolves into an extensive network of tubular epithelium composed of eight generations of branches. This process requires a complex interaction between several signaling molecules, such as FGF10 (fibroblast growth factor 10), SHH (sonic hedgehog), and BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) (2Warburton D. Schwarz M. Tefft D. Flores-Delgado G. Anderson K.D. Cardoso W.V. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 55-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 6Chuang P.T. McMahon A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 86-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Second, distal-proximal polarity of the branching epithelial tree is established at the same time that branching takes place. As early as E10.5-11.5, the expression of many genes is spatially restricted to the distal end of the branches. Shh, Wnt7b, Id2, thrombospondin, transforming growth factor-β2, Etv5/Pea3, and Bmp4 are among the genes showing this pattern of expression (7Liu Y. Hogan B.L. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2002; 2: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Distal fate specification requires the BMP4, FGFs, and β-catenin pathways. Mice deficient in either the BMP4 or β-catenin pathways showed complete transformation of distal epithelium into proximal epithelium with little sign of type I or type II alveolar cell development (8Weaver M. Yingling J.M. Dunn N.R. Bellusci S. Hogan B.L. Development. 1999; 126: 4005-4015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mucenski M.L. Wert S.E. Nation J.M. Loudy D.E. Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Morrisey E.E. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40231-40238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Recently published data suggest that β-catenin achieves this function by acting as a transcriptional factor downstream of Wnt signaling (10Shu W. Guttentag S. Wang Z. Andl T. Ballard P. Lu M.M. Piccolo S. Birchmeier W. Whitsett J.A. Millar S.E. Morrisey E.E. Dev. Biol. 2005; 283: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). FGF10 and FGF7 expressed in the distal mesenchyme are also proposed to regulate distal fate, because in a mesenchyme-free tracheal transdifferentiation assay, FGFs are the most potent distalizing signals (11Shannon J.M. Gebb S.A. Nielsen L.D. Development. 1999; 126: 1675-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The third event in distal lung epithelial development is the initiation of differentiation of epithelial cells at the end of the pseudoglandular stage. At E12.5, the distal epithelium starts to express differentiation-associated genes, such as Sftpc. At E13, glycogen accumulation (which is required for synthesis of phospholipids, a key component of surfactant) is evident in the distal epithelium (12Alescio T. Dani A.M. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 155-162PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of surfactant-associated protein A (SP-A), another differentiation marker of type II cells, is initiated distally 2 days later at E15.5. In addition, early events in lamellar body biosynthesis, a key feature of type II cell differentiation, are activated between E15.5 and E16.5. At E15.5, multivesicle bodies (the precursors of lamellar bodies) can be visualized under electron microscopy (EM). At E16-16.5, immature lamellar bodies are present in the distal cells (13Stahlman M.T. Gray M.P. Falconieri M.W. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the genetic regulation of the initiation phase of distal epithelial differentiation, since most transgenic models with distal differentiation defects manifested their phenotype at the canalicular or early saccular stage. However, one study did indicate roles for transcription factors Foxa1 and Foxa2 in this early phase of differentiation (14Wan H. Dingle S. Xu Y. Besnard V. Kaestner K.H. Ang S.L. Wert S. Stahlman M.T. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13809-13816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Differentiation of distal epithelium is accelerated at the canalicular and saccular stages. During E17 and E18, Sftpc and Sftpa mRNA expression is increased severalfold, more mature lamellar bodies are generated in type II cells, and the processing of pro-SP-C and pro-SP-B is also greatly increased (13Stahlman M.T. Gray M.P. Falconieri M.W. Whitsett J.A. Weaver T.E. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Type I cells start to emerge at E17.5 and can be identified by expression of aquaporin 5, a type I cell-specific water channel. Type I and Type II cell differentiation at these stages requires the function of transcription factors TTF-1 (15DeFelice M. Silberschmidt D. DiLauro R. Xu Y. Wert S.E. Weaver T.E. Bachurski C.J.

Gebb S.A. Nielsen L.D. Development. 1999; 126: 1675-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pharmacologic activation of cAMP synthesis also enhances the differentiated phenotype in human embryonic type II cell primary culture (23Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J.F. Margraf L.R. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Bates S.R. Gonzales L.W. Tao J.Q. Rueckert P. Ballard P.L. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L267-L276PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the heterologous Sftpa and Sftpb promoters can be activated by cAMP signaling in vitro (25Li J. Gao E. Mendelson C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4592-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Yan C. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The current study examined the effect of cAMP on distal lung development using two novel approaches. Ex vitro we used lung bud organ culture. In vivo we generated a transgenic line that promotes cAMP production in the distal lung epithelium in a doxycycline-controlled fashion. Surprisingly, we consistently observed both in vivo and ex vivo the suppression of early distal differentiation by cAMP. However, at later stages, cAMP production had no significant influence on distal epithelial gene expression in vivo. In addition, the temporally restricted inhibition of distal epithelial differentiation and lack of detectable changes in known epithelial regulators of distal lung development suggest novel regulators at the late pseudoglandular stage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLung Bud Culture—Swiss Webster mice (Jackson Laboratory, ME) were set up for timed mating. On the day when a vaginal plug was identified, the embryos were considered 0.5 days old. Lung buds were microdissected from E11.5 embryos and cultured in Costar Transwells (Corning Glass). The growth medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and antibiotics. Medium was placed only at the bottom of the wells so that organ cultures could be maintained at the air-liquid interface. After an initial growth of 12 h in regular medium, tissues were transferred to fresh medium that contained various treatment reagents and allowed to grow for up to 5 days. Each treatment group included three lung buds. For Northern blot analysis each RNA sample was generated from pooled lysate of three lung buds in the same experimental group.Transgenic Mice—Using a PCR-based method, the Q227L point mutation was engineered in the IMAGE clone 3154475 (purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA)), which carries a full-length mouse Gαs cDNA. This mutation was first introduced into a 280-base pair EcoRI-BamHI PCR fragment with forward primer cccacctgaattctatga and reverse primer actggatccacttgcggcgctcatcgcgcaggccgcccacatcga (the single base substitution is shown in boldface type on the reverse primer). The wild type EcoRI-BamHI fragment on the IMAGE clone 3154475 was then replaced with this PCR fragment to generate a full-length mutant cDNA. In the second step, an NheI-SspI IRES-EGFP cassette from pIRES-EGFP vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was cloned into a modified pTRE2 vector (Clontech) between the NheI and EcoRV sites. The resulting vector is called pTRE2-IRES/EGFP. Then, in the last step, an EcoRI-ClaI GsαQ227L cDNA fragment was ligated into the pTRE2-IRES/EGFP vector. The resulting transgene was then released from the vector as a 3.5-kb NotI fragment, purified, and microinjected for transgenic animal production.The tetO-GαsQ227L transgenic line was generated in a C3HxC57/BL6 hybrid background. The previously published hSPC-rtTA transgenic line was in an FVB/N background (27Tichelaar J.W. Lu W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). After both hSPC-rtTA and tetO-GαsQ227L transgenes were bred into the C57/BL6 background for four generations, two transgenic lines were crossed to generate double transgenic hSPC-rtTA+/-, Gαs Q227L+/+ mice and single transgenic Gαs Q227L+/+ mice. Matings were then set up between these two groups of mice to produce timed pregnancy. Genotyping of hSPC-rtTA trasngene was performed as previously described (27Tichelaar J.W. Lu W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The tetO-GαsQ227L transgene was identified through PCR detection of GFP coding sequence using forward primer cgtaaacggccacaagttcag and reverse primer atgccgttcttctgcttgtcg. For transgene induction, 1 mg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) and 5% sucrose was added to the drinking water.In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed with a simplified version of a previously published protocol (28Xu J. Liu Z. Ornitz D.M. Development. 2000; 127: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IMAGE clone 1278132 (GenBank™ accession number AA882457) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was used as the template for generating the digoxigenin-labeled SP-C probe. Probe synthesis was performed with digoxigenin RNA labeling mix from Roche Applied Science. Slides were processed as previously published and hybridized at 62 °C with 1.6 mg/ml probe in a buffer that consists 50% formamide, 5× SSC, and 40 mg/ml herring sperm DNA. After 16-20 h of incubation, slides were washed twice in 2× SSC for 15 min each at room temperature, followed by a wash in 2× SSC at 60 °C for 1 h and a wash in 0.2× SSC for 30 min at 60 °C and incubated with an alkaline phosphotase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science). SP-C-expressing cells were visualized with alkaline phosphotase substrates nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.Real Time RT-PCR—cDNA was synthesized with Amersham Biosciences RT-PCR beads. Real time RT-PCRs were carried out on a GeneAmp system 9600 with a GeneAmp 5700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). PCR products were quantified by the amount of binding and fluorescence emission of SYBR green dye. Expression level was calculated with the formula 2(Ctcyclophilin - Ctgene X) × 100, as published previously. The expression of the gene of interest is normalized with that of the housekeeping gene Ppia (cyclophilin), which was defined as 100 arbitrary expression units (29Xu J. Tian J. Shapiro S.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).

Immunostaining of PDGFRα and CC-10 was performed with the avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase method (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as the chromogenic substrate. Immunostaining of phospho-CREB was performed with the tyramide signal amplification biotin system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) also using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as the substrate. Antibody against phospho-CREB was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies against PDGFRα and CC-10 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunostaining of α-SMA was performed with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Sigma) using Vector Red as the substrate (Vector Laboratories). A terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay was performed with an Apoptag®Plus peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Anti-BrdUrd immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (28Xu J. Liu Z. Ornitz D.M. Development. 2000; 127: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BrdUrd incorporation into embryonic lungs was achieved via intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg BrdUrd into pregnant females 1 h 20 min before harvesting the embryos. In all of the above procedures, slides were counterstained with methyl green.Western Blot Analysis—E15.5 lungs were homogenized in a buffer that contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and a complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For further protein extraction, the homogenates were supplemented with 1% Trition X-100 and rocked at room temperature for 1 h. Insoluble fractions were then removed by a 15-min centrifugation at 13,000 × g. The resulting protein lysates were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon™ membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). After incubation of the membrane with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by chemiluminescent substrates (Amersham Biosciences), the target proteins were visualized by x-ray autoradiograph. Anti-phospho-CREB, anti-CREB, and anti-phospo-Smad1/5/8 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-α-tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma.Transmission Electron Microscopy—Accessory lobes from E17 lungs were first fixed in Karnovsky's solution and then postfixed in osmium tetroxide. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Lamellar bodies were monitored under JEOL 1200EX transmission EM at the Harvard Cell Biology Core facility for EM analysis.Morphometry—Adult mouse lungs were inflated with 10% formalin through an intratracheal catheter under a pressure of 25 cm H2O. After 48 h of fixation in 10% formalin at room temperature, lungs were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin. Midsagittal 5-μm lung sections stained with Gill's hematoxylin were used to calculate the cord length (CL) as previously described (30Houghton A.M. Quintero P.A. Perkins D.L. Kobayashi D.K. Kelley D.G. Marconcini L.A. Mecham R.P. Senior R.M. Shapiro S.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). 10 randomly selected ×200 fields per slide were photographed using MetaMorph image analysis software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). The images were analyzed using the Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Airway and vascular structures were excluded from the analysis. For alveolar septation analysis, postnatal day 7 lungs were inflated with 100 μl of 10% formalin and then processed, embedded, and sectioned the same as described above. Midsagittal 5-μm lung sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin were photographed to obtain random ×400 high power images. 15 such images from each lung were used to calculate the number of septa per field. For branching analysis, the number of distal epithelial tubules was quantified with ×100 high power images collected from hematoxylin/eosin-stained midsagittal sections from the left lobes of E15.5 or E16.5 lungs; three sections were used for each lung.RESULTSLung Bud Culture—We first examined the effect of cAMP on lung development using an in vitro lung bud organ culture system. Timed matings were set up as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When embryos were 11.5 days old, lung buds were microdissected and cultured on microporous membranes at an air-liquid interface in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The explants continued to branch for up to 5 days. They not only recapitulated branching morphogenesis in culture but also demonstrated time-dependent maturation of many features of distal differentiation. For example, SP-B was expressed only in either the propeptide form or the partially processed form on days 1 and 2 by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The completely processed mature form was not evident until days 3 and 4, and it became much more abundant at day 5 (data not shown). After the initial 12 h of culture in regular medium, lung buds were transferred to fresh medium supplemented with either vehicle (Me2SO) or 5 μm forskolin and 5 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Forskolin directly activates adenylyl cyclases, whereas IBMX inhibits all of the phosphodiesterases that can degrade cAMP. The combination of these two reagents has been used routinely to achieve sustained intracellular cAMP signaling (31Hoang T. Fenne I.S. Cook C. Borud B. Bakke M. Lien E.A. Mellgren G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2006; 26: 3039-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Foskolin and IBMX had at least four effects on lung bud culture. First, forskolin and IBMX exposure induced distal epithelial dilation (Fig. 1B, black arrows) compared with the vehicle control group (Fig. 1A). Second, after 3 days of culture, forskolin and IBMX significantly decreased the number of branches in the treatment groups (Fig. 1C), which was 43.7 ± 3.19 (n = 3) compared with 58.7 ± 3.1 (n = 3) in the control group (p = 0.004). Third, these two agents induced thinning of the mesenchyme, which was often evident on a whole mount image (Fig. 1B, red arrows). Histological analysis of the midtransverse sections (Fig. 1, D and E) of these lung buds showed that these two agents reduced the mesenchymal to epithelial cell ratio (Fig. 1F), which was 1.32 ± 0.08 in the treatment group (n = 3) compared with 2.08 ± 0.05 in the control group (n = 3) (p < 0.001), suggesting an effect of cAMP-elevating agents on mesenchyme development. Last, Northern blot analysis of RNA samples isolated from lung buds showed a dramatic decrease in Sftpc expression in the forskolin- and IBMX-treated group after 2 or 3 days in culture (Fig. 1C). However, we observed that this suppression was gradually reversed after prolonged exposure (4-5 days), suggesting that this effect is stage-specific. The delayed onset of Sftpc expression was an unexpected observation, challenging a positive role of cAMP in promoting distal epithelial differentiation during development. To address the in vivo relevance of these findings, we designed a transgenic model to examine the role of cAMP signaling in lung epithelial development in vivo. Although we chose to focus on the effect of cAMP signaling on epithelial differentiation in the rest of this study, there are ongoing efforts investigating its effects on branching morphogenesis and lung mesenchyme development.Generation of gαsQ227L Transgenic Mice—To achieve ectopic cAMP synthesis in vivo, we expressed a constitutively active mutant form of Gαs, which carries a glutamine-to-leucine substitution (GαsQ227L) and was initially identified as a somatic mutation in patients with pituitary or thyroid adenomas (33Lania A. Mantovani G. Spada A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 145: 543-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because this mutation disrupts GTPase activity, GαsQ227L stimulates adenylyl cyclases constitutively in the absence of receptor ligation (Fig. 2A). To avoid unwanted negative effects of prolonged constitutive expression, we employed a bitransgenic system that is pharmacologically regulated by either tetracylcine or its analog doxycycline. Similar transgenic systems have been used in several studies to modulate in vivo gene function in the murine lung (9Mucenski M.L. Wert S.E. Nation J.M. Loudy D.E. Huelsken J. Birchmeier W.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B schematically illustrates this system. In short, the gαsQ227L transgene is under the control of a cytomegalovirus minimum promoter that harbors seven tetO sites, serving as cis-binding elements for the heterologous transcription factor rtTA, which is expressed from a separate line of transgene that is driven by the 3.7-kb human surfactant-associated protein C promoter, as published previously (27Tichelaar J.W. Lu W. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11858-11864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because binding of rtTA to tetO requires tetracycline or its analog doxycycline, the GαsQ227L transgene is expected to be inactive until the animals are exposed to doxycycline.FIGURE 2Lung-specific, inducible, constitutively active Gαs transgenic mice.

https://openalex.org/W2081290812,"Tyrosine kinases, which are important regulators of intracellular signal-transduction pathways, have mutated forms that are often associated with oncogenesis and are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Recently, systematic mutational analyses of tyrosine kinases revealed that a minimum of 30% of colorectal cancer contain at least one mutation in the tyrosine kinases. To further explore these mutations, we examined all reported mutations of NTRK3, FES, KDR, EPHA3, NTRK2, JAK1, PDGFRA, EPHA7, EPHA8, ERBB4, FGFR1, MLK4 and GUCY2F genes in the 24 colorectal cancer cell lines. Unexpectedly, among 24 colorectal cancer cell lines, only two cell lines (LoVo and CaR1) harbored mutation C1408T (R470C) in MLK4 gene. The mutation rate was extremely low compared to that previously reported. Therefore, we analyzed mutations in 46 colorectal cancer samples resected from the same number of Japanese patients. Surprisingly, none of the 46 samples contained any of the mutations reported. Based on our study, we advise that a more comprehensive tyrosine kinase gene mutation assay is necessary in the future."
