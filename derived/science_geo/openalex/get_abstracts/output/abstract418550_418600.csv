https://openalex.org/W1968198478,"This study tested whether nonredox metalloenzymes are commonly charged with iron in vivo and are primary targets of oxidative stress because of it. Indeed, three sample mononuclear enzymes, peptide deformylase, threonine dehydrogenase, and cytosine deaminase, were rapidly damaged by micromolar hydrogen peroxide in vitro and in live Escherichia coli. The first two enzymes use a cysteine residue to coordinate the catalytic metal atom; it was quantitatively oxidized by the radical generated by the Fenton reaction. Because oxidized cysteine can be repaired by cellular reductants, the effect was to avoid irreversible damage to other active-site residues. Nevertheless, protracted H(2)O(2) exposure gradually inactivated these enzymes, consistent with the overoxidation of the cysteine residue to sulfinic or sulfonic forms. During H(2)O(2) stress, E. coli defended all three proteins by inducing MntH, a manganese importer, and Dps, an iron-sequestration protein. These proteins appeared to collaborate in replacing the iron atom with nonoxidizable manganese. The implication is that mononuclear metalloproteins are common targets of H(2)O(2) and that both structural and metabolic arrangements exist to protect them."
https://openalex.org/W2051741744,"Background Comparative genomics, or the study of the relationships of genome structure and function across different species, offers a powerful tool for studying evolution, annotating genomes, and understanding the causes of various genetic disorders. However, aligning multiple sequences of DNA, an essential intermediate step for most types of analyses, is a difficult computational task. In parallel, citizen science, an approach that takes advantage of the fact that the human brain is exquisitely tuned to solving specific types of problems, is becoming increasingly popular. There, instances of hard computational problems are dispatched to a crowd of non-expert human game players and solutions are sent back to a central server. Methodology/Principal Findings We introduce Phylo, a human-based computing framework applying “crowd sourcing” techniques to solve the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem. The key idea of Phylo is to convert the MSA problem into a casual game that can be played by ordinary web users with a minimal prior knowledge of the biological context. We applied this strategy to improve the alignment of the promoters of disease-related genes from up to 44 vertebrate species. Since the launch in November 2010, we received more than 350,000 solutions submitted from more than 12,000 registered users. Our results show that solutions submitted contributed to improving the accuracy of up to 70% of the alignment blocks considered. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that, combined with classical algorithms, crowd computing techniques can be successfully used to help improving the accuracy of MSA. More importantly, we show that an NP-hard computational problem can be embedded in casual game that can be easily played by people without significant scientific training. This suggests that citizen science approaches can be used to exploit the billions of “human-brain peta-flops” of computation that are spent every day playing games. Phylo is available at: http://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca."
https://openalex.org/W2071573974,"Lipotoxicity refers to the cytotoxic effects of excess fat accumulation in cells and has been implicated as one of the contributing factors to diseases like obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver. In this study we sought to examine effects of palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid, two of the common dietary fatty acids on the autophagic process. We found that PA, but not oleic acid, was able to cause an increase in autophagic flux, evidenced by LC3-II accumulation and formation of GFP-LC3 puncta. Notably, PA-induced autophagy was found to be independent of mTOR regulation. Next, in search of the mechanism mediating PA-induced autophagy, we found increased levels of diacylglycerol species and protein kinase C (PKC) activation in PA-treated cells. More importantly, inhibition of classical PKC isoforms (PKC-α) was able to effectively suppress PA-induced autophagy. Finally, we showed that inhibition of autophagy sensitized the cells to PA-induced apoptosis, suggesting the pro-survival function of autophagy induced by PA. Taken together, results from this study reveal a novel mechanism underlying free fatty acid-mediated autophagy. Furthermore, the pro-survival function of autophagy suggests modulation of autophagy as a potential therapeutic strategy in protection of cells against lipotoxicity and lipid-related metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2166992661,"Background The link between histologic acute chorioamnionitis and infection is well established in preterm deliveries, but less well-studied in term pregnancies, where infection is much less common. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a secondary analysis among 195 low-risk women with term pregnancies enrolled in a randomized trial. Histologic and microbiologic evaluation of placentas included anaerobic and aerobic cultures (including mycoplasma/ureaplasma species) as well as PCR. Infection was defined as ≥1,000 cfu of a single known pathogen or a ≥2 log difference in counts for a known pathogen versus other organisms in a mixed culture. Placental membranes were scored and categorized as: no chorioamnionitis, Grade 1 (subchorionitis and patchy acute chorioamnionitis), or Grade 2 (severe, confluent chorioamnionitis). Grade 1 or grade 2 histologic chorioamnionitis was present in 34% of placentas (67/195), but infection was present in only 4% (8/195). Histologic chorioamnionitis was strongly associated with intrapartum fever >38°C [69% (25/36) fever, 26% (42/159) afebrile, P<.0001]. Fever occurred in 18% (n = 36) of women. Most febrile women [92% (33/36)] had received epidural for pain relief, though the association with fever was present with and without epidural. The association remained significant in a logistic regression controlling for potential confounders (OR = 5.8, 95% CI = 2.2,15.0). Histologic chorioamnionitis was also associated with elevated serum levels of interleukin-8 (median = 1.3 pg/mL no histologic chorioamnionitis, 1.5 pg/mL Grade 1, 2.1 pg/mL Grade 2, P = 0.05) and interleukin-6 (median levels = 2.2 pg/mL no chorioamnionitis, 5.3 pg/mL Grade 1, 24.5 pg/mL Grade 2, P = 0.02) at admission for delivery as well as higher admission WBC counts (mean = 12,000cells/mm3 no chorioamnionitis, 13,400cells/mm3 Grade 1, 15,700cells/mm3 Grade 2, P = 0.0005). Conclusion/Significance Our results suggest histologic chorioamnionitis at term most often results from a noninfectious inflammatory process. It was strongly associated with fever, most of which was related to epidural used for pain relief. A more ‘activated’ maternal immune system at admission was also associated with histologic chorioamnionitis."
https://openalex.org/W2169816885,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of malignant cancers. However, approximately 80% of patients undergoing 5-FU treatment suffer from gastrointestinal mucositis. The aim of this report was to identify the drug target for the 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis was established by intraperitoneally administering mice with 100 mg/kg 5-FU. Network analysis of gene expression profile and bioluminescent imaging were applied to identify the critical molecule associated with 5-FU-induced mucositis. Our data showed that 5-FU induced inflammation in the small intestine, characterized by the increased intestinal wall thickness and crypt length, the decreased villus height, and the increased myeloperoxidase activity in tissues and proinflammatory cytokine production in sera. Network analysis of 5-FU-affected genes by transcriptomic tool showed that the expression of genes was regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and NF-κB was the central molecule in the 5-FU-regulated biological network. NF-κB activity was activated by 5-FU in the intestine, which was judged by in vivo bioluminescence imaging and immunohistochemical staining. However, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) inhibited 5-FU-induced NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, 5-FU-induced histological changes were improved by 5-ASA. In conclusion, our findings suggested that NF-κB was the critical molecule associated with the pathogenesis of 5-FU-induced mucositis, and inhibition of NF-κB activity ameliorated the mucosal damage caused by 5-FU."
https://openalex.org/W2015614886,"Haematopoietic progenitor activity in the Drosophila lymph gland can respond to stress. Banerjee and colleagues show that systemic insulin and nutritional signals maintain these progenitors by modulating Wingless-dependent pathways. The Drosophila lymph gland is a haematopoietic organ in which progenitor cells, which are most akin to the common myeloid progenitor in mammals, proliferate and differentiate into three types of mature cell—plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes—the functions of which are reminiscent of mammalian myeloid cells1. During the first and early second instars of larval development, the lymph gland contains only progenitors, whereas in the third instar, a medial region of the primary lobe of the lymph gland called the medullary zone contains these progenitors2, and maturing blood cells are found juxtaposed in a peripheral region designated the cortical zone2. A third group of cells referred to as the posterior signalling centre functions as a haematopoietic niche3,4. Similarly to mammalian myeloid cells, Drosophila blood cells respond to multiple stresses including hypoxia, infection and oxidative stress5,6,7. However, how systemic signals are sensed by myeloid progenitors to regulate cell-fate determination has not been well described. Here, we show that the haematopoietic progenitors of Drosophila are direct targets of systemic (insulin) and nutritional (essential amino acid) signals, and that these systemic signals maintain the progenitors by promoting Wingless (WNT in mammals) signalling. We expect that this study will promote investigation of such possible direct signal sensing mechanisms by mammalian myeloid progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W1990134250,"Deregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl has been implicated in the progression of several human cancers. However, the role of Axl in prostate cancer remains poorly understood, and the therapeutic efficacy of Axl targeting remains untested. In this report we identified Axl as a new therapeutic target for prostate cancer. Axl is consistently overexpressed in prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate tumors. Interestingly, the blockage of Axl gene expression strongly inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth. Furthermore, inhibition of Axl expression by small interfering RNA regulates a transcriptional program of genes involved in cell survival, strikingly all connected to the nuclear factor-κB pathway. Additionally, blockage of Axl expression leads to inhibition of Akt, IKKα and IκBα phosphorylation, increasing IκBα expression and stability. Furthermore, induction of Akt phosphorylation by insulin-like growth factor 1 in Axl knockdown cells restores Akt activity and proliferation. Taken together, our results establish an unambiguous role for Axl in prostate cancer tumorigenesis with implications for prostate cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2098208011,"Resveratrol, a phytochemical found in various plants and Chinese herbs, is associated with multiple tumor-suppressing activities, has been tested in clinical trials. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in resveratrol-mediated tumor suppressing activities are not yet completely defined. Here, we showed that treatment with resveratrol inhibited cell mobility through induction of the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) in lung cancer cells. We also found that downregulation of FOXC2 (forkhead box C2) is critical for resveratrol-mediated suppression of tumor metastasis in an in vitro and in vivo models. We also identified a signal cascade, namely, resveratrol—∣miRNA-520h—∣PP2A/C—∣Akt → NF-κB → FOXC2, in which resveratrol inhibited the expression of FOXC2 through regulation of miRNA-520h-mediated signal cascade. This study identified a new miRNA-520h-related signal cascade involved in resveratrol-mediated tumor suppression activity and provide the clinical significances of miR-520h, PP2A/C and FOXC2 in lung cancer patients. Our results indicated a functional link between resveratrol-mediated miRNA-520h regulation and tumor suppressing ability, and provide a new insight into the role of resveratrol-induced molecular and epigenetic regulations in tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2092691640,"Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) has become one of the most promising modalities for a practical noninvasive BCI system. Owing to both the limitation of refresh rate of liquid crystal display (LCD) or cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, and the specific physiological response property that only a very small number of stimuli at certain frequencies could evoke strong SSVEPs, the available frequencies for SSVEP stimuli are limited. Therefore, it may not be enough to code multiple targets with the traditional frequencies coding protocols, which poses a big challenge for the design of a practical SSVEP-based BCI. This study aimed to provide an innovative coding method to tackle this problem.In this study, we present a novel protocol termed multiple frequencies sequential coding (MFSC) for SSVEP-based BCI. In MFSC, multiple frequencies are sequentially used in each cycle to code the targets. To fulfill the sequential coding, each cycle is divided into several coding epochs, and during each epoch, certain frequency is used. Obviously, different frequencies or the same frequency can be presented in the coding epochs, and the different epoch sequence corresponds to the different targets. To show the feasibility of MFSC, we used two frequencies to realize four targets and carried on an offline experiment. The current study shows that: 1) MFSC is feasible and efficient; 2) the performance of SSVEP-based BCI based on MFSC can be comparable to some existed systems.The proposed protocol could potentially implement much more targets with the limited available frequencies compared with the traditional frequencies coding protocol. The efficiency of the new protocol was confirmed by real data experiment. We propose that the SSVEP-based BCI under MFSC might be a promising choice in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2132089035,"The Hippo-Yap (Yes-associated protein) signaling pathway has emerged as one of the critical pathways regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to environmental and developmental cues. However, Yap1 roles in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) biology have not been investigated. VSMCs undergo phenotypic switch, a process characterized by decreased gene expression of VSMC contractile markers and increased proliferation, migration, and matrix synthesis. The goals of the present studies were to investigate the relationship between Yap1 and VSMC phenotypic switch and to determine the molecular mechanisms by which Yap1 affects this essential process in VSMC biology. Results demonstrated that the expression of Yap1 was rapidly up-regulated by stimulation with PDGF-BB (a known inducer of phenotypic switch in VSMCs) and in the injured vessel wall. Knockdown of Yap1 impaired VSMC proliferation in vitro and enhanced the expression of VSMC contractile genes as well by increasing serum response factor binding to CArG-containing regions of VSMC-specific contractile genes within intact chromatin. Conversely, the interaction between serum response factor and its co-activator myocardin was reduced by overexpression of Yap1 in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results indicate that down-regulation of Yap1 promotes VSMC contractile phenotype by both up-regulating myocardin expression and promoting the association of the serum response factor-myocardin complex with VSMC contractile gene promoters and suggest that the Yap1 signaling pathway is a central regulator of phenotypic switch of VSMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2065116481,"BCR-ABL transforms bone marrow progenitor cells and promotes genome instability, leading to development of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib effectively treats CML, but acquired resistance can develop because of BCR-ABL mutations. Mechanisms for acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations are not fully understood. Using a novel culture model of CML acquired resistance, we show that inhibition of SIRT1 deacetylase by small molecule inhibitors or gene knockdown blocks acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and relapse of CML cells on tyrosine kinase inhibitors. SIRT1 knockdown also suppresses de novo genetic mutations of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase gene in CML and non-CML cells upon treatment with DNA damaging agent camptothecin. Although SIRT1 can enhance cellular DNA damage response, it alters functions of DNA repair machineries in CML cells and stimulates activity of error-prone DNA damage repair, in association with acquisition of genetic mutations. These results reveal a previously unrecognized role of SIRT1 for promoting mutation acquisition in cancer, and have implication for targeting SIRT1 to overcome CML drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2018994753,"Prohibitin (PHB) is indispensable for Ras-induced Raf-1 activation, cell migration and growth; however, the exact role of PHB in the molecular pathogenesis of cancer metastasis remains largely unexamined. Here, we found a positive correlation between plasma membrane-associated PHB and the clinical stages of cancer. The level of PHB phosphorylated at threonine 258 (T258) and tyrosine 259 (Y259) in human cancer-cell membranes correlated with the invasiveness of cancer cells. Overexpression of phosphorylated PHB (phospho-PHB) in the lipid-raft domain of the cell membrane enhanced cell migration/invasion through PI3K/Akt and Raf-1/ERK activation. It also enhanced epithelial–mesenchymal transition, matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity and invasiveness of cancer cells in vitro. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that phospho-PHB associated with Raf-1, Akt and Ras in the membrane and was essential for the activation of Raf-1 signaling by Ras. Mice implanted with cancer cells stably overexpressing PHB in the plasma membrane showed enlarged cervical tumors, enhanced metastasis and shorter survival time compared with mice implanted with cancer cells without PHB overexpression. Dephosphorylation of PHB at T258 by site-directed mutagenesis diminished the in vitro and in vivo effects of PHB. These results suggest that increase in phospho-PHB T258 in the raft domain of the plasma membrane has a role in the Ras-driven activation of PI3K/Akt and Raf-1/ERK-signaling cascades and results in the promotion of cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1968928166,"To understand how cytotoxic agent-induced cancer cell death affects the immune system is of fundamental importance to stimulate immune response to counteract the high mortality due to cancer. Here we compared the immunogenicity of Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL) cell death induced by anticancer drug Bortezomib (Velcade) and Tyrphostin AG 490, a Janus Activated Kinase 2/signal trasducer and activator of transcription-3 (JAK2/STAT3) inhibitor. We show that both treatments were able to induce PEL apoptosis with similar kinetics and promote dendritic cells (DC) maturation. The surface expression of molecules involved in immune activation, namely calreticulin (CRT), heat shock proteins (HSP) 90 and 70 increased in dying cells. This was correlated with DC activation. We found that PEL cell death induced by Bortezomib was more effective in inducing uptake by DC compared to AG 490 or combination of both drugs. However the DC activation induced by all treatments was completely inhibited when these cells were pretreated with a neutralizing antiboby directed against the HSP90/70 and CRT common receptor, CD91. The activation of DC by Bortezomib and AG 490 treated PEL cells, as seen in the present study, might have important implications for a combined chemo and immunotherapy in such patients."
https://openalex.org/W2001208885,"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder predominantly caused by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2. A primary feature of the syndrome is the impaired maturation and maintenance of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system (CNS). Different RTT mouse models have shown that particular Mecp2 mutations have highly variable effects on neuronal architecture. Distinguishing MeCP2 mutant cellular phenotypes therefore demands analysis of specific mutations in well-defined neuronal subpopulations. We examined a transgenically labeled subset of cortical neurons in YFP-H mice crossed with the Mecp2(tm1.1Jae) mutant line. YFP(+) Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex of wildtype and hemizygous mutant male mice were examined for differences in dendrite morphology and spine density. Total basal dendritic length was decreased by 18.6% due to both shorter dendrites and reduced branching proximal to the soma. Tangential dendrite lengths in the apical tuft were reduced by up to 26.6%. Spine density was reduced by 47.4% in the apical tuft and 54.5% in secondary apical dendrites, but remained unaffected in primary apical and proximal basal dendrites. We also found that MeCP2 mutation reduced the number of YFP(+) cells in YFP-H mice by up to 72% in various cortical regions without affecting the intensity of YFP expression in individual cells. Our results support the view that the effects of MeCP2 mutation are highly context-dependent and cannot be generalized across mutation types and cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W1977754435,"Seamless tubes are found in Drosophila tracheal terminal cells, but it is still unclear how they grow. Ghabrial and colleagues find that the small GTPase Rab35, and its apically localized GAP, Whacked, direct tube shape and growth. They also highlight a role for dynein in this process. Seamless tubes form intracellularly without cell–cell or autocellular junctions. Such tubes have been described across phyla, but remain mysterious despite their simple architecture. In Drosophila, seamless tubes are found within tracheal terminal cells, which have dozens of branched protrusions extending hundreds of micrometres. We find that mutations in multiple components of the dynein motor complex block seamless tube growth, raising the possibility that the lumenal membrane forms through minus-end-directed transport of apical membrane components along microtubules. Growth of seamless tubes is polarized along the proximodistal axis by Rab35 and its apical membrane-localized GAP, Whacked. Strikingly, loss of whacked (or constitutive activation of Rab35) leads to tube overgrowth at terminal cell branch tips, whereas overexpression of Whacked (or dominant-negative Rab35) causes formation of ectopic tubes surrounding the terminal cell nucleus. Thus, vesicle trafficking has key roles in making and shaping seamless tubes."
https://openalex.org/W2127501662,"SUMOylation is a posttranslational modification in which a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins is conjugated to lysine residues in specific target proteins. Most known SUMOylation target proteins are located in the nucleus, but there is increasing evidence that SUMO may also be a key determinant of many extranuclear processes. Gap junctions consist of arrays of intercellular channels that provide direct transfer of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. Gap junction channels are formed by integral membrane proteins called connexins, of which the best-studied isoform is connexin 43 (Cx43). Here we show that Cx43 is posttranslationally modified by SUMOylation. The data suggest that the SUMO system regulates the Cx43 protein level and the level of functional Cx43 gap junctions at the plasma membrane. Cx43 was found to be modified by SUMO-1, -2, and -3. Evidence is provided that the membrane-proximal lysines at positions 144 and 237, located in the Cx43 intracellular loop and C-terminal tail, respectively, act as SUMO conjugation sites. Mutations of lysine 144 or lysine 237 resulted in reduced Cx43 SUMOylation and reduced Cx43 protein and gap junction levels. Altogether, these data identify Cx43 as a SUMOylation target protein and represent the first evidence that gap junctions are regulated by the SUMO system."
https://openalex.org/W2024612673,"The Warburg effect in cancer cells has been proposed to involve several mechanisms, including adaptation to hypoxia, oncogenes activation or loss of oncosuppressors and impaired mitochondrial function. In previous papers, it has been shown that K-ras transformed mouse cells are much more sensitive as compared with normal cells to glucose withdrawal (undergoing apoptosis) and present a high glycolytic rate and a strong reduction of mitochondrial complex I. Recent observations suggest that transformed cells have a derangement in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP/PKA) pathway, which is known to regulate several mitochondrial functions. Herein, the derangement of the cAMP/PKA pathway and its impact on transformation-linked changes of mitochondrial functions is investigated. Exogenous stimulation of PKA activity, achieved by forskolin treatment, protected K-ras-transformed cells from apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation, enhanced complex I activity, intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, mitochondrial fusion and decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Several of these effects were almost completely prevented by inhibiting the PKA activity. Short-time treatment with compounds favoring mitochondrial fusion strongly decreased the cellular ROS levels especially in transformed cells. These findings support the notion that glucose shortage-induced apoptosis, specific of K-ras-transformed cells, is associated to a derangement of PKA signaling that leads to mitochondrial complex I decrease, reduction of ATP formation, prevalence of mitochondrial fission over fusion, and thereby opening new approaches for development of anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2083070588,"Immortalization (senescence bypass) is a critical rate-limiting step in the malignant transformation of mammalian somatic cells. Human cells must breach at least two distinct senescence barriers to permit unfettered clonal evolution during cancer development: (1) stress- or oncogene-induced premature senescence (SIPS/OIS), mediated via the p16-Rb and/or ARF-p53-p21 tumour-suppressive pathways, and (2) replicative senescence triggered by telomere shortening. In contrast, because their telomerase is constitutively active, cells from small rodents possess only the SIPS/OIS barrier, and are therefore useful for studying SIPS/OIS bypass in isolation. Dermal fibroblasts from the Syrian hamster (SHD cells) are exceptionally resistant to spontaneous SIPS bypass, but it can be readily induced following exposure to a wide range of chemical and physical carcinogens. Here we show that a spectrum of carcinogen-specific mutational and epigenetic alterations involving the INK4A (p16), p53 and INK4B (p15) genes are associated with induced SIPS bypass. With ionizing radiation, immortalization is invariably accompanied by efficient biallelic deletion of the complete INK4/CDKN2 locus. In comparison, SHD cells immortalized by the powerful polycyclic hydrocarbon carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene display transversion point mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 coupled with INK4 alterations such as loss of expression of p15. Epimutational silencing of p16 is the primary event associated with immortalization by nickel, a human non-genotoxic carcinogen. As SIPS/OIS bypass is a prerequisite for the immortalization of normal diploid human epithelial cells, our results with the SHD model will provide a basis for delineating combinations of key molecular changes underpinning this important event in human carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2022978758,"The potential for human disease treatment using human pluripotent stem cells, including embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), also carries the risk of added genomic instability. Genomic instability is most often linked to DNA repair deficiencies, which indicates that screening/characterization of possible repair deficiencies in pluripotent human stem cells should be a necessary step prior to their clinical and research use. In this study, a comparison of DNA repair pathways in pluripotent cells, as compared to those in non-pluripotent cells, demonstrated that DNA repair capacities of pluripotent cell lines were more heterogeneous than those of differentiated lines examined and were generally greater. Although pluripotent cells had high DNA repair capacities for nucleotide excision repair, we show that ultraviolet radiation at low fluxes induced an apoptotic response in these cells, while differentiated cells lacked response to this stimulus, and note that pluripotent cells had a similar apoptotic response to alkylating agent damage. This sensitivity of pluripotent cells to damage is notable since viable pluripotent cells exhibit less ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage than do differentiated cells that receive the same flux. In addition, the importance of screening pluripotent cells for DNA repair defects was highlighted by an iPSC line that demonstrated a normal spectral karyotype, but showed both microsatellite instability and reduced DNA repair capacities in three out of four DNA repair pathways examined. Together, these results demonstrate a need to evaluate DNA repair capacities in pluripotent cell lines, in order to characterize their genomic stability, prior to their pre-clinical and clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2006278464,"Native (pre-existing) collaterals are arteriole-to-arteriole anastomoses that interconnect adjacent arterial trees and serve as endogenous bypass vessels that limit tissue injury in ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary and peripheral artery disease. Their extent (number and diameter) varies widely among mouse strains and healthy humans. We previously identified a major quantitative trait locus on chromosome 7 (Canq1, LOD = 29) responsible for 37% of the heritable variation in collateral extent between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. We sought to identify candidate genes in Canq1 responsible for collateral variation in the cerebral pial circulation, a tissue whose strain-dependent variation is shared by similar variation in other tissues.Collateral extent was intermediate in a recombinant inbred line that splits Canq1 between the C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains. Phenotyping and SNP-mapping of an expanded panel of twenty-one informative inbred strains narrowed the Canq1 locus, and genome-wide linkage analysis of a SWRxSJL-F2 cross confirmed its haplotype structure. Collateral extent, infarct volume after cerebral artery occlusion, bleeding time, and re-bleeding time did not differ in knockout mice for two vascular-related genes located in Canq1, IL4ra and Itgal. Transcript abundance of 6 out of 116 genes within the 95% confidence interval of Canq1 were differentially expressed >2-fold (p-value<0.05÷150) in the cortical pia mater from C57BL/6 and BALB/c embryos at E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5 time-points that span the period of collateral formation.These findings refine the Canq1 locus and identify several genes as high-priority candidates important in specifying native collateral formation and its wide variation."
https://openalex.org/W1984172539,"N-cadherin is a cell–cell adhesion molecule that plays a role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, we show that in vivo expression of N-cadherin in the PyMT mouse model, which enhances mammary tumor metastasis, results in selective inhibition of Akt3 expression and phosphorylation. Similarly, exogenous expression of N-cadherin in PyMT or MCF-7 mammary tumor cells enhanced cell motility and caused a dramatic reduction in Akt3 expression and phosphorylation. Moreover, knockdown of Akt3 in PyMT tumor cells increased cell motility and disrupted mammary morphogenesis, but had no effect on cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type Akt3 in PyMT-N-cadherin cells inhibited cell motility promoted by N-cadherin. Taken altogether, these findings demonstrate that N-cadherin suppresses Akt3 to promote cell motility and highlight the intricate regulation of Akt isoforms by N-cadherin during metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2088914725,"Background Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a rare developmental disorder caused by deletion of contiguous genes at 7q11.23, has been characterized by strengths in socialization (overfriendliness) and communication (excessive talkativeness). WBS has been often considered as the polar opposite behavioral phenotype to autism. Our objective was to better understand the range of phenotypic expression in WBS and the relationship between WBS and autistic disorder. Methodology The study was conducted on 9 French individuals aged from 4 to 37 years old with autistic disorder associated with WBS. Behavioral assessments were performed using Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scales. Molecular characterization of the WBS critical region was performed by FISH. Findings FISH analysis indicated that all 9 patients displayed the common WBS deletion. All 9 patients met ADI-R and ADOS diagnostic criteria for autism, displaying stereotypies and severe impairments in social interaction and communication (including the absence of expressive language). Additionally, patients showed improvement in social communication over time. Conclusions The results indicate that comorbid autism and WBS is more frequent than expected and suggest that the common WBS deletion can result in a continuum of social communication impairment, ranging from excessive talkativeness and overfriendliness to absence of verbal language and poor social relationships. Appreciation of the possible co-occurrence of WBS and autism challenges the common view that WBS represents the opposite behavioral phenotype of autism, and might lead to improved recognition of WBS in individuals diagnosed with autism."
https://openalex.org/W2011697758,"Translocases of mitochondrial inner membrane (TIMs) are multiprotein complexes. The only Tim component so far characterized in kinetoplastid parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei is Tim17 (TbTim17), which is essential for cell survival and mitochondrial protein import. Here, we report that TbTim17 is present in a protein complex of about 1,100 kDa, which is much larger than the TIM complexes found in fungi and mammals. Depletion of TbTim17 in T. brucei impairs the mitochondrial import of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, an N-terminal signal-containing protein. Pretreatment of isolated mitoplasts with the anti-TbTim17 antibody inhibited import of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, indicating a direct involvement of the TbTim17 in the import process. Purification of the TbTim17-containing protein complex from the mitochondrial membrane of T. brucei by tandem affinity chromatography revealed that TbTim17 associates with seven unique as well as a few known T. brucei mitochondrial proteins. Depletion of three of these novel proteins, i.e. TbTim47, TbTim54, and TbTim62, significantly decreased mitochondrial protein import in vitro. In vivo targeting of a newly synthesized mitochondrial matrix protein, MRP2, was also inhibited due to depletion of TbTim17, TbTim54, and TbTim62. Co-precipitation analysis confirmed the interaction of TbTim54 and TbTim62 with TbTim17 in vivo. Overall, our data reveal that TbTim17, the single homolog of Tim17/22/23 family proteins, is present in a unique TIM complex consisting of novel proteins in T. brucei and is critical for mitochondrial protein import. Translocases of mitochondrial inner membrane (TIMs) are multiprotein complexes. The only Tim component so far characterized in kinetoplastid parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei is Tim17 (TbTim17), which is essential for cell survival and mitochondrial protein import. Here, we report that TbTim17 is present in a protein complex of about 1,100 kDa, which is much larger than the TIM complexes found in fungi and mammals. Depletion of TbTim17 in T. brucei impairs the mitochondrial import of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, an N-terminal signal-containing protein. Pretreatment of isolated mitoplasts with the anti-TbTim17 antibody inhibited import of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, indicating a direct involvement of the TbTim17 in the import process. Purification of the TbTim17-containing protein complex from the mitochondrial membrane of T. brucei by tandem affinity chromatography revealed that TbTim17 associates with seven unique as well as a few known T. brucei mitochondrial proteins. Depletion of three of these novel proteins, i.e. TbTim47, TbTim54, and TbTim62, significantly decreased mitochondrial protein import in vitro. In vivo targeting of a newly synthesized mitochondrial matrix protein, MRP2, was also inhibited due to depletion of TbTim17, TbTim54, and TbTim62. Co-precipitation analysis confirmed the interaction of TbTim54 and TbTim62 with TbTim17 in vivo. Overall, our data reveal that TbTim17, the single homolog of Tim17/22/23 family proteins, is present in a unique TIM complex consisting of novel proteins in T. brucei and is critical for mitochondrial protein import. A vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are nucleus-encoded and need to be imported into mitochondria after synthesis on cytoplasmic ribosomes (1Schmidt O. Pfanner N. Meisinger C.

Biol. 2005; 22: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TOM is a multisubunit protein complex that is responsible for import of virtually all nucleus-encoded proteins through the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) (6Bains G. Lithgow T. The Tom channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane: alive and kicking.BioEssays. 1999; 21: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Rapaport D. How does the TOM complex mediate insertion of precursor proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane?.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The major subunit of TOM is Tom40, a β-barrel protein that forms a channel for protein translocation. Tom20, Tom70, Tom22, and Tom5 are important in the receptor function of the translocase. Tom6, Tom7, and Tom22 are involved in structural assembly of the complex. There are two TIMs (TIM23-17 and TIM22-54) in the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) in fungi to mammals (3Neupert W.

Biol. 2005; 22: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The TIM23-17 complex imports N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS)-containing proteins as well as an adjacent hydrophobic sorting signal-containing proteins destined to the mitochondrial matrix and the MIM, respectively (8van der Laan M.

A presequence- and voltage-sensitive channel of the mitochondrial preprotein translocase formed by Tim23.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The core subunits of the TIM23-17 complex are Tim23, Tim17, and Tim50. For translocation of proteins for the mitochondrial matrix, the TIM23-17 complex associates with the presequence-activated motor (PAM) complex consisting of Tim44, Tim14/Pam18, Tim16/Pam16, and Hsp70. Once the proteins reach their destination, the presequence or MTS is cleaved by a mitochondrial processing peptidase (10Gakh O. Cavadini P. Isaya G. Mitochondrial processing peptidases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and the imported proteins are folded within the matrix through the action of the Hsp60-Hsp10 chaperone system (3Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Translocation of proteins into mitochondria.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TIM22-54 complex imports internal signal-containing proteins such as the ADP/ATP carrier or other metabolite carriers with the help of hexameric chaperone complexes consisting of small Tims (such as Tim9-Tim10 and Tim8-Tim13) located in the intermembrane space (11Kerscher O. Holder J. Srinivasan M. Leung R.S. Jensen R.E. The Tim54p-Tim22p complex mediates insertion of proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane.J.

These small Tim proteins are also involved in the sorting and assembly of the MOM β-barrel proteins such as Tom40 and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) through a topogenesis of β-barrel protein complex (TOB), which is also known as the sorting and assembly complex (SAM) (13Becker T.

Despite the elaborate discoveries of the mitochondrial protein import machinery in fungi and mammals, this essential-to-life process is poorly understood in trypanosomatids. Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a group of hemoflagellated parasitic protozoa that cause a devastating disease in humans and domestic animals (African trypanosomiasis), which is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (15World Health Organization (2006) Report on Infectious Diseases, World Health Organization, GenevaGoogle Scholar, 16Sternberg J.M. Maclean L. A spectrum of disease in human African trypanosomiasis: the host and parasite genetics of virulence.Parasitology. 2010; 137: 2007-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Trypanosomatids possess a single reticular mitochondrion with several unique characteristics essential for cell survival (17Lukes J. Hashimi H. Zíková A.

Unique aspects of mitochondrial biogenesis in trypanosomatids.Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similar to other eukaryotes, the mitochondrial genome of these parasites encodes only a limited set of proteins. About a thousand mitochondrial proteins (19Panigrahi A.K. Ogata Y. Zíková A. Anupama A. Dalley R.A. Acestor N. Myler P.J. Stuart K.D.

Mitochondrial protein import is thus essential to the survival of T. brucei. In fungi, plants, and mammals, the N-terminal MTS varies in length by about 20–60 amino acid residues (3Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Translocation of proteins into mitochondria.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 4Bauer M.F. Gempel K. Reichert A.S. Rappold G.A.

Biol. 2005; 22: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of MTSs are not conserved, but they all possess specific characteristics, including the presence of positively charged residues and the ability to form an amphiphilic α-helix (21von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Domain structure of mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting peptides.Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Although T. brucei possess such N-terminal MTS-containing proteins, the length of the sequence varies widely compared with other eukaryotes and can be as small as 8–9 amino acid residues (22Schneider A.

Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In fungi and higher eukaryotes, there are three homologous proteins, Tim17, Tim22, and Tim23, which belong to the amino acid transporter family and consist of four transmembrane domains in the center of the protein that are integrated in the MIM, leaving both the N and C termini in the intermembrane space (27Rassow J. Dekker P.J. van Wilpe S. Meijer M. Soll J. The preprotein translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane: function and evolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although the predicted secondary structure of T. brucei Tim17 (TbTim17) is conserved, there are no homologs of eukaryotic Tim22 and Tim23 in the trypanosome genome databases. Therefore, it is necessary to identify these unknown TbTim17-interacting partners and to investigate the functions of these proteins in T. brucei. Here, we report that TbTim17 is present in a protein complex of about 1,100 kDa, which is much larger than the TIMs found in other eukaryotes. TbTim17 is directly involved in the import of cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COIV), an N-terminal signal-containing protein, into mitochondria. Tandem affinity purification (TAP) of the TbTim17 protein complex identified several associated proteins that are unique for trypanosomes. Two of these unique proteins (TbTim54 and TbTim62) showed strong interaction with TbTim17 and were found to be critical for mitochondrial protein import in T. brucei both in vitro and in vivo. The procyclic form of T. brucei 427 cells were grown in SDM-79 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. T. brucei 427 procyclic double resistant cell line (Tb427 29-13) expressing the tetracycline repressor gene and T7 RNA polymerase were grown in the same medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 15 μg/ml neomycin (G418) (28Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Vectors for inducible expression of toxic gene products in bloodstream and procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For measurement of cell growth, the procyclic cells were inoculated at a cell density of 2–3 × 106/ml in medium containing appropriate antibiotics in the presence or absence of doxycycline (1 μg/ml). Cells were harvested on different days up to 12 days, and the number of cells was counted in a Neubauer hemocytometer counter. The logs of the cumulative cell numbers were plotted versus time of incubation in culture. Large scale cultivation of the procyclic form was performed by inoculating 1 liter of medium at a cell density of 2–3 × 106/ml at 27 °C in a conical flask of 2-liter capacity with constant agitation. To generate constructs for inducible expression of C-terminal TAP-tagged TbTim17, the 459-bp open reading frame (ORF) of TbTim17 was PCR-amplified using the Tim17-TAP forward and reverse primers with HindIII and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, at their 5′-ends (supplemental Table S1). The PCR product was digested with HindIII and XhoI enzymes and cloned into pLew79-MHT vector (a generous gift from Marilyn Parsons), which contains c-myc, His6, calmodulin binding peptide, and 2X-protein A tags in that order (29Hashimi H.

The calmodulin binding peptide and the 2X-protein A tags are separated by a TEV protease cleavage site. The purified plasmid DNA was linearized by NotI. The linearized plasmid was used for transfection into procyclic cells (Tb427 29-13) expressing T7 polymerase and tetracycline repressor proteins according to standard protocols (28Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Vectors for inducible expression of toxic gene products in bloodstream and procyclic Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); cells were then selected by phleomycin (2.5 μg/ml) resistance. After transfection, the plasmid was integrated into the ribosomal DNA spacer region in T. brucei. The C-terminal TAP-tagged construct for Tb927.8.1740-TAP and Tb927.6.2470-TAP was developed similarly using appropriate primers (supplemental Table S1) to amplify the corresponding ORFs. The RNAi constructs for Tb927.1.1310, Tb927.6.2470, Tb927.8.1740, and Tb927.10.3620 were generated using a tetracycline-inducible dual promoter plasmid vector, p2T7Ti-177 (32Wickstead B. Ersfeld K.

Specific primer pairs (supplemental Table S1) containing appropriate restriction enzyme sites at the 5′-ends were used to amplify the fragments of the corresponding cDNAs. The amplified products were cloned individually into the BamHI/HindIII sites of the vector p2T7Ti-177. The constructs for RNAi were verified by sequencing. The purified plasmid DNA was linearized by NotI. The linearized plasmids were used for transfection into procyclic cells Tb427 29-13 as described above. After transfection, the plasmid was integrated into 177-bp repeat regions of the minichromosomes in T. brucei. The RNAi cell lines for TbTim17 and VDAC was similarly developed as described (25Singha U.K. Peprah E. Williams S. Walker R. Saha L. Chaudhuri M.

RNA was isolated from the procyclic trypanosomes grown for 2 days with or without doxycycline using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and Northern analysis was performed as described previously (25Singha U.K. Peprah E.

Specific probes were generated using a random primer labeling protocol (Invitrogen) from the cDNA fragments generated by PCR using the same primer pairs used for preparation of RNAi constructs. The ethidium bromide-stained ribosomal RNA was used as loading controls. T. brucei cells were harvested and resuspended in fresh medium (5 × 106/ml). MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) was added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 0.05 μm and incubated at 27 °C for 15 min. Following incubation, cells were washed with 10.0 ml of complete medium, resuspended in 5.0 ml of medium, and incubated at 27 °C for 30 min. After that, cells were washed with 1× PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and stored in PBS in the dark at 4 °C for further analysis. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) analytical flow cytometer using absorption at 578 nm and emission at 599 nm. CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) was used to analyze the results. Fractionation of T. brucei procyclic cells was performed as described (34Paris Z. Hashimi H. Lun S. Alfonzo J.D. Lukeš J.

Briefly, 2 × 108 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of SMEP buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) containing 0.03% digitonin and incubated on ice for 5 min. The cell suspension was then centrifuged for 5 min at 6,800 × g at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was considered a crude mitochondrial fraction, and the supernatant contained the soluble cytosolic proteins. Mitochondria were also isolated from the parasite after lysis via nitrogen cavitation in isotonic buffer as described (25Singha U.K. Peprah E. Williams S. Walker R. Saha L. Chaudhuri M.

The isolated mitochondria were stored at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in SME buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA) containing 50% glycerol at −70 °C. Before using, mitochondria were washed twice with 9 volumes of SME buffer to remove glycerol. Mitoplasts (i.e. mitochondrial matrix with intact MIM) were isolated after treatment of mitochondria with 3 volumes of water for 15 min on ice to disrupt MOM. Afterward, the osmolarity was restored with the addition of one-third volume of 2.4 m sucrose. Mitoplasts were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed for the release of Cyt c, an intermembrane space protein, as described (33Singha U.K. Sharma S. Chaudhuri M.

Mitochondrial proteins (50 and 100 μg) were solubilized in 72 μl of ice-cold buffer N (20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% digitonin). The solubilized mitochondrial proteins were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were mixed with 7.5 μl of sample buffer (750 mm amino caproic acid, 5% Coomassie G-250) and electrophoresed on a linear 6–13% polyacrylamide gradient gel (33Singha U.K. Sharma S.

https://openalex.org/W2005204476,"Knowledge of the responses of soil nitrogen (N) availability, fine root mass, production and turnover rates to atmospheric N deposition is crucial for understanding fine root dynamics and functioning in forest ecosystems. Fine root biomass and necromass, production and turnover rates, and soil nitrate-N and ammonium-N in relation to N fertilization (50 kg N ha−1 year−1) were investigated in a temperate forest over the growing season of 2010, using sequential soil cores and ingrowth cores methods. N fertilization increased soil nitrate-N by 16% (P<0.001) and ammonium-N by 6% (P<0.01) compared to control plots. Fine root biomass and necromass in 0–20 cm soil were 13% (4.61 vs. 5.23 Mg ha−1, P<0.001) and 34% (1.39 vs. 1.86 Mg ha−1, P<0.001) less in N fertilization plots than those in control plots. The fine root mass was significantly negatively correlated with soil N availability and nitrate-N contents, especially in 0–10 cm soil layer. Both fine root production and turnover rates increased with N fertilization, indicating a rapid underground carbon cycling in environment with high nitrogen levels. Although high N supply has been widely recognized to promote aboveground growth rates, the present study suggests that high levels of nitrogen supply may reduce the pool size of the underground carbon. Hence, we conclude that high levels of atmospheric N deposition will stimulate the belowground carbon cycling, leading to changes in the carbon balance between aboveground and underground storage. The implications of the present study suggest that carbon model and prediction need to take the effects of nitrogen deposition on underground system into account."
https://openalex.org/W2039911936,"Oncogene-induced replication stress is recognized as the primary cause of accumulation of DNA damage and genome instability in precancerous cells. Although the molecular mechanisms responding to such type of replication perturbation are not fully characterized, it has been speculated that their dysfunction may enhance genome instability and accelerate tumor progression. Here, we show that the WRN protein, a member of the human RecQ helicases, is necessary to sustain replication fork progression in response to oncogene-induced replication stress. Loss of WRN affects cell cycle progression and results in enhanced accumulation of double-strand breaks and instability at common fragile sites in cells experiencing oncogene-induced replication stress. Moreover, we demonstrate that double-strand breaks, observed upon oncogene over-expression, depend on the MUS81 endonuclease, which represents a parallel pathway collaborating with WRN to prevent cell death. Overall, our findings give insights into the mechanisms protecting replication forks in cells experiencing oncogene-induced replication stress, and identify factors that, when mutated or dysfunctional, may enhance genome instability in precancerous cells. In addition, because concomitant depletion of WRN and MUS81 causes synthetic sickness in cells growing under oncogene-induced replication stress, our results support the possibility of targeting cancer cells with an impaired replication fork recovery pathway by a specific inactivation of the other parallel pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2144573431,"Proteinase-activated receptors 4 (PAR4) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) recognized through the ability of serine proteases such as thrombin and trypsin to mediate receptor activation. Due to the irreversible nature of activation, a fresh supply of receptor is required to be mobilized to the cell surface for responsiveness to agonist to be sustained. Unlike other PAR subtypes, the mechanisms regulating receptor trafficking of PAR4 remain unknown. Here, we report novel features of the intracellular trafficking of PAR4 to the plasma membrane. PAR4 was poorly expressed at the plasma membrane and largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a complex with the COPI protein subunit β-COP1. Analysis of the PAR4 protein sequence identified an arginine-based (RXR) ER retention sequence located within intracellular loop-2 (R183AR → A183AA), mutation of which allowed efficient membrane delivery of PAR4. Interestingly, co-expression with PAR2 facilitated plasma membrane delivery of PAR4, an effect produced through disruption of β-COP1 binding and facilitation of interaction with the chaperone protein 14-3-3ζ. Intermolecular FRET studies confirmed heterodimerization between PAR2 and PAR4. PAR2 also enhanced glycosylation of PAR4 and activation of PAR4 signaling. Our results identify a novel regulatory role for PAR2 in the anterograde traffic of PAR4. PAR2 was shown to both facilitate and abrogate protein interactions with PAR4, impacting upon receptor localization and cell signal transduction.

Although a thrombin-activated receptor, it lacks the hirudin-like domain required for thrombin selectivity and is activated by several other ligands including trypsin. In addition it has a shorter C terminus than PAR1 and PAR2 and lacks essential phosphorylation sites within intracellular domains, which are present in other family members and have been shown to be necessary for receptor desensitization (22.Shapiro M.J.

However, very little is known of the mechanisms regulating receptor trafficking. proteinase-activated receptor endoplasmic reticulum G protein-coupled receptor monomeric enhanced green/yellow/cyan fluorescent protein arginine-based ER retention motifs coat protein I complex ratiometric FRET. Due to the irreversible nature of activation of PARs, for responsiveness to agonist to be retained, fresh supplies of receptor are required to be mobilized to the cell surface. Delivery to the membrane requires efficient transport between the ER/Golgi/plasma membrane, which can be facilitated through discrete motifs that reside within the synthesized protein (24.Gassmann M.

Many chaperone proteins, such as coat protein complexes (COPI and COPII), can assist transport of recently synthesized proteins through motif-based sorting (26.Barlowe C.

Properly assembled proteins are packaged for export into COPII vesicles where they progress to the ER-Golgi intermediate complex, a process known as anterograde transport. Misfolded proteins or those exposing sequences encoding ER retention motifs (for example, RXR, KDEL, or KKAA motifs) are shuttled back to the ER via COPI vesicles, in a process known as retrograde transport (29.Aridor M.

During the assembly of multimeric proteins, such as GPCR homo/heterodimers, proteins possessing ER retention signals have been shown to evade ER retention through the steric masking of motifs during protein folding (30.Zerangue N.

Once proper protein folding has been achieved, post-translational modifications, such as complex glycosylation, will occur (35.Duvernay M.T. Filipeanu C.M. Wu G. The regulatory mechanisms of export trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors.Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here we identify for the first time the presence of an arginine-based ER retention motif within intracellular loop-2 of PAR4, which results in ER retention through COPI-dependent retrograde transport. In the presence of PAR2, through PAR2/PAR4 heterodimer formation and interaction with 14-3-3ζ, PAR4 was able to evade ER retention and undergo N-linked complex glycosylation. This resulted in efficient delivery to the plasma membrane. The impact of enhanced cell surface expression was reflected in enhanced PAR4-mediated cell signal transduction. PAR2 is often co-expressed with PAR4, and they are dual up-regulated by various pro-inflammatory mediators and have been shown to be co-activated by common agonists (20.Xu W.F. Andersen H.

In the presence of PAR2, a significant increase in PAR4-mediated total inositol phosphate accumulation was observed. This work demonstrates for the first time a novel regulatory role for PAR2 in the anterograde traffic and signaling of PAR4. This is mediated by selective interaction with COPI or 14-3-3 proteins, offering a new paradigm for class A GPCR trafficking and control. The PAR4 activating peptide, Ala-Tyr-Pro-Gly-Lys-Phe-amidated (NH2) peptide (AYPGKF-NH2), was synthesized by the University of Calgary Peptide Service (Calgary, Canada).

The alkaline phosphatase substrate kit was obtained from Bio-Rad. Human PAR2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a pRSV-PAR2 vector. The PCR product was then digested with HindIII-BamHI and cloned into the respective sites of a pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Human PAR4 was amplified from a pcDNA3.1(+)-hPAR4 vector by PCR and digested with Kpn-AgeI, whereas ECFP was amplified from the pECFP-N1 vector (Clontech) and digested with AgeI-XbaI. PAR4 and ECFP were ligated and cloned into the KpnI-XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Monomeric ECFP and EYFP constructs were generated by amino acid substitution of Ala206 to Lys206 (38.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Partitioning of lipid-modified monomeric GFPs into membrane microdomains of live cells.Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar), through site-directed mutagenesis using the Gene TailorTM Site-directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen). Amino acid substitutions were similarly made within the primary sequence of PAR4 to mutate potential arginine-based ER retention motifs (positions R183AR → A183AA, (referred to as RAR mut) R188GRR → A188GAA and R183AR R188GRR → A183AA A188GAA) and the N-linked glycosylation site on the N-terminal of PAR4 (Asn56 → Ala56). A HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) was incorporated into the C-terminal of PAR4 by PCR to generate PAR4-HA. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. HEK293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 units ml−1), streptomycin (100 μg ml−1), and nonessential amino acids and passaged using 1× SSC (sodium citrate, pH 7.4). NCTC-2544 cells and NCTC-PAR2 cells were grown in Medium 199 with Earle's salts (Sigma) containing 10% FCS, sodium bicarbonate (50 mm), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units ml−1), and streptomycin (100 μg ml−1). NCTC-2544 cells were passaged using Versene (0.53 mm EDTA in PBS) to avoid trypsin exposure. All cells where then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 with medium replaced every 2 days. Cells were grown in 12- and 6-well plates or T75 flasks prior to transient transfection at 70–80% confluence with 1, 2, or 10 μg of endo-free plasmid DNA, respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the recommended manufacturer's guidelines. Maximal gene expression was observed 48 h post-transfection. Following transient transfection for 24 h, cells were serum starved for a further 24 h in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.5 μCi/well (1 Ci = 37 GBq) of myo-[2-3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (0.5 μCi/well; 1 Ci = 37 GBq). Cells were pretreated with 20 mm lithium chloride for 30 min prior to agonist treatment (100 μm AYPGKF-NH2 for 45 min). Measurement of the accumulation of inositol phosphates was carried out as previously described by Plevin et al. (39.Plevin R. Kellock N.A. Wakelam M.J. Wadsworth R. Regulation by hypoxia of endothelin-1-stimulated phospholipase D activity in sheep pulmonary artery cultured smooth muscle cells.Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in PBS prior to methanol fixation for 15 min at room temperature. After further washes with PBS, cells were stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear dye or ER TrackerTM dye then mounted onto glass microscope slides with 15 μl of mowiol (Calbiochem). Cells were visualized using a Nikon TE300-E microscope (Nikon Instruments, New York) using a ×100 (numerical aperture; NA 1.3) oil immersion Fluor lens. Emitted fluorescence was detected using a photometric Cool Snap-HQ monochrome camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) set up in 12-bit mode (0–4095 gray tones). Metamorph software (version 7.0, Molecular Devices Corp., Downing, PA) was used to control image acquisition and modify image settings. Images were background corrected, based on statistical correction of average background regions from defined regions of interest. Changes in cell surface expression of PAR4 were measured by Enzyme-linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Cells were transfected with PAR4 for 24 h prior to being seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-well plates pre-coated with 0.1 ml/ml of poly-l-lysine. Cells were grown overnight to recover. Surface receptors were pre-labeled with anti-PAR4 (1/1000 dilution) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Cells were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS for 45 min at room temperature followed by a 1-h inculation with a alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1/1000 dilution) in 1% BSA in TBS. Cells were washed four times in TBS to remove unbound secondary antibody. Alkaline phosphate substrate solution was prepared by dissolving p-nitrophenyl phosphate tablets in diethanolamine buffer (Bio-Rad). Substrate solution was added to cells and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 10–30 min. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Dynex MRX revelation). Surface expression of PAR4 in NCTC-2544 and NCTC-PAR2 cells was measured by a biotinylation assay using Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, four T75 cm2 flasks of NCTC-2544 or NCTC-PAR2 cells were transfected with PAR4 mECFP. Cells were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin for 30 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The biotinylation reaction was stopped through the addition of a quench solution followed by further incubation at 4 °C for 15 min. Cells were scraped and the flasks were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min. Supernatant was discarded and the cell pellets were washed 3 times in TBS followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 3 min. Cells were lysed using the provided lysis buffer containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and sonicated on ice at low power to disrupt using five 1-s bursts, then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min on an orbital rotator. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Clarified supernatants were transferred to a new tube and incubated with NeutrAvidin-agarose for 60 min at room temperature with end-over-end mixing using a rotator. Supernatant/agarose slurry was centrifuged for 1 min at 1,000 × g and the supernatant was discarded. The agarose pellet was washed 3 times in the wash buffer provided with the addition of complete protease inhibitor mixture. SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm DTT) was added to the sample, which was then heated in a heat block for 5 min at 95 °C. The tubes were then centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 × g. PAR4 expression was detected by Western blotting using antibodies specific for either PAR4 or GFP. Equal expression of total levels of PAR4 mECFP in transfected cells was confirmed by resolving the corresponding whole cell lysates prepared from the same cells used for the biotinylation experiments. Proteins were separated by 8–10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding in 2% BSA (w/v) diluted in NATT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20) for 2 h. The blots were then incubated overnight with 50 ng/ml of primary antibody diluted in 0.2% BSA (w/v) in NATT buffer then washed with NATT buffer at 15-min intervals for a further 90 min. The blots were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (20 ng/ml) in 0.2% BSA (w/v) diluted in NATT buffer for 2 h. After a further 90-min wash, the membranes were treated with ECL reagent and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. Cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 5 × T150 cm tissue culture flasks prior to transient transfection with PAR4 mECFP. The cells were harvested and the cell pellet resuspended in 3 ml of HES buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (25 μg/ml of leupeptin, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml of PMSF). The cell lysate was homogenized using a pre-cooled cell homogenizer (Isobiotec Precision Engineering, Germany, German Patent Office number 202 09 547.9) fitted with a size 10-μm clearance tungsten carbide ballbearing. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and resuspended in Opti-prep (Invitrogen) density gradient medium to create a 45% (v/v) density sample solution. A density gradient (30–10%) was prepared using Opti-prep medium mixed in HES buffer followed by ultracentrifugation at 72,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C to separate plasma membrane, endosomal, and ER fractions (40.Proctor K.M.

Equal volume fractions (300 μl) were collected and precipitated in 37.5% TCA, incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets obtained were resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 1 m urea and resolved by Western blotting.

https://openalex.org/W1996123576,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a major supportive component within neoplasms. Mechanisms of macrophage (MΦ) attraction and differentiation to a tumor-promoting phenotype, which is characterized by pronounced interleukin (IL)-10 production, are under investigation. We report that supernatants of dying cancer cells induced substantial IL-10 release from primary human MΦs, dependent on signaling through tyrosine kinase receptor A (TRKA or neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (NTRK1)). Mechanistically, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) release from apoptotic cancer cells triggered src-dependent shuttling of cytosolic TRKA to the plasma membrane via S1P receptor signaling. Plasma membrane-associated TRKA, which was activated by constitutively autocrine secreted nerve growth factor, used phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to induce IL-10. Interestingly, TRKA-dependent signaling was required for cytokine production by TAMs isolated from primary murine breast cancer tissue. Besides IL-10, this pathway initiated secretion of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), indicating relevance in cancer-associated inflammation. Our findings highlight a fine-tuned regulatory system including S1P-dependent TRKA trafficking for executing TAM-like cell function in vitro as well as in vivo."

It is conceivable that some PDZ domain-containing proteins interact with MRP4 via PDZ-PDZ interaction and modulate its expression on the plasma membrane. In the current study, we performed GST pull-down assays and subsequent analysis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and identified sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) as one of the partners that interacts with a PDZ-bm of MRP4. SNX27 is a member of the SNX family of proteins, which are unified by the presence of a phox domain, a phospholipid-binding motif, and implicated in intracellular sorting and trafficking (10Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Sorting out the cellular functions of sorting nexins.Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 919-931Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). SNX27 was originally identified in the rat neocortex as a developmentally regulated psychostimulant-inducible novel gene, which was designated as mrt1 (methamphetamine-responsive transcript 1), having two splice forms (SNX27a (mrt1a) and SNX27b (mrt1b)) that vary only in their C-terminal ends (11Kajii Y.

However, the function of SNX27 has not been characterized fully because the sorting process affected by SNX27 depends on the targeted proteins. SNX27 modulates the early endosomal trafficking of the 5-hydroxytryptamine type-4(a) receptor (5-HT4(a)R), G protein-gated potassium (Kir3) channels, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2C (NR2C) (12Cai L.

SNX27 also helps in the efficient recycling of β2-adrenoreceptor (β2AR) to the plasma membrane (14Lauffer B.E. Melero C. Temkin P. Lei C. Hong W. Kortemme T. von Zastrow M. SNX27 mediates PDZ-directed sorting from endosomes to the plasma membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Reports like these have generated interest in the association of SNX27 with the intracellular sorting of MRP4 in some processes and thereby in the regulation of the cell surface expression and transport function of MRP4. Herein, we examined the effect of SNX27 suppression by siRNA in HEK293 cells on the cell surface expression of MRP4; sensitivity to 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG), whose nucleotide metabolites are toxic MRP4 substrates; and endocytosis and recycling rates of MRP4. The cellular localization of SNX27 was explored in HEK293 and COS-1 cells. The data show that SNX27 interacts with MRP4 near the plasma membrane and promotes endocytosis of MRP4 and thereby negatively regulates its cell surface expression and transport function. Antibodies against MRP4, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), transferrin receptor, FLAG epitope (m2), hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate, and β-actin were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), Invitrogen, Sigma-Aldrich, Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO), and MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH), respectively.

Hayashi H. Naoi S. Sugiyama Y.

The sequences of the constructed vectors were confirmed using an ABI PRISM 3110 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). HEK293, HeLa, COS-1, and HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. pBAsi-hU6 Pur DNA encoding MRP4 shRNA or control shRNA was transfected into HEK293 cells with Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). After 48 h, transfected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Several clones were isolated, and the expression of MRP4 was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-MRP4 antibody. To construct the GST fusion protein with MRP4-Cter (GST-MRP4-Cter), MRP4-CterΔ4 (GST-MRP4-CterΔ4), and SNX27 PDZ (GST-SNX27 PDZ), the constructs of MRP4-Cter, MRP4-CterΔ4, and SNX27 PDZ in the pGEX6P-2 vector were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. A 5-ml aliquot of bacteria, grown overnight in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin was transferred to 500 ml of 2× YT medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and cultured at 37 °C for an additional 3 h until the A600 reached 0.4. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and incubation overnight at 20 °C. After the induction, the bacteria were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bacteria were solubilized with B-PER (bacterial protein extraction reagent) (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting bacterial lysate was either used immediately or stored at −80 °C until use. GST fusion proteins were purified by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by washing with cold PBS. The amount of fusion protein eluted from the beads was quantified using the Lowry protein assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro binding assays, HepG2 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The prepared lysate was then incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-agarose beads containing 50 μg of bound GST fusion protein for 2 h at 4 °C. After binding, the beads were washed three times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione), separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to silver staining or Western blot analysis. Protein bands plus blank regions were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels visualized with silver staining and destained using a SilverQuest silver staining kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After destaining, samples were subjected to in-gel digestion with a trypsin solution overnight at 37 °C. Supernatants were collected, washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), eluted with 50% acetonitrile solution containing 0.1% TFA, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. A list of the determined peptide masses was subjected to mass fingerprinting using the Mascot software program (Matrix Science, London, UK), which was used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein databases. HEK293 cells were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was precleared by adding control IgG and 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Roche Applied Science). Three percent of each precleared lysate was preserved at −80 °C as the input specimen. The remaining precleared lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-SNX27 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, after which 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads was added, and the lysate was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated, washed, and eluted as described previously (18Mizuno T. Hayashi H. Naoi S. Sugiyama Y.

The transport study was performed as reported previously (21Miyagawa M. Maeda K. Aoyama A. Sugiyama Y. The eighth and ninth transmembrane domains in organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 affect the transport kinetics of estrone-3-sulfate and estradiol-17β-d-glucuronide.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In brief, HEK293 cells expressing MRP4 shRNA (HEK-MRP4 shRNA) or control shRNA (HEK-control shRNA) were seeded onto 12-well plates coated with poly-l-lysine and poly-l-ornithine (Sigma-Aldrich) at a density of 4.0 × 105 cells/well and transfected with SNX27 siRNA or control siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection, the cells were washed once and preincubated with Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer (118 mm NaCl, 23.8 mm NaHCO3, 4.83 mm KCl, 0.96 mm KH2PO4, 1.20 mm MgSO4, 12.5 mm HEPES, 5.0 mm glucose, and 1.53 mm CaCl2 adjusted to pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 15 min. The uptake and efflux assay was then initiated by adding KH buffer containing 5 μm [14C]6MP. The uptake was terminated at a designated time by removing the incubation buffer and adding ice-cold KH buffer. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold KH buffer, solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH, and kept overnight at room temperature, and 0.4 n HCl was added. For the efflux assay, the cells were incubated for 2 h in KH buffer containing 5 μm [14C]6MP, washed three times, and incubated with KH buffer at 37 °C. At the time points indicated, the incubation buffer was collected, and the cells were solubilized as described for the uptake assay. The radioactivity of the cell lysate and incubation buffer was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 600SC, Beckman, Fullerton, CA) after mixing each sample with scintillation fluid (Clear-sol I; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) in a scintillation vial. The protein concentration of the cell lysate was measured by the Lowry method with BSA as the standard. The uptake value was calculated as described previously (22Hayashi H. Takada T. Suzuki H. Onuki R. Hofmann A.F. Sugiyama Y. Transport by vesicles of glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile salts and taurolithocholate 3-sulfate. A comparison of human BSEP with rat Bsep.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1738: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Efflux percentage was calculated by dividing the radioactivity in the incubation buffer at each time point by total radioactivity in the cell lysate and incubation buffer at that time point. HEK-MRP4 shRNA and HEK-control shRNA cells were seeded into 96-well plates coated with poly-l-lysine and poly-l-ornithine at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well and transfected with SNX27 siRNA or control siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The next day, various concentrations of 6MP, 6TG, and etoposide were added to the growth medium. After 96 h of growth in the presence of a drug, cell proliferation assays were performed using the CellTiter 96 cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-1 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips (Matsunami Glass Ind. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in 12-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/well. In the experiments in which ectopically expressed Rab proteins were required, COS-1 cells were transfected with pAcGFP-C1 containing Rab4, Rab5, Rab7, or Rab11 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), harvested after 24 h of culture, and seeded as described above. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.1% saponin, PBS for 10 min, blocked with 3% BSA, PBS for 30 min, and stained with anti-SNX27, anti-EEA1, and anti-LAMP1 antibodies for 2 h, followed by Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h. These staining procedures were performed at room temperature. The cells were mounted onto glass slides with VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) and were visualized by confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS SP5 II laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Solms, Germany).

Proteasome inhibitors were suggested to promote TRAIL signal transduction through the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) by modulating the relative abundance of core DISC components, thereby enhancing caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the changes in DISC protein levels as an early consequence of proteasome inhibition in HeLa cervical cancer cells and, based on these data, mathematically modeled the proapoptotic TRAIL signaling toward caspase-8 activation. Modeling results surprisingly suggested that caspase-8 activation might be delayed in presence of proteasome inhibitors, in particular at submaximal TRAIL doses. Subsequent FRET-based single cell time-lapse imaging at conditions where transcription dependent prosurvival signaling was blocked confirmed this hypothesis: caspase-8 activity was delayed by hours in the presence of proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin or bortezomib. Corresponding delays were detected for effector caspase processing and cell death. Contrary to current models, we therefore provide evidence that synergies between TRAIL and proteasome inhibitors do not result from changes in the levels of core DISC signaling proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2119919840,"M2 protein of influenza A viruses is a tetrameric transmembrane proton channel, which has essential functions both early and late in the virus infectious cycle. Previous studies of proton transport by M2 have been limited to measurements outside the context of the virus particle. We have developed an in vitro fluorescence-based assay to monitor internal acidification of individual virions triggered to undergo membrane fusion. We show that rimantadine, an inhibitor of M2 proton conductance, blocks the acidification-dependent dissipation of fluorescence from a pH-sensitive virus-content probe. Fusion-pore formation usually follows internal acidification but does not require it. The rate of internal virion acidification increases with external proton concentration and saturates with a pKm of ∼4.7. The rate of proton transport through a single, fully protonated M2 channel is approximately 100 to 400 protons per second. The saturating proton-concentration dependence and the low rate of internal virion acidification derived from authentic virions support a transporter model for the mechanism of proton transfer."

In vivo, these Na+ channels are formed as complexes of pore-forming α and auxiliary β subunits. The goal of this study was to investigate the expression of β subunits in DRG sensory neurons. Quantitative single-cell RT-PCR revealed that β subunit mRNA is differentially expressed in small (β2 and β3) and large (β1 and β2) DRG neurons. This raises the possibility that β subunit availability and Na+ channel composition and functional regulation may differ in these subpopulations of sensory neurons. To further explore these possibilities, we quantitatively compared the mRNA expression of the β subunit with that of Nav1.7, a TTX-sensitive Na+ channel widely expressed in both small and large DRG neurons. Nav1.7 and β subunit mRNAs were significantly correlated in small (β2 and β3) and large (β1 and β2) DRG neurons, indicating that these subunits are coexpressed in the same populations. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry indicated that Nav1.7 formed stable complexes with the β1–β3 subunits in vivo and that Nav1.7 and β3 co-localized within the plasma membranes of small DRG neurons. Heterologous expression studies showed that β3 induced a hyperpolarizing shift in Nav1.7 activation, whereas β1 produced a depolarizing shift in inactivation and faster recovery.

https://openalex.org/W2091339085,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of unknown origin that affects the central nervous system of an estimated 400,000 Americans. GBV-C or hepatitis G is a flavivirus that is found in the serum of 1-2% of blood donors. It was originally associated with hepatitis, but is now believed to be a relatively non-pathogenic lymphotropic virus. Fifty frozen specimens from the brains of deceased persons affected by MS were obtained along with 15 normal control brain specimens. RNA was extracted and ribosomal RNAs were depleted before sequencing on the Illumina GAII. These 36 bp reads were compared with a non-redundant database derived from the 600,000+ viral sequences in GenBank organized into 4080 taxa. An individual read successfully aligned to the viral database was considered to be a ""hit"". Normalized MS specimen hit rates for each viral taxon were compared to the distribution of hits in the normal controls. Seventeen MS and 11 control brain extracts were sequenced, yielding 4-10 million sequences (""reads"") each. Over-representation of sequence from at least one of 12 viral taxa was observed in 7 of the 17 MS samples. Sequences resembling other viruses previously implicated in the pathogenesis of MS were not significantly enriched in any of the diseased brain specimens. Sequences from GB virus C (GBV-C), a flavivirus not previously isolated from brain, were enriched in one of the MS samples. GBV-C in this brain specimen was confirmed by specific amplification in this single MS brain specimen, but not in the 30 other MS brain samples available. The entire 9.4 kb sequence of this GBV-C isolate is reported here. This study shows the feasibility of deep sequencing for the detection of occult viral infections in the brains of deceased persons with MS.

In support of its oncogenic activity, SKI was found to be overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, although the exact molecular mechanism(s) responsible for its oncogenic activity is not fully understood. We found that SKI can negatively regulate p53 by decreasing its level through up-regulation of MDM2 activity, which is mediated by the ability of SKI to enhance sumoylation of MDM2. This stimulation of MDM2 sumoylation is accomplished through a direct interaction of SKI with SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2, Ubc9, resulting in enhanced thioester bond formation and mono-sumoylation of Ubc9. A mutant SKI defective in transformation fails to increase p53 ubiquitination and is unable to increase MDM2 levels and to increase mono-sumoylation of Ubc9, suggesting that the ability of SKI to enhance Ubc9 activity is essential for its transforming function.

Mice lacking the Ski gene result in early postnatal lethality with exencephaly caused by failed closure of the cranial neural tube during neurulation as well as a host of developmental abnormalities (11Berk M. Desai S.Y. Heyman H.C. Colmenares C. Mice lacking the ski proto-oncogene have defects in neurulation, craniofacial, patterning, and skeletal muscle development.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Humans diagnosed with a haploid deficiency of SKI due to 1p36 deletion display similar phenotypes as shown in mice with a constitutional lack of Ski gene (12Colmenares C. Heilstedt H.A. Shaffer L.G. Schwartz S. Berk M. Murray J.C. Stavnezer E. Loss of the SKI proto-oncogene in individuals affected with 1p36 deletion syndrome is predicted by strain-dependent defects in Ski−/− mice.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The connection of the SKI oncoprotein with the TGFβ signaling pathway was established a decade ago by the finding that SKI can physically interact with Smad proteins, including Smad2, -3, and -4 (13Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. The Ski oncoprotein interacts with the Smad proteins to repress TGFβ signaling.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Sun Y. Liu X. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S.

Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 15Xu W. Angelis K. Danielpour D. Haddad M.M. Bischof O. Campisi J. Stavnezer E. Medrano E.E. Ski acts as a co-repressor with Smad2 and Smad3 to regulate the response to type β transforming growth factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Smad proteins are the central mediators of TGFβ signaling pathways transmitting signals of the activated receptor at the plasma membrane to the nucleus (16Kretzschmar M. Massagué J. SMADs. Mediators and regulators of TGF-β signaling.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Upon activation of receptor through ligand binding, type I receptor kinase is activated and phosphorylates Smad protein that subsequently oligomerizes with Smad4, and the complex translocates to the nucleus to regulate target gene transcription. SKI regulates the TGFβ signaling at multiple levels; it interacts with the Smad proteins and inhibits the transcriptional activation of target genes, likely by recruiting the nuclear corepressor complex. Indeed, SKI has been found to be a component of the nuclear corepressor complex capable of inhibiting the transcriptional activation of reporter constructs (17Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.D. Wadhwa R. Colmenares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Ski is a component of the histone deacetylase complex required for transcriptional repression by Mad and thyroid hormone receptor.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been found that SKI can interact with the type I TGFβ receptor directly and can lead to repression of the receptor activity (18Ferrand N. Atfi A. Prunier C. The oncoprotein c-Ski functions as a direct antagonist of the transforming growth factor-β type I receptor.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 8457-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because TGFβ signaling is a major cellular pathway that negatively regulates epithelial cell proliferation, the transforming capability of SKI is at least partially derived from its ability to neutralize the inhibition of cell proliferation by the TGFβ pathway. However, in the initial characterization of Ski oncogene in avian fibroblast cells, TGFβ signaling was thought to be promoting Ski-induced transformation by inhibiting Ski-induced myogenic differentiation (19Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. The ski oncogene induces muscle differentiation in quail embryo cells.Cell. 1989; 59: 293-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, TGFβ signaling cooperates with Ski to transform avian fibroblast cells. This apparent contradiction of the role of TGFβ signaling in Ski-induced cellular transformation has not been fully reconciled. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) 3The abbreviation used is: SUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifier. has been found to be involved in a variety of cellular processes, including intracellular trafficking, stress response, DNA replication, DNA damage repair, as well as transcriptional regulation (20Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Concepts in sumoylation. A decade on.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Four versions of SUMO, 1–4, have been identified. SUMO1–3 is expressed in the precursor forms and requires proteolytic activation to expose the invariant Gly-Gly motif at the C terminus of the mature SUMO for target conjugation. Much like the cellular ubiquitination process, SUMO activation enzyme E1, SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2, and SUMO ligase enzyme E3 are required to transfer the SUMO moiety to target proteins. SUMO E1 activates the SUMO through thioester bond formation between C-terminal Gly of SUMO and the catalytic cysteine residue of E1; the activated SUMO is then transferred to E2 with a similar thioester bond. Although E2 itself can transfer SUMO to target proteins, SUMO ligase E3 through enhancing efficiency and substrate specificity facilitates this process by transferring SUMO from the high energy bond to the ϵ-position of lysine of the target protein. Unlike ubiquitin modification, the main function of sumoylation is not a signal of destruction of the target through proteasomal degradation, instead it plays a role in a variety of cellular processes. SUMO modification in some cases has been shown to antagonize ubiquitination through competitive modification (21Bae S.H. Jeong J.W. Park J.A. Kim S.H. Bae M.K. Choi S.J. Kim K.W. Sumoylation increases HIF-1α stability and its transcriptional activity.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S.

Another difference between ubiquitination and sumoylation is their respective core enzymes that carry out the modifications. It appears that there is only one E2 enzyme for sumoylation, although there are many E2s that can fulfill the ubiquitin-conjugating activity. Similar to regulation by ubiquitination, there are also proteases, sentrin-specific proteases, that can hydrolytically remove the SUMO moiety, and thus reverse the modification of sumoylation. These sentrin-specific proteases are also responsible for the activation of SUMO precursor by removing their C-terminal peptides to expose the Gly-Gly motif. Like many biological processes, the core machinery of SUMO modification has also been found to be regulated by other proteins. For example, RSUME and SF2/ASF have been found to enhance SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9 to regulate target sumoylation (24Carbia-Nagashima A. Gerez J. Perez-Castro C. Paez-Pereda M. Silberstein S. Stalla G.K. Holsboer F. Arzt E.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16119-16124Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), although Rhes can enhance cross-sumoylation between E1 and Ubc9 (26Subramaniam S. Mealer R.G. Sixt K.M. Barrow R.K. Usiello A. Snyder S.H. Rhes, a physiologic regulator of sumoylation, enhances cross-sumoylation between the basic sumoylation enzymes E1 and Ubc9.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20428-20432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). small ubiquitin-like modifier. Several prominent proteins involved in tumorigenesis have been found to be modified by sumoylation. For example, p53 can be modified by sumoylation with either enhancement or reduction of its activity (27Hock A. Vousden K.H. Regulation of the p53 pathway by ubiquitin and related proteins.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 42: 1618-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, MDM2, the main ubiquitin E3 ligase for p53, has been found to be sumoylated (28Miyauchi Y. Yogosawa S. Honda R. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Sumoylation of Mdm2 by protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) and RanBP2 enzymes.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50131-50136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and this sumoylation was shown to be associated with increased activity of MDM2 (29Lee M.H. Lee S.W. Lee E.J. Choi S.J. Chung S.S. Lee J.I. Cho J.M. Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kim K.I. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Bang O.S. Chung C.H. SUMO-specific protease SUSP4 positively regulates p53 by promoting Mdm2 self-ubiquitination.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1424-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). MDM2 can be self-ubiquitinated and degraded. Sumoylation of MDM2 decreases its self-ubiquitination and degradation, whereas de-sumoylation leads to enhanced MDM2 self-ubiquitination. UV damage can decrease MDM2 sumoylation through a SUMO protease SUSP4. MDM2 sumoylation requires its N-terminal domain of amino acids 40–59 (30Buschmann T. Lerner D. Lee C.G. Ronai Z. The Mdm-2 amino terminus is required for Mdm2 binding and SUMO-1 conjugation by the E2 SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme Ubc9.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40389-40395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We report here that SKI is capable of regulating sumoylation of MDM2 through its ability to interact with and regulate SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9, resulting in enhanced MDM2 activity and decreased p53 protein. This novel function of SKI is likely a major molecular mechanism for its oncogenic activity as p53 is an important tumor suppressor, and a mechanism that leads to its destruction will greatly contribute to cellular transformation. LNCaP was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium; H1299, U2OS, HEK293, 293T, HepG2, and mink lung epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HCT116 and HCT116 p53−/− cells were in McCoy's 5A medium, and all were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Chemical siRNA for Ski, PIAS1, and PIAS3 were from IDT Inc. with the following sequences: Ski, sense 5′-rCrCrArGrUrArArGrGrArGrArCrUrUrGrArArArUrUrCrAGA-3′ and antisense 5′-rUrCrUrGrArArUrUrUrCrArArGrUrCrUrCrCrUrUrArCrUrGrGrUrU-3′; PIAS1, sense 5′-rUrGrGrUrUrArUrGrArGrCrCrUrUrArGrArGrUrUrUrCrUGA-3′ and antisense 5′-rUrCrArGrArArArCrUrCrUrArArGrGrCrUrCrArUrArArCrCrArUrU-3′; and PIAS3, sense 5′-rCrArCrUrGrArUrCrArArGrGrArGrArArArUrUrGrArCrUGC-3′ and antisense 5′-rGrCrArGrUrCrArArUrUrUrCrUrCrCrUrUrGrArUrCrArGrUrGrCrC-3′. Dharmafect was used to transfect siRNA into cells. Expression plasmids were introduced into cells with BioT transfection reagent (Bioland Inc.) according to the instruction of the vendor, and empty vector DNA was used to provide equal amount of DNA in each transfection. PCR primers for p53 target gene quantification are as follows: p21, forward 5′-CTGGAGACTCTCAGGGTCGAA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGATTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGA-3′; Noxa, forward 5′-CTCTTTCCTCCTCGCCACTT-3′ and reverse 5′-CGTGCACCTCCTGAGAAAAC-3′; Tsp1, 5′-GGGAAGAAAATCATGGCTGA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTCGCACGTTCTAGGAGTC-3′; Mdm2 mRNA (p2 promoter), forward 5′-CGATTGGAGGGTAGACCTGT-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTCTCTTGTTCCGAAGCTG-3′; Mdm2 (last exon), forward 5′-CAGACGGGGACTAGCTTTTG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGGTTGCAGTGAGCCAAGAT-3′; and Gapdh, forward 5′-CATGGGTGTGAACCATGAGA-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGTGATGGCATGGACTGTG-3′. RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit, and cDNA was generated using SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Anti-SKI, p53, and Ubc9 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma (A1205). Anti-HA antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Anti-SUMO1 antibody was from Epitomics. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, cells were collected by scraping or trypsinization and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitations were performed with appropriate antibody and protein A- or G-Sepharose (Upstate Biotechnology). Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto, Pierce). CellTiter Glo (Promega Inc.) was used to measure relative cell number according to the manufacturer. For FACS analysis to gauge the sub-G1 DNA content, the cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol followed by RNase treatment and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide staining, and the cells were then analyzed by FACS. Expression plasmid for His6-MDM2 was transfected into 293T cells together with other expression plasmids. 40 h after transfection, cells were collected and lysed in 150 μl of RIPA buffer (regular buffer + 0.1% SDS + 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was mixed with 8 m guanidine hydrochloride to obtain 6 m guanidine hydrochloride with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT. This lysate was centrifuged at room temperature for 10 min, and the supernatant was mixed with 20 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads in 50% bead slurry. After binding for 3 h, the beads were washed three times with urea buffer (8 m urea with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5)) followed by incubation with sample buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was then separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. SKI is a transforming oncoprotein for chicken embryo fibroblast cells upon overexpression. Previously, we and others have established that SKI can interact with Smad proteins and negatively regulate TGFβ signal transduction (13Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. The Ski oncoprotein interacts with the Smad proteins to repress TGFβ signaling.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Sun Y. Liu X. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Interaction of the Ski oncoprotein with Smad3 regulates TGF-β signaling.Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 15Xu W. Angelis K. Danielpour D. Haddad M.M. Bischof O. Campisi J. Stavnezer E. Medrano E.E. Ski acts as a co-repressor with Smad2 and Smad3 to regulate the response to type β transforming growth factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and it was widely thought that this inhibition of TGFβ signaling is the underlying mechanism of its transforming activity. Although this mechanistic explanation is plausible, we suspected that other mechanism(s) might also be involved in the oncogenic activity of SKI. Therefore, we examined in cells with overexpression of SKI the abundance of p53 protein, one of the essential tumor suppressor proteins in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. As shown in Fig. 1A, overexpression of SKI in mink lung epithelial cells leads to a decrease of p53, and this reduction is independent of the status of TGFβ signaling (data not shown). Consistent with this reduction, the protein level of p21waf1, one of the p53 target genes, also decreases. Moreover, this reduced p53 level is likely a result of decreased metabolic stability as its half-life is apparently reduced in cells with overexpression of SKI (Fig. 1B). These findings therefore suggested the possibility that a higher level of SKI results in a reduction of p53, thus resulting in cellular transformation. We further tested whether in a transient overexpression system SKI can also cause a reduction of p53. As shown in Fig. 1C, in human colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 cells with or without endogenous Tp53 (see supplemental Fig. 1), overexpression of SKI by itself cannot decrease p53 levels; however, SKI can enhance the reduction of p53 caused by the wild type MDM2, the main ubiquitin E3 ligase for p53, but not the RING finger mutant of MDM2 (C464A) (31Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Oncoprotein MDM2 is a ubiquitin ligase E3 for tumor suppressor p53.FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a higher level of SKI can result in an MDM2-dependent p53 reduction likely through enhanced p53 degradation. To rule out the possibility that SKI can only regulate p53 in an overexpression system, we also examined the impact of SKI depletion on endogenous p53 activity. As shown in Fig. 1D, siRNA-mediated loss-of-function of SKI in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP results in elevated p53 levels and enhanced apoptosis as determined by cell number enumeration through measurement of ATP levels as well as of sub-G1 DNA content in a fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis (Fig. 1, E and F). Consistent with these findings, we also found that a subset of p53 target genes are up-regulated in response to a reduction of SKI and up-regulation of p53 (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that SKI with both physiological and quasi-physiological expressions can negatively regulate p53 through MDM2, and this aspect of SKI is likely a major contributor for its transforming activity. p53 is a major tumor suppressor protein that is inactivated in many human cancers. Nearly half of the human cancers harbor mutations of Tp53, whereas p53 is inactivated in a large proportion of tumors without Tp53 mutation through a multitude of mechanisms. For example, overexpression of MDM2, loss of the p14Arf protein, which is a negative regular of MDM2, and expression of viral oncoproteins, including HPV16 E6, adenovirus E1A, and SV40 large T antigen (32Hollstein M. Hainaut P. Massively regulated genes. the example of Tp53.J. Pathol. 2010; 220: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), can all lead to p53 inactivation. Although several ubiquitin E3 ligases have been shown to regulate p53 levels (33Brooks C.L. Gu W. p53 ubiquitination. Mdm2 and beyond.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), the genetically modified mouse without Mdm2 has unequivocally demonstrated the centrality of Mdm2 in regulating the p53 protein level (34Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Regulating the p53 pathway. In vitro hypotheses, in vivo veritas.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). As described earlier, we found that SKI can enhance the MDM2-mediated p53 decrease (Fig. 1, A and C); therefore, we examined whether SKI can positively regulate MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. As shown in Fig. 2A, although expression of MDM2 alone enhanced the ubiquitination of p53, co-expression of SKI dramatically increased the p53 ubiquitination shown both by the ubiquitin in the p53 immunoprecipitation as well as p53 in the immunoprecipitation of ubiquitin (supplemental Fig. 2). These results suggest that SKI can enhance MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and thus proteasomal degradation, which likely results in a decreased p53 level. It has been shown that a mutant SKI with an insertion of four amino acids, alanine, arginine, proline, and glycine (ARPG) replacing aspartic acid at position 181, inactivated the transforming function of SKI in chicken embryo fibroblast cells (35Colmenares C. Teumer J.K. Stavnezer E. Transformation-defective v-ski induces MyoD and myogenin expression but not myotube formation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and we therefore tested whether the transforming capacity of SKI is correlated with its ability to enhance ubiquitination of p53. As shown in Fig. 2B, lane 4, expression of the SKI mutant ARPG, at a comparable level of wild type SKI protein, did not enhance, if reduced, p53 ubiquitination, suggesting that the transforming ability of SKI is tightly associated with its interaction with MDM2 to result in p53 ubiquitination. In addition, we also tested whether SKI at a physiological level can regulate MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 2C, siRNA-mediated reduction of endogenous SKI protein also reduced p53 ubiquitination conferred upon by MDM2 expression. These results suggest that SKI at both normal and overexpression levels is capable of enhancing MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53, and this activity is tightly associated with the transforming function of SKI. The ability of SKI to enhance MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 suggests several possible modes of action of SKI in the regulation of p53. It is possible that SKI directly regulates p53's propensity of being ubiquitinated by MDM2 followed by proteosomal degradation. It is also possible that SKI can positively enhance the activity of MDM2 through direct physical interaction with MDM2; alternatively, SKI can regulate MDM2 through post-translational modification without direct physical interaction. We established that in an overexpression system, SKI could physically interact with MDM2 (supplemental Fig. 3). However, repeated attempts in a variety of cell types failed to demonstrate this physical interaction at endogenous expression levels. Nevertheless, we can clearly demonstrate that overexpression of SKI increases the abundance of MDM2, consistent with its ability to decrease the p53 level (Fig. 3, A, and middle panel of B). Conversely, a depletion of SKI by siRNA in HepG2 cells can decrease endogenous MDM2 levels (Fig. 3B, right panel), supporting the view that SKI can positively regulate the abundance of MDM2. Moreover, the increased level of MDM2 by SKI is likely a result of increased stability of MDM2 as shown in Fig. 3C, whereas the SKI mutant ARPG fails to increase the stability of MDM2 (Fig. 3C, right panel). These results suggest that SKI can functionally enhance MDM2, likely its protein level or activity, yet it does not do so through high affinity or direct physical interaction with MDM2. It is known that MDM2 can be broadly regulated by two biochemical mechanisms as follows: one involves post-translational modification, and the other involves proteinaceous regulators that modulate its cellular localization and activity (36Sui G.

https://openalex.org/W2096826825,"Capping protein (CP) controls the polymerization of actin filaments by capping their barbed ends. In lamellipodia, CP dissociates from the actin cytoskeleton rapidly, suggesting the possible existence of an uncapping factor, for which the protein CARMIL (capping protein, Arp2/3 and myosin-I linker) is a candidate. CARMIL binds to CP via two motifs. One, the CP interaction (CPI) motif, is found in a number of unrelated proteins; the other motif is unique to CARMILs, the CARMIL-specific interaction motif. A 115-aa CARMIL fragment of CARMIL with both motifs, termed the CP-binding region (CBR), binds to CP with high affinity, inhibits capping, and causes uncapping. We wanted to understand the structural basis for this function. We used a collection of mutants affecting the actin-binding surface of CP to test the possibility of a steric-blocking model, which remained open because a region of CBR was not resolved in the CBR/CP co-crystal structure. The CP actin-binding mutants bound CBR normally. In addition, a CBR mutant with all residues of the unresolved region changed showed nearly normal binding to CP. Having ruled out a steric blocking model, we tested an allosteric model with molecular dynamics. We found that CBR binding induces changes in the conformation of the actin-binding surface of CP. In addition, ∼30-aa truncations on the actin-binding surface of CP decreased the affinity of CBR for CP. Thus, CARMIL promotes uncapping by binding to a freely accessible site on CP bound to a filament barbed end and inducing a change in the conformation of the actin-binding surface of CP."
https://openalex.org/W2117008886,"The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is regulated by multiple extracellular stimuli, including shear stress. Previous studies suggest that the extracellular finger domains of ENaC α and γ subunits contain allosteric regulatory modules. However, the role of the finger domain in the shear stress response is unknown. We examined whether mutations of specific residues in the finger domain of the α subunit altered the response of channels to shear stress. We observed that Trp substitutions at multiple sites within the tract αLys-250-αLeu-290 altered the magnitude or kinetics of channel activation by shear stress. Consistent with these findings, deletion of two predicted peripheral β strands (αIle-251-αTyr-268) led to slower channel activation by shear stress, suggesting that these structures participate in the shear stress response. The effects of mutations on the shear stress response did not correlate with their effects on allosteric Na(+) inhibition (i.e. Na(+) self-inhibition), indicating a divergence within the finger domain regarding mechanisms by which the channel responds to these two external stimuli. This result contrasts with well correlated effects we previously observed at sites near the extracellular mouth of the pore, suggesting mechanistic convergence in proximity to the pore. Our results suggest that the finger domain has an important role in the modulation of channel activity in response to shear stress."
https://openalex.org/W2021675233,"The nuclear pore complex gates nucleocytoplasmic transport through a massive, eight-fold symmetric channel capped by a nucleoplasmic basket and structurally unique, cytoplasmic fibrils whose tentacles bind and regulate asymmetric traffic. The conserved Nup82 complex, composed of Nsp1, Nup82, and Nup159, forms the unique cytoplasmic fibrils that regulate mRNA nuclear export. Although the nuclear pore complex plays a fundamental, conserved role in nuclear trafficking, structural information about the cytoplasmic fibrils is limited. Here, we investigate the structural and biochemical interactions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nup159 and the nucleoporin, Dyn2. We find that Dyn2 is predominantly a homodimer and binds arrayed sites on Nup159, promoting the Nup159 parallel homodimerization. We present the first structure of Dyn2, determined at 1.85 Å resolution, complexed with a Nup159 target peptide. Dyn2 resembles homologous metazoan dynein light chains, forming homodimeric composite substrate binding sites that engage two independent 10-residue target motifs, imparting a β-strand structure to each peptide via antiparallel extension of the Dyn2 core β-sandwich. Dyn2 recognizes a highly conserved QT motif while allowing sequence plasticity in the flanking residues of the peptide. Isothermal titration calorimetric analysis of the comparative binding of Dyn2 to two Nup159 target sites shows similar affinities (18 and 13 μm), but divergent thermal binding modes. Dyn2 homodimers are arrayed in the crystal lattice, likely mimicking the arrayed architecture of Dyn2 on the Nup159 multivalent binding sites. Crystallographic interdimer interactions potentially reflect a cooperative basis for Dyn2-Nup159 complex formation. Our data highlight the determinants that mediate oligomerization of the Nup82 complex and promote a directed, elongated cytoplasmic fibril architecture. The nuclear pore complex gates nucleocytoplasmic transport through a massive, eight-fold symmetric channel capped by a nucleoplasmic basket and structurally unique, cytoplasmic fibrils whose tentacles bind and regulate asymmetric traffic. The conserved Nup82 complex, composed of Nsp1, Nup82, and Nup159, forms the unique cytoplasmic fibrils that regulate mRNA nuclear export. Although the nuclear pore complex plays a fundamental, conserved role in nuclear trafficking, structural information about the cytoplasmic fibrils is limited. Here, we investigate the structural and biochemical interactions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nup159 and the nucleoporin, Dyn2. We find that Dyn2 is predominantly a homodimer and binds arrayed sites on Nup159, promoting the Nup159 parallel homodimerization. We present the first structure of Dyn2, determined at 1.85 Å resolution, complexed with a Nup159 target peptide. Dyn2 resembles homologous metazoan dynein light chains, forming homodimeric composite substrate binding sites that engage two independent 10-residue target motifs, imparting a β-strand structure to each peptide via antiparallel extension of the Dyn2 core β-sandwich. Dyn2 recognizes a highly conserved QT motif while allowing sequence plasticity in the flanking residues of the peptide. Isothermal titration calorimetric analysis of the comparative binding of Dyn2 to two Nup159 target sites shows similar affinities (18 and 13 μm), but divergent thermal binding modes. Dyn2 homodimers are arrayed in the crystal lattice, likely mimicking the arrayed architecture of Dyn2 on the Nup159 multivalent binding sites. Crystallographic interdimer interactions potentially reflect a cooperative basis for Dyn2-Nup159 complex formation. Our data highlight the determinants that mediate oligomerization of the Nup82 complex and promote a directed, elongated cytoplasmic fibril architecture."
https://openalex.org/W1966139811,"This study describes a novel bifunctional metallocarboxypeptidase and serine protease inhibitor (SmCI) isolated from the tentacle crown of the annelid Sabellastarte magnifica. SmCI is a 165-residue glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 19.69 kDa (mass spectrometry) and 18 cysteine residues forming nine disulfide bonds. Its cDNA was cloned and sequenced by RT-PCR and nested PCR using degenerated oligonucleotides. Employing this information along with data derived from automatic Edman degradation of peptide fragments, the SmCI sequence was fully characterized, indicating the presence of three bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor/Kunitz domains and its high homology with other Kunitz serine protease inhibitors. Enzyme kinetics and structural analyses revealed SmCI to be an inhibitor of human and bovine pancreatic metallocarboxypeptidases of the A-type (but not B-type), with nanomolar K(i) values. SmCI is also capable of inhibiting bovine pancreatic trypsin, chymotrypsin, and porcine pancreatic elastase in varying measures. When the inhibitor and its nonglycosylated form (SmCI N23A mutant) were overproduced recombinantly in a Pichia pastoris system, they displayed the dual inhibitory properties of the natural form. Similarly, two bi-domain forms of the inhibitor (recombinant rSmCI D1-D2 and rSmCI D2-D3) as well as its C-terminal domain (rSmCI-D3) were also overproduced. Of these fragments, only the rSmCI D1-D2 bi-domain retained inhibition of metallocarboxypeptidase A but only partially, indicating that the whole tri-domain structure is required for such capability in full. SmCI is the first proteinaceous inhibitor of metallocarboxypeptidases able to act as well on another mechanistic class of proteases (serine-type) and is the first of this kind identified in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2001114171,"Direct animal behavior can be inferred from the fossil record only in exceptional circumstances. The exceptional mode of preservation of ammonoid shells in the Posidonia Shale (Lower Jurassic, lower Toarcian) of Dotternhausen in southern Germany, with only the organic periostracum preserved, provides an excellent opportunity to observe the contents of the ammonoid body chamber because this periostracum is translucent. Here, we report upon three delicate lobsters preserved within a compressed ammonoid specimen of Harpoceras falciferum. We attempt to explain this gregarious behavior. The three lobsters were studied using standard microscopy under low angle light. The lobsters belong to the extinct family of the Eryonidae; further identification was not possible. The organic material of the three small lobsters is preserved more than halfway into the ammonoid body chamber. The lobsters are closely spaced and are positioned with their tails oriented toward each other. The specimens are interpreted to represent corpses rather than molts. The lobsters probably sought shelter in preparation for molting or against predators such as fish that were present in Dotternhausen. Alternatively, the soft tissue of the ammonoid may have been a source of food that attracted the lobsters, or it may have served as a long-term residency for the lobsters (inquilinism). The lobsters represent the oldest known example of gregariousness amongst lobsters and decapods in the fossil record. Gregarious behavior in lobsters, also known for extant lobsters, thus developed earlier in earth's history than previously known. Moreover, this is one of the oldest known examples of decapod crustaceans preserved within cephalopod shells."
https://openalex.org/W2067703001,"Freshwater biodiversity has declined dramatically in Europe in recent decades. Because of massive habitat pollution and morphological degradation of water bodies, many once widespread species persist in small fractions of their original range. These range contractions are generally believed to be accompanied by loss of intraspecific genetic diversity, due to the reduction of effective population sizes and the extinction of regional genetic lineages. We aimed to assess the loss of genetic diversity and its significance for future potential reintroduction of the long-tailed mayfly Palingenia longicauda (Olivier), which experienced approximately 98% range loss during the past century. Analysis of 936 bp of mitochondrial DNA of 245 extant specimens across the current range revealed a surprisingly large number of haplotypes (87), and a high level of haplotype diversity (). In contrast, historic specimens (6) from the lost range (Rhine catchment) were not differentiated from the extant Rába population (, ), despite considerable geographic distance separating the two rivers. These observations can be explained by an overlap of the current with the historic (Pleistocene) refugia of the species. Most likely, the massive recent range loss mainly affected the range which was occupied by rapid post-glacial dispersal. We conclude that massive range losses do not necessarily coincide with genetic impoverishment and that a species' history must be considered when estimating loss of genetic diversity. The assessment of spatial genetic structures and prior phylogeographic information seems essential to conserve once widespread species."
https://openalex.org/W2091267904,"A peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase, Pin1, regulates insulin signal transduction. Pin1 reduces responses to insulin stimulation by binding CRTC2 (CREB-regulated transcriptional co-activator 2) and PPARγ (peroxisome prolifereator- activated receptor γ), but conversely enhances insulin signaling by binding IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1), Akt kinase, and Smad3. Therefore, it is still unclear whether Pin1 inhibits or enhances adipose cell differentiation.Pin1(-/-) and wild-type mice were fed with high fat diets and adipose tissue weight was measured. Compared to wild-type mice, Pin1(-/-) mice had lower adipose tissue weight, while the weight of other tissues was similar. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), prepared from both groups of mice, were induced to differentiate into adipose cells by stimulation with insulin. However, the rate of differentiation of MEFs from Pin1(-/-) mice was less than that of MEFs from wild-type mice. The rate of insulin-induced MEF cell differentiation in Pin1(-/-) mice was restored by increasing expression of Pin1. We found that Pin1 binds to phosphoThr172- and phosphoSer271-Pro sites in CREB suppress the activity in COS-7 cells.Pin1 enhanced the uptake of triglycerides and the differentiation of MEF cells into adipose cells in response to insulin stimulation. Results of this study suggest that Pin1 down-regulation could be a potential approach in obesity-related dysfunctions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis."

Here, we found that S. aureus culture supernatant inhibited colony spreading. We purified δ-hemolysin (Hld, δ-toxin), a major protein secreted from S. aureus, as a compound that inhibits colony spreading. The culture supernatants of hld-disrupted mutants had 30-fold lower colony-spreading inhibitory activity than those of the parent strain. Furthermore, hld-disrupted mutants had higher colony-spreading ability than the parent strain. These results suggest that S. aureus negatively regulates colony spreading by secreting δ-hemolysin."
https://openalex.org/W2009252975,"Efficient adaptive immune responses require the localization of T lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs and inflamed tissues. To achieve correct localization of T lymphocytes, the migration of these cells is initiated and directed by adhesion molecules and chemokines. It has recently been shown that the inhibitory surface molecule CD152 (CTLA-4) initiates Th cell migration, but the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains to be elucidated. Using CD4 T lymphocytes derived from OVA-specific TCR transgenic CD152-deficient and CD152-competent mice, we demonstrate that chemokine-triggered signal transduction is differentially regulated by CD152 via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). In the presence of CD152 signaling, the chemoattractant CCL4 selectively induces the full activation of Akt via phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 in pro-inflammatory Th lymphocytes expressing the cognate chemokine receptor CCR5. Akt signals lead to cytoskeleton rearrangements, which are indispensable for migration. Therefore, this novel Akt-modulating function of CD152 signals affecting T cell migration demonstrates that boosting CD152 or its down-stream signal transduction could aid therapies aimed at sensitizing T lymphocytes for optimal migration, thus contributing to a precise and effective immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2016059175,"The interplay of light and life has fascinated me since my college years. In the introductory biology laboratory at the University of Chicago, we isolated chloroplasts and carried out the Hill reaction, in which light leads to the reduction of an indicator dye with the concomitant generation of O2. I vividly recall my excitement on seeing this graphic demonstration of key features of photosynthesis in a test tube. Equally important were my evenings as a waiter at the Quadrangle Club, where I had the good fortune of serving James Franck, a distinguished emeritus professor of chemistry who had received the Nobel Prize in 1925 for carrying out experiments that established the validity of Bohr's model of the atom. My task was simple because he invariably ordered a lean veal sandwich for dinner, and so there was time for conversation. Franck told me about his current interest in the mechanism of photosynthesis and his early research on energy transfer. In 1923, Franck and his graduate student Günther Cario reported that excitation of mercury led to the emission of thallium in a gaseous mixture of the two atoms (1Cario G. Franck J. Uber sensibilisierte fluoreszenz von gasen.Z. Physik. 1923; 17: 202-212Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This sensitized fluorescence revealed that electronic excitation energy can be transferred between atoms by a direct electromagnetic interaction. Later in the quarter, Franck remarked to me, “One day, you too might work on energy transfer.” That day came two years later, in 1957, when I spent a very rewarding summer as a research student at the Argonne National Laboratory under the mentorship of Douglas Smith. He introduced me to photodynamic action, a process in which light activates a photosensitizing dye in the presence of O2 to induce cellular damage, and encouraged me to read about energy transfer because it often plays a key role in effecting the light-induced damage. I learned that energy transfer can take place between any two chromophores provided that the emission spectrum of the energy donor overlaps the absorption spectrum of the energy acceptor. I was captivated by Theodor Förster's theory for dipole-dipole energy transfer, which explicitly predicted the rate and efficiency of transfer as a function of spectroscopic and geometric variables (2Förster T. Zwischenmolekulare energiewanderung und fluoreszenz.Ann. Physik. 1948; 437: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4920) Google Scholar). What especially grabbed me was his prediction that the transfer efficiency depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance between the donor and acceptor. During that summer and the following one, I learned how to carry out fluorescence measurements and label proteins. My first published paper dealt with energy transfer from aromatic amino acids in chymotrypsinogen to attached dansyl groups (3Stryer L. Intramolecular resonance transfer of energy in proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At a bioenergetics meeting at Brookhaven in 1959, where I met Förster, I reviewed the literature on energy transfer in proteins and suggested that energy transfer could be used as a probe to gain insight into the conformation of biological macromolecules (4Stryer L. Energy transfer in proteins and polypeptides.Symp. Bioenerg. Radiat. Res. Suppl. 1960; 2: 432-451Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A highlight of that year was visiting Franck to let him know that I was indeed working on energy transfer. As a medical student at Harvard University, I carried out research under the mentorship of Elkan Blout, who was Director of Chemical Research at Polaroid by day and head of a basic research laboratory at Children's Hospital by night. At Polaroid, Elkan worked closely with Edwin Land in developing instant color photography, and at Harvard, he synthesized synthetic polypeptides as models of proteins and studied their conformations using spectroscopic techniques. I wanted to find out how dyes bound to synthetic polypeptides altered their conformation and began by monitoring the known helix-coil transitions of poly-l-glutamic acid and poly-l-lysine by optical rotatory dispersion using a manual spectropolarimeter. I then turned to their complexes with dyes. To my surprise, the optical rotation of acriflavine bound to the helical form of poly-l-glutamic acid changed dramatically with wavelength in the vicinity of the visible absorption band of the bound dye. The helical polypeptide by itself showed only a monotonic change in optical rotation in this spectral region, and the dye alone was optically inactive. I presented these data to Elkan that evening and told him that I was puzzled by the large magnitude of the optical rotation of the dye-polypeptide complex and that it went positive and then negative in such a short-wavelength interval. Elkan's eyes sparkled as he told me, “Ah, you've just seen a Cotton effect!”; he proceeded to give me an illuminating tutorial on how optical activity arises in the absorption bands of chiral molecules and is expressed as circular dichroism or circular birefringence. We were then excited to find that acriflavine bound to the random coil form of the polypeptide exhibited no Cotton effect in the visible band. These experiments revealed that symmetric chromophores can exhibit induced optical activity when bound to helical macromolecules (5Blout E.R. Stryer L. Anomalous optical rotatory dispersion of dye: polypeptide complexes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1959; 45: 1591-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the start of my fourth year of medical school, I decided to pursue a career in basic research. A few weeks later, Elkan had a plan for my postdoctoral years: I was to first move across the river to strengthen my background in physics, chemistry, and mathematics under the mentorship of Edward Purcell in the Department of Physics at Harvard and then join John Kendrew at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory in Cambridge, England, to learn x-ray crystallography. A fellowship from the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation made it possible for me to pursue these exceptional opportunities. Indeed, my postdoctoral years in the two Cambridges turned out to be among the best in my life. I was incredibly fortunate to have had Purcell as a very inspiring and supportive tutor. Kendrew then opened the doors of the MRC to me at an auspicious time in structural biology and molecular genetics. Together with Herman Watson, I used the difference Fourier method to see the precise mode of binding of the azide ion to the heme iron atom in azide ferrimyoglobin (6Stryer L. Kendrew J.C. Watson H.C. The mode of attachment of the azide ion to sperm whale metmyoglobin.J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This crystallographic study demonstrated that the mode of binding of a small molecule to a protein can readily be determined if the native and complexed crystals are isomorphous. A very attractive offer of a faculty appointment at Stanford University from Arthur Kornberg and his colleagues in the biochemistry department led me to leave the MRC Laboratory earlier than planned. In the autumn of 1963, I went to Stanford to start my own research program and decided to pursue fluorescence spectroscopy as a means of gaining insight into the conformation and dynamics of protein molecules in solution. Gregorio Weber, a pioneer in fluorescence spectroscopy, had shown that some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are virtually non-fluorescent in solution become highly fluorescent on binding to proteins (7Weber G. Laurence D.J. Fluorescent indicators of adsorption in aqueous solution and on the solid phase.Biochem. J. 1954; 56: xxxiPubMed Google Scholar). I surmised that the markedly enhanced emission of these compounds might be due to their binding to non-polar crevices in proteins. I had in mind the non-polar niches that serve as the heme-binding sites in myoglobin and hemoglobin and proceeded to prepare the heme-free forms of these proteins. Indeed, apomyoglobin and apohemoglobin, but not their heme-bound forms, bound 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) in a highly specific manner (8Stryer L. The interaction of a naphthalene dye with apomyoglobin and apohemoglobin. A fluorescent probe of non-polar binding sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of ANS increased 200-fold, and the emission spectrum shifted from green to blue by 60 nm. The fluorescence quantum yield of ANS likewise increased in going from water to less polar solvents, and there was a concomitant blue shift of the emission maximum. These experiments suggested that ANS and related chromophores would be useful in detecting changes in the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins that alter the presence and accessibility of non-polar regions. During my medical school and postdoctoral years, I thought often about fluorescence energy transfer and particularly about Förster's prediction that the transfer efficiency depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance between the donor and acceptor. It seemed to me that this steep dependence on distance could be exploited to measure distances in proteins between sites bearing chromophores with appropriate spectroscopic properties, but it was essential to first test this central prediction of Förster's theory. The most direct way would be to synthesize a series of compounds in which the donor and acceptor moieties were separated by known distances. Helical synthetic polypeptides first came to mind during my medical school years, but the synthesis of a series of oligomers by conventional methods seemed very daunting and out of reach. A major breakthrough occurred in 1963 when R. Bruce Merrifield introduced solid-phase peptide synthesis, in which growing peptide chains attached to beads could be filtered and thereby washed free of reagents and byproducts at each step (9Merrifield R.B. Solid-phase peptide synthesis. I. The synthesis of a tetrapeptide.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Merrifield's solid-phase method opened the way to preparing molecular sticks of different lengths to calibrate the distance dependence of energy transfer. I chose oligomers of l-proline as spacers because it seemed likely that even short n-mers would form a type II trans-helix of the type seen in high molecular weight poly-l-proline and in the individual strands of collagen. Furthermore, the rise per residue of the prolyl trans-helix is 3.12 Å, compared with 1.5 Å for the α-helix, and so a wider span of distances would be obtained for a given range of n-mers than with an α-helix. Richard Haugland joined my laboratory as a graduate student, and we proceeded to synthesize oligomers of poly-l-proline up to the 12-mer by the solid-phase method. The energy donor was an α-naphthyl group at the carboxyl-terminal end of the peptide, and the energy acceptor was a dansyl group at the imino end. These chromophores were chosen because they fulfill the conditions for efficient transfer over distances of the order of 30 Å and have distinct absorption and emission spectra (Structure 1). Optical rotatory dispersion measurements established that the oligomers from n = 5 to 12 in ethanol were in fact in the type II trans-helical conformation. We assumed that the helix was rigid and estimated from molecular models that the distance (r) between the centers of the chromophores ranged from 12 to 46 Å for n = 1–12. The transfer efficiency (E) decreased from nearly 100% for the short oligomers to 16% for the n = 12 oligomer. Most important, the observed dependence of the transfer efficiency on distance followed an inverse 5.9 ± 0.3 power dependence (Fig. 1) (10Stryer L. Haugland R.P. Energy transfer: a spectroscopic ruler.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1967; 58: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar), in excellent agreement with the r−6 dependence predicted by Förster. We proposed then that energy transfer can serve as a spectroscopic ruler. Two years later, we showed that the transfer rate is proportional to J, the magnitude of the overlap between the emission spectrum of the energy donor and the absorption spectrum of the energy acceptor (11Haugland R.P. Yguerabide J. Stryer L. Dependence of the kinetics of singlet-singlet energy transfer on spectral overlap.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1969; 63: 23-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thereby validated another key prediction of Förster's theory. It is very gratifying to see, forty-five years later, that fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been used in thousands of studies to detect molecular associations, map the architecture of proteins and nucleic acids, and monitor conformational transitions. The application of recombinant DNA technology and the availability of a wide selection of fluorescent probes, exemplified by cyanine dyes and the green fluorescent proteins, have greatly facilitated the specific labeling of macromolecules with donors and acceptors having appropriate spectroscopic properties. Uncertainty about the value of the dipole-dipole orientation factor has been markedly reduced by using fluorescent probes that have appreciable local rotational mobility and by using donor-acceptor pairs that have different attachment and transition moment geometries. The introduction of single-molecule FRET by Ha et al. (12Ha T. Enderle T. Ogletree D.F. Chemla D.S. Selvin P.R. Weiss S. Probing the interaction between two single molecules: fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a single donor and a single acceptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) in 1996 was a major advance because it provides a window on discrete states and transitions between them without being blurred by ensemble averaging. The molecular ballet of life comes into view with single-molecule FRET, which has provided a wealth of information about molecular motors, signaling complexes, transcriptional and translational assemblies, membrane fusion machines, and protein folding dynamics (for an enticing sample, see Refs. 13Zimmermann B.

Biol. 2010; 17: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). FRET has also been ingeniously employed to create highly specific sensors for cellular imaging studies (17Tsien R.Y. Constructing and exploiting the fluorescent protein paintbox (Nobel lecture).Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2009; 48: 5612-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 18Miyawaki A. Development of probes for cellular functions using fluorescent proteins and fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 357-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The FRET harvest coming from many laboratories around the world has been remarkable. What began as a physical principle has been transformed into a powerful biological discovery tool. I have been intrigued by the molecular basis of visual excitation since my medical school days, when I visited George Wald's laboratory and learned that vision begins so simply, with the light-driven isomerization of 11-cis-retinal bound to rhodopsin to the all-trans form (19Hubbard R. Kropf A. The action of light on rhodopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1958; 44: 130-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). I was also inspired by Selig Hecht's earlier discovery that a retinal rod cell can be excited by a single photon (20Hecht S. Shlaer S. Pirenne M.H. Energy, quanta, and vision.J. Gen. Physiol. 1942; 25: 819-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). How remarkable that a 7-Å change in the geometry in a single rhodopsin molecule can generate a nerve signal! I conveyed my sense of awe and wonder in a lecture I gave in 1966 in Stanford's introductory biochemistry course and decided while lecturing that I should turn my research focus to the molecular basis of vision. My move from Stanford to Yale University in 1969 gave me the scope and opportunity to initiate this alluring exploration. We began by carrying out spectroscopic studies of rhodopsin. Our FRET experiments showed that rhodopsin is an elongated molecule with retinal bound near its center (21Wu C.W. Stryer L. Proximity relationships in rhodopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1972; 69: 1104-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We also succeeded in obtaining the resonance Raman spectrum of rhodopsin, which was technically challenging, by rapidly flowing a fresh solution into the intensely illuminated volume (22Mathies R. Oseroff A.R. Stryer L. Rapid-flow resonance Raman spectroscopy of photolabile molecules: rhodopsin and isorhodopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: l-5Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Richard Mathies brought electric field spectroscopy into the laboratory and applied it to retinal and its Schiff bases. The key finding was that retinal has a highly dipolar, vertically excited singlet state (23Mathies R. Stryer L. Retinal has a highly dipolar vertically excited singlet state: implications for vision.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1976; 73: 2169-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The 12-debye change in dipole moment on excitation corresponds to a shift of 0.21 e− across the retinal, with the ionone ring becoming more electropositive. One consequence of this charge shift is that the double bonds of the polyene chain acquire single-bond character, which would promote isomerization. The large increase in dipole moment on excitation also provides a facile electrostatic mechanism for tuning the absorption maximum of retinal, which is at 500 nm for rhodopsin and ranges from 431 to 561 nm for the cone visual pigments. Negatively charged groups positioned near the ionone ring would lower the energy of the excited state and thereby shift the absorption maximum of retinal to red. At a Gordon Conference in the summer of 1978, I was intrigued by Paul Liebman's report that a single photon can trigger the activation of hundreds of phosphodiesterase (PDE) molecules specific for cGMP in rod outer segments (ROS) provided that GTP is present (24Yee R. Liebman P.A. Light-activated phosphodiesterase of the rod outer segment. Kinetics and parameters of activation and deactivation.J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8902-8909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On my way home from this meeting, I had the good fortune of staying overnight at William Miller's home. After a delicious dinner, Miller showed me some striking electrophysiological records. He and Grant Nicol had just found that rods became depolarized when cGMP was injected in the dark into ROS (25Nicol G.D. Miller W.H. Cyclic GMP injected into retinal rod outer segments increases latency and amplitude of response to illumination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 5217-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the injection of cGMP greatly increased the latency between illumination and hyperpolarization. The simplest interpretation of these data was that cGMP is the transmitter: sodium-conducting channels are opened by cGMP in the dark and close when the cGMP level drops because of hydrolysis by the light-activated PDE. Channel closure would directly hyperpolarize the rod, in agreement with Tsuneo Tomita's finding several years earlier that light hyperpolarizes vertebrate rod cells (26Tomita T. Electrical activity of vertebrate photoreceptors.Q. Rev. Biophys. 1970; 3: 179-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). When I returned to Stanford (having moved back after seven rewarding years at Yale), I told Bernard Fung, a postdoctoral fellow in my laboratory, about these exciting results. He shared my enthusiasm for the notion that cGMP might be the transmitter, so we decided to explore the molecular mechanism by which the cGMP-specific PDE is activated by light. The requirement for GTP and Mark Bitensky's recent finding that ROS contain a light-activated GTPase (27Wheeler G.L. Bitensky M.W. A light-activated GTPase in vertebrate photoreceptors: regulation of light-activated cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) suggested that a G-protein might be a key participant in this process. Our first experiment was designed to detect the binding of guanyl nucleotides to ROS membranes by incubating them with [α-32P]GTP and washing with a nucleotide-free buffer. We were rewarded by finding that 1) the ROS contained radioactive GDP following incubation, and 2) subsequent bright illumination led to the release of the bound GDP. Because ROS are rich in GTP, the question arose as to whether GTP influences the photorelease of tightly bound GDP. Indeed, GTP greatly enhanced the photorelease of GDP. In the presence of 1 μm GTP, release of GDP was half-maximal when fewer than 1 in 104 rhodopsins were excited. The next question was what happens when ROS are incubated with a hydrolysis-resistant analog of GTP such as guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). The striking finding was that a single photoexcited rhodopsin catalyzed the uptake of 500 molecules of this GTP analog (28Fung B.K. Stryer L. Photolyzed rhodopsin catalyzes the exchange of GTP for bound GDP in retinal rod outer segments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our observation of this highly amplified GTP-GDP exchange led us to propose that the GTP form of a guanyl nucleotide-binding protein, which we subsequently called transducin, is the first amplified intermediate in visual excitation. We also proposed that the GTP form of transducin is the activator of the PDE. The flow of information postulated by us in 1980 was R* → T-GTP → PDE*, where R* is photoexcited rhodopsin, T-GTP is transducin bearing GTP, and PDE* is the activated form of the phosphodiesterase. Our scheme predicted that 1) T-GTP can be formed in the absence of the phosphodiesterase, and 2) the phosphodiesterase can be activated in the absence of photoexcited rhodopsin. The next step was to purify transducin, a task facilitated by Hermann Kühn's report that transducin binds tightly to illuminated ROS membranes in the absence of GTP and can be released into solution by adding GTP (29Kühn H. Light- and GTP-regulated interaction of GTPase and other proteins with bovine photoreceptor membranes.Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We added a final hexyl-agarose chromatography step and observed that transducin consists of three polypeptide chains: Tα (∼39 kDa), Tβ (∼36 kDa), and Tγ (∼10 kDa). We then found that reconstituted membranes containing only rhodopsin and transducin exhibit light-activated GTPase activity and light-triggered binding of GTP or a GTP analog. A single R* led to the uptake of Gpp(NH)p by 71 molecules of transducin (Fig. 2). This reconstituted system revealed that the role of photoexcited rhodopsin is to activate transducin by catalyzing the exchange of GTP for bound GDP (30Fung B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Flow of information in the light-triggered cyclic nucleotide cascade of vision.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). We were then very eager to learn whether the GTP form of transducin, by itself, activates the PDE. Fung and James Hurley, who had recently joined my laboratory, prepared transducin containing Gpp(NH)p. We encountered a pleasant surprise in purifying this complex. Transducin had dissociated into Tα and Tβγ following the exchange of Gpp(NH)p for GDP, and it was the α-subunit that bore the GTP analog. Now we could ask a more precise question than was originally planned: do either Tα-Gpp(NH)p or Tβγ activate the PDE? We found that Tα bearing the GTP analog was highly effective in activating PDE in the dark, whereas Tβγ had no effect. Thus, Tα-GTP is the amplified information-carrying intermediate in the photoactivation of the PDE (30Fung B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Flow of information in the light-triggered cyclic nucleotide cascade of vision.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Tα-GTP greatly stimulates the catalytic activity of the PDE by pulling away its inhibitory subunits, which hold the PDE in check in the dark (31Pober J.S. Bitensky M.W. Light-regulated enzymes of vertebrate retinal rods.Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 11: 265-301PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Purification and characterization of the γ-regulatory subunit of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase from retinal rod outer segments.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11094-11099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent hydrolysis of Tα-GTP to Tα-GDP returns the PDE to the dark state. Also crucial for the return to the dark state, as shown by Kühn, is the deactivation of R* by multiple phosphorylations of its C-terminal region, followed by the binding of arrestin, which caps these sites and prevents R* from interacting with transducin (33Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kühn H. Phosphodiesterase activation by photoexcited rhodopsin is quenched when rhodopsin is phosphorylated and binds the intrinsic 48-kDa protein of rod outer segments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Our experiments established that transducin cycles between a quiescent T-GDP state in the dark and a transiently active Tα-GTP state following illumination (Fig. 3). The light-activated transducin cycle is powered by the hydrolysis of GTP rather than by the energy of the absorbed photon, which serves only to generate a very reliable trigger, R*. The cycle flows unidirectionally once triggered by R*, whose only role is to bind transducin to stabilize the transition state, an empty nucleotide-binding site. R* accelerates GTP-GDP exchange by a factor of ∼107, corresponding to a lowering of the energy of the transition state by ∼10 kcal/mol. The reaction partners have been designed so that R* has high affinity for transducin devoid of a bound nucleotide but not for T-GDP or T-GTP. Like other efficient catalysts, R* is specifically complementary to the transition state but not to the substrate or product. The free energy profile of the transducin cycle has been optimized for 1) the rapid formation of Tα-GTP, 2) a high degree of amplification, 3) effective operation over a wide dynamic range of illumination intensity, and 4) maintenance of a very low level of Tα-GTP in the dark (34Stryer L. Visual transduction: design and recurring motifs.Chem. Scripta B. 1987; 27: 161-171Google Scholar). Elegant electrophysiological studies by Denis Baylor and co-workers revealed that absorption of a single photon blocks the influx of millions of sodium ions into ROS by closing hundreds of channels in the plasma membrane to give the consequent hyperpolarization (35Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.W. Responses of retinal rods to single photons.J. Physiol. 1979; 288: 613-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). What is the link between the light-induced lowering of the level of cGMP and channel closure? The answer proved to be unexpectedly simple. Evgeniy Fesenko and co-workers incisively demonstrated in 1985 that cGMP directly opens cation-specific channels in excised patches of the plasma membrane (36Fesenko E.E. Kolesnikov S.S. Lyubarsky A.L. Induction by cyclic GMP of cationic conductance in plasma membrane of retinal rod outer segment.Nature. 1985; 313: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). This key finding provided the final link in the excitation chain and gave us a mechanistic understanding of what makes a retina rod cell so exquisitely sensitive. Three stages of amplification, the generation of many Tα-GTP complexes by R*, the hydrolysis of many cGMPs by activated PDE, and the consequent blockage of the flow of many cations through a single cGMP-gated channel, give rise to the single-photon sensitivity of rods. Subsequent studies carried out in numerous laboratories have delineated how recovery of the dark state and adaptation over a very wide range of background light levels are achieved (for reviews, see Refs. 37Luo D.G. Xue T. Yau K.W. How vision begins: an odyssey.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9855-9862Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and 38Arshavsky V.Y. Burns M.E. Photoreceptor signaling: supporting vision across a wide range of light intensities.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 1620-1626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cone cells, which mediate color vision and vision at high light levels, use a very similar transduction cascade; the cone homologs of the signaling molecules of rods are optimized for speed rather than sensitivity. What is especially satisfying is that the G-protein cascade of vision exemplifies fundamental principles of signal transduction that are ubiquitously employed in eukaryotes. In 1981, Vernon Oi, a postdoctoral fellow in my laboratory with expertise in immunology, challenged me to devise better long wavelength-emitting fluorescent pro"

It is not known whether drugs that affect IR such as Pioglitazone and Prednisone also affect serum HCV RNA titers independently of PEG-Interferon-α2/ribavirin treatment. The primary aim was to assess whether Pioglitazone by improving IR and/or inflammation decreases HCV viral load independently of standard of care HCV treatment. A secondary aim was to assess whether Prednisone, a drug that induces insulin resistance and stimulates HCV viral entry and replication in replicon culture systems, increases HCV viral load in this population.We designed a two-arm, parallel Pilot Study of overweight, treatment naïve genotype 4 HCV-infected patients at a public referral Liver Clinic in Giza, Egypt. The subjects received Pioglitazone (30 mg/day for 14 days) or Prednisone (40 mg/day for 4 days) in a randomized fashion, but the two arms can be considered independent pilot studies. Only changes from baseline within each arm were assessed and no contrasts of the interventions were made, as this was not an aim of the study. Among 105 consecutive HCV genotype 4 patients, 39 were enrolled based on the optimal sample size and power analysis according to the CONSORT statement; 20 to the Pioglitazone group and 19 to the Prednisone group. Pioglitazone was effective in decreasing serum HCV RNA at day-14 (n = 10; difference of means = 205,618 IU/ml; 95% CI 26,600 to 384,600; P<0.001). Although Prednisone did increase serum HCV RNA at day-4 (n = 10; change from baseline = -42,786 IU/ml; 95% CI -85,500 to -15,700; P = 0.049), the log(10) HCV RNA titers were statistically not different from baseline day-0.This is the first documentation that Pioglitazone decreases the serum HCV RNA titers independently of PEG-Interferon-α2/ribavirin treatment. The novel findings of our Study provide the foundation for basic and clinical investigations on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the Pioglitazone-induced decrease in HCV genotype 4 RNA titers.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01157975."
https://openalex.org/W1993984361,"Background Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major threat to global public health. Patients with extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), particularly those with HIV-coinfection, experience high and accelerated mortality with limited available interventions. To determine modifiable factors associated with survival, we evaluated XDR-TB patients from a community-based hospital in rural South Africa where a large number of XDR-TB cases were first detected. Methodology/Principal Findings A retrospective case control study was conducted of XDR-TB patients diagnosed from 2005–2008. Survivors, those alive at 180 days from diagnostic sputum collection date, were compared with controls who died within 180 days. Clinical, laboratory and microbiological correlates of survival were assessed in 69 survivors (median survival 565 days [IQR 384–774] and 73 non-survivors (median survival 34 days [IQR 18–90]). Among 129 HIV+ patients, multivariate analyses of modifiable factors demonstrated that negative AFB smear (AOR 8.4, CI 1.84–38.21), a lower laboratory index of routine laboratory findings (AOR 0.48, CI 0.22–1.02), CD4>200 cells/mm3 (AOR 11.53, 1.1–119.32), and receipt of antiretroviral therapy (AOR 20.9, CI 1.16–376.83) were independently associated with survival from XDR-TB. Conclusions/Significance Survival from XDR-TB with HIV-coinfection is associated with less advanced stages of both diseases at time of diagnosis, absence of laboratory markers indicative of multiorgan dysfunction, and provision of antiretroviral therapy. Survival can be increased by addressing these modifiable risk factors through policy changes and improved clinical management. Health planners and clinicians should develop programmes focusing on earlier case finding and integration of HIV and drug-resistant TB diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive activities."
https://openalex.org/W2069616912,"Lysine acetylation is a major post-translational modification of proteins and regulates many physiological processes such as metabolism, cell migration, aging, and inflammation. Proteomic studies have identified numerous lysine-acetylated proteins in human and mouse models (Kim, S. C., Sprung, R., Chen, Y., Xu, Y., Ball, H., Pei, J., Cheng, T., Kho, Y., Xiao, H., Xiao, L., Grishin, N. V., White, M., Yang, X. J., and Zhao, Y. (2006) Mol. Cell 23, 607-618). One family of proteins identified in this study was the murine glycine N-acyltransferase (GLYAT) enzymes, which are acetylated on lysine 19. Lysine 19 is a conserved residue in human glycine N-acyltransferase-like 2 (hGLYATL2) and in several other species, showing that this residue may be important for enzyme function. Mutation of lysine 19 in recombinant hGLYATL2 to glutamine (K19Q) and arginine (K19R) resulted in a 50-80% lower production of N-oleoyl glycine and N-arachidonoylglycine, indicating that lysine 19 is important for enzyme function. LC/MS/MS confirmed that Lys-19 is not acetylated in wild-type hGLYATL2, indicating that Lys-19 requires to be deacetylated for full activity. The hGLYATL2 enzyme conjugates medium- and long-chain saturated and unsaturated acyl-CoA esters to glycine, resulting in the production of N-oleoyl glycine and also N-arachidonoyl glycine. N-Oleoyl glycine and N-arachidonoyl glycine are structurally and functionally related to endocannabinoids and have been identified as signaling molecules that regulate functions like the perception of pain and body temperature and also have anti-inflammatory properties. In conclusion, acetylation of lysine(s) in hGLYATL2 regulates the enzyme activity, thus linking post-translational modification of proteins with the production of biological signaling molecules, the N-acyl glycines."
https://openalex.org/W2085811612,"Objectives The aim of this work was to develop a MRI method to determine arterial flow reserve in patients with intermittent claudication and to investigate whether this method can discriminate between patients and healthy control subjects. Methods Ten consecutive patients with intermittent claudication and 10 healthy control subjects were included. All subjects underwent vector cardiography triggered quantitative 2D cine MR phase-contrast imaging to obtain flow waveforms of the popliteal artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia. Resting flow, maximum hyperemic flow and absolute flow reserve were determined and compared between the two groups by two independent MRI readers. Also, interreader reproducibility of flow measures was reported. Results Resting flow was lower in patients compared to controls (4.9±1.6 and 11.1±3.2 mL/s in patients and controls, respectively (p<0.01)). Maximum hyperemic flow was 7.3±2.9 and 16.4±3.2 mL/s (p<0.01) and the absolute flow reserve was 2.4±1.6 and 5.3±1.3 mL/s (p<0.01), respectively in patients and controls. The interreader coefficient of variation was below 10% for all measures in both patients and controls. Conclusions Quantitative 2D MR cine phase-contrast imaging is a promising method to determine flow reserve measures in patients with peripheral arterial disease and can be helpful to discriminate patients with intermittent claudication from healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W2061667427,"We consider and analyze the influence of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on homeostatic states in synaptically coupled neuronal oscillators. In contrast to conventional models of STDP in which spike-timing affects weights of synaptic connections, we consider a model of STDP in which the time lags between pre- and/or post-synaptic spikes change internal state of pre- and/or post-synaptic neurons respectively. The analysis reveals that STDP processes of this type, modeled by a single ordinary differential equation, may ensure efficient, yet coarse, phase-locking of spikes in the system to a given reference phase. Precision of the phase locking, i.e. the amplitude of relative phase deviations from the reference, depends on the values of natural frequencies of oscillators and, additionally, on parameters of the STDP law. These deviations can be optimized by appropriate tuning of gains (i.e. sensitivity to spike-timing mismatches) of the STDP mechanism. However, as we demonstrate, such deviations can not be made arbitrarily small neither by mere tuning of STDP gains nor by adjusting synaptic weights. Thus if accurate phase-locking in the system is required then an additional tuning mechanism is generally needed. We found that adding a very simple adaptation dynamics in the form of slow fluctuations of the base line in the STDP mechanism enables accurate phase tuning in the system with arbitrary high precision. Adaptation operating at a slow time scale may be associated with extracellular matter such as matrix and glia. Thus the findings may suggest a possible role of the latter in regulating synaptic transmission in neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2105882337,"Factor (F)VIII can be activated to FVIIIa by FXa following cleavages at Arg(372), Arg(740), and Arg(1689). FXa also cleaves FVIII/FVIIIa at Arg(336) and Arg(562) resulting in inactivation of the cofactor. These inactivating cleavages occur on a slower time scale than the activating ones. We assessed the contributions to cleavage rate and cofactor function of residues flanking Arg(336), the primary site yielding FVIII(a) inactivation, following replacement of these residues with those flanking the faster-reacting Arg(740) and Arg(372) sites and the slower-reacting Arg(562) site. Replacing P4-P3' residues flanking Arg(336) with those from Arg(372) or Arg(740) resulted in ∼4-6-fold increases in rates of FXa-catalyzed inactivation of FVIIIa, which paralleled the rates of proteolysis at Arg(336). Examination of partial sequence replacements showed a predominant contribution of prime residues flanking the scissile bonds to the enhanced rates. Conversely, replacement of this sequence with residues flanking the slow-reacting Arg(562) site yielded inactivation and cleavage rates that were ∼40% that of the WT values. The capacity for FXa to activate FVIII variants where cleavage at Arg(336) was accelerated due to flanking sequence replacement showed marked reductions in peak activity, whereas reducing the cleavage rate at this site enhanced peak activity. Furthermore, plasma-based thrombin generation assays employing the variants revealed significant reductions in multiple parameter values with acceleration of Arg(336) cleavage suggesting increased down-regulation of FXase. Overall, these results are consistent with a model of competition for activating and inactivating cleavages catalyzed by FXa that is modulated in large part by sequences flanking the scissile bonds."
