https://openalex.org/W2037226098,"Insulin receptors (IRs) and insulin signaling proteins are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). To study the physiological role of insulin signaling in the brain, we created mice with a neuron-specific disruption of the IR gene (NIRKO mice). Inactivation of the IR had no impact on brain development or neuronal survival. However, female NIRKO mice showed increased food intake, and both male and female mice developed diet-sensitive obesity with increases in body fat and plasma leptin levels, mild insulin resistance, elevated plasma insulin levels, and hypertriglyceridemia. NIRKO mice also exhibited impaired spermatogenesis and ovarian follicle maturation because of hypothalamic dysregulation of luteinizing hormone. Thus, IR signaling in the CNS plays an important role in regulation of energy disposal, fuel metabolism, and reproduction."

Although it has been suggested that calorie restriction may work by reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species produced during respiration, the mechanism by which this regimen slows aging is uncertain. Here, we mimicked calorie restriction in yeast by physiological or genetic means and showed a substantial extension in life-span. This extension was not observed in strains mutant for SIR2 (which encodes the silencing protein Sir2p) or NPT1 (a gene in a pathway in the synthesis of NAD, the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). These findings suggest that the increased longevity induced by calorie restriction requires the activation of Sir2p by NAD."

The Coulomb blockade for electron tunneling is overcome completely by the Kondo effect, and the conductance reaches the unitary limit value. We compare the experimental Kondo temperature with the theoretical predictions for the spin- 12 Anderson impurity model. Excellent agreement is found throughout the Kondo regime. Phase coherence is preserved when a Kondo quantum dot is included in one of the arms of an Aharonov-Bohm ring structure, and the phase behavior differs from previous results on a non-Kondo dot."
https://openalex.org/W2131209038,"The crystal structure of the double-stranded DNA bacteriophage HK97 mature empty capsid was determined at 3.6 angstrom resolution. The 660 angstrom diameter icosahedral particle contains 420 subunits with a new fold. The final capsid maturation step is an autocatalytic reaction that creates 420 isopeptide bonds between proteins. Each subunit is joined to two of its neighbors by ligation of the side-chain lysine 169 to asparagine 356. This generates 12 pentameric and 60 hexameric rings of covalently joined subunits that loop through each other, creating protein chainmail: topologically linked protein catenanes arranged with icosahedral symmetry. Catenanes have not been previously observed in proteins and provide a stabilization mechanism for the very thin HK97 capsid."
https://openalex.org/W2042292319,"In developing ovarian follicles, the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation is tightly coordinated. Precisely how this coordination is achieved is unknown, but recent observations have suggested that molecules emitted by the oocyte are involved in the process. The newly discovered oocyte-specific growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15), is one such molecule. At present, nothing is known about the target cells and biological functions of BMP-15. To fill this gap in our knowledge, recombinant BMP-15 and its antibody were produced and used to determine BMP-15 expression and bioactivity. BMP-15 mRNA and protein were shown to be co-expressed in oocytes throughout folliculogenesis, supporting the idea that BMP-15 is a physiological regulator of follicle cell proliferation and/or differentiation. To test this, we used primary cultures of rat granulosa cells (GCs). We found that BMP-15 is a potent stimulator of GC proliferation, and importantly, the mitogenic effect was follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-independent. By contrast, BMP-15 alone had no effect on steroidogenesis. However, it produced a marked decrease in FSH-induced progesterone production, but had no effect on FSH-stimulated estradiol production. This result indicates that BMP-15 is a selective modulator of FSH action. In summary, this study identifies GCs as the first target cells for BMP-15. Moreover, it identifies the stimulation of GC proliferation and the differential regulation of two crucial steroid hormones as the first biological functions of BMP-15. Significantly, BMP-15 is the first growth factor that can coordinate GC proliferation and differentiation in a way that reflects normal physiology.

It is clear that some of these molecules are synthesized and secreted by the oocyte (1Eppig J.J. Chesnel F. Hirao Y. O'Brien M.J. Pendola F.L. Watanabe S. Wigglesworth K. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 12: 127-132PubMed Google Scholar). The current theory is that some oocyte factors act as morphogens to control follicle growth and differentiation (2Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence that this concept operates in vertebrates comes from the important work of Matzuk and co-workers (3Dong J. Albertini D.F. Nishimori K. Kumar T.R. Lu N. Matzuk M.

In 1998, another oocyte-specific growth factor was discovered by two independent laboratories. This factor, which is a new member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, was named bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15) (6Dube J.L. Wang P. Elvin J. Lyons K.M. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1809-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or GDF-9B (7Laitinen M. Vuojolainen K. Jaatinen R. Ketola I. Aaltonen J. Lehtonen E. Heikinheimo M. Ritvos O. Mech.

Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1809-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), human (6Dube J.L. Wang P. Elvin J. Lyons K.M. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1809-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and rat (9Jaatinen R. Laitinen M. Vuojolainen K. Aaltonen J. Louhio H. Heikinheimo K. Lehtonen E. Ritvos O. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 156: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) BMP-15 most closely resembles that of GDF-9 (6Dube J.L. Wang P. Elvin J. Lyons K.M. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1809-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jaatinen R. Laitinen M. Vuojolainen K. Aaltonen J. Louhio H. Heikinheimo K. Lehtonen E. Ritvos O. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 156: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). An interesting structural feature of BMP-15 and GDF-9 is that they lack the fourth cysteine residue of the seven cysteines that are typically conserved in the more than 40 members of TGF-β superfamily (6Dube J.L. Wang P. Elvin J. Lyons K.M. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1809-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the fourth cysteine is responsible for interchain disulfide bond formation, it is possible that BMP-15 and GDF-9 may be monomers or perhaps linked noncovalently as hetero- and/or homodimeric proteins. Despite its physiological significance, the target cells of BMP-15 have not been identified, and nothing is known about the biological functions of BMP-15 protein. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we report the temporal pattern of BMP-15 mRNA and protein expression during folliculogenesis and show that BMP-15 acts directly on follicular GCs to regulate their proliferation and cytodifferentiation. This is the first demonstration of the expression, the target cells, and biological function of BMP-15 protein. Ovine FSH (NIDDK-oFSH-S20) was provided by Dr. Parlow of the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (Rockville, MD). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12, medium 199, and McCoy's 5a medium were from Life Technologies Inc. (Rockville, MD). Anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (anti-Flag mAb), anti-Flag mAb agarose, and diethylstilbestrol were from Sigma-Aldrich Co. The protein coding region of human BMP-15 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from ovarian total RNA with a primer set containing the amino- or carboxyl-terminal part of prepro-BMP-15 (GenBank™ accession nos. AF082349 and AF082350). A PCR product of expected size was cloned in frame at the upstream site of Flag epitope tag (an amino acid sequence of Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) present in pCMV-Tag4A (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) and designated phBMP-15-Flag. Another expression plasmid, phBMP-15-GST, was constructed by inserting the DNA segment encoding only the mature domain of hBMP-15 in frame at the downstream site of GST present in the prokaryotic expression vector, pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA sequences of both plasmids were confirmed. A DNA segment of rat BMP-15 cDNA (nucleotides 406–814 in GenBank™ accession no.AJ132407) (9Jaatinen R. Laitinen M. Vuojolainen K. Aaltonen J. Louhio H. Heikinheimo K. Lehtonen E. Ritvos O. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 156: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from ovarian total RNA. The product was gel-purified, cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), and the DNA sequence confirmed. This plasmid, prBMP-15–409, which contained the pro-region of rat BMP-15 precursor showed no obvious sequence homology with other known TGF-β superfamily members, including GDF-9. Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was transformed with phBMP-15-GST, and its production was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG). The fusion protein was purified from whole cell lysate by glutathione-Sepharose affinity column. The purified protein was injected into rabbits to generate anti-rhBMP-15-GST polyclonal antibodies (anti-BMP-15 Ab). The IgG fraction was purified by protein A-Sepharose affinity column. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with phBMP-15-Flag (10Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines permanently expressing rhBMP-15-Flag were selected using 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. When transfected cells (TF) reached ∼90% confluence, they were recultured for 3 days in serum-free medium, after which the conditioned medium (CM) was harvested. As a control, CM from non-transfected cells (n-TF) was harvested. CM containing rhBMP-15-Flag was subjected to affinity column chromatography using anti-Flag mAb agarose. Western immunoblotting was performed as described (11Inouye S. Guo Y. DePaolo L. Shimonaka M. Ling N. Shimasaki S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions using the anti-Flag mAb (1:1,000 dilution) or anti-BMP-15 Ab (1:10,000 dilution). Immunofluorescent signals were detected by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). N-Linked and O-linked glycosylation analyses were performed by treating the samples with peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) or O-glycanase together with neuraminidase II, galactosidase III, and hexosaminidase I (Glyco Inc., Novato, CA), respectively. The density of each protein band stained by silver was analyzed with NIH image 1.62. BMP-15 mRNA was investigated in 10-μm sections of immature rat ovaries fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde as described (12Nakatani A. Shimasaki S. Erickson G.F. Ling N. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The RNA probes that encode sense or antisense strand were made from prBMP-15–409 by in vitro transcription using T7 or SP6 polymerase in the presence of 35S-UTP. BMP-15 protein in 6-μm sections of immature rat ovaries fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde was examined as described previously (13Nakatani A. Shimasaki S. DePaolo L.V. Erickson G.F. Ling N. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Anti-BMP-15 Ab was diluted 1:3,000 with 1% normal goat serum for use. The intensity of the hybridization signals was scored as described (13Nakatani A. Shimasaki S. DePaolo L.V. Erickson G.F. Ling N. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In brief, the signals represent a subjective comparison of four sections from four ovaries of four different animals hybridized with the same concentrations of sense and antisense probes and exposed for the same times. The hybridization signal was estimated on a scale of nondetectable (ND) to (+4); silver grains were sparse but with positive hybridization (+1), numerous but not covering the tissue in question (+2), very numerous and beginning to merge in some places (+3), and very dense, forming a near uniform mass above the tissue in question (+4). The intensity of immunostaining was assessed subjectively: nondetectable (ND), weak but definitely positive (+1), moderately positive (+2), and intensely positive (+3). Follicles were classified as follows: primordial (single layer of squamous or flat GCs), primary (single layer of GCs in which at least one is cuboidal), secondary (more than two layers of GCs but no antrum), and Graafian (multiple layers of GCs with an antrum). Female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (23 day old) were implanted with silastic capsules containing 10 mg of diethylstilbestrol to increase GC number (14Erickson G.F. Hsueh A.J.W. Endocrinology. 1978; 102: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). After 4 days, GCs were collected from the ovaries and cultured in serum-free McCoy's 5a medium as described previously (14Erickson G.F. Hsueh A.J.W. Endocrinology. 1978; 102: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The animal protocols were approved by the University of California at San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. GCs (2 × 105 viable cells) were cultured in polypropylene 1.5-ml tubes containing 200 μl (final volume) of culture medium at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After a 24-h pre-culture period, cells were incubated with 0.5 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine/tube, either alone or together with increasing doses of rhBMP-15-Flag with or without FSH or CM from either n-TF or TF. After another 24 h of culture, the cells were washed with PBS, centrifuged (2000 × g, 30 min), and incubated with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was solubilized in 0.2 m NaOH and its radioactivity measured. For steroidogenic studies, GCs (105 viable cells) were cultured in a 96-well plate with 200 μl of medium containing 100 nm 4-androstene-3,17-dione (substrate of P450-aromatase) either alone or together with the indicated concentrations of FSH and/or rhBMP-15-Flag. After 48 h of culture, the levels of progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2) in the media were measured by a radioimmunoassay. All bioassay results shown are averages (mean ± S.E.) of at least four separate experiments, with triplicate determination for each treatment. Differences between groups were analyzed for statistical significance using analysis of variance (StatView 5.0 software, Abacus Concept, Inc., Berkely, CA).P values < 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. In situ hybridization (Fig. 1, a and b) revealed strong hybridization signals for BMP-15 mRNA in the oocytes. No hybridization signal was detected in other ovarian cell types. Hybridization with the sense BMP-15 probe showed only a low level of nonspecific background signal (data not shown). These results are in agreement with previous reports (6Dube J.L. Wang P. Elvin J. Lyons K.M. Celeste A.J. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1809-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Laitinen M. Vuojolainen K. Jaatinen R. Ketola I. Aaltonen J. Lehtonen E. Heikinheimo M. Ritvos O. Mech. Dev. 1998; 78: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To assess the relative changes in BMP-15 mRNA expression during folliculogenesis, the oocyte hybridization signals were subjected to quantification. Virtually all (99%) of the oocytes in primordial follicles showed no hybridization signal above background (TableI and Fig. 1 d). In the majority (75%) of primary follicles, no BMP-15 mRNA was detectable (Table I). However, when the oocyte was surrounded by one complete layer of cuboidal GCs, a weak hybridization signal was observed (TableI and Fig. 1 e). A positive hybridization signal was found in 97% of the oocytes in secondary follicles (Table I). As the number of GC layers increased, the number of silver grains over the oocyte increased (Fig. 1, e and f). In healthy Graafian follicles, 100% of the oocytes showed relatively strong labeling (Table I and Fig. 1 g).Table IQuantitative in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis of BMP-15 expression in oocytes during follicular developmentSignal strengthFollicle stagePrimordialPrimarySecondaryGraafianBMP-15 mRNA ND 1-aND, nondetectable.99 (99%)102 (75%)2 (3%)0 (0%) +11 (1%)32 (24%)19 (25%)0 (0%) +20 (0%)1 (1%)11 (14%)8 (25%) +30 (0%)0 (0%)24 (31%)14 (44%) +40 (0%)0 (0%)21 (27%)10 (31%)BMP-15 protein ND39 (71%)54 (45%)0 (0%)0 (0%) +115 (27%)56 (47%)6 (14%)0 (0%) +21 (2%)10 (8%)13 (32%)5 (56%) +30 (0%)0 (0%)22 (54%)4 (44%)1-a ND, nondetectable. Open table in a new tab Whether BMP-15 mRNA in the oocytes is translated is unknown. To address this, we first developed an anti-BMP-15 Ab. Fig. 2 A shows that bacterial lysates from rhBMP-15-GST transformants induced by IPTG exhibited a strong band at ∼42 kDa, which was then purified by a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column (Fig. 2 B). This 42-kDa protein exhibits the expected molecular weight (Mr) of rhBMP-15-GST (the calculated masses of GST, intervening amino acid chain between GST and BMP-15, and BMP-15 are 26, 1, and 14 kDa, respectively). The purified rhBMP-15-GST protein was injected into rabbit to generate the anti-BMP-15 Ab. Using the anti-BMP-15 Ab, we examined BMP-15 protein expression in immature rat ovaries by immunohistochemistry. Consistent with the mRNA data, the anti-BMP-15 Ab selectively stained oocytes, and no immunoreactivity was evident in other ovarian cell types (Fig. 1 c). In control experiments, no immunoreactive cells were seen in control sections incubated with preimmune serum. Notably, the anti-BMP-15 Ab showed no cross-reactivity with 100 ng of rhGDF-9 when examined by Western immunoblotting (data not shown). Quantitative analysis revealed that oocytes in most primordial follicles (71%) were not stained by the anti-BMP-15 Ab (Table I and Fig. 1 h); however, it is interesting that a significant percentage (29%) appeared weakly positive for BMP-15 protein (TableI). The majority (55%) of the oocytes in primary follicles were stained by the anti-BMP-15 Ab (Table I and Fig. 1 i), and the strength of the signal appeared related to the number of cuboidal GC,e.g. the highest signal (+2) appearing in those oocytes surrounded by a complete layer of cuboidal cells. When developing follicles reached the secondary stage, 100% of the oocytes appeared immunostained, and in the majority (54%) the intensity of the signal was high, +3 (Table I and Fig. 1 j). A relatively high level of immunoreactivity was evident in all oocytes of healthy Graafian follicles (Table I and Fig. 1 k). To uncover the biological functions of BMP-15, 293 cells were transfected with a phBMP-15-Flag. A single colony of 293 cells producing high levels of rhBMP-15-Flag protein was selected by Geneticin and established as a permanent cell line. SDS-PAGE analysis of CM from n-TF and TF revealed numerous proteins (Fig. 3 A). When gels were immunostained with anti-BMP-15 Ab under reducing conditions, two proteins migrating at 16 and 50 kDa were seen in the CM from TF, but not n-TF (Fig. 3 B). It is likely that the small and large proteins are the mature rhBMP-15-Flag and its proprotein, respectively. Examination of the same samples with anti-Flag mAb also revealed the same two bands; however, this antibody identified an additional band, which runs at a slightly higher mass (17 kDa) than the 16-kDa protein in the CM from TF (Fig. 3 C). We next immunopurified the rhBMP-15-Flag from CM of TF using an anti-Flag mAb agarose column. Silver-staining of the immunopurified proteins revealed two small proteins (16 and 17 kDa) and several larger proteins in the 50–60-kDa range (Fig. 4 A). In the smaller mass range, only the 16-kDa band was detected by anti-BMP-15 Ab (Fig. 4 B) whereas the anti-Flag mAb detected both 16- and 17-kDa bands (Fig. 4 C). In addition, both antibodies also detected a 50-kDa band, which is most likely the rhBMP-15-Flag proprotein. At this point, the nature of the 17-kDa band is unknown. However, its mass was not altered by the treatment with N-glycosidase orO-glycosidase together with neuraminidase II, galactosidase III, and hexosaminidase I, suggesting it is not a glycosylated protein. Our in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry results indicating increased BMP-15 expression during follicle growth and development (see Fig. 1) led us to hypothesize that BMP-15 might modulate GC proliferation and/or differentiation. Before testing this hypothesis, we first estimated the concentration of rhBMP-15-Flag protein in the immunopurified sample by comparing the intensity of the rhBMP-15-Flag protein on SDS-PAGE with that of known amounts of activin A (Fig. 5). Since the nature of 17-kDa protein is not clear, it was not used in the estimation of the concentration of rhBMP-15-Flag stock. Fig. 6 shows DNA synthesis data derived from cultured rat GCs that had been stimulated with rhBMP-15-Flag. As shown in the inset, unpurified CM from TF produced an increase (∼2-fold) in [3H]thymidine incorporation when compared with CM from n-TF. Treatment of the cells with purified rhBMP-15-Flag (200 ng/ml) produced a marked increase in thymidine incorporation, and the rhBMP-15-Flag effect was dose-dependent (ED50 = ∼30 ng/ml). We also found that 30 ng/ml rhBMP-15-Flag increased the GC number by 1.5-fold, indicating rhBMP-15-Flag stimulates cell proliferation as well as DNA synthesis. The stimulatory effect of rhBMP-15-Flag on DNA synthesis was unaffected by co-treatment with a saturating dose (3 ng/ml) of FSH (Fig. 6). Finally, we determined the effects of rhBMP-15-Flag on P4and E2 production by cultured GCs. As observed earlier (15Shimasaki S. Zachow R.J. Li D. Kim H. Iemura S.-I. Ueno N. Sampath K. Chang R.J. Erickson G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7282-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), FSH increased P4 and E2 production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). By comparison, rhBMP-15-Flag alone was unable to directly stimulate basal P4 and E2 production. However, co-treatment of FSH with rhBMP-15-Flag produced a marked inhibition (as much as 50%) of the FSH-induced P4 levels (ED50 of rhBMP-15-Flag = 10 ng/ml), whereas the rhBMP-15-Flag had no effect on FSH-induced E2 production. Our experiments provide the first evidence for the target cells and biological activity of BMP-15 ligand. Experiments in which 10−9m concentrations of BMP-15 were added to cultured GCs indicated that BMP-15 is a potent regulator of mitosis and a negative regulator of FSH-induced P4production. These findings suggest two new principles; (i) GCs are target cells for BMP-15 ligand, and (ii) the BMP-15 receptor signaling pathways in GCs are functionally coupled to DNA replication/cell proliferation and the modulation of FSH action. We propose that the biological significance of oocyte-specific BMP-15 in vivomight be to promote follicle growth, while preventing premature luteinization. Because human ooctyes express BMP-15 (8Aaltonen J. Laitinen M.P. Vuojolainen K. Jaatinen R. Horelli-Kuitunen N. Seppä L. Louhio H. Tuuri T. Sjöberg J. Bützow R. Hovata O. Dale L. Ritvos O. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 2744-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine whether these principles apply to women. It is noteworthy that the effects of BMP-15 on GCs are different from those of other members of the TGF-β superfamily, including inhibin (16Hutchinson L.A. Findlay J.K. de Vos F.L. Robertson D.M.

Reprod. 2000; 62: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). As such, it would appear that the biological activity of BMP-15 in the GC is unique. Prior to this work, nothing was known about the cellular expression of BMP-15 protein. Our experiments now provide the first evidence for the oocyte-specific expression of BMP-15 protein and show that BMP-15 protein and mRNA are selectively co-expressed in the oocytes throughout the course of folliculogenesis. From a physiological perspective, these results fit the hypothesis that BMP-15 produced by the oocytes plays a role regulating cell proliferation and differentiation during follicle development. The presence of BMP-15 protein in some primordial follicles is of interest because it pushes the question of oocyte BMP-15 expression back to the beginning stages of folliculogenesis. This could suggest that oocyte BMP-15 plays a role in follicle recruitment. What mechanisms are responsible for the initiation and maintenance of BMP-15 mRNA and protein expression in the oocyte remains an important unanswered question. Our results identify GC as the first target cells for BMP-15. From a functional point of view, nothing was known about the biological activity of BMP-15 until this study. We found that BMP-15 acts directly on GC to markedly stimulate mitosis. These results suggest that BMP-15 functions as a GC growth factor. An important point to emerge from these experiments is that the mitogenic activity of BMP-15 is FSH-independent. Although it is not clear what this means physiologically, it is possible that oocyte-derived BMP-15 is involved in controlling GC mitosis in preantral follicles during the FSH-independent or preantral period of folliculogenesis. Consistent with this idea, our in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry results show strong BMP-15 mRNA and protein expression in oocytes in preantral follicles. Taken together, our results provide the new concept that BMP-15 is a mitogen for GCs. Our studies also suggest that BMP-15 is likely to be involved in the regulation of GC steroidogenesis. A striking feature of the BMP-15 steroidogenic response is that, in contrast to the proliferative response, it is FSH-dependent. The finding that BMP-15 produced a marked inhibition in FSH-induced P4biosynthesis, while having no effect on FSH-induced E2production, indicates that the biochemical pathways that eventually lead to P4 synthesis in GCs are preferentially inhibited by BMP-15. The ability of BMP-15 to selectively inhibit the stimulation of P4 production by FSH suggests a novel role for BMP-15 in the luteinization process. There is a large body of evidence supporting the concept that the oocyte secretes a putative regulatory factor that inhibits GC luteinization (1Eppig J.J. Chesnel F. Hirao Y. O'Brien M.J. Pendola F.L. Watanabe S. Wigglesworth K. Hum. Reprod. 1997; 12: 127-132PubMed Google Scholar, 2Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. Trends Endocrinol.

Although the nature of the putative oocyte steroid-regulating factor is unknown, our data suggest that BMP-15 is a possible candidate for the oocyte-derived luteinization inhibitor. What do we know about the physiological relevance of BMP-15? Genetic studies in sheep have provided compelling evidence for the involvement of BMP-15 in folliculogenesis and fertility. The Inverdale (FecXI) mutant has a single T to A transition at nucleotide position 92 in the mature BMP-15 coding region (27Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M., P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In female homozygous mutants (FecXI/FecXI), follicular development is arrested at the primary stage and the animals are infertile. Interestingly, these female heterozygous BMP-15 mutants (FecXI/FecX+) are superfertile, having increased ovulation rates and multiple pregnancies. A different BMP-15 mutant, Hanna (FecXH), generates a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 23 in mature region of BMP-15. When FecXI and FecXH sheep are crossed, the resulting (FecXI/FecXH) females exhibit a phenotype indistinguishable from (FecXI/FecXI) infertile females (27Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M., P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). It seems clear from this work that BMP-15 molecules are central to ovarian function, regulating follicle development and ovulation quota in a very intriguing gene dosage manner. Based on our results, one would propose that the GC might mediate some of these BMP-15 effects. Over the past few years, much attention has been focused on another oocyte growth factor, GDF-9 (2Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Elvin J.A. Yan C. Matzuk M.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Both BMP-15 and GDF-9 are closely related structurally, and both proteins can stimulate GC mitosis with similar potency (24Vitt U.A. Hayashi M. Klein C. Hsueh A.J.W. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that both of these oocyte growth factors might be directly involved in the regulation of GC proliferation and follicle growth. It will be important to determine the interaction of BMP-15 and GDF-9 in the context of GC mitosis. Regarding differentiation, GDF-9 itself can stimulate E2 production and inhibit both FSH-induced E2 and P4 production by cultured GCs. (24Vitt U.A. Hayashi M. Klein C. Hsueh A.J.W. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These results, together with our findings, suggest that important differences exist between BMP-15 and GDF-9 in their ability to influence GC cytodifferentiation. If true, the data would support the view that BMP-15 and GDF-9 have different effects on follicle differentiation in vivo. Under physiological conditions, FSH causes developing follicles to produce E2 but not P4 during the cycle (28Smith M.S. Freeman M.E. Neill J.D. Endocrinology. 1975; 96: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). As such, the effects of BMP-15 on GC differentiation would appear to be more physiologically relevant than those reported for GDF-9. It will be of great interest to find out how specific BMP-15 and GDF-9 signaling pathways lead to the stimulation and inhibition of particular effector genes and ultimately to the specific biological responses that are critical for follicle growth and development. Given the oocyte-specific expression and structural similarity between BMP-15 and GDF-9, it will be of great interest to determine whether these molecules form heterodimers, which in turn might have yet to be discovered biological responses. In summary, these studies identify the GCs as the first target cells for BMP-15 and provide the first insight into the expression and biological functions of BMP-15 protein. From a physiological perspective, our results led us to propose that BMP-15 is a unique oocyte-specific molecule that coordinates GC proliferation and FSH-dependent cytodifferentiation during folliculogenesis. Because coordinated cell proliferation and differentiation is essential for preovulatory follicle development, our findings could have new implications for understanding fertility and infertility in the female.

One of the effects of the snapping is to stun or kill prey animals. During the rapid snapper claw closure, a high-velocity water jet is emitted from the claw with a speed exceeding cavitation conditions. Hydrophone measurements in conjunction with time-controlled high-speed imaging of the claw closure demonstrate that the sound is emitted at the cavitation bubble collapse and not on claw closure. A model for the bubble dynamics based on a Rayleigh-Plesset-type equation quantitatively accounts for the time dependence of the bubble radius and for the emitted sound."
https://openalex.org/W2070144984,"The asymmetric localization of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein determinants plays an important role in the establishment of complex body plans. In Drosophila oocytes, the anterior localization of bicoid mRNA and the posterior localization of oskar mRNA are key events in establishing the anterior-posterior axis. Although the mechanisms that drive bicoid and oskar localization have been elusive, oocyte microtubules are known to be essential. Here we report that the plus end–directed microtubule motor kinesin I is required for the posterior localization of oskar mRNA and an associated protein, Staufen, but not for the anterior-posterior localization of other asymmetric factors. Thus, a complex containing oskar mRNA and Staufen may be transported along microtubules to the posterior pole by kinesin I."

The subversion of these anti-neoplastic effects during Ras-dependent tumor development may be as important as the acquisition of the pro-neoplastic effects.

Consequently, we have sought to identify novel Ras effectors that may be responsible for apoptosis induction. By examining the EST data base, we identified a potential Ras association domain in the tumor suppressor RASSF1. We now show that RASSF1 binds Ras in a GTP-dependent manner, both in vivo and directlyin vitro. Moreover, activated Ras enhances and dominant negative Ras inhibits the cell death induced by transient transfection of RASSF1 into 293-T cells. This cell death appears to be apoptotic in nature, as RASSF1-transfected 293-T cells exhibit membrane blebbing and can be rescued by the addition of a caspase inhibitor. Thus, the RASSF1 tumor suppressor may serve as a novel Ras effector that mediates the apoptotic effects of oncogenic Ras.

This versatility is facilitated by the ability of Ras to bind and activate a diverse array of effector proteins (1Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J.

Signal. 2000; 12: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, it seems certain that there are Ras effectors remaining to be identified. Consequently, the mechanisms behind Ras mediated growth inhibition and death remain poorly understood. The observation that oncoproteins can promote cell death as well as transformation has led to the hypothesis that the signaling pathways that drive death and proliferation are tightly coupled to protect against oncogenic transformation (32Hueber A.O. Evan G.I. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33Guo M. Hay B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Understanding how Ras subverts this balance of life and death in a successful tumor is critical to understanding the role of Ras in human cancer. There are two likely mechanisms behind Ras-mediated growth inhibition. First, certain Ras effectors may play a dual role, being capable of either inducing or inhibiting growth. This seems to be the case with Raf-1. Here, moderate activation can be shown to promote growth, but excessive, prolonged activation may cause growth arrest and senescence (34Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 35Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Second, certain Ras effectors may be specialized to induce only growth inhibition. These effectors would have to be rendered ineffective during the development of the tumor. In effect, these proteins would serve as Ras activated tumor suppressors. A novel tumor suppressor, RASSF1, has recently been identified, which has a putative Ras association (RA)1 domain and produces two main splice variants, A and C (36Dammann R. Li C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the expression of RASSF1 is frequently down-regulated in ovarian tumor cell lines. Moreover, the C splice variant of RASSF1 binds Ras in a GTP-dependent manner and mediates a potent, Ras-dependent apoptosis. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the pro-apoptotic functions of Ras and how these functions may be subverted in the development of human tumors. The EST data base was searched with Advanced tBLASTn using the amino acid sequence of the Nore1 RA domain. An RA-containing protein was identified that was later described as RASSF1C (36Dammann R. Li C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The gene was cloned by PCR from the IMAGE consortium clone (632948; GenBankTM accession numberAA205984) as a BamHI/EcoRI PCR fragment using primers (gacggatccatgggcgaggcggaggcgcc) and (gacgaattcacccaagggggcaggcg). The isolated RA domain was cloned as aBamHI/EcoRI PCR fragment using an internal 5′ oligomer (gacggatcctctcaagctgagattgag). pZip-Neo SV(X)1 HA is a modified form of pZip-Neo SV(X)1 (37Cepko C.L.

This version has the internalEcoRI site deleted and the cloning site modified from a single BamHI site to aBamHI/HindIII/EcoRI sequence downstream of an HA tag. (The frame is GGA TTC). PCDNAFLAG is a version of pCDNA3 that has been modified in a similar manner with an upstream FLAG epitope. The RA domain was cloned in a modified version of pMal (New England Biolabs) in which we have changed the orientation of the EcoRI/BamHI sites in the cloning site to BamHI/EcoRI. Maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were prepared essentially as described previously (38Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Rossman K.L. Carpenter J.W. Rogers-Graham K. Fu H. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J.

The fusion proteins were quantified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining and a comparison with known standards.

Binding assays were performed at 4 °C for 2 h in phosphate-buffered saline/25 mm MgCl2 and washed four times before Western analysis using the 146 Ha-Ras monoclonal (Quality Biotech). In vivo association was determined by co-transfecting pCGNHA (39Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Western blots were developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NIH 3T3 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). 293-T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% Fetal Calf serum. Cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate precipitation technique described previously (40Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). z-VAD-fmk assays were performed by adding the drug at 30 μm to the cells immediately after transfection. The drug concentration was maintained during subsequent changes of medium. The RASSF1C cDNA clone was random primed with [32P]dCTP and hybridized to a multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) using standard procedures. Total RNA was prepared from ovarian tumor cell lines using gaunidinium isothiocyanate lysis followed by cesium chloride gradient purification and run on an 0.8% formaldehyde gel. The gel was transferred to nylon membrane and after hybridization was washed to high stringency before autoradiography. Many Ras effectors share a conserved structural domain that is responsible for mediating the interaction with Ras. This is known as the Ras association or RA domain. (41Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In an attempt to discover novel Ras effectors responsible for Ras-mediated growth inhibition, we conducted a data base search for potential RA domain-containing tumor suppressors. We identified a novel protein that possesses an RA domain. Analysis of genomic sequence data bases showed that the gene is localized to the 3p21.3 region of the genome. This region is frequently deleted or rearranged in human lung and ovarian carcinomas (42Fullwood P. Marchini S. Rader J.S. Martinez A. Macartney D. Broggini M. Morelli C. Barbanti-Brodano G. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4662-4667PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic structure of the gene and further analysis of transcripts present in the EST data base suggested that the gene could produce three transcripts. During the preparation of this manuscript, the gene was identified as a tumor suppressor and designated RASSF1. Production of three separate transcripts A, B, and C, was confirmed (36Dammann R. Li C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). We cloned splice variant C of RASSF1 (which we will designateRASSF1C) as well as the isolated RA domain from the IMAGE consortium clone (632948) using PCR. The clones were sequenced to confirm fidelity before use. To determine whether RASSF1C is a Ras effector, we examined its Ras binding properties. Ras is a small G protein and shuttles between an inactive, GDP-bound state and an active, GTP-bound state. Only the active, GTP-bound form of Ras adopts the appropriate conformation for effector binding (43Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore, if RASSF1C is a Ras effector, then its RA domain should bind GTP but not GDP Ras. We cloned the RA domain into a MBP fusion vector, pMal (New England Biolabs). The MBP-RASSF1(RA) fusion protein was induced in XL1 Blue bacteria (Stratagene) and purified on maltose-conjugated Sepharose beads. We then used the fusion protein as an affinity reagent to precipitate recombinant GDP/GTP Ha-Ras from solution in vitro (Fig.1 a). The precipitate was then subjected to Western analysis using an Ha-Ras antibody. The Ras binding domain of Raf-1 was used as a positive control. The RA domain of RASSF1 clearly binds Ras in a GTP preferential manner. To confirm that RASSF1C could interact with Ras in vivo,RASSF1C was cloned into a pCDNA3 variant (Invitrogen), which adds a FLAG epitope tag to the amino-terminal end of the protein. The RASSF1C construct was co-transfected into 293-T cells with HA epitope-tagged activated or wild type Ha-Ras. Activated forms of Ras are typically more than 70% GTP bound in the cell, and wild type Ras is typically only 5% bound to GTP. After 48 h, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with HA-conjugated Sepharose beads (BabCo). The immunoprecipitate was then subjected to Western analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). We found that RASSF1C co-precipitated preferentially with activated, GTP-bound Ras (Fig.1 b). The direct, GTP-dependent association of RASSF1C with Ras confirms this protein as a new candidate Ras effector. Northern analysis of RASSF1expression showed that the mRNA is present in most normal tissue (Fig. 2 a). AsRASSF1 has been mapped to a region of the genome that is frequently deleted or rearranged in lung and ovarian tumors (42Fullwood P. Marchini S. Rader J.S. Martinez A. Macartney D. Broggini M. Morelli C. Barbanti-Brodano G. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4662-4667PubMed Google Scholar), we examined a series of ovarian carcinoma cell lines for RASSF1expression by Northern blot. We found that six of nine transformed ovarian cell lines had lost the expression of RASSF1 (Fig.2 b). To examine the biological role of RASSF1C, we attempted to make stable cell lines over-expressing RASSF1C. RASSF1C was cloned into an HA-tagged version of pZIP-Neo SV(X)1 (37Cepko C.L. Roberts B.E. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1984; 37: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. The cells were then selected in G418. No colonies survived the selection in the RASSF1C-transfected dishes (Fig. 3 a); moreover, co-transfection with activated Ras failed to rescue the cells (data not shown). Therefore, deregulated expression of RASSF1C inhibits cell growth and survival. As we could not study the action of RASSF1C in stable cell lines, we examined the effects of RASSF1C in transient transfection experiments using 293-T cells. The cells were transfected with RASSF1C and examined for growth effects at 72 h. The right hand panel of Fig. 3 a shows that 293-T cell growth is inhibited by RASSF1C. If RASSF1C is a Ras-activated tumor suppressor, then the presence of activated Ras should stimulate its biological activity. The effects of Ras on RASSF1C-mediated growth inhibition were determined by co-transfecting 293-T cells with RASSF1C and Ha-Ras mutants. Activated Ha-Ras (G12V) dramatically stimulated the growth inhibitory effects of RASSF1C (Fig. 3 b). This stimulation was dependent upon an intact effector domain, as an effector mutant (44White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) (Ha-RasG12V/E37G) was unable to activate RASSF1C. The presence of a dominant negative form of Ha-Ras (Q61L/C186S) served to completely block the growth inhibitory effects of RASSF1C. Thus, the growth inhibition appears to be Ras-dependent. To examine the mechanism of the growth inhibition, we compared theRASSF1C transfectants with cells transfected with pCDNA Fas. Fas is a well characterized inducer of apoptosis (45Nagata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with RASSF1C and Fas exhibited similar morphological changes such as membrane blebbing, a hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 3 c) (46Wyllie A.H. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis requires the activation of caspase proteases (47Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To confirm that apoptotic cell death was occurring, the transfection experiments were repeated in the presence of the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Calbiochem). In these experiments, the ability of RASSF1C to impair cell growth was severely reduced (Fig. 3 c). Recently, our understanding of the role of oncogenes has begun to change to incorporate the concept that they not only provoke transformation but may also induce growth inhibition and death. It appears that the signaling pathways for growth and for death are linked, such that deregulation of growth pathways can cause the activation of growth inhibitory pathways (32Hueber A.O. Evan G.I. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33Guo M. Hay B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This struggle between the forces of transformation and death persists even in a successful tumor, where high levels of apoptosis can still be detected (48Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 49Lowe S.W. Lin A.W. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms by which these controls are mediated, and ultimately subverted, may give rise to new avenues of cancer therapy. Although Ras oncoproteins were initially characterized as suppressors of apoptosis (12Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 50Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar) it is now clear that they also have the ability to promote apoptosis (20Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 21Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). We now provide part of the explanation for this apparent paradox by identifying the first component of a specific Ras/apoptosis pathway, the tumor suppressor RASSF1. The tumor-suppressing properties of RASSF1 have been described recently (36Dammann R. Li C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The gene produces three splice variants, A, B, and C. RASSF1A expression, and to a lesser extent RASSF1C expression, is impaired in a number of lung tumor cell lines (36Dammann R. Li C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). We now show that RASSF1C is frequently down-regulated in ovarian tumor cell lines. It will be interesting to determine whether the greater incidence of RASSF1C loss in ovarian versus lung tumor cell lines reflects tissue-dependent differences in biological activity of the isoforms. All three splice variants of RASSF1 contain the putative RA domain. Here, we show that this domain does indeed code for an RA domain, as it binds directly to Ha-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner in vitro. Moreover, RASSF1C preferentially binds the activated form of Ras in vivo. RASSF1C has an endogenous ability to promote apoptosis in 293-T cells. However, this activity is dramatically stimulated by activated Ras. The stimulation is dependent upon the presence of an intact Ras effector domain. Furthermore, a dominant negative form of Ras inhibits the apoptotic inducing effects of RASSF1C. As RASSF1C binds Ras in a GTP-dependent, effector domain-dependent manner, it meets the minimal criteria for a potential Ras effector. Moreover, unlike many candidate Ras effectors, we have shown a biological activity for RASSF1 that may be modulated by Ras. Thus, we present strong evidence that the RASSF1 tumor suppressor may be a Ras effector. The growth inhibition assays were performed mainly in 293-T cells. This cell system is not typically used for the study of Ras biological effects (although it has been used extensively to study Ras-mediated signaling); this is because the cells are already transformed, and typical bioassays for Ras involve studying the induction of transformation. Here, we studied growth inhibition, a novel effect of Ras. Therefore, we felt the use of 293-T cells to be entirely appropriate. However, we intend to extend our studies into ovarian epithelial cell lines to confirm the physiological relevance of our results. The fact that RASSF1C also inhibits the growth of NIH 3T3 cells and MCF7 human breast tumor cells (data not shown) suggests that the biological effects of RASSF1 are consistent between cell systems. Previous reports have shown that Ras-mediated apoptosis is p53-independent, can be promoted by inhibitors of NF-κB (20Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and can be suppressed with activators of NF-κB (22Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As we found that RASSF1C-mediated apoptosis is also p53-independent (in 293-T cells p53 should be inactivated by SV40 large-T antigen), we intend to examine the connections between the RASSF1 pathway and NF-κB in subsequent studies. The primary amino acid sequence of the RASSF1C gives few immediate clues to the mechanism behind its action. At first sight, the carboxyl-terminal sequences suggest a potential CAAX motif for protein prenylation (51Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the amino acid immediately after the cysteine is a proline; this does not fit the rule that two aliphatic residues are required at this position, and the protein is not prenylated in our hands (data not shown). RASSF1 bears some homology to an as yet uncharacterized Ras effector, Nore1 (52Vavvas D. Li X. Avruch J. Zhang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5439-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, RASSF1 may be just the first of a family of related proteins that serve as Ras-regulated tumor suppressors. In summary, we show that one of the isoforms of the novel tumor suppressor RASSF1 can function as a novel Ras effector, which may be used by Ras to mediate apoptotic cell death. Activated Ras enhances RASSF1C-induced cell death, and dominant negative Ras blocks it. Cells that acquire a Ras mutation and express RASSF1 will be predisposed to die by apoptosis. Therefore, the loss or inactivation of RASSF1 may be a critical component of the evolution of Ras-dependent tumors. We thank J.

https://openalex.org/W2006304210,"To examine the impact of homozygous genetic disruption of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 (IRS-1−/−) or IRS-2 (IRS-2−/−) on basal and insulin-stimulated carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in vivo, we infused 18-h fasted mice (wild-type (WT), IRS-1−/−, and IRS-2−/−) with [3-3H]glucose and [2H5]glycerol and assessed rates of glucose and glycerol turnover under basal (0–90 min) and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (90–210 min; 5 mm glucose, and 5 milliunits of insulin·kg−1·min−1) conditions. Both IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/− mice were insulin-resistant as reflected by markedly impaired insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose utilization compared with WT mice. Insulin resistance in the IRS-1−/− mice could be ascribed mainly to decreased insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose metabolism. In contrast, IRS-2−/− mice displayed multiple defects in insulin-mediated carbohydrate metabolism as reflected by (i) decreased peripheral glucose utilization, (ii) decreased suppression of endogenous glucose production, and (iii) decreased hepatic glycogen synthesis. Additionally, IRS-2−/− mice also showed marked insulin resistance in adipose tissue as reflected by reduced suppression of plasma free fatty acid concentrations and glycerol turnover during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. These data suggest important tissue-specific roles for IRS-1 and IRS-2 in mediating the effect of insulin on carbohydrate and lipid metabolismin vivo in mice. IRS-1 appears to have its major role in muscle, whereas IRS-2 appears to impact on liver, muscle, and adipose tissue.

To characterize the precise physiological roles of these proteins, we and others have generated mice with targeted disruption of IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, or IRS-4 (3Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R.

For example, IRS-1−/− mice are severely growth-retarded, have normal fasting blood glucose concentrations and appear to be mildly insulin-resistant, as suggested by insulin tolerance testing (7Araki E.

In contrast, IRS-2−/− mice are normal in size but develop diabetes due to a combination of peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance and a failure in B-cell function (9Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S.

These dramatic phenotypes contrast with the absence of major abnormalities of insulin signaling in mice lacking either IRS-3 or IRS-4 (11Liu S.C. Wang Q. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J. Biol.

Thus it appears that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are major mediators of insulin action but their relative contribution to the in vivoregulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism has not yet been determined. To examine the tissue-specific roles of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in mediating insulin's effect in the key insulin-responsive organs (muscle, liver, and adipose), we performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in conscious mice in combination with the infusion of [3-3H]glucose and [2H5]glycerol tracers to assess rates of glucose and glycerol turnover as well as rates of insulin-stimulated liver and muscle glycogen synthesis. These studies demonstrate that, in vivo, IRS-1 appears to have its major role in muscle alone whereas IRS-2 mediates insulin action in liver, fat, and muscle. Unless noted, chemicals were purchased from Sigma. [2H5]Glycerol (98 atom % excess) and [2-13C]glycerol (99 atom % excess) were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes (Andover, MA). [3-3H]Glucose was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry supplies were purchased from Hewlett-Packard (Wilmington, DE). Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + 10% trimethylchlorosilane was purchased from Pierce. Male mice (wild type, IRS-1−/−, or IRS-2−/−) were received from Dr. Morris F. White (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). Catheters were implanted in the jugular vein of 5–6-week-old mice, approximately 5 days prior to the study. Mice were fasted 18 h and infused with [2H5]glycerol (3 μmol·kg−1·min−1) to estimate rates of lipolysis and [3-3H]glucose (1 μCi·kg−1·min−1) to estimate rates of glucose production and utilization. The experimental design consisted of a 90-min basal period followed by a 2-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. A primed-continuous infusion of insulin (Humulin, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was given (5 milliunits·kg−1·min−1). Glucose (20% w/v) was infused to maintain blood glucose at ∼6 mm. Blood (∼40 μl) was sampled via tail-tip bleeds at 70 and 90 min (basal) and at 190 and 210 min (clamp) for determination of the rate of appearance of glucose and glycerol and the concentration of plasma glycerol and free fatty acids. Additional blood samples (∼20 μl) were obtained at 30-min intervals (i.e. 120, 150, and 180 min) for determination of blood glucose concentration. Total blood loss was approximately 20% of the estimated blood volume. At the end of the experiment the liver and hind-limb muscles (mixed muscle from the whole leg) were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Plasma samples were processed for 3H counting as follows. Briefly, a 10-μl aliquot of plasma was deproteinized by adding 20 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. A 15-μl portion of the supernatant was dried to remove3H2O. The residue was dissolved in 100 μl of water. Samples were counted after addition of 2 ml of scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold, Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). GC-MS analyses were conducted using electron impact ionization on a Hewlett-Packard 5973 MSD equipped with a Hewlett-Packard 6980 GC. All samples were analyzed using split injection (10:1) on a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) maintained at a constant helium flow (1.2 ml·min−1). Glycerol and free fatty acids was determined as follows. A 15-μl plasma sample was added to 15 μl of internal standard mixture containing [2-13C]glycerol and heptadecanoic acid (C17:0). To this sample was added 200 μl of methanol. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness and reacted at room temperature with 65 μl of trimethylchlorosilane reagent. Plasma glycerol concentration was calculated from them/z (205 + 208)/206 signal, and the2H-enrichment was calculated from them/z 208/ (205 + 208) signal. Plasma free fatty acid concentration was calculated from the ratio of C17:0 (m/z 327) to the sum of C16:0 (m/z 313), C18:0 (m/z 341), C18:1 (m/z 339), and C18:2 (m/z 337). Total liver and muscle glycogen concentration was determined according to the method of Walaas and Walaas (13Walaas O. Walaas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 187: 769-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A portion of the hydrolyzed glycogen was also used to determine the total counts of 3H. Plasma insulin was assayed using the rat radioimmunoassay from Linco, with the mouse standard. The rate of appearance of glucose and glycerol were calculated from: tracer infusion rate/labeling of plasma pool. In the case of [3-3H]glucose the tracer infusion rate is in dpm·kg−1·min−1and labeling of plasma pool is in dpm·μmol glucose−1. In the case of [2H5]glycerol the tracer infusion rate is in μmol·kg−1·min−1, and the labeling of plasma pool is the 2H-enrichment of plasma glycerol. The rate of hepatic glycogen synthesis was estimated from μmol of glucose equivalent/g wet weight/120 min clamp. The rate of muscle glycogen synthesis was estimated from dpm/g wet weight/specific activityplasma glucose × 120 min clamp. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistics were calculated using one-way analysis of variance, Tukey's post hoc testing was used to determine significance. Where paired data were analyzed, a ttest was used. Insulin action on glucose and lipid metabolism in vivowas examined before and during a 2-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in conscious WT, IRS-1−/−, and IRS-2−/−mice, and before the development of fasting hyperglycemia in the IRS-2−/− animals. Basal plasma glucose concentrations were similar in mice from all three genotypes (TableI). Likewise glucose production rates were comparable in all three groups during the basal period (Table I). From separate studies we have determined that fasting (18 h) insulin levels in 4-week-old mice were: WT, 10.5 ± 0.79 microunit·ml−1; IRS1−/−, 54 ± 7 microunits·ml−1; and IRS2−/−, 30 ± 2.5 microunits·ml−1 mice (n = 6 for each group). The observation of basal hyperinsulinemia in IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/−mice (p < 0.05 for each versus WT) confirm that both IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/− mice are insulin-resistant. Also, IRS-1−/− are insulin-resistant as compared with IRS-2−/− mice (p < 0.05).Table ICarbohydrate and lipid metabolism in wild type, IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/− mice.

However, in both the IRS-1−/− mice and the IRS-2−/− mice there was a significantly attenuated response to insulin with steady state glucose infusion rates being markedly reduced, i.e. 64 ± 19 μmol·kg−1·min−1in IRS1−/− mice (p < 0.05versus WT) and 28 ± 6 μmol·kg−1·min−1in IRS-2−/− (p < 0.05 versusWT) (Table I). Additionally, both IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/− mice failed to show significant changes in rates of whole-body glucose utilization during the clamp (Fig. 1 A; IRS-1−/− mice 8 ± 8% and IRS-2−/−mice 11 ± 12% increases from basal in each group, respectively,p = not significant for each from basal). Furthermore, there was a trend toward a lower glucose infusion rate in IRS-2−/− mice versus IRS-1−/−mice (p = 0.10), suggesting that animals lacking IRS-2 display more profound defects in insulin action (Table I). Thus these findings confirm that IRS-2−/− mice are markedly insulin-resistant and demonstrate for the first time that IRS-1−/− mice, studied in vivo using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, also display significant insulin resistance. Skeletal muscle, liver, and fat are the major sites of insulin action. To gain an insight into tissue-specific differences in IRS function underlying the observed insulin resistance in IRS-1−/−and IRS-2−/− mice, muscle and liver glycogen metabolism, hepatic glucose production, and whole-body lipid turnover were analyzed. Following the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp there were no significant differences in muscle glycogen content among the three genotypes, although there was a trend to lower muscle glycogen stores in the IRS-1−/− mice compared with wild-type animals (WT mice: 0.57 ± 0.07 mmol glucose equivalents·g wet weight−1; IRS-1−/− 0.43 ± 0.03 mmol glucose equivalents·g wet weight−1, p = 0.084versus WT; IRS-2−/− 0.71 ± 0.17 mmol glucose equivalents·g wet weight−1 p = not significant versus WT). In WT mice the rate of [3H]glucose incorporation into muscle glycogen was 0.3 μmol·kg−1·min−1. Both IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/− mice synthesized significantly less muscle glycogen during the clamp (IRS-1−/− 0.08 μmol·kg−1· min−1,p < 0.05 versus WT and IRS-2−/− 0.15 μmol·kg−1·min−1,p < 0.05 versus WT). Furthermore, IRS-1−/− mice synthesized significantly less glycogen than IRS-2−/− mice (p < 0.05) reflecting a more significant impairment in insulin action in the muscle of these mice. To analyze the contribution of defective insulin signaling in the liver to insulin resistance in IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/− mice, hepatic glucose production was determined. In the basal state, endogenous glucose production was similar in animals of all three genotypes (Table I). During the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, we observed a 59 ± 11% decrease in endogenous glucose production in WT mice (p< 0.05 versus basal glucose production rate) (Fig. 1 B). Likewise, IRS-1−/− mice displayed a 34 ± 12% decrease in endogenous glucose production (p < 0.05 versus basal) (Fig. 1 B), achieving a similar level of suppression to that observed in WT mice. In contrast, there was no significant effect of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp on the rate of endogenous glucose production in IRS-2−/− mice (12 ± 9% decrease in glucose production, p = not significantversus basal) (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of hepatic glycogen metabolism in the three groups of mice revealed differences in the roles of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in liver. IRS-1−/− mice had a slight reduction in hepatic glycogen content compared with WT animals (WT, 3.58 ± 1.27 mmol glucose equivalents·g wet weight−1 versusIRS-1−/− mice 2.31 ± 0.90 mmol glucose equivalents·g wet weight−1 p= not significant). In contrast, IRS-2−/− mice had markedly reduced hepatic glycogen (0.52 ± 0.13 mmol glucose equivalents·g wet weight−1,p < 0.05 versus WT mice and IRS-1−/− mice). Extrapolating from the glycogen content at the end of the clamp and the duration of the clamp, we estimated rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis. The rate of insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis in WT mice was 30 ± 11 μmol glucose·g−1· min−1. The rate of glycogen synthesis in IRS-1−/− mice was 19 ± 8 μmol·kg−1·min−1, which was not significantly different from WT mice. In contrast, the rate of insulin stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis was significantly reduced in IRS-2−/− mice (4 ± 1 μmol·kg−1·min−1,p < 0.05 versus WT mice or IRS-1−/− mice). Thus these findings demonstrate marked defects in insulin action in vivo in the liver of the IRS-2−/− mice. To determine the effects of deletion of IRS-1 and IRS-2 on lipid metabolism in vivo, we analyzed plasma glycerol and FFA concentrations and the rate of glycerol production both basally and during the clamp. Basal plasma glycerol and the basal rate of glycerol production were similar in mice from each group (Table I). In addition in mice of all three genotypes there was no change in the concentration of plasma glycerol in response to insulin. During the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp there was a comparable reduction in the rate of production of glycerol in WT mice and in IRS-1−/− mice (WT mice, 28 ± 9% reduction; IRS-1−/− mice, 30 ± 12% reduction;p < 0.05 versus basal period for each group). In contrast, we observed no reduction in the rate of production of glycerol in IRS-2−/− mice during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with only a 5 ± 6% decrease from the basal period being achieved (p = not significant versus basal period). Basal plasma FFA concentrations were similar in each group (Table I). During the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp there was a 48 ± 3% reduction in the concentration of FFA in WT mice and a 53 ± 4% reduction in the concentration of FFA in IRS-1−/− mice (p < 0.05 versus basal concentration in each). In contrast, we observed only a minor reduction in the concentration of plasma FFA in IRS-2−/− mice during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (i.e. only a 17 ± 7% decrease, p = not significant from basal concentrations). Taken together these findings suggest that IRS-2 plays a major role in regulating lipid metabolism in vivo in mice. The role of IRS proteins as mediators of insulin signaling is well established (1White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the structural similarities between IRS-1 and IRS-2 and their co-expression in insulin-sensitive tissues, it has been shown that disruption of these proteins in mice yields distinct phenotypes (7Araki E.

Nature Genetics. 1999; 23: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). While the development of diabetes in IRS-2−/− mice at least in part reflects the role of IRS-2 in beta cell function, it is less clear whether IRS-1 and IRS-2 play redundant or selective roles in mediating insulin action in insulin-sensitive tissues in vivo (9Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.-M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F.

Nature Genetics. 1999; 23: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Thus in this study we determined the insulin responsiveness of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in WT, IRS-1−/− and normoglycemic IRS-2−/− mice in vivo to evaluate the functional roles of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in muscle, liver, and fat. Our findings demonstrate that in vivo IRS-1 mediates insulin action in skeletal muscle, while IRS-2 plays important roles in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. The deletion of IRS-1 or IRS-2 causes profound resistance to insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose utilization in vivo(Fig. 1 A). Deletion of IRS-1 causes a marked defect in insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis. This is consistent with the previously reported finding of a 50% reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in isolated skeletal muscle preparations (14Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akanuma Y. Soneberg N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of IRS-2 has a small yet significant effect on insulin-stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis. We have previously shown that in vitro the absence of IRS-2 does not significantly impair insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle (15Higaki Y. Wojtaszewski J.F. Hirshman M.F. Withers D.J. Towery H. White M.F. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20791-20795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although those observations were made in a distinct experimental model (15Higaki Y. Wojtaszewski J.F. Hirshman M.F. Withers D.J. Towery H. White M.F. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20791-20795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), they suggest that IRS-2 has a role in regulating glycogen synthesis distinct from mediating insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Taken together, our previous findings (14Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akanuma Y. Soneberg N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20791-20795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and our current observations, suggest that in vivo IRS-1 has a more important role than IRS-2 in the overall regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in muscle. Consistent with these observations Kido et al. (16Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that mice with a combined heterozygous disruption of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 (IR+/−/IRS-1+/−) develop severe muscle insulin resistance and a reduction in insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, the major signaling mediator of glucose transport and glycogen synthesis (16Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In contrast, the muscle defects in IR+/−/IRS-2+/− mice in these parameters are less marked (16Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). It is well established that the regulation of hepatic glucose production by insulin is a major determinant of blood glucose concentrations (17De Fronzo R. Diabetes Rev. 1997; 5: 177-247Google Scholar). To further dissect the nature of the insulin resistance in IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/− mice, we examined hepatic carbohydrate metabolism. Basal endogenous glucose production was similar in WT, IRS-1−/−, and IRS-2−/− mice (Table I). Endogenous glucose production decreased by approximately 60% during the infusion of 5 milliunits of insulin·kg−1·min−1in overnight fasted WT mice (Fig. 1 B). These data are consistent with the results of Shen et al. (18Shen H.Q. Zhu J.-S. Baron A.D. Metabolism. 1999; 48: 965-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) who reported a dose response of insulin to glucose fluxes in awake mice. Insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production was similar in WT and IRS-1−/− mice (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, there was virtually no response to endogenous glucose production in IRS-2−/− mice (Fig. 1 B). We have recently reported (9Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.-M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) a normal response of endogenous glucose production in IRS-2+/− mice, infused with 2.5 milliunits of insulin·kg−1· min−1, as compared with virtually no response to endogenous glucose production in IRS-2−/− mice. In that study (9Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.-M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar) we observed that endogenous glucose production was almost completely suppressed at 20 milliunits of insulin·kg−1·min−1in IRS-2−/− mice, suggesting that the insulin resistance can be overcome at supraphysiological insulin concentrations. Coupled with our previous data (9Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.-M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar), our current findings suggest that deletion of IRS-2 profoundly impairs hepatic carbohydrate metabolismin vivo. Furthermore our current observations on hepatic glycogen metabolism show defects in glycogen synthesis that are significantly more marked in IRS-2−/− mice compared with the relatively mild abnormalities in the IRS-1−/− mice. These findings are consistent with our analysis of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation in the livers of IR+/−/IRS-2+/− and IR+/−/IRS-1+/− mice and the analysis of IR-deficient hepatocyte cell lines (16Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 19Rother K.I. Imai Y. Caruso M. Beguino F. Formisano P. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17491-17497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that adipose tissue (e.g.presumably the release of free fatty acids) may modulate the functions of muscle, liver, and beta cell (20Bergman R.N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 359-385PubMed Google Scholar, 21McGarry J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Indeed we have recently shown that lipid abnormalities impair insulin action in muscle (22Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 23Kim J.K. Gavrilova O. Chen Y. Reitman M.L. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8456-8460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that plasma FFA and glycerol concentrations and glycerol production were comparable in WT, IRS-1−/−, and IRS-2−/− mice, suggesting that basal lipolysis rates were similar in animals from all three genotypes (Table I). In contrast, during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp IRS-2−/−, but not IRS-1−/−, mice displayed an attenuated suppression of lipolysis suggesting an important role for IRS-2 in adipose tissue function. Isolated IRS-1−/−adipocytes show that insulin-stimulated glucose transport is attenuatedin vitro (7Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.-E. Bruning J.C. Haag B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 8Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hatakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Yoshioka S. Horikoshi H. Furuta Y. Ikawa Y. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Aizaura S. Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Additionally we have observed that isolated IRS-2−/− adipocytes do not display significant defects in glucose transport. 2J. Smith-Hall, D. J. Withers, and M. F. White, unpublished observations. Taken together these observations suggest that IRS-2, but not IRS-1, may be required for different “anti-lipolytic” responses to insulin. For example, IRS-1 may be more important for re-esterification (perhaps via insulin-mediated effects on adipose tissue glucose utilization), whereas IRS-2 may be more important for the direct inhibition of lipolysis (perhaps via effects on hormone-sensitive lipase). Our experimental design only permits an assessment of lipolysis, we are unable to comment on the role of IRS-1 or IRS-2 with regards to adipose tissue glucose utilization in vivo. Analysis of the phenotype of the IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/− mice has suggested that IRS-1 and IRS-2 display unique roles in vivo. However, previous in vivostudies on IRS-1−/− and IRS-2−/− mice involved treating animals with large doses of insulin, administered to the intraperitoneal cavity, to examine signaling events in liver and muscle. Such “supraphysiological” doses of insulin may potentially activate IGF-1 receptors (10Withers D.J. Burks D.J. Towery H. Altamuro S.L. Flint C.L. White M.F. Nature Genetics. 1999; 23: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 16Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The current study utilized a euglycemic clamp at physiological concentrations of insulin, thereby enabling us to develop a clearer picture of the role(s) of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in insulin-mediated metabolism. Thus our results demonstrate for the first time in vivo tissue-specific differences in the metabolic pathways regulated by IRS-1 and IRS-2. These signaling molecules appear to mediate divergent insulin-dependent metabolic events. Deletion of either IRS-1 or IRS-2 causes insulin resistance, which largely resides in skeletal muscle in IRS-1−/− mice, whereas IRS-2−/− mice have significant abnormalities in liver, muscle, and adipocyte function. The presence of marked skeletal muscle resistance, but not diabetes, in the IRS-1−/− mice again demonstrates that the development of glucose intolerance requires defects in multiple sites, including the muscle, liver, and adipose tissue (17De Fronzo R. Diabetes Rev. 1997; 5: 177-247Google Scholar, 24Kahn B.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Our results emphasize the critical role of IRS-2 in integrating metabolic responses to insulin in liver, muscle, and fat and thus identifies IRS-2 and its downstream effector(s) as potential common pathway in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes.

The largest crater is 5.5 kilometers across, but there is a 10-kilometer saddle-like depression with attributes of a large degraded crater. Surface lineations, both grooves and ridges, are prominent on Eros; some probably exploit planes of weakness produced by collisions on Eros and/or its parent body. Ejecta blocks (30 to 100 meters across) are abundant but not uniformly distributed over the surface. Albedo variations are restricted to the inner walls of certain craters and may be related to downslope movement of regolith. On scales of 200 meters to 1 kilometer, Eros is more bland in terms of color variations than Gaspra or Ida. Spectra (800 to 2500 nanometers) are consistent with an ordinary chondrite composition for which the measured mean density of 2.67 +/- 0.1 grams per cubic centimeter implies internal porosities ranging from about 10 to 30 percent."

These results indicate that upon ligand stimulation, at least two distinct protein complexes assemble on phosphorylated Tyr-1062 of c-Ret via Shc, one leading to activation of the Ras/Erk pathway through recruitment of Grb2/Sos and another to the PI3K/Akt pathway through recruitment of Grb2/Gab2 followed by p85PI3K and SHP-2.

Several point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements can also activate the c-Ret kinase. In humans, these mutations turn on the oncogenic potential of the c-ret gene, leading to the development of several types of cancers, including multiple endocrine neoplasias type 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B), familial medullary thyroid carcinomas, and papillary thyroid carcinomas (reviewed in Refs. 12Edery P.

Invest. 1999; 22: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the c-ret gene has been known for more than a decade, most of our knowledge about its signal transduction capabilities derives from studies of its oncogenic forms, several of which appear to activate unique signaling pathways. Activation of c-Ret initiates many of the same signal transduction pathways activated by other receptor tyrosine kinases including the Ras/Raf pathway, which leads to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2, and the PI3K pathway, which leads to activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt and cell survival (Ref. 8Trupp M.

However, it is still unclear how these two pathways are initiated by the c-Ret receptor. A number of adaptor proteins have been implicated in signaling by various oncogenic and ligand-activated forms of c-Ret, including Shc, Grb2, SNT/FRS2, Gab1, Nck, Crk, and p62Dok (8Trupp M. Scott R.

The Shc adaptor protein has been shown to interact with phosphorylated Tyr-1062 in several oncogenic forms of c-Ret (18Arighi E. Alberti L. Torriti F. Ghizzoni S. Rizzetti M.G. Pelicci G. Pasini B.

Takahashi M. Endocrinol. 1999; 140: 3992-3998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adaptor Grb2 links Shc to the Ras pathway, and other work has shown that it can also be recruited directly to c-Ret by binding to phosphorylated Tyr-1096 in the tail of the long isoform of this receptor (14Alberti L. Borrello M.G. Ghizzoni S. Torriti F. Rizzetti M.G. Pierotti M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the short c-Ret isoform, which differs from the long in the 50 C-terminal residues and lacks Tyr-1096, appears to also be able to recruit Grb2 independently of Shc, although the precise mechanism in this case is unknown (14Alberti L. Borrello M.G. Ghizzoni S. Torriti F. Rizzetti M.G. Pierotti M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1079-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Whether activation of Ras is coupled to Tyr-1062, Tyr-1096, or to other phosphorylated residues in c-Ret is still unclear. Activation of PI3K, on the other hand, has recently been shown to depend exclusively on phosphorylation of Tyr-1062 in the short isoform of the MEN2A Ret oncoprotein (25Segouffin-Cariou C. Billaud M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3568-3576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). How PI3K activation is triggered by ligand-activated c-Ret and whether this is dependent upon Ras activity is unknown. The PI3K/Akt pathway is an important regulator of neuronal survival, both in central and peripheral subpopulations (26Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.A. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Survival of sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) is critically dependent upon an intact PI3K pathway (29Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Philpott K.L. Mccarthy M.J. Klippel A. Rubin L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). GDNF is also able to activate PI3K and to promote survival of SCG neurons (31Creedon D.J. Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Osborne P.A. Lampe P.A. Fahrner T.J. Heuckeroth R.O. Milbrandt J. Johnson E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7018-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), although a causal link between these two events has not been established. In the case of NGF, both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanisms of PI3K activation are at work, each accounting for roughly 50% of the survival responses of SCG neurons to NGF (32Nobes C.D. Tolkovsky A.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Mazzoni I.E. Said F.A. Aloyz R. Miller F.D. Kaplan D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9716-9727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Ras in the survival responses elicited by GDNF has not been addressed. In the work presented here, we have investigated how the Ras and PI3K pathways couple to the c-Ret receptor when activated by GDNF in cells co-expressing the GFRα1 ligand binding subunit. These studies led us to the characterization of distinct macromolecular complexes that assemble in a ligand-dependent manner onto the activated c-Ret receptor, leading to activation of the Ras/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways. Fibroblast cell lines were derived from mouse MG87 cells, an NIH3T3 subclone. The M23 cell line was derived by stable transfection of full-length rat GFRα1 into MG87 cells. c-Ret-expressing cell lines were derived by stable transfection of wild type and mutated forms of full-length human c-Ret (long isoform) into M23 cells. MN1 is an immortalized motorneuron cell line generated by cell fusion of mouse embryonic motor neurons with a mouse neuroblastoma (34Salazar-Grueso E. Kim S. Kim H. Neuroreport. 1991; 2: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and expresses endogenous c-Ret and GFRα1. Recombinant rat GDNF was produced in SF21 insect cells and purified as described previously (35Trupp M. Rydén M. Jörnvall H. Timmusk T. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Ibáñez C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). NGF was purchased from Promega. Point mutations in human c-Ret (subcloned in pCDNA3, Invitrogen) were introduced by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis by the Kunkel method (36Kunkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers in 10-cm plates were changed to serum-free media 16 h before incubation at 37 °C with 50 ng/ml GDNF for the indicated time periods and immediately lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerolphosphate). After a 15-min lysis on ice, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were done by 4 °C overnight incubation of cell lysates with antibodies plus 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose bead slurry (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS/β-mercaptoethanol buffer. Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with the indicated antibodies followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-IgG and developed with the ECF Western detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All blots were scanned in a Storm 840 fluorimager (Molecular Dynamics). For reprobing, blots were stripped for 60 min at room temperature in 0.1 m acetic acid, 0.15 m NaCl. Antibodies were obtained from various sources as follows: anti-Shc, anti-Gab1, anti-Gab2, and anti-p85PI3K were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-Grb2, anti-SHP-2, anti-phosphotyrosine, and anti-Ret (long isoform) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Ras was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-Erk, anti-P-Erk, anti-Akt, and anti-P-Akt were from New England Biolabs (Hutchin, UK); anti-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6983 (Calbiochem) was used at 120 nm. For PI3K assays, total lysates, prepared from cells treated or not with GDNF (50 ng/ml) for 45 min, were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85PI3K antibodies. After immunoprecipitation and washing, beads were further washed twice in TNE (10 mm Tris HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA) containing 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. Pellets were then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 50 μl of TNE supplemented with 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.88 mm ATP, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by addition of HCl 6 n, and the radiolabeled lipids were extracted with CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1). Fifty μl of the organic phase were spotted on silicon TLC plates, and lipids were then separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography on phosphorscreens. For Akt kinase assays, after immunoprecipitation and washing, beads were further washed twice in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate) supplemented with protease inhibitors and incubated at room temperature for 20 min in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm ATP, and histone B2 (HB2) as substrate. After a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of SDS/β-mercaptoethanol sample buffer, boiled, fractionated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were exposed to phosphorscreens, which were subsequently scanned in a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified using ImageQuant software. After exposure, the membranes were probed with different antibodies as above. Plasmids for bacterial expression of GST fusions with amino acids 1 to 149 from the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf1 (GST-RBD), full-length p85PI3K (GST-p85PI3KFL), and full-length Grb2 (GST-Grb2FL) were obtained from Stephen Taylor (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), Jonathan Backer (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY), and James Bliska (SUNY, Stony Brook, NY), respectively. GST fusions were produced in Escherichia coli and purified by chromatography on glutathione-conjugated-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For pull-down assays, the indicated purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysates overnight at 4 °C together with glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by washing, SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting as above. The activated Ras interaction assay was performed as described previously (37Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) using the pGEX-RBD plasmid encoding a GST-RBD fusion protein. For Far Western blotting, polyvinylidene difluoride blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C, followed by an incubation of 2 h at room temperature with purified GST fusion proteins (1 μg/ml), washed, and then developed with anti-GST antibodies as above. Neuronal survival assays were performed using dissociated cultures of post-natal day 1 (P1) rat SCG. Ganglia were dissociated by 2 incubations of 30 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, the first one containing 0.025% trypsin, and the second containing 5 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) followed by mechanical trituration in neuron basal medium. Neuron basal medium consist of 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated overnight in the presence of 5 ng/ml NGF. This medium was removed on the next day and replaced by fresh medium containing anti-NGF antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and GDNF at 100 ng/ml. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem) was added together with GDNF (or with NGF at 10 ng/ml when indicated) at 10, 50, or 100 μm in neuron basal medium containing 0.6% methylcellulose to prevent cells from mechanically detaching. Survival was assessed 24 h later by counting phase-bright, neurite-bearing neurons in random fields. Microinjection was carried out using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 100, Zeiss) with an Eppendorf transjector and micromanipulator. Cells were injected into the cytoplasm with 0.5 mg/ml anti-Ras-blocking antibodies (Oncogene Research) or 0.5 mg/ml purified guinea pig IgG (Sigma) as a control and with 5 μg/ml neutral red 70-kDa Texas Red Dextran (Molecular Probes) in 0.5× phosphate-buffered saline. Texas Red Dextran-positive cells were counted 24 h later. We generated fibroblast cell lines stably expressing the GFRα1 receptor together with either wild type or mutant versions of the long isoform of human c-Ret. Tyr-1062 and Tyr-1096 have previously been shown to be phosphorylated in oncogenic forms of c-Ret, where they serve as docking sites for the Shc and Grb2 adaptor proteins, respectively. Tyr-981 lies within a consensus binding site for p85PI3K and could therefore be involved in PI3K activation by ligand-activated c-Ret. Fibroblast lines expressing the Y981F, Y1062F, Y1096F, or the double Y1062F/Y1096F c-Ret mutants were generated and tested for ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. The four c-Ret mutants could be activated by stimulation with GDNF and showed comparable levels of total tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). Mutation of Tyr-1062 abolished binding of Shc to the activated receptor, Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, and Shc binding to Grb2 after GDNF treatment (Fig. 1 B). Grb2, on the other hand, was still able to interact with the Y1062F mutant in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). This interaction was eliminated in the double mutant Y1062F/Y1096F (Fig. 1 C), confirming the capacity of Grb2 to associate with the activated receptor via phosphorylated Tyr-1096 independently of Shc. We then investigated the ability of the c-Ret mutants to activate Ras after GDNF stimulation using a pull-down assay with a fusion construct between GST and the RBD of Raf1 (GST-RBD), which interacts specifically with the GTP-loaded activated form of Ras. In cells expressing the wild type receptor, Ras was activated within 5 min after ligand stimulation, declining back to basal levels by 60 min (Fig. 2 A). No stimulation of Ras activity could be observed in the Y1062F mutant after ligand treatment (Fig. 2 A), indicating that activation of Ras by GDNF depends upon phosphorylation of this residue in c-Ret. The activation of Erk kinases, one of the downstream targets of Ras, was investigated using anti-phospho-Erk antibodies. Rapid Erk phosphorylation was induced by GDNF in cells carrying wild type c-Ret, which lasted up to 45 min after stimulation (Fig. 2 B). In the Y1062F mutant, Erk phosphorylation was greatly attenuated, although a residual, delayed, and transient activation remained 15 min after ligand stimulation (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, neither the time course or intensity of Erk phosphorylation were affected after mutation of Tyr-1096 (Fig. 2 B), confirming that this residue does not participate in activation of the Ras/Erk pathway by c-Ret. Moreover, the residual Erk phosphorylation observed in the Y1062F mutant was not eliminated in the Y1062F/Y1096F double mutant, indicating that it was not mediated via Tyr-1096. Inhibition of protein kinase C could neither block the residual Erk activation in the Y1062F mutant (Fig. 2 C), ruling out the participation of the phospholipase Cγ pathway in this response. A similar transient peak in Erk phosphorylation was also observed in a fibroblast line carrying the kinase-inactive c-Ret mutant Y905F (Fig. 2 C), which replaces a crucial tyrosine in the activation loop of the enzyme. This result suggested that the residual Erk activation remaining in the Y1062F mutant was a c-Ret-independent response. In fact, GDNF-dependent phosphorylation of Erk has been detected in cells expressing GFRα1 receptors in the absence of c-Ret (9Poteryaev D. Titievsky A. Sun Y.F. Thomas-Crusells J. Lindahl M. Billaud M. Arumäe U. Saarma M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). 2V. Besset, R. P. Scott, and C. F. Ibáñez, unpublished observations.. This novel pathway is mediated by members of the Src kinase family and appears not to involve Ras activation (8Trupp M. Scott R. Whittemore S.R. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20885-20894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), in agreement with the present findings. Thus, activation of the Ras/Erk pathway by ligand stimulation of c-Ret is mediated by phosphorylation of Tyr-1062 followed by docking of Shc and Grb2, with little or no participation of the Grb2 binding site at Tyr-1096. These results also indicated that binding of Grb2 to phosphorylated Tyr-1096 may lead to the recruitment of other c-Ret targets distinct from the Ras activator Sos. We then examined the activity of PI3K in wild type and Y1062F mutant c-Ret after GDNF treatment. Ligand stimulation caused a significant increase in PI3K activity in cells carrying wild type c-Ret (Fig. 3 A). Mutation of Tyr-1062 greatly diminished this response but did not abolished it completely; a residual 50% increase over base line could be reproducibly detected after GDNF treatment (Fig. 3 A). Stimulation of the kinase activity of Akt, a target of the PI3K pathway, in response to GDNF was also attenuated, but not totally eliminated, in cells carrying the Y1062F c-Ret mutant, which showed a residual 50% stimulation over base line (Fig. 3 B). In agreement with this, a reduced and delayed stimulation of Akt phosphorylation by GDNF could still be detected in these cells (Fig. 3 C). Together, these data indicated the existence of alternative pathways for PI3K/Akt activation independently of phosphorylation of Tyr-1062 and suggested that Tyr-1096, which bound Grb2 but did not contribute to the Ras pathway, could be involved. Indeed, ligand-dependent phosphorylation of Akt was completely eliminated in the Y1062F/Y1096F double mutant (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating the participation of Tyr-1096 in the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by c-Ret. PI3K may be activated through the recruitment of the p85PI3K regulatory subunit to activated receptors. We examined the role of p85PI3K in the activation of PI3K by c-Ret using pull-down assays with a recombinant GST-p85PI3Kfusion protein followed by c-Ret immunoblotting. GST-p85PI3K brought down wild type c-Ret in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A), suggesting a capacity of the p85PI3K subunit for interacting with the activated receptor. In agreement with our previous results, we observed a diminished but significant interaction of GST-p85PI3K with Y1062F c-Ret but not with the Y1062F/Y1096F double mutant (Fig. 4 A), underscoring the role of both these tyrosine residues in the recruitment of p85PI3K to the activated receptor. GST-p85PI3K was also able to pull-down the Y981F mutant in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A), indicating that this residue does not play a significant role in the activation of PI3K by c-Ret. This was also confirmed by the ability of this mutant to induce normal phosphorylation of Akt upon ligand stimulation (data not shown). In addition to these fibroblast cell lines, GST-p85PI3K could also precipitate c-Ret in a ligand-dependent manner from cells of neuronal origin expressing endogenous c-Ret receptors, including the motorneuron cell line MN1 and the neuroblastoma Neuro2A-α1 (Fig. 4 B). Despite its ability to precipitate c-Ret from lysates of cells stimulated with GDNF, GST-p85PI3K failed to recognize the activated receptor in Far Western overlay assays of c-Ret immunoprecipitates (data not shown), although several"

Res. 1991; 70: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, demineralized dentin matrix implants exhibited a stronger osteogenic inductive activity (3Bang G. Urist M.R. Arch. Surg. 1967; 94: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Butler W.T. Mikulski A. Urist M.R. Bridges G. Uyeno S. J. Dent.

Conover M.A. Lietze A. Finerman G.A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1982; 101: 61-81PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation studies showed that the principal activity of rat incisor dentin matrix resided in a fraction with molecular mass in the range of 6–10 kDa, with pI 5.4–5.5, and a composition devoid of cysteine, properties distinctly different from the members of the BMP-transforming growth factor β family (8Amar S. Sires B. Sabsay B. Clohisy J. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8609-8618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bessho K. Tagawa T. Murata M. J.

Res. 1991; 70: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was thus likely that the dentin matrix activity was not related to the BMP/VGR family. Unfortunately, the final peptide fractions obtained by Amar et al. (8Amar S. Sires B. Sabsay B. Clohisy J. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8609-8618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were not pure, and the amino-terminal sequence and composition data obtained could not be related to a single protein component. The very low content of the active peptides in rat incisor dentin made it impractical to continue using rat incisor dentin as the peptide source. With some modifications in isolation procedure but using the same in vitro assay systems (11Nebgen D.R. Inoue H. Sabsay B. Wei K. Ho C.-S. Veis A. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the comparable fraction was isolated from bovine dentin in essentially homogeneous form, and its activity was verified in in vitro and in vivo assays. The amino-terminal sequence and one internal tryptic peptide sequence were determined. Both sequences proved to be derived from the amino-terminal portion of bovine amelogenin (11Nebgen D.R. Inoue H. Sabsay B. Wei K. Ho C.-S. Veis A. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Gibson C. Golub E. Herold R. Risser M. Ding W. Shimokawa H. Young M. Termine J. Rosenbloom J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This was a surprising result for two reasons. First, the active peptides had been isolated from both rat and bovine dentin cleaned as well as possible from enamel contamination. Second, the principal function of the amelogenins and their degradation products have been assigned to structural roles in creating the space and milieu for promoting enamel mineralization (13Simmer J.P. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 32: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a mixture of porcine enamel proteins has been used clinically (14Hammarström L. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1997; 24: 658-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to induce cementogenesis along the tooth root surface, and the activity was attributed to amelogenin. Thus, it appeared to be of interest to explore the cell signaling activity of the amelogenin peptides. The amelogenins present in the tooth at any stage are a complex mixture of gene isoforms and degradation products (13Simmer J.P. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 32: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The two peptides partially sequenced by Nebgen et al. (11Nebgen D.R. Inoue H. Sabsay B. Wei K. Ho C.-S. Veis A. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were the products of exon 2–3 and exon 5 transcription, respectively, both from the amino-terminal region of amelogenin. Every intact amelogenin molecule, most alternatively spliced isoforms, and the major amino-terminal region degradation product known as TRAP (tyrosine-rich amelogeninpeptide) would have yielded these sequences. Amelogenin amino acid sequences are highly conserved across all species, although the human and bovine have amelogenin genes on the X and Y chromosomes, whereas rat and murine amelogenin genes reside only on the Y chromosome. These genes yield distinct sets of splice product isoforms (12Gibson C. Golub E. Herold R. Risser M. Ding W. Shimokawa H. Young M. Termine J. Rosenbloom J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Gibson C.W. Golub E.E. Abrams W.R. Shen G. Ding W. Rosenbloom J.

However, the larger amelogenins are specifically degraded in stepwise fashion and also yield a variety of smaller peptides during the process of enamel mineralization (17Moradian-Oldak J. Sarte P.E. Fincham A.G. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The “active” peptide described by Nebgen et al. (11Nebgen D.R. Inoue H. Sabsay B. Wei K. Ho C.-S. Veis A. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was characterized only by amino-terminal sequencing. It was not determined whether it was an amelogenin degradation product or an intact polypeptide transcribed and translated as a specific enamel gene splice product. This is a very important distinction relative to the function and regulation of the potential in vivo activity of the peptide. Thus, the objective of the work reported here was to determine whether the message corresponding to the specific gene splice product was present and, if so, to prepare the peptide and determine whether it could express the cell inductive activities equivalent to the peptide isolated by Nebgen et al. (11Nebgen D.R. Inoue H. Sabsay B. Wei K. Ho C.-S. Veis A. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because the protein isolation work (7Veis A. Sires B. Clohisy J. Sabsay B. Amar S. Biomaterials. 1990; 11: 35-37PubMed Google Scholar, 8Amar S. Sires B. Sabsay B. Clohisy J. Veis A. J. Biol.

The rationale for choosing the rat incisor cDNA library was 3-fold. First, there is high conservation of the amelogenin sequences between rat and bovine species (13Simmer J.P. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 32: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Second, our cDNA library has been verified (18George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ritchie H.H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol.

Third, the mRNAs for these three dentin proteins are transiently expressed in mouse molar enamel organs during fetal and immediately post-natal tooth development (21George A. Silberstein R. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22D'Souza R.N. Cavender A. Sunavala G. Alvarez J. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner.

Freshly extracted rat incisors were cleaned to remove the soft enamel. The odontoblasts and pulp cells were retained. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from these cells using the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). The mRNA was converted to first strand cDNA using an 18-mer oligo(dT) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first strand cDNA was then used in PCR.1 The forward primer (P1) ATGCCTCTACCACCT was based on the amelogenin amino-terminal peptide sequence MPLPP, and the reverse primer (P2) TATCATGCTCTGGTACCA corresponded to the tryptic peptide sequence WYQSMI (11Nebgen D.R. Inoue H. Sabsay B. Wei K. Ho C.-S. Veis A. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the rat amelogenin gene intron-exon organization and the specific location of the primers. The PCR conditions were 25 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Two PCR product bands differing in size by 42 nucleotides were obtained. These were further amplified by another round of PCR and then cloned in pGEMT vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. Each of the amplified bands was used to screen a previously prepared λgt11 rat incisor odontoblast cDNA library (18George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were picked and plaque purified through three successive rounds of screening. Finally, pure plaques were then amplified, and phage DNA was prepared (24Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.60-2.83Google Scholar), digested with EcoRI, and then cloned into theEcoRI site of pBluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. Because two amelogenin amino-terminal domain PCR products were obtained initially, two new primers were designed to examine the possibility of differentially spliced products. Forward primer (P3) TTCCCGAATTCCATGCCCCTACCACCTCA contained a uniqueEcoRI site (underlined) and included the first fifteen nucleotides of the secreted form of the protein. The reverse primer (P4) GGCCGCTCGAGTTAATCCACTTCTTCCCG contained a uniqueXhoI site (underlined) and included the last 15 nucleotides and the stop codon TAA. These primers (see Fig. 1 A) were used in a PCR reaction under the conditions described above using the phage DNA obtained from amplification of the same λgt11 odontoblast library as template. The PCR amplified bands were cloned in pGEMT vector and sequenced. The cloned amelogenins were expressed as the GST fusion proteins. The inserts in pGEMT were reamplified by PCR using the primers P3 and P4 and conditions described above. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, purified on a 1% agarose gel, and cloned in frame into theEcoRI/XhoI site of the GST expression vector pGEXT4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting plasmid was introduced into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). For preparation of the fusion protein, a single colony was inoculated into 100 ml of LB and grown overnight. An additional 900 ml of LB was added, and growth continued for 4 h, after which isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to a final concentration of 1 μm. Incubation was carried on for an additional 4 h. The expressed protein was then passed over and collected on a glutathione-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For different purposes, either the fusion proteins were directly eluted from the column with reduced glutathione or the bound protein was treated with thrombin to release the recombinant peptide. In most preparations, the thrombin released peptides were a heterogeneous mixture. Therefore, the eluted thrombin cleaved protein was passed over a C-18 reverse phase column (Vydac, Sep/a/ra/tions Group, Hesperia, CA) developed by an increasing gradient of acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid as described (11Nebgen D.R. Inoue H. Sabsay B. Wei K. Ho C.-S. Veis A. J. Dent. Res. 1999; 78: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) for the final step of purification of the protein extracted from dentin matrix. The purified recombinant proteins were tested for biological activity by the assay for enhanced incorporation of35[S]SO4 into proteoglycan (8Amar S. Sires B. Sabsay B. Clohisy J. Veis A. J. Biol.

The cells were trypsinized and passed into T75 flasks and grown again to ∼80% confluence. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. Conditioning medium (0.5% FBS in α-minimum essential medium, 1% pen/strep) was added, and the cells were held for 24 h. The conditioning medium was replaced with fresh conditioning medium containing various concentrations of the test factors or no additions for the controls. At selected time periods of incubation, the cells were washed in PBS, detached with trypsin. An equal volume of 10% FBS was added, and the cells were pelleted. The pelleted cells were suspended in PBS, repelleted, and stored at −80 °C. RNA was isolated from the cells using the Rneasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions. Reverse transcription was ycarried out using the Promega RT system with reaction at 49 °C for 50 min. The gene-specific primers were used in every case for the reverse transcription reaction, except for the type I collagen.

The polymer scaffolds were cast as 2.5-cm discs containing a total of 1 mg of recombinant protein, 1 mg of BSA, 1 mg of rhBMP2, or 1.5 mg of Emdogain. Each disc was cut into six equal wedges. A wedge was then placed into the right hind thigh muscle of a 4-week-old, ∼100-g Long-Evans rat. A negative control wedge of bovine serum albumin in PBS was placed in the contralateral left thigh. Four animals were used for each test condition. All surgical implant protocols and animal care procedures were reviewed and approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee. The implants were followed radiographically with a measurement every week. The matrices were removed at 4 or 6 weeks after implantation and processed for histology. The implant blocks were fixed in 10% formalin, radiographed, and then embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were cut and examined following staining with standard hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), von Kossa, Alizarin Red, and Goldner's Trichrome stains. The sections were deparaffinized with xylene washes three times for 3 min each time and rehydrated by passage through decreasing concentrations of alcohol. The tissue was then fixed in 10% formalin for 15 min and washed 1 min with PBS. The cells were permeabilized by exposure to acetone for 5 min, washed 1 min with PBS, blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% BSA, and then washed with PBS. Primary antibody was added to each section directly without dilution from stock (10–20 μl/section). Sections were incubated in the dark for 1 h and then washed three times for 1 min with PBS. The secondary antibody was applied at 1:50 dilution (10–20 μl/section). The sections were incubated for 1 h in the dark and then washed three times with PBS (1 min/wash).

Gorski, University of Missouri, Kansas City. Secondary antibodies were Texas Red conjugated to anti-mouse IgG for BSP and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG for BAG-75. These antibodies were all from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA. Nuclei were labeled with DAPI reagent (Pierce) When the PCR primers P1 and P2 were used to probe the mRNA isolated from fresh rat incisor odontoblast pulp complex (Fig. 1A), two PCR products were detected (Fig. 2 A) and sequenced. Their nucleotide sequences corresponded to the amino acid sequences,MPLPPHPGHPGYINFSYEVLTPLKWYQSMI (PCR90) (primers P1 and P2 underlined), andMPLPPHPGHPGYINFSYEKSHSQAINTDRTALVLTPLKWYQSMI(PCR132). The band corresponding to PCR90 was much more intense than that for PCR132. PCR90 corresponded exactly to the secreted protein amino-terminal sequence encoded by rat amelogenin gene exons 2, 3, and 5. PCR132 included exon 4 (sequence in italics above) (46Hu C-C. Ryu O.H. Qian Q. Zhang C.H. Simmer J.P. J. Dent. Res. 1997; 76: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data established that differentially spliced amelogenin mRNAs, containing exons 2, 3, and 5 and 2–5, respectively, were indeed present in the presumed odontoblast pulp tissue. Based on the higher intensity of PCR90 on the gels, it is likely that there was a higher concentration of its mRNA than for the PCR132 transcript containing exon 4, although this could also signify that the two mRNAs require different conditions for optimal reverse transcription. When the established odontoblast pulp rat incisor λgt11 cDNA library (18George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was screened with forward and reverse primers P3 and P4, four PCR product bands were amplified from the template phage DNA. The PCR bands at approximately 600 and 200 bp were strong, and PCR 650 and PCR250 were weak. All four bands were reamplified (Fig. 2 B) and cloned in pGEMT vector and sequenced. These data s"

FXR functions as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor and in the presence of ligand, the heterodimer binds to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of target genes to regulate gene transcription. Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) has been identified as a possible target gene for FXR because the human promoter contains a potential FXR response element, an inverted repeat in which consensus receptor-binding hexamers are separated by one nucleotide (inverted repeat-1). PLTP is essential in the transfer of very low density lipoprotein phospholipids into high density lipoprotein (Jiang, X. C., Bruce, C., Mar, J., Lin, M., Ji, Y., Francone, O. L., and Tall, A. R. (1999) J. Clin. Invest. 103, 907–914). Here we report the regulation of PLTP gene expression by FXR and bile acids. In CV-1 cells, cotransfection of FXR and the retinoid X receptor resulted in bile acid-dependent transactivation of a luciferase reporter construct containing the human PLTP promoter. Mutation analysis demonstrated that the inverted repeat-1 (IR-1) in the PLTP promoter is required for this transactivation. Finally, we demonstrate that bile acids are able to regulate PLTP gene expression in vivo. Mice fed a chow diet supplemented with bile acid showed increased hepatic PLTP mRNA levels. These results suggest that FXR may play a role in high density lipoprotein metabolism via the regulation of PLTP gene expression.

Bile acids, in the form of bile, are secreted from the gallbladder into the small intestine, where they act as detergents to emulsify dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. Approximately 95% of bile acids are recycled in the small intestine by enterocytes and returned to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation, whereas 5% escape into the colon and are excreted from the body. Bile acids also play a role in the regulation of gene transcription, as they were recently shown to be physiological ligands for the farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR)1 (2Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y.

Of the bile acids, the most potent activator of FXR is chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), which is able to both mediate FXR transcriptional activation and recruit steroid receptor coactivator-1 to the ligand-binding domain of FXR (3Parks D.J.

Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol.

It functions as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to response elements in the promoters of target genes to regulate gene transcription. The FXR-RXR heterodimer binds with highest affinity to an inverted repeat-1 (IR-1) response element, in which consensus receptor-binding hexamers are separated by one nucleotide. Intestinal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP) was the first identified direct target of FXR (2Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). I-BABP is a cytosolic protein that mediates bile acid uptake in the ileum and through its regulation FXR is able to modulate the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. We have identified PLTP as a possible target for FXR because its promoter contains one copy of a potential FXR response element, IR-1 (9Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10638-10647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). PLTP is a member of the lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein gene family (10Lagrost L. Desrumaux C. Masson D. Deckert V. Gambert P. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Other members in the family include the cholesteryl ester transfer protein, the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, and the bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (10Lagrost L. Desrumaux C. Masson D. Deckert V. Gambert P. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PLTP is present in the plasma as a free or HDL-bound protein and is expressed at the highest levels in the placenta, pancreas, adipose tissue, and lung, with intermediate levels in the liver, kidney, and heart (11Bruce C. Chouinard Jr., R.A. Tall A.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 297-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although the function of PLTP is still unclear, several studies, including results with PLTP knockout mice, indicate that PLTP has a role in HDL metabolism (1Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The physiological function of PLTP in HDL metabolism is important because of the inverse relationship between atherosclerosis and the level of HDL (12Rader D.J. Maugeais C. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 170-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The PLTP knockout mice confirmed previous in vivo studies that suggested a role for PLTP in the transfer of phospholipids from large-sized triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to HDL. An in vivo lipid transfer activity assay showed that the transfer of plasma phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and sphingomyelin) and free cholesterol from very low density lipoprotein to HDL is absent in PLTP knockout mice (1Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In addition, the knockout mice showed a 60–70% reduction in HDL levels, possibly the result of an increase in the catabolism of HDL protein and cholesteryl ester (13Qin S. Kawano K. Bruce C. Lin M. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. Jiang X. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 269-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The liver is at the center of cholesterol homeostasis, as it is the site where cholesterol is biosynthesized from precursor molecules and catabolized into bile acids. Maintaining cholesterol homeostasis includes the regulation of gene expression by both cholesterol and bile acids. The physiological role of PLTP in the maintenance of HDL metabolism makes PLTP a good candidate for cholesterol and/or bile acid regulation. Except for a response element for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor in the human promoter (14Tu A.Y. Albers J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), not much is known about the regulation of hepatic PLTP gene expression. Since FXR and PLTP are coexpressed in the liver, where bile acids are present at concentrations required to activate FXR, and because the human PLTP promoter has a potential FXR response element, we decided to study the role of FXR and its ligand CDCA in the regulation of PLTP gene expression. Part of the human PLTP gene promoter, including the PLTP IR-1, was linked to the luciferase reporter gene. In monkey kidney CV-1 cells, cotransfection of FXR and RXR resulted in transactivation of the PLTP promoter in the presence of the ligand CDCA, and mutation of the PLTP IR-1 eliminated this response. As expected, the FXR-RXR heterodimer bound specifically to the PLTP IR-1, but not to the mutant form, as shown by a gel mobility shift assay. Finally, the physiological role of FXR and bile acids in the regulation of PLTP gene expression was studied in mice. In the liver, PLTP gene expression was significantly increased when mice were fed a chow diet supplemented with 1% cholic acid. The pPLTP(−2800/+15) plasmid (15Tu A.Y. Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction to generate 955-, 385-, and 335-base pair fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the human PLTP promoter. These fragments were cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) upstream of the luciferase gene to generate the PLTP940, PLTP370, and PLTP320 reporter constructs, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and restriction digests. The PLTP IR-1 of the PLTP940 reporter construct was mutated using the ChameleonTMdouble-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Three different mutants were generated using the following oligonucleotides: MUT1, cgctgaaggaagaaactgatttatagtgacccaagtgaagtgacttgc; MUT2, ggaagaaactgagggtca-gttttttaagtgaagtgacttgccc; and MUT3, cgctgaaggaagaaactgatttatagt-tttttaagtgaagtgacttgcccaagatcatgcagg. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfections were carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum using calcium phosphate precipitation. The cells were plated in 24-well multiwell dishes to ∼80% confluence and transfected either with 137.5 ng of pCDM8 or with 125 ng of pCDM8-FXR and 12.5 ng of pCDM8-RXRα plus 375 ng of the indicated reporter construct and 50 ng of pTKGH per well for 12 h. Following a phosphate-buffered saline wash, the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% charcoal-stripped serum and vehicle alone (ethanol) or 25, 50, or 100 μmCDCA. After a 36-h incubation, cells were harvested, and luciferase was assayed as described previously (16Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Growth hormone was measured using the human growth hormone transient gene expression kit (Nichols Institute). Using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), in vitrotranscribed/translated RIP14 and human RXRα were generated from pT7-lac-His-Myc expression vectors containing either the RIP14 (6Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or RXRα (17Zavacki A.M. Lehmann J.M. Seol W. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7909-7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) full-length cDNA. The following oligonucleotides were used for the gel shift assay: an Sp1-binding site; PLTP IR-1, gaaactgaGGGTCAgTGACCCaagtgaag; PLTP IR-1 MUT1, gaaactgaTTTATAgTGACCCaagtgaag; PLTP IR-1 MUT2, gaaactgaGGGTCAgTCTTTTaagtgaag; and PLTP IR-1 MUT3, gaaactgaTTTATAgTTTTTTaagtgaag. Double-stranded PLTP IR-1 was end-labeled with [α-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Proteins were preincubated in 20 μl of gel shift buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 60 mmKCl, 0.065 mm EDTA (pH 8), 16.25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5% Ficoll 400, 0.65 mm dithiothreitol, and 300 ng of poly(dI-dC)). For the competition analysis, a 1000-fold molar excess of the Sp1-binding site or a 1-, 10-, 100-, or 1000-fold molar excess of the PLTP IR-1 or of the PLTP IR-1 MUT1, MUT2, or MUT3 was included. After a 15-min incubation on ice, labeled PLTP IR-1 was added, and the samples were further incubated on ice for 30 min. The samples were analyzed by 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 1× Tris acetate/EDTA. C57BL/6 male mice (8–10 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan, Inc. The mice were maintained on 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed ad libitum a standard mouse diet. To study the effect of bile acids on PLTP gene expression, mice (n = 3) were fed ad libitum the standard diet supplemented with 1% cholic acid (test diet). After 30 days, the mice were killed. Their livers were harvested, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further processing. All procedures in this study were performed in accordance with guidelines set by the Center for Comparative Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Total RNA was extracted from the liver using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method as described (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar), and mRNA was isolated using Oligotex suspension (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The mRNA (5 μg) was resolved on a 2.2 m formaldehyde and 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane using the Turboblotter Rapid Downward Transfer system (Schleicher & Schüll). A mouse cDNA probe for PLTP (1.7 kilobase pairs) was derived from the mouse PLTP cDNA (19Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Day J.R. Ching A.F. Lok S. Tu A.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The membrane was stripped with 60% formamide and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and reprobed with human β-actin cDNA probe (CLONTECH). Probes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Random Primers DNA labeling system kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Bands were quantitated using a densitometer and ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and were standardized against β-actin controls. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of the difference of the means was evaluated using the two-sample t test for independent samples with equal variances. The FXR-RXRα heterodimer binds to specific DNA sequences in the promoters of target genes to regulate gene transcription. The DNA sequences recognized by the heterodimer include several direct and inverted repeats of the consensus receptor-binding hexamer, including an IR-1 (6Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 72-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was deduced that the FXR-RXRα heterodimer binds with highest affinity to the consensus sequence RGGTCA arranged as an IR-1 (9Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10638-10647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, a data base search using the IR-1 consensus sequence identified an IR-1 with a perfect match to the consensus sequence in the promoter of the human PLTP gene (9Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10638-10647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To characterize the regulation of the human PLTP promoter by FXR via the IR-1, 955 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the human PLTP promoter were cloned upstream of the luciferase gene to generate PLTP940. Monkey kidney CV-1 cells were cotransfected with FXR and RXRα expression plasmids plus the PLTP940 reporter construct in the absence of ligand or in the presence of 100 μm CDCA and/or 1 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid, an RXRα ligand (Fig. 1 A). Cells cotransfected with FXR and RXRα showed an ∼10-fold induction of the PLTP940 promoter when treated with 100 μm CDCA relative to untreated cells. As expected from previous results (8Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), a weaker transactivation was observed with 9-cis-retinoic acid alone, and addition of 9-cis-retinoic acid augmented the CDCA response. The transactivation of the PLTP940 reporter construct by CDCA via FXR was dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B). Although a plateau was not reached due to the toxicity of higher bile acid concentrations, CDCA activated the PLTP940 promoter with an estimated half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 37 μm. This agrees well with the EC50 of 35 μm estimated for the activation of the I-BABP promoter by CDCA (8Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine if the PLTP IR-1 is necessary for the transactivation of the PLTP940 promoter, two other reporter constructs were generated, PLTP370 and PLTP320 (Fig. 2 A). Only the PLTP940 and PLTP370 reporter constructs contain the IR-1, as it is located between nucleotides −339 and −327. Both the PLTP940 and PLTP370 reporter constructs were induced ∼10- and 8-fold, respectively, in the presence of 100 μm CDCA (Fig. 2 B), whereas the PLTP320 reporter construct lacking the IR-1 showed only minimal transactivation. The basis for this residual response is unclear, as no other candidate bile acid response elements were identified in this region. To confirm these 5′-deletion results in the context of the PLTP940 reporter construct, mutations were introduced into either one or both of the IR-1 half-sites (PLTP940 MUT1, MUT2, and MUT3) (Fig. 3 A). In all three cases, FXR and CDCA had only a modest residual effect on luciferase gene expression (Fig. 3 B). As expected, the FXR-RXRα heterodimer is able to bind specifically to the IR-1 in a gel mobility shift assay (9Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10638-10647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but neither FXR nor RXRα could bind oligonucleotide alone (Fig. 4). Competition analysis showed that an unlabeled IR-1 oligonucleotide was able to compete for binding at a 100- or 1000-fold molar excess, whereas a 1000-fold molar excess of a nonspecific competitor, an Sp1-binding site, had no effect. Furthermore, the three different mutant versions of the IR-1 (PLTP IR-1 MUT1, MUT2, and MUT3) were also unable to compete for binding at a 1-, 10-, 100-, or 1000-fold molar excess. These results demonstrate that the FXR-RXRα heterodimer is able to bind specifically to the IR-1 located between nucleotides −339 and −327 in the PLTP gene promoter and confirm that the introduced mutations block this binding. We conclude that the IR-1 is required for the FXR and CDCA activation of the PLTP promoter. The physiological role of FXR and CDCA in the regulation of PLTP gene expression was studied in mouse liver because FXR and PLTP are coexpressed there. To test the effect of bile acids on the expression of PLTP, male mice were fed chow supplemented with 1% cholic acid. We chose to study the effects of a cholic acid diet on the expression of the PLTP gene since this diet was previously shown to activate FXR (20Chiang J.Y. Kimmel R. Weinberger C. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10918-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Bjorkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A modest but significant increase in the level of PLTP mRNA expression was seen in the mice fed the cholic acid diet (Fig. 5, A and B). This result demonstrates that bile acids can regulate the expression of the PLTP gene in vivo. We have characterized the role of FXR and bile acids in the regulation of PLTP gene expression. Our results show that FXR and bile acids can regulate the human PLTP promoter. CDCA induced the expression of the reporters containing the PLTP promoter ∼8–10-fold in the presence of the FXR-RXRα heterodimer, and this response required the PLTP IR-1 element. To determine whether bile acids could regulate PLTP gene expression in vivo, we fed mice a chow diet supplemented with 1% cholic acid and observed a 1.6-fold increase in the level of PLTP mRNA in the livers of mice fed the cholic acid diet. Previously, it was shown that a taurocholic acid diet results in a similar increase in the expression of the murine I-BABP gene in the small intestine (8Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The relatively modest magnitude of these responses may be due to the fact that both PLTP and I-BABP are expressed in tissues where the endogenous level of bile acids is already high. The regulation of PLTP by FXR suggests a model in which cholesterol, in the form of bile acids, is able to indirectly regulate its return to the liver via HDL. HDL is thought to promote the delivery of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver via the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, and numerous studies have shown it to have anti-atherogenic properties (12Rader D.J. Maugeais C. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 170-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this scenario, an increase in bile acids due to a higher cholesterol concentration would result in increased HDL levels as a consequence of the induction of PLTP gene expression by FXR and bile acids. This model is consistent with what is known about the physiological functions of PLTP and FXR. Both PLTP and FXR are coexpressed in tissues where bile acids are present at concentrations that are required to activate FXR. Studies with PLTP knockout mouse revealed that HDL levels were decreased by 60–70% (1Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), demonstrating that PLTP is essential for maintaining HDL levels. The PLTP knockout study showed that PLTP is required for the transfer of very low density lipoprotein phospholipids into HDL. Thus, induction of PLTP expression by bile acid-activated FXR should result in increased HDL levels. This model is also consistent with a number of human studies. High cholesterol diets have been reported to increase plasma HDL levels. In addition, in the initial stages of primary biliary cirrhosis, a cholestatic disease, serum HDL levels are increased as expected (22Poupon R.E. Ouguerram K. Chretien Y. Verneau C. Eschwege E. Magot T. Poupon R. Hepatology. 1993; 17: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Hiraoka H. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Kubo M. Nozaki S. Sakai N. Hirano K. Kawata S. Tarui S. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The initial rise in HDL levels could be the direct result of an increase in PLTP gene expression, as an increasing bile acid level in the liver activates FXR. Interestingly, several studies of patients with cholestatic diseases have also shown that HDL is enriched in surface lipids, phospholipids, and free cholesterol (24Gylling H. Farkkila M. Vuoristo M. Miettinen T.A. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 89-95PubMed Google Scholar, 25Coulhon M.P. Tallet F. Yonger J. Agneray J. Raichvarg D. Clin. Chim.

Acta. 1996; 244: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), perhaps as the result of an increase in PLTP gene expression, via FXR activation, by elevated bile acid levels in the liver. Although this model implies that a bile acid diet should increase HDL levels, HDL metabolism is complex and involves many proteins, including apoA-I. A recent study in mice has shown that a cholic acid diet down-regulates hepatic apoA-I mRNA, resulting in decreased HDL levels (28Srivastava R.A. Srivastava N. Averna M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this down-regulation is not clear. Moreover, the PLTP promoter can also be regulated by fenofibrate via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element located upstream of the IR-1 (19Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Day J.R. Ching A.F. Lok S. Tu A.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, although an increase in bile acid can result in higher HDL levels, a number of other factors clearly contribute to the overall regulation of cholesterol metabolism. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that FXR and bile acids can regulate PLTP gene expression. This regulation is consistent with the physiological roles of FXR and PLTP and suggests that FXR may have a role in regulating HDL metabolism. We thank Dr. John J.

We identify threonine 423, a conserved threonine in the activation loop of kinase subdomain VIII, as the PDK1 phosphorylation site on PAK1. Threonine 423 is a previously identified PAK1 autophosphorylation site that lies within a PAK consensus phosphorylation sequence. After pretreatment with phosphatases, autophosphorylation of PAK1 occurred at all major sites except threonine 423. A phosphothreonine 423-specific antibody detected phosphorylation of recombinant, catalytically inactive PAK1 after incubation with wild-type PAK1, indicating phosphorylation of threonine 423 occurs by an intermolecular mechanism. The biological significance of PDK1 phosphorylation of PAK1 at threonine 423 in vitro is supported by the observation that these two proteins interact in vivo and that PDK1-phosphorylated PAK1 has an increased activity toward substrate. An increase of phosphorylation of catalytically inactive PAK1 was observed in COS-7 cells expressing wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, PDK1 upon elevation of intracellular sphingosine levels. PDK1 phosphorylation of PAK1 was not blocked by pretreatment with wortmannin or when PDK1 was mutated to prevent phosphatidylinositol binding, indicating this process is independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. The data presented here provide evidence for a novel mechanism for PAK1 regulation and activation.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These kinases were discovered by their ability to selectively bind the Rho GTPase family members Cdc42 and Rac (2Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Like all low molecular weight GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac exist in an inactive, GDP-bound state and an active, GTP-bound state (3Aelst L.V. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). PAK1 specifically binds the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 or Rac (3Aelst L.V. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), resulting in a conformational change that leads to autophosphorylation on several serine and/or threonine residues and an increase in activity toward substrates (4Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the ability of a membrane-targeted PAK1 to become activated in a Cdc42- or Rac-independent manner suggested that alternate mechanisms for PAK1 activation must exist (5Bokoch G.M.

Certain sphingolipids, such as sphingosine, but not ceramide or sphingosine 1-phosphate, were subsequently shown to activate PAK1, suggesting PAKs also transduce lipid signals (5Bokoch G.M.

In addition to the kinase domain, PAK1 also contains a p21 binding domain (PBD), which binds active Cdc42 and Rac, an autoinhibitory domain (AID), four proline-rich regions, and an acidic domain. The first proline-rich region interacts with the adapter protein Nck (6Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A. Knaus U.G. J. Biol.

Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), appear to be independent of PAK kinase activity, suggesting PAKs may also act as intermolecular scaffolds. However, accumulating evidence indicates that PAK phosphorylates key cytoskeletal components. PAK1 phosphorylates and down-regulates myosin light chain kinase activity (18Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase (19Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N.

PAKs also play a regulatory role in apoptosis, phosphorylating and inactivating the pro-apoptotic protein Bad (20Schurmann A. Mooney A. Sanders L. Sells M. Wang H. Reed J. Bokoch G. Mol. Biol.

King, unpublished data. suggesting an important regulatory role in the inflammatory response. The requirement for PAK kinase activity in such diverse processes underscores the importance of understanding the molecular basis for regulation of PAK activity.The kinetics of PAK autophosphorylation in human neutrophils stimulated with the chemoattractant f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) is rapid. Maximum autophosphorylation occurs within 30 s to 1 min and decreases to basal levels after 5 min (23Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to the rapid (30 s) and transient activation (<5 min) in stimulated neutrophils, PAK activation in vitro is slow (15–20 min) and sustained (7Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that additional mechanisms of PAK regulation exist in vivo. Recent data suggest that PAK family members may be regulated by phosphorylation. The yeast PAK homolog, Ste20, was shown to be phosphorylated by the yeast cell cycle-dependent kinase Cdc28 when complexed with Cln2 (24Wu C. Leeuw T. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. J. Biol.

PAK activity has also been shown to be down-regulated after phosphorylation by the neuron-specific p35/cyclin-dependent kinase 5 complex (25Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Field et al. (21Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol.

Additionally, we recently showed that kinase subdomain VIII of PAK1 could be phosphorylatedin vitro by PDK1, suggesting phosphorylation events within the catalytic domain may regulate PAK1 activity (26King C.C. Zenke F.T. Dawson P.E. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Hemmings B.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Although the PDK1 PH domain binds the products of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) reaction, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5-P3), with low nanomolar affinity (32Currie R.A.

Rather, binding of these lipids is necessary to localize PDK1 to the plasma membrane. The enzyme has been reported to have a low level of kinase activity (27Niederberger C. Schweingruber M.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G.

Recently, our laboratory showed that sphingosine, another biologically active lipid, activated PDK1 toward a variety of substrates (26King C.C. Zenke F.T. Dawson P.E. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C.

It is well established that PDK1 phosphorylates the activation loop (kinase subdomain VIII) of AGC kinase family members p70S6 kinase, Akt, protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase), various protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (26King C.C.

J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar).Until recently, the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate substrates has been thought to be modulated by localization of the enzyme to the membrane through the carboxyl-terminal PH domain. PDK1 plays a regulatory role in phosphorylating substrates whose activation loops are accessible in quiescent cells, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase and PKCβII. Indeed, heterologous phosphorylation of PKCβII by PDK1 is absolutely required to make PKCβII catalytically competent (36Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Other defined PDK1 substrates appear to have their activation loop masked by regulatory domains in resting cells. Upon cell stimulation, the activation loop is exposed by a conformational change, allowing PDK1 access to its substrate. For example, p70S6 kinase must undergo multiple regulatory phosphorylations by proline-directed protein kinases before PDK1 can phosphorylate the activation loop of p70S6 kinase (38Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Another example is the well defined mechanism of Akt activation: binding of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 to the PH domain of Akt precedes PDK1 phosphorylation of the activation loop (31Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Regulatory phosphorylation(s) and/or conformational changes incurred by the binding of regulatory molecules have been hypothesized to expose the activation loop of PDK1 substrates in stimulated cells. Although PAKs are not members of the AGC kinase family, they show many similarities to PDK1 substrates. First, the kinase domain interacts with an AID that requires binding of Cdc42-GTP, Rac-GTP, or sphingosine to relieve this interaction (39Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Additionally, sequence alignment of the activation loop of PAK1 with kinase substrates of PDK1 shows a high degree of homology (26King C.C. Zenke F.T. Dawson P.E. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Hemmings B.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18108-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that PAK1 phosphorylates other PAK1 molecules at the activation loop threonine 423 by an intermolecular autophosphorylation mechanism. Pretreatment of PAK1 with phosphatase enzymes prevented phosphorylation of threonine 423, but had a slight effect on the ability of PAK1 to autophosphorylate at other sites. PDK1 phosphorylates PAK1 in the presence of sphingosine specifically at threonine 423. Support for the biological significance of this phosphorylation is strengthened by the observation that these two proteins interact in vivo and that PDK1-phosphorylated PAK1 has an increased activity toward substrate. Finally, we show that wild-type PDK1, but not catalytically inactive PDK1, phosphorylates PAK1 in NIH3T3 cells. Phosphorylation of PAK1 by PDK1 is independent of PtdIns 3-kinase activity. Wortmannin, a PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor, and mutation of PDK1 to prevent phosphatidylinositol lipid binding did not alter the ability of PDK1 to phosphorylate PAK1. These studies suggest PAK1 activity is controlled, in part, by phosphorylation of the activation loop by PDK1 and that this may be an important regulatory step for activation in vivo.DISCUSSIONUntil recently, the regulation of PAK activity has been thought to occur primarily through the binding of activated GTPases or sphingosine to the amino-terminal regulatory domain. Reports of Ste20 phosphorylation by Cln2/Cdc28 (24Wu C. Leeuw T. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28107-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and PAK1 phosphorylation by p35/cdk5 (25Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and Akt (21Tang Y. Zhou H. Chen A. Pittman R.N. Field J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9106-9109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that kinases also regulate PAK activity. In this study, we present data indicating that PDK1 phosphorylates threonine 423 in the activation loop of PAK1 in the presence of sphingosine. PDK1 interacts with PAK1 in vivoand phosphorylation of PAK1 by PDK1 increases PAK1 kinase activity. This process was not blocked by wortmannin, and occurred normally in a PDK1 mutant that cannot bind PtdIns lipids, indicating that the process is PtdIns 3-kinase independent. Although PAK1 and PDK1 interactin vivo in a variety of cell lines, we were unable to see a direct interaction between the two purified proteins. This is consistent with the observation that PAK1 does not contain a PDK1 binding motif (49Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The results suggest that another protein(s) is required to link PAK1 and PDK1.PDK1 phosphorylates PAK1 on threonine 423, an amino acid previously suggested to be an autophosphorylation site. Our laboratory and others have observed that recombinant or immunoprecipitated PAK1 is autophosphorylated at multiple sites, including threonine 423, when activated by Rho GTPases or sphingosine (4Manser E.

Our data support the hypothesis that threonine 423 is in fact an inefficient PAK1 autophosphorylation site, and that threonine 423 phosphorylation may result from the activation and phosphorylation of a localized PAK1 population by PDK1. Our data suggest that a fraction of PAK1 is phosphorylated at threonine 423 prior to stimulation. First, the activation loop antibody (Fig. 2 A) recognized a portion of immunoprecipitated PAK1 that was phosphorylated at threonine 423 in unstimulated COS-7 cell lysates. No PAK1 was detected with this antibody after treatment with phosphatase, indicating that there was no cross-reactivity with dephosphorylated PAK1. Examination of threonine 423 by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy detected both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of PAK1 in lysates from COS-7 cells, providing further evidence for a fraction of threonine 423 phosphorylated PAK1. 3C. C. King and G. M. Bokoch, unpublished results. Second, threonine 423 falls within a PAK1 consensus phosphorylation sequence of Lys-Arg-X-(Ser/Thr) (49Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, immunoprecipitated PAK1 phosphorylated recombinant PAK1 K299A at threonine 423. This provides additional evidence that PAK1 can transphosphorylate other PAK1 molecules (39Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).Activation of PDK1 and PtdIns 3-kinase activation have been linked (50Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). PDK1 has a carboxyl-terminal PH domain and has been shown to bind and localize to the membrane in response to increased levels of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. However, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 has not been shown to activate PDK1 itself; instead, PtdIns 3,4,5-P3appears to act on PDK1 substrates. PAK1 K299A is phosphorylated in PDGF stimulated NIH3T3 cells transfected with wild-type PDK1 or PDK1 R474A, a mutation in the PH domain previously shown to prevent binding of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3 (51Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These data, coupled with the observation that in vivo PAK1 phosphorylation is independent of wortmannin in NIH3T3 cells, suggest that PDK1 can phosphorylate certain substrates in the absence of PtdIns 3-kinase activation.PDK1 was shown to phosphorylate a catalytically inactive PAK1 in NIH3T3 cells when the cells were stimulated with PDGF, a stimulant previously shown to elevate intracellular sphingosine levels. Elevation of intracellular sphingosine by PDGF has been shown to modulate processes including Ca2+ mobilization (45Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28191-28198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), activation of phospholipase D (52Desai N.N. Zhang H. Olivera A. Mattie M.E. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23122-23128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin (53Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27610-27617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that the elevation of intracellular sphingosine by PDGF can result in the activation of both PDK1 and PAK1 in a PtdIns 3-kinase independent manner. Although it is possible that PDK1 activation by PDGF may occur through additional mechanisms, our experiments with sphingomyelinase indicate that elevation of intracellular sphingosine represent at least one mechanism by which PDK1 becomes activated.Until recently, PAK1 was viewed solely as an effector of Rho family GTPases. The demonstration that sphingosine also regulated PAK1 activity suggested that PAK1 might also act as a transducer of lipid signals. Both Cdc42-GTPγS and sphingosine disrupt the interaction between the AID and kinase domain of PAK1 (39Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, we observed that only sphingosine was effective for PDK1-induced phosphorylation of PAK1 (26King C.C. Zenke F.T. Dawson P.E. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Hemmings B.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18108-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We propose that sphingosine disrupts the interaction of the AID and kinase domain such that the PAK1 activation loop is exposed to PDK1. The Cdc42-GTPγS-induced disruption of the PAK1 AID/kinase domain interaction does not lead to phosphorylation by PDK1; one possibility is that sphingosine-activated PAK1 may be regulated and signal differently than GTPase-stimulated PAK1. Another is that other unidentified kinases and/or regulatory phosphorylations may be required for GTPase signaling. However, we have previously shown that Cdc42-GTPγS, but not Cdc42-GDP, can down-regulate basal PDK1 activity (26King C.C. Zenke F.T. Dawson P.E. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Hemmings B.A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18108-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is possible that activated GTPases may specifically inhibit PAK1 phosphorylation by PDK1. The interplay between PDK1 and Rho family GTPases is currently under investigation. PAK1,1 a member of the PAK/Ste20 family of protein kinases, contains two major functional domains, an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (1Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These kinases were discovered by their ability to selectively bind the Rho GTPase family members Cdc42 and Rac (2Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Like all low molecular weight GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac exist in an inactive, GDP-bound state and an active, GTP-bound state (3Aelst L.V. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). PAK1 specifically binds the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 or Rac (3Aelst L.V. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar), resulting in a conformational change that leads to autophosphorylation on several serine and/or threonine residues and an increase in activity toward substrates (4Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the ability of a membrane-targeted PAK1 to become activated in a Cdc42- or Rac-independent manner suggested that alternate mechanisms for PAK1 activation must exist (5Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Certain sphingolipids, such as sphingosine, but not ceramide or sphingosine 1-phosphate, were subsequently shown to activate PAK1, suggesting PAKs also transduce lipid signals (5Bokoch G.M.

In addition to the kinase domain, PAK1 also contains a p21 binding domain (PBD), which binds active Cdc42 and Rac, an autoinhibitory domain (AID), four proline-rich regions, and an acidic domain. The first proline-rich region interacts with the adapter protein Nck (6Bokoch G.M. Wang Y. Bohl B.P. Sells M.A. Quilliam L.A. Knaus U.G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2024410864,"We report that transfection of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) cDNA in human breast cancer cell lines expressing either mutant p53 (T47D) or wild-type p53 (MCF-7) induces apoptosis. IGFBP-3 also increases the ratio of pro-apoptotic to anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. In MCF-7, an increase in Bad and Bax protein expression and a decrease in Bcl-xL protein and Bcl-2 protein and mRNA were observed. In T47D, Bax and Bad proteins were up-regulated; Bcl-2 protein is undetectable in these cells. As T47D expresses mutant p53 protein, these modulations of pro-apoptotic proteins and induction of apoptosis are independent of p53. The effect of IGFBP-3 on the response of T47D to ionizing radiation (IR) was examined. These cells do not G1 arrest in response to IR and are relatively radioresistant. Transfection of IGFBP-3 increased the radiosensitivity of T47D and increased IR-induced apoptosis but did not effect a rapid G1 arrest. IR also caused a much greater increase in Bax protein in IGFBP-3 transfectants compared with vector controls. Thus, IGFBP-3 increases the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and apoptosis both basally and in response to IR, suggesting it may be a p53-independent effector of apoptosis in breast cancer cells via its modulation of the Bax:Bcl-2 protein ratio. We report that transfection of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) cDNA in human breast cancer cell lines expressing either mutant p53 (T47D) or wild-type p53 (MCF-7) induces apoptosis.

There is still some ambiguity in determining the role of IGFBP-3 in regulating IGF actions, with studies showing both enhancement and inhibition of IGF mitogenic effects (1De Mellow J.S. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 2Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Chen J.-C.

However, IGFBP-3 has also been shown to have IGFRI-independent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. IGFBP-3 is expressed in many tissues including breast epithelium (4Figueroa J.A. Yee D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1992; 22: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and we and others have demonstrated its growth inhibitory effects in human breast cancer cells (5Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Firth S.M. Fanayan S. Benn D. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as well as murine 3T3 fibroblasts (7Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 3: 23-26Google Scholar) and IGFRI-null fibroblasts (8Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).More recently, it has been suggested that the anti-proliferative effects of IGFBP-3 may be mediated via an induction of apoptosis. Indirect evidence has come from reports that an increase in IGFBP-3 expression is associated with the induction of apoptosis (9Nickerson T. Pollak M. Huynh H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Shen L. Glazer R.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Nickerson T. Huynh H. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 160: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that high levels of recombinant nonglycosylated IGFBP-3 can induce apoptosis in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, although under some conditions these levels of exogenous IGFBP-3 may induce apoptosis indirectly by sequestering anti-apoptotic IGFs from the IGFRI (12Nickerson T. Huynh H. Pollak M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, no induction of apoptosis was observed in either Hs578T breast carcinoma cells or colorectal carcinoma cells exposed to exogenous IGFBP-3 alone (0.1–0.5 μg/ml; see Refs. 13Gill Z.P.

Moorghen M. Holly J.M.P. Paraskeva C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 22-27PubMed Google Scholar), although in both studies IGFBP-3 augmented the cellular response to apoptotic stimuli. Studies by Rajah et al. (15Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) in prostate carcinoma cells and IGFRI-negative mouse fibroblasts showed an induction of apoptosis by both exogenous and endogenous IGFBP-3 and provide the strongest evidence of an IGFRI-independent pro-apoptotic role for IGFBP-3 in cancer cell growth.IGFBP-3 gene expression is induced by potent growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic agents including transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1; see Refs. 16Martin J.L. Ballesteros M. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1703-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and 17Oh Y. Muller H.L. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis factor-α (19Rozen F. Zhang J. Pollak M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 865-869PubMed Google Scholar) with evidence that these agents may mediate their cellular effects through IGFBP-3. Furthermore, IGFBP-3 is an established target of the tumor suppressor p53 (20Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The latter plays a critical role in effecting the cellular response to IR, mediating both a G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptotic cell death (21Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2757) Google Scholar), although which, if any, of these cellular functions involve IGFBP-3 is less clear. In addition, the intracellular mechanisms by which IGFBP-3 mediates its IGFRI-independent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects remain largely unknown. However, we have demonstrated that IGFBP-3 is translocated to the nucleus in breast carcinoma cells (22Schedlich L.J. Young T.Y. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18347-18352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that IGFBP-3 may mediate its cellular effects via direct or indirect interaction with growth inhibitory and/or apoptotic genes.The Bcl-2 family has been identified as an important regulator of mammalian cell death with both anti-apoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and pro-apoptotic (e.g. Bax and Bad) members (23Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). Members of this family regulate susceptibility to apoptosis, whereby overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in relation to Bax promotes survival, but overexpression of Bax accelerates cell death (24Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Bax overexpression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells enhances radiation-induced apoptosis (25Sakakura C. Sweeney E.A. Shirahama T. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S.-I. Nakatani H. Tsujimoto H. Imanishi T. Ohgaki M. Ohyama T. Yamazaki J. Hagiwara A. Yamaguchi T. Sawai K. Takahashi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting changes in the ratio of Bcl-2-related proteins may be an important determinant in the response of breast cancer cells to apoptotic stimuli.In this study, the effect of IGFBP-3 on the induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer cells expressing either mutant p53 (T47D) or wild-type p53 (MCF-7) protein was examined. We demonstrate that IGFBP-3 induces apoptosis and modulates expression of Bcl-2-related proteins in a p53-independent manner. We also determined the ability of IGFBP-3 to restore the sensitivity of mutant p53-expressing breast cancer cells to the apoptotic effects of IR. Expression of IGFBP-3 increased T47D sensitivity to IR-induced apoptosis, without altering the cell cycle response. IR also caused a much greater increase in Bax protein in IGFBP-3 transfectants compared with vector controls. These results suggest that IGFBP-3 may be an important effector of apoptosis in breast cancer cells whether initiated by p53 or by other inhibitory agents, via its modulation of Bcl-2-related proteins.DISCUSSIONThere is now accumulating evidence that IGFBP-3 has an important anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic role in the regulation of cancer cell growth (6Firth S.M. Fanayan S. Benn D. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, although it has been described as an IGF-independent pro-apoptotic agent, there are still conflicting data to support this role for IGFBP-3. This study examined the effects of increased endogenous expression of IGFBP-3 on the induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Stable transfection of T47D and MCF-7 with IGFBP-3 cDNA results in the secretion of similar levels of IGFBP-3 (∼20–25 ng/ml) to that observed in other breast cancer-derived cells lines (e.g. Hs578T) and a phenotypically normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A (36Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16407-16411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), emphasizing the relevance of this model in studying the effects of IGFBP-3 on breast cancer cell growth. Stable expression of IGFBP-3 resulted in a significant induction of apoptosis in both cell lines. This induction was observed under serum-free conditions, in cell lines that do not express detectable IGF-I (37Yee D. Paik S. Lebovic G.S. Marcus R.R. Favini R.E. Cullen K.J. Lippman M.E. Rosen N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 38Osborne C.K. Coronado E.B. Kitten L.J. Arteaga C.R. Fuqua S.A.W. Ramasharma K. Marshall M. Li C.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1701-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), suggesting the pro-apoptotic effect of IGFBP-3 in these cells may be independent of its IGF binding ability, although these results do not rule out the effects of IGF-II in this system. This effect was observed in cells expressing either mutant (T47D) or wild-type (MCF-7) p53 protein, so it is independent of functional p53. This supports the work by Rajahet al. (15Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) who demonstrated the pro-apoptotic function of IGFBP-3 in p53-negative prostate carcinoma cells as well as IGFRI-deficient mouse fibroblasts.The induction of apoptosis by IGFBP-3 was associated with changes in both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. The ratio of pro-apoptotic Bax-like proteins to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins is a crucial determinant of both cellular susceptibility to apoptosis (39Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5838) Google Scholar) and radiosensitivity of breast and other tumors (25Sakakura C. Sweeney E.A. Shirahama T. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S.-I. Nakatani H. Tsujimoto H. Imanishi T. Ohgaki M. Ohyama T. Yamazaki J. Hagiwara A. Yamaguchi T. Sawai K. Takahashi T. Int. J.

Oncol. 1998; 124: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Normal breast epithelium expresses both Bax and Bcl-2 (41Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Shabaik A. Miyashita T. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1323-1333PubMed Google Scholar), the levels of which may be regulated by estrogen and other factors. Studies of breast cancers have further demonstrated that, while Bcl-2 expression correlates negatively with p53 immunopositivity, Bax expression does not show any correlation (42Krajewski S. Thor A.D. Edgerton S.M. Moore D.H. Krajewska M. Reed J.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 199-208PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the regulation of Bax expression in breast cancers may also occur via p53-independent pathways. Our present results support such a hypothesis, by demonstrating the ability of IGFBP-3 to up-regulate Bax expression in breast cancer cells expressing either mutant or wild-type p53 protein. In addition, IGFBP-3 expression further modulated the ratio of these apoptotic proteins by up-regulating the pro-apoptotic protein, Bad, in both cell lines and down-regulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins in MCF-7 (T47D do not express detectable levels of Bcl-2 protein). There is evidence that anti-apoptotic signaling through the IGFRI is associated with changes in expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (43Singleton J.R. Dixit V.M. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31791-31794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 44Parrizas M. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1355-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, our results present evidence that IGFBP-3 has direct effects on Bcl-2-related proteins. In a wider context, the demonstration of these novel effects of IGFBP-3 on the expression of apoptotic proteins also suggests a possible pathway by which other pro-apoptotic agents (e.g. TGF-β1 and tumor necrosis factor α), which induce IGFBP-3 and in some cases up-regulate Bax (45Guo Y. Kyprianou N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1366-1371PubMed Google Scholar, 46Teramoto T. Kiss A. Thorgeirsson S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and Bad (47Kanatani Y. Kasukabe T. Okabe-Kado J. Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y. Nagata N. Motoyoshi K. Honma Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 705-712PubMed Google Scholar), may elicit their effects.Expression of IGFBP-3 in both T47D and MCF-7 up-regulated Bax protein expression without altering mRNA levels. This suggests that IGFBP-3 may regulate expression of Bax at a post-translational level, for example by stabilization of the protein. Although it remains to be determined by which mechanism IGFBP-3 is eliciting its effects on Bax protein expression, Miyashita et al. (48Miyashita T. Kitada S. Krajewshi S. Horne W.A. Delia D. Reed R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26049-26052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have reported post-translational regulation of Bax protein by Bcl-2 resulting in an increase in the half-life of Bax. Unlike bax mRNA which did not change, we observed a 4-fold decrease in bcl-2mRNA levels in IGFBP-3-transfected MCF-7 cells compared with vector controls, leading to the intriguing possibility that IGFBP-3 may exert its effects on Bcl-2 expression at a transcriptional level, analogous to the effects of p53 (33Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar).The presence of functional p53 protein is generally regarded as a critical component in determining cellular radiosensitivity in tumor cells (35Siles E.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5742-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Cells with mutant p53 such as T47D fail to arrest in G1 following exposure to IR and are relatively resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis (35Siles E. Villalobos M. Valenzuela M.T. Nunez M.I. Gordon A. McMillan T.J. Pedraza V. Ruiz de Almodovar J.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 73: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We observed increased radiosensitivity in IGFBP-3-expressing T47D cells compared with vector controls, demonstrating that IGFBP-3 can enhance radiosensitivity in the absence of functional p53 protein. Examination of cell cycle progression post-irradiation in T47D/BP-3 and T47D/VEC showed that expression of IGFBP-3 did not restore a G1 arrest following exposure to IR. There is much evidence of the growth inhibitory role of IGFBP-3 in breast cancer (6Firth S.M. Fanayan S. Benn D. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), including its up-regulation by various growth-inhibitory agents such as TGF-β1 (17Oh Y. Muller H.L. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13589-13592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously reported IGFBP-3 expression can result in a gradual accumulation of cells in G1 phase over time (6Firth S.M. Fanayan S. Benn D. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, our present data show that IGFBP-3, unlike the p53 target gene p21WAF1/CIP1 , does not effect a rapid G1 arrest in response to IR.Exposure of IGFBP-3 transfectants to IR did not affect the secretion, cell-surface attachment, or proteolysis of IGFBP-3 produced by these cells indicating that none of these mechanisms, which modulate the cellular response to IGFBP-3, is rate-limiting for the induction of apoptosis. Expression of IGFBP-3 in T47D significantly increased the rate of apoptosis when cells were exposed to the apoptotic stimulus of IR. Interestingly, Williams et al. (14Williams A.C. Collard T.J. Perks C.M. Newcomb P. Moorghen M. Holly J.M.P. Paraskeva C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 22-27PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown increased apoptosis following IR in colonic adenoma cells exposed to 100 ng/ml exogenous IGFBP-3. However, this effect was dependent upon the presence of wild-type p53 protein, as opposed to our present study where these actions occurred in the absence of functional p53 protein. This may reflect differences in the effects of exogenous (nonglycosylated) and endogenous (glycosylated) IGFBP-3 on the apoptotic pathway or different regulatory pathways in these two cell systems.The enhanced rate of apoptosis post-irradiation in IGFBP-3-expressing cells may be due to its modulation of the Bax:Bcl-2 protein ratio. There was a significant up-regulation of Bax protein in IGFBP-3-transfectants following irradiation compared with irradiated vector-transfected cells. This suggests that IGFBP-3 may potentiate radiation-induced apoptosis via a modulation of Bax protein levels. No changes in Bad or Bcl-xL proteins were observed in T47D/BP-3 post-irradiation, so these proteins may not be involved in mediating IGFBP-3 effects following IR.These results have led us to hypothesize that IGFBP-3 acts as an effector of apoptosis in breast cancer cells via a modulation of the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio. Thus, the activation of wild-type p53 protein following a DNA-damaging stimulus could induce apoptosis not only through its direct modulation of bax and bcl-2expression at a transcriptional level (33Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar, 34Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) but also via its induction of IGFBP-3 expression (20Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Induction of IGFBP-3 either by p53 or other anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic agents independently of p53, would result in an induction of apoptosis via alterations in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio. Once induced, IGFBP-3 may also increase apoptosis via its known sequestration of anti-apoptotic IGFs from the IGFRI (reviewed in Ref. 50Butt A.J. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).The role of IGFBP-3 as an effector of p53-independent apoptotic pathways has particular relevance in the treatment of breast cancer, where inactivating mutations in the p53 gene occur at high frequency (51Osborne R. Merlo G.R. Mitsudomi T. Venesio T. Liscia D.S. Cappa A.P.M. Chiba I. Takahashi T. Nau M.M. Callahan R. Minna J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6194-6198PubMed Google Scholar) leading to increased radio- and chemo-resistance of breast tumors. Thus, our present findings suggest that loss of expression, or reduced IGFBP-3 expression (or resistance to IGFBP-3), either directly or indirectly through inactivating mutations in p53, may be an important determinant in the acquisition of radio- and chemo-resistance in breast tumors. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3)1 is a member of a family of specific high affinity binding proteins that modify the mitogenic actions of IGFs by regulating their access to the IGF-I receptor (IGFRI). There is still some ambiguity in determining the role of IGFBP-3 in regulating IGF actions, with studies showing both enhancement and inhibition of IGF mitogenic effects (1De Mellow J.S. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 2Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Chen J.-C. Shao Z.-M. Sheikh M.S. Hussain A. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. Fontana J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 158: 69-78Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, IGFBP-3 has also been shown to have IGFRI-independent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. IGFBP-3 is expressed in many tissues including breast epithelium (4Figueroa J.A. Yee D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1992; 22: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and we and others have demonstrated its growth inhibitory effects in human breast cancer cells (5Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Firth S.M. Fanayan S. Benn D. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as well as murine 3T3 fibroblasts (7Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 3: 23-26Google Scholar) and IGFRI-null fibroblasts (8Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been suggested that the anti-proliferative effects of IGFBP-3 may be mediated via an induction of apoptosis. Indirect evidence has come from reports that an increase in IGFBP-3 expression is associated with the induction of apoptosis (9Nickerson T. Pollak M. Huynh H. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Shen L. Glazer R.I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Nickerson T. Huynh H. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 160: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There is some evidence that high levels of recombinant nonglycosylated IGFBP-3 can induce apoptosis in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, although under some conditions these levels of exogenous IGFBP-3 may induce apoptosis indirectly by sequestering anti-apoptotic IGFs from the IGFRI (12Nickerson T. Huynh H. Pollak M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, no induction of apoptosis was observed in either Hs578T breast carcinoma cells or colorectal carcinoma cells exposed to exogenous IGFBP-3 alone (0.1–0.5 μg/ml; see Refs. 13Gill Z.P.

Moorghen M. Holly J.M.P. Paraskeva C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 22-27PubMed Google Scholar), although in both studies IGFBP-3 augmented the cellular response to apoptotic stimuli. Studies by Rajah et al. (15Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) in prostate carcinoma cells and IGFRI-negative mouse fibroblasts showed an induction of apoptosis by both exogenous and endogenous IGFBP-3 and provide the strongest evidence of an IGFRI-independent pro-apoptotic role for IGFBP-3 in cancer cell growth. IGFBP-3 gene expression is induced by potent growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic agents including transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1; see Refs. 16Martin J.L. Ballesteros M. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1703-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar and 17Oh Y. Muller H.L. Ng L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis factor-α (19Rozen F. Zhang J. Pollak M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 865-869PubMed Google Scholar) with evidence that these agents may mediate their cellular effects through IGFBP-3. Furthermore, IGFBP-3 is an established target of the tumor suppressor p53 (20Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The latter plays a critical role in effecting the cellular response to IR, mediating both a G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptotic cell death (21Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2757) Google Scholar), although which, if any, of these cellular functions involve IGFBP-3 is less clear. In addition, the intracellular mechanisms by which IGFBP-3 mediates its IGFRI-independent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects remain largely unknown. However, we have demonstrated that IGFBP-3 is translocated to the nucleus in breast carcinoma cells (22Schedlich L.J. Young T.Y. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18347-18352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that IGFBP-3 may mediate its cellular effects via direct or indirect interaction with growth inhibitory and/or apoptotic genes. The Bcl-2 family has been identified as an important regulator of mammalian cell death with both anti-apoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and pro-apoptotic (e.g. Bax and Bad) members (23Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar). Members of this family regulate susceptibility to apoptosis, whereby overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL in relation to Bax promotes survival, but overexpression of Bax accelerates cell death (24Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Bax overexpression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells enhances radiation-induced apoptosis (25Sakakura C. Sweeney E.A. Shirahama T. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S.-I. Nakatani H. Tsujimoto H. Imanishi T. Ohgaki M. Ohyama T. Yamazaki J. Hagiwara A. Yamaguchi T. Sawai K. Takahashi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting changes in the ratio of Bcl-2-related proteins may be an important determinant in the response of breast cancer cells to apoptotic stimuli. In this study, the effect of IGFBP-3 on the induction of apoptosis in human breast cancer cells expressing either mutant p53 (T47D) or wild-type p53 (MCF-7) protein was examined. We demonstrate that IGFBP-3 induces apoptosis and modulates expression of Bcl-2-related proteins in a p53-independent manner. We also determined the ability of IGFBP-3 to restore the sensitivity of mutant p53-expressing breast cancer cells to the apoptotic effects of IR. Expression of IGFBP-3 increased T47D sensit"

The mass of Eros is (6.687 ± 0.003) × 10 18 grams, which, coupled with our volume estimate, implies a bulk density of 2.67 ± 0.03 grams per cubic centimeter. The asteroid appears to have a uniform density distribution. The right ascension and declination of the rotation pole are 11.37 ± 0.05 and 17.22 ± 0.05 degrees, respectively, and at least over the short term, the rotation state of Eros is stable with no measurable free precession of the spin pole. Escape velocities on the surface vary from 3.1 to 17.2 meters per second. The dynamical environment of Eros suggests that it is covered with regolith and that one might expect material transport toward the deepest potential wells in the saddle and 5.5-kilometer crater regions."
https://openalex.org/W2112234094,Measurements from the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)–Shoemaker Laser Rangefinder (NLR) indicate that asteroid 433 Eros is a consolidated body with a complex shape dominated by collisions. The offset between the asteroid's center of mass and center of figure indicates a small deviation from a homogeneous internal structure that is most simply explained by variations in mechanical structure. Regional-scale relief and slope distributions show evidence for control of topography by a competent substrate. Impact crater morphology is influenced by both gravity and structural control. Small-scale topography reveals ridges and grooves that may be generated by impact-related fracturing.

To search for potential neuronal β1AR-interacting proteins, we screened a rat brain cDNA library using the β1AR carboxyl terminus (β1AR-CT) as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. These screens identified PSD-95, a multiple PDZ domain-containing scaffolding protein, as a specific binding partner of the β1AR-CT. This interaction was confirmed by in vitro fusion protein pull-down and blot overlay experiments, which demonstrated that the β1AR-CT binds specifically to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95. Furthermore, the full-length β1AR associates with PSD-95 in cells, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunofluorescence co-localization studies. The interaction between β1AR and PSD-95 is mediated by the last few amino acids of the β1AR, and mutation of the β1AR carboxyl terminus eliminated the binding and disrupted the co-localization of the β1AR and PSD-95 in cells. Agonist-induced internalization of the β1AR in HEK-293 cells was markedly attenuated by PSD-95 co-expression, whereas co-expression of PSD-95 has no significant effect on either desensitization of the β1AR or β1AR-induced cAMP accumulation. Furthermore, PSD-95 facilitated the formation of a complex between the β1AR andN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. These data reveal that PSD-95 is a specific β1AR binding partner that modulates β1AR function and facilitates physical association of the β1AR with synaptic proteins, such as theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which are known to be regulated by β1AR stimulation.

The tissue distributions of the three receptors are distinct: β2AR is highly expressed in many tissues, β3AR is expressed at high levels only in adipose tissue, and β1AR is expressed at high levels in the heart and brain and lower levels elsewhere (1Lefkowitz R.J. Hoffman B.B. Taylor P. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 105-139Google Scholar). In the brain, β1AR exhibits a predominantly neuronal expression pattern, whereas β2AR is expressed mainly in glial cells (2Cash R. Raisman R. Lanfumey L. Ploska A. Agid Y.

Emotionally charged events often lead to the creation of vivid memories (8McGaugh J.L.

Electron microscopic examinations of brain slices reveal that β1-adrenergic receptors are concentrated in thepost-synaptic density (PSD) (29Strader C.D. Pickel V.M. Joh T.H. Strohsacker M.W.

The β2-adrenergic receptor is known to associate via its carboxyl terminus with a family of PDZ domain-containing proteins, the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factors (NHERF) (36Hall R.A. Premont R.T.

Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). NHERF binds to a DSLL motif at the carboxyl terminus of β2AR (36Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A.

The β1AR does not contain this motif, but rather terminates in an ESKV motif that might plausibly mediate binding to PDZ domain-containing proteins other than NHERF. Thus, we used the β1AR carboxyl terminus as bait in yeast two-hybrid screens of a rat brain library to identify potential β1AR-interacting proteins that might play a role in β1AR localization and regulation. Mammalian expression plasmids pcDNA3/Flag-β1AR and pcDNA3/Flag-β2AR were described before (39Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

GST-β1AR-loop 3 (corresponding to amino acids 247–321 of the human β1AR) and GST-β2AR-loop 3 (corresponding to amino acids 222–272 of the human β2AR) constructs were described previously (40Tang Y. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Ringstad N. Hall R.A. Pitcher J.A. DeCamilli P. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12559-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Point mutations of both β1AR-CT and full-length Flag-β1AR constructs (V477A, S475D, S475A, and S473A) were introduced by PCR and verified by sequencing. PSD-95 PDZ1+2 (corresponding to amino acids 59–303 of rat PSD-95) and PSD-95 PDZ3 (corresponding to amino acids 307–446 of rat PSD-95) were amplified by PCR and inserted into pET-30A (Novagen) at the EcoRI andXhoI restriction sites for expression as hexahistidine- and S-tagged fusion proteins. Plasmids GW1/myc-PSD-95, GW1/NR1, and GW1/NMDA2B were generous gifts from Morgan Sheng (Harvard Medical School). NR2A-CT-GST fusion protein (the final 200 amino acids of rat NR2A fused to GST) was a generous gift from Fang Zheng (Emory University School of Medicine). Polyclonal (A-14) and monoclonal (9E10) anti-myc antibodies and the monoclonal anti-GST antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin 12CA5 antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Rabbit anti-NMDA2B was a gift from Morgan Sheng. Anti-Flag M2 antibody, anti-mouse IgG FITC conjugate, and Anti-Flag M2 affinity gel were from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG Texas Red conjugates were from Calbiochem. The β1AR-CT (amino acids 381–end) was amplified by PCR and cloned into theEcoRI and PstI restriction sites of the yeast two-hybrid vector pAS2-1. This construct (pAS2-1/β1AR-CT) was used as bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). Plasmid pAS2-1/β1AR-CT and the rat brain library cDNAs (in the vector pGAD-10) were co-transformed into yeast strain PJ69-4A using a standard yeast transformation protocol. Yeast were plated on selective medium (SD-Leu/Trp/His, +2 mm 3-aminotriazole) and allowed to grow for 4–6 days at 30 °C. Positive colonies were then re-streaked on selective medium (SD-Leu/Trp/Ade or SD-Leu/Trp/His) plates. Plasmids were rescued from positive colonies that exhibited positive growth on both-His and-Ade plates and were then transformed into bacterial DH5α cells. Purified bacterial DNA was screened by restriction digestion. Plasmids with unique restriction digest patterns were subjected to further automatic sequence analysis. Sequence information was analyzed online using the BLAST search program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. To further confirm positive interactions, isolated library cDNAs were co-transformed back into yeast together with a bait plasmid, either pAS2-1/β1AR-CT, empty vector pAS2-1, or other test plasmids as indicated in the figures. Yeast were then subjected to growth tests on selective plates. All tissue culture medium and related reagents were purchased from Life Technologies. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 incubator. Cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 20 μl of LipofectAMINE (at 4:1 ratio to DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK-293 cells were maintained in the same condition as that of COS-7 cells except minimal essential medium was used. HEK-293 cells were transfected with a modified calcium phosphate method. After transfection, cells were grown 36–48 h before harvesting. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. The clarified supernatants were then used in all the following in vitro GST pull-down or cellular co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 50 μl of each supernatant was diluted into an equal amount of 3× sample buffer and served as whole cell extract. GST fusion proteins were purified from bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins (conjugated on beads) were incubated with 1 ml of clarified whole cell extracts from COS-7 cells over-expressing myc-PSD-95. After incubation at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 4 h, beads were extensively washed with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted from beads with 3× SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. PSD-95 was detected via Western blotting with a rabbit anti-myc antibody (1:1000) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:2000). Bands were visualized via chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK-293 cells or COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with appropriate plasmid combinations as indicated in the figure legends. 1 ml of clarified cell extract was incubated with 25 μl of anti-Flag M2 affinity gel slurry at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 4 h. Beads were washed four to five times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. The binding of receptor carboxyl terminus GST fusion proteins to hexahistidine-tagged PDZ domain fusion proteins was assayed via a far-Western blot overlay technique. The His6-tagged PDZ domains (2 μg per lane) were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels, blotted, and overlaid with the receptor CT-GST fusion proteins (50 nm final concentration) in 2% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (“blot buffer”) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with blot buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a monoclonal anti-GST antibody. The blots were then washed again three times with blot buffer and incubated with an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody in blot buffer. Following three final washes with blot buffer, the binding of the GST fusion proteins was visualized via chemiluminescence as described above. For receptor internalization assays, HEK-293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/Flag-β1AR or pcDNA3/Flag-β2AR in the absence and presence of GW1/myc-PSD-95. One day after transfection, cells were split into poly-lysine-coated 6-well plates (Biocoat) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were serum-starved for 1 h before stimulation with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were placed on ice, and Flag-tagged receptors were detected with anti-Flag M2 antibody followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as described previously (40Tang Y. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Ringstad N. Hall R.A. Pitcher J.A. DeCamilli P. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12559-12564Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Receptor internalization was defined as the percentage of agonist-stimulated loss of surface receptors, as measured by cell flow cytometry. For whole cell cAMP accumulation assays, HEK-293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with pcDNA3/Flag-β1AR in the absence and presence of GW1/myc-PSD-95. One day after transfection, cells were split into 12-well poly-lysine-coated plates and then labeled with modified essential medium supplement with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine for 4 h to overnight at 37 °C incubator. Cells were serum-starved for 30 min and then stimulated with various concentrations of dobutamine or 10 μm forskolin for 10 min. The cAMP accumulation was quantitated by chromatography and expressed as the percentage incorporation of 3H into cAMP as described previously (40Tang Y. Hu L.A. Miller W.E. Ringstad N. Hall R.A.

For the receptor desensitization experiments, cells were stimulated with (desensitized cells) or without (control cells) 1 μmisoproterenol for 20 min. The membrane preparations and membrane adenylyl cyclase activity assays were performed according to the method of Freedman et al. (39Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17935-17961Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were transfected with pcDNA 3/Flag-β1AR (or V477A mutant) and/or GW1/myc-PSD-95 and were split into 30-mm dishes with glass bottoms (MatTek) designed for microscopy. Cells were washed with minimal essential medium and then incubated with anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (1:500) for 1 h at 37 °C. After two brief washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 1 h at 37 °C. After two washes with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-myc (A-14) (1:250) followed by a Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:200). FITC-labeled receptor and Texas Red-labeled PSD-95 were visualized with a Zeiss LSM-410 laser confocal microscope. To search for potential binding partners of the β1-adrenergic receptor, we used the β1AR carboxyl terminus (β1AR-CT) as bait in yeast two-hybrid screens of a rat brain cDNA library. From a total of 11 million independent colonies screened, eight positives were obtained and subjected to further sequence analysis. Two of these positives yielded sequences encoding rat PSD-95, a multiple PDZ domain-containing protein. Both sequences contained partial PSD-95 sequence (Fig. 1 A). One clone (#1) was found to encode a nearly full-length version of PSD-95 plus a long 5′-untranslated region, whereas another clone (#2) represents a truncated or alternate splicing isoform of PSD-95. The specificity of the interaction between PSD-95 and the β1AR-CT was confirmed by further work with the yeast two-hybrid system. PSD-95 clones were transformed back into yeast strain PJ69-4A together with the bait plasmids pAS2-1, pAS2-1/β1AR-CT, or pAS2-1/β2AR-CT. Transformed yeast containing both bait and PSD-95 clones were then subjected to growth tests on selective medium. As shown in Fig. 1 B, only yeast containing both PSD-95 and β1AR-CT were able to grow on both −His and −Ade plates. Moreover, this interaction between β1AR-CT and PSD-95 is specific, because neither empty vector pAS2-1 nor pAS2-1/β2AR-CT could support yeast growth under the same conditions when co-transformed with PSD-95. Fusion protein pull-down experiments were employed to study the interaction between β1AR-CT and PSD-95. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins, including GST alone as well as GST fused to β1AR-CT, β2AR-CT, β1AR-loop 3, and β2AR-loop 3, were absorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and then incubated with cell extracts from COS-7 cells that had been transfected with myc-PSD-95. PSD-95 bound to beads was detected by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, only GST-β1AR-CT pulled down PSD-95 from the cell lysates, whereas neither GST alone nor other GST fusion proteins (GST-β2AR-CT, GST-β1AR-loop 3, and GST-β2AR-loop 3) were able to pull down PSD-95 from the cell lysates under the same conditions. To determine whether the full-length β1AR associates with PSD-95 in a cellular context, we expressed both Flag-β1AR and myc-PSD-95 in HEK-293 cells. Immunoprecipitation of β1AR followed by Western blotting for PSD-95 revealed robust co-immunoprecipitation of a PSD-95·β1AR complex (Fig. 2 B). Treatment of the cells with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol had no significant effect on this association. Consistent with the fusion protein pull-down results, PSD-95 did not detectably co-immunoprecipitate with full-length Flag-β2AR when the two proteins were expressed together in HEK-293 cells. Thus, the yeast two-hybrid studies, the in vitro fusion protein pull-down experiments, and the cellular co-immunoprecipitation experiments all demonstrated that β1AR interacts specifically with PSD-95. PSD-95 contains three PDZ domains, protein-protein interaction modules known to bind to specific motifs at the carboxyl termini of target proteins (31Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1995; 269: 1737-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 35Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of β1AR contains an ESKV-carboxyl motif, which is a likely site of interaction with PSD-95 via a PDZ domain-mediated interaction. To examine the structural determinants of the β1AR·PSD-95 interaction, we individually mutated the last five residues of β1AR-CT to alanine and expressed these mutants as GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 A, mutation of Val at position 0, Ser at the −2 position, or Glu at the −3 position resulted in complete elimination of β1AR-CT binding to PSD-95. In contrast, mutation to Ala at positions −1 or −4 had little effect on the β1AR-CT·PSD-95 interaction. These results reveal that three of the last four residues of β1AR-CT are the critical determinants for association with PSD-95. Based on the findings with the mutant β1AR-CT fusion proteins, we next constructed several mutant versions of the full-length β1AR to examine the structural determinants of the β1AR·PSD-95 interaction in cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, PSD-95 co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type Flag-β1AR when the two proteins were co-expressed in COS-7 cells, consistent with our earlier results. However, when these studies were repeated with a mutant version of β1AR, which has the last residue changed to Ala (V477A), no co-immunoprecipitation of PSD-95 was observed. Similarly, no PSD-95 co-immunoprecipitation could be detected when the key serine residue at −2 of β1AR was mutated to either Ala (S475A) or Asp (S475D). In contrast, PSD-95 co-immunoprecipitation with a mutant β1AR bearing a change of the Ser at −4 to Ala (S473A) was reduced only slightly relative to the level of PSD-95 co-immunoprecipitation observed with the wild-type β1AR. These data further support the conclusion that several of the last few residues of β1AR are critical determinants for the interaction with PSD-95. To determine the region of PSD-95 responsible for binding to β1AR-CT, we prepared His6-tagged fusion proteins corresponding to the first two PDZ domains (PDZ1+2) and the third PDZ domain (PDZ3) of PSD-95. These fusion proteins were examined in blot overlay studies, along with His6-tagged fusion proteins corresponding to the PDZ1 and PDZ2 regions of NHERF, for their ability to bind either β1AR-CT, β2AR-CT, or the carboxyl terminus of the NMDA receptor NR2A subunit (NR2A-CT). As shown in Fig. 4, β1AR bound specifically to PSD-95 PDZ3 but did not detectably bind to the other PDZ domains. In contrast, β2AR-CT did not bind at all to the PSD-95 PDZ domains, but instead bound avidly to NHERF PDZ1, consistent with previous findings (36Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.W. Blitzer J.T.

N-Glycan formation begins with the transfer of a preformed oligosaccharide precursor, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, to the nascent polypeptide chain. α-Glucosidases and α-mannosidases in the ER trim this oligosaccharide precursor to primarily Man8GlcNAc2, while subsequent transport of the glycoprotein into the Golgi apparatus allows further trimming of the remaining α1,2-linked mannose residues. The resulting Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide is the substrate for GlcNAc-transferase I, the first enzyme in a cascade that ultimately results in the formation of complex and hybrid oligosaccharide structures (6Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4987) Google Scholar). ER class I α1,2-mannosidase also plays a key role in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins (7Su K. Stoller T. Rocco J.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The structure of the catalytic domain of the ER α1,2-mannosidase fromS. cerevisiae has recently been determined by x-ray crystallography (29Vallée F. Lipari F. Yip P. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The protein is an (αα)7-helix barrel with one side of the barrel plugged by a β-hairpin. The nine highly conserved acidic residues and the calcium ion, all of which are essential for catalytic activity (30Lipari F. Herscovics A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), are located at the top of this β-hairpin in the center of the barrel, at the bottom of a 15-Å deep cavity. In the structure, an N-glycan from one molecule interacts with a symmetry-related molecule in what is believed to be an enzyme-product complex. This interaction helped to identify the active site and residues involved in oligosaccharide binding. Examination of the protein-carbohydrate interaction revealed an arginine residue (Arg273 in yeast α1,2-mannosidase) that interacts with three mannose residues and one N-acetylglucosamine residue of the N-glycan. This interaction has been shown to be responsible, in part, for the specificity of yeast ER class I α1,2-mannosidase (31Romero P.A. Vallée F. Howell P.L. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11071-11074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidases that trim Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 , this arginine residue is typically a leucine. Replacement of Arg273 with leucine in yeast ER class I α1,2-mannosidase results in an enzyme that is capable of cleaving all four α1,2-linked mannose residues rather than just the single terminal residue of the middle arm of Man9GlcNAc2. Although the observed protein-carbohydrate interactions in yeast ER class I α1,2-mannosidase have provided a wealth of information regarding substrate specificity, the N-glycan lacks the middle-arm terminal mannose residue that would be specifically cleaved during the enzymatic reaction. This prevented unambiguous identification of the residues involved in catalysis and provided no evidence for the role of the calcium ion. We present here the first structures of a class I α1,2-mannosidase in complex with the potent inhibitors kifunensine (KIF) (32Elbein A.D. Tropea J.E. Mitchell M. Kaushal G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15599-15605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMNJ) (33Bischoff J. Kornfeld R. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The structural results provide clear evidence for the role of calcium in substrate stabilization and suggest that this class of inverting enzymes has a novel catalytic mechanism. This work also provides insight into the specificity of these enzymes for α1,2-linked mannose residues and the inhibitors kifunensine and 1-deoxymannojirimycin. The importance of ER class I α1,2-mannosidases in ER-associated degradation of misfolded glycoproteins has been demonstrated in both yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast, it has been shown that a misfolded mutant of carboxypeptidase Y is rapidly degraded in wild-type cells, whereas it is stabilized in the mns1 mutant lacking the ER processing α1,2-mannosidase (8Knop M. Hauser N. Wolf D.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, treatment with the α1,2-mannosidase inhibitors 1-deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine has been shown to block the degradation of the T cell receptor subunit CD3-δ (34Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), tyrosinase (35Wang Y. Androlewicz M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), α2-plasmin inhibitor (36Chung D.H. Ohashi K. Watanabe M. Miyasaka N. Hirosawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4981-4987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and a misfolded variant form of α1-antitrypsin (10Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the case of α1-antitrypsin, increased secretion of α1-antitrypsin was also observed (37Marcus N.Y. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1987-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since the aggregation of misfolded α1-antitrypsin in the ER leads to emphysema, understanding the structural basis of inhibition of class I α1,2-mannosidase is therefore the first step toward the structure-based design of novel therapeutic agents for this and other genetic diseases characterized by rapid degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. The cloning and characterization of the soluble catalytic domain of human ER class I α1,2-mannosidase as a protein A fusion (pPROTA-ERManI) were described previously (13Gonzalez D.S. Karaveg K.

The portion of the cDNA encoding the catalytic domain (amino acids 172–689) was excised from the pPROTA expression vector by digestion with EcoRI and ligated into theEcoRI site of the Pichia expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). The final construct in the expression vector (10 μg) was linearized by digestion withHindIII and transformed into Pichia pastoris host strain X-33 by the lithium chloride transformation method as described in the Pichia expression manual (Invitrogen). Transformants were selected on yeast extract, peptone, dextrose (YPD)/Zeocin (100 μg/ml) plates and screened for expression of the recombinant human ER α1,2-mannosidase enzyme activity as described below following methanol induction in small-scale liquid cultures (24Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Liao Y.F. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol.

The Pichia transformant expressing the highest level of the soluble enzyme activity was used to produce the recombinant enzyme in large shaker flask and fermentor cultures. After optimizing the expression and purification of human ER α1,2-mannosidase from 1-liter shaker flask cultures, enzyme expression was scaled-up by growth of the culture in a 100-liter fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) at the Fermentation Research Facility of the University of Georgia. The fermentor, containing 100 liters of BMGY medium (400 μg of biotin, 0.5% methanol, 1% glycerol, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7), and 1.34% yeast nitrogen base), was inoculated with a 5-liter overnight culture of the human ER α1,2-mannosidase Pichia transformant in BMGY medium. The culture was maintained at 30 °C with agitation at 180 rpm and an air flow of 100 liters/min for 48 h until the glycerol in the culture was consumed. Human ER α1,2-mannosidase enzyme expression was then induced by the daily addition of methanol (50% (v/v) stock solution) to a final concentration of 0.5%. After 5 days of induction, the medium was harvested using a Sharples Model AS-16P continuous centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 5 h, followed by filtration using a 0.45-μm filter. Attempts to concentrate the culture medium by ultrafiltration resulted in >50% loss of enzyme activity and the appearance of human ER α1,2-mannosidase as a precipitate on the ultrafiltration filter. As a result, the clarified culture medium was not concentrated, but was applied directly in 20-liter batches to an SP-Sepharose column (5 × 13 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 16 ml/min. The column was washed with 500 ml of column buffer containing 10 mm sodium succinate (pH 6.0) and 1 mm CaCl2 and eluted with a one-liter linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in the same column buffer at a flow rate of 6 ml/min. The protein eluted as a sharp peak at ∼400 mm NaCl. The fractions containing enzyme were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The solubility of the concentrated protein was maintained by the addition of NDSB201 (Calbiochem) (42Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 43Blisnick T. Morales-Betoulle M.E. Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Braun Breton C. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to 1.0 m. After concentration, an EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was added to prevent protease degradation. The concentrated enzyme preparation, in 5–7-ml batches, was further purified by loading onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (1.6 × 65 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm MES (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.25m NDSB201. Fractions containing human ER α1,2-mannosidase were pooled and concentrated to 1.8 mg/ml using a YM-10 membrane. The concentrated enzyme was stored at 4 °C prior to use in crystallization trials. An aliquot of the purified enzyme (50 μg) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane to determine the N-terminal sequence as described previously (24Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The protein (157 mg) was purified with a 16.7% yield from 100 liters of fermentor medium. During purification, the recombinant protein was found to rapidly precipitate when stored at 4 °C, even at low protein concentrations (<0.1 mg/ml). A series of solubility tests were therefore performed to investigate the effect of salts, detergents, glycerol, and NDSBs (43Blisnick T. Morales-Betoulle M.E. Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Braun Breton C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 44Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Leberman R. Berthet-Colominas C. Cusack S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) on the solubility of the enzyme (data not shown). To test conditions for maintaining soluble enzyme during the crystallization trials, the purified enzyme (0.14 mg/ml) was concentrated in the presence of either 0.75 or 0.25m NDSB256, NDSB201, or NDSB195 (Calbiochem) (43Blisnick T. Morales-Betoulle M.E. Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Braun Breton C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 44Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Leberman R. Berthet-Colominas C. Cusack S.

The concentrated samples were stored at 4 °C for 5 days. Aliquots were removed daily; and after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min, the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined as described below. Glycerol and nonionic detergents were found to have a minimal effect on the solubility of the enzyme, with only 20–30% of the protein remaining soluble after concentration and 10–20% remaining soluble after 5 days. In contrast, samples containing the NDSB compounds resulted in ∼65–81% of the enzyme remaining soluble after concentration and 25–40% remaining soluble after 5 days (data not shown). The most effective solubilizing agent was NDSB201. In NDSB201, 81% of the protein remained soluble after concentration, and 30% remained soluble after 5 days at 4 °C. As a result of the solubility studies, the pooled enzyme preparation after the SP-Sepharose step was concentrated in the presence of 1.0 m NDSB201 prior to its application to the Superdex 75 column (as described above), and the gel filtration column was run with a buffer containing 0.25 mNDSB201. Human ER α1,2-mannosidase enzyme activity was determined by the addition of the enzyme sample to a final reaction volume of 40 μl containing 20 mm MES (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 and pyridylamine-tagged (PA) Man9GlcNAc2 as an oligosaccharide substrate. The assays were incubated for 10–20 min at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by heating to 100 °C for 5 min. The human ER α1,2-mannosidase product, Man8GlcNAc2-PA, was resolved from Man9GlcNAc2-PA on a Hypersil APS-2 NH2 high-pressure liquid chromatography column (13Gonzalez D.S. Karaveg K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28348-28358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that generates 1 μmol of Man8GlcNAc2 from Man9GlcNAc2 in 1 min at 37 °C and pH 7.0. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Crystals of human ER α1,2-mannosidase were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method from equal volumes of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 20 mm MES (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 0.25 m NDSB201) and precipitating solution (1.6–1.7 m(NH4)2SO4) suspended over a 1-ml reservoir containing the same precipitating solution. Rod-shaped crystals grew within ∼5 days to a maximum size of 0.4 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm. The crystals are trigonal and belong to space group P3121 with unit dimensions of a =b = 95.8 Å, c = 136.8 Å, and γ = 120°. One molecule is present in the asymmetric unit. The complexes of human ER α1,2-mannosidase with 1-deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine were prepared by co-crystallization. The conditions described above for the uncomplexed protein were used with the inhibitor added to the precipitating solution. The concentration of inhibitor (0.5–25 mm) was screened to determine which concentration of inhibitor produced the best crystals. X-ray diffraction data were collected on crystals containing 0.5 mm kifunensine or 6.5 mm 1-deoxymannojirimycin. The protein-inhibitor crystals have the same space group and unit cell dimensions as the native uncomplexed crystals (see Table I). An initial set of data for the uncomplexed protein was collected from a single crystal at room temperature using CuKα X-radiation (Rigaku Rotaflex RU200 rotating anode generator) on a Mar Research image plate detector (345-mm diameter). The crystal diffracted to a minimum d-spacing of 2.8 Å. High-resolution data for the native and inhibitor complexed crystals were collected at Beamline X8-C at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) using a Quantum4 CCD detector and flash-frozen crystals. The crystals were cryoprotected prior to flash-freezing by soaking them in a 20% (v/v) glycerol/artificial mother liquor solution for ∼3 min. All data were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (46Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar).

Transmembrane redox sensing may represent a fundamental mechanism by which ER/SR Ca2+channels respond to localized changes in transmembrane glutathione redox potential produced by physiologic and pathophysiologic modulators of Ca2+ release from stores. endoplasmic reticulum sarcoplasmic reticulum bilayer lipid membrane 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin glutathione glutathione disulfide inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate IP3 receptor o-phthaldialdehyde redox potential ryanodine receptor 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid A change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration serves as a signal for modulating a wide range of cellular activities (1Berridge M.J.

A major mechanism for increasing cytosolic Ca2+ includes release of Ca2+ from internal stores (endoplasmic or sarcoplasmic reticulum, ER or SR)1 via a genetic superfamily of Ca2+ release channels including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) (4Nakai J.

A prominent functional property of all of these channels is exquisite sensitivity to reduction and oxidation by sulfhydryl reagents (7Missiaen L. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J.

The functional consequences of sulfhydryl modification of RyRs include phases of activation and inhibition, revealing that multiple classes of sulfhydryl groups residing on Cys residues of all three isoforms of RyR channel complexes are important for native functioning and subject to chemical modification (11Pessah I.N. Feng W. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Dulhunty A. Haarmann C. Green D. Hart J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2 (,): 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, defining a role for sulfhydryl redox chemistry in RyR function has been controversial since the initial suggestion that sulfhydryl oxidation is a key step in channel activation (13Abramson J.J. Salama G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A plausible physiological role for redox control of ER/SR Ca2+ release channels and its attendant mechanism has remained elusive. It is known that glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) constitute the major redox buffer system of skeletal muscle and many non-muscle cells (14Sen C. Biochem. Parmacol. 1998; 55: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). In the typical mammalian cell, the ratio of [GSH]/[GSSG] in the cytosol is ≥30:1, thereby maintaining very reduced redox potential (RP) of approximately −220 mV (16Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). By contrast, the RP of the ER lumen is significantly more oxidized (approximately −180 mV) and is maintained with a 3:1 to 1:1 ratio of [GSH]/[GSSG] (16Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, the typical microsomal membrane within which the RyR and IP3R reside is normally subject to a large transmembrane RP difference of 40–50 mV with the lumen much more oxidized than the cytosol (16Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J.

To study redox regulation of RyR channel activity, the bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) preparation affords precise control of the redox state on both the cytoplasmic (cis) and luminal (trans) faces of the reconstituted channel by adjustment of the [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio to form varied redox potentials. In the present work, we provide direct evidence that RyR1 channel activity follows transmembrane redox potential. Chemical labeling studies with CPM indicate previously identified hyperreactive sulfhydryl moieties within the RyR1 complex (18Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) constitute an essential component of a unique transmembrane redox sensor. Sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane vesicles were prepared from back and hind limb skeletal muscles of New Zealand White rabbits according to the method of Saitoet al. (20Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) with some modifications. During the SR preparation, GSH and GSSG were included in the homogenization buffer, and the glutathione RP was made to −220 mV, which mimics the typical cytoplasmic RP in vivo. The preparations were stored in 10% sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, at −80 °C until needed. GSH was dissolved in degassed Hepes (20 mm) buffer, and the solution was adjusted to pH 7.0. Aliquots (∼0.2 ml) were transferred to vials and sealed after blowing with argon. The vials were stored at −20 °C for no longer than 60 days. Once thawed and opened for use, the vial was discarded. GSSG solution was also made and stored in a similar manner except without degassing and argon protection. Samples of GSH and GSSG were taken from both sides of the BLM chamber at the end of channel recordings to verify that the initial redox potential did not change during the course of the experiments. Redox buffers were found to be stable for at least 1 h. Osmotically induced changes in microsomal vesicle size and shape (21Meissner G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were monitored at 400 nm at a right angle to the incoming light beam, using a fluorimeter (F-2000, Hitachi). A decrease in light scattering reflected vesicular swelling, a consequence of osmotic changes as GSH and GSSG transported into the vesicle lumen. Briefly, SR vesicles (25 μg/ml) were equilibrated in a hypotonic medium (5 mm K-PIPES, pH 7.0). The osmotically induced changes in light scattering were measured after the addition of a small volume (<10% of the total incubation volume) of concentrated and stock solutions of the compounds to be tested. No changes in light scattering were observed when an identical assay solution was diluted with the same volume of stock buffer lacking GSH or GSSH. Sucrose was used to test the selectivity of GSH- and GSSG-induced changes in light scattering because it was shown to be weakly permeable to SR membranes (21Meissner G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Flufenamic acid, a known anion transport inhibitor (17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), was used to test the specificity of GSH or GSSG permeation of junctional SR. SR vesicles (100 μg) were incubated in 1 ml of solution A (100 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, 100 μmCaCl2), and an indicated combination of [GSH] and [GSSG] at 37 °C for 15 min. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. Each supernatant was carefully decanted from its respective pellet, and the latter was rinsed three times with 1 ml of solution A. The pellets were resuspended and homogenized in 100 μl of buffer containing 1n potassium Pi buffer, 0.5% CHAPS (w/v), and alamethicin (22Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (0.1 mg/mg protein) and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to permit the release of all vesicular glutathione. Following incubation, 100 μl of 5% tricholoracetic acid in redox quenching buffer (20 mm HCl, 5 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 10 mm ascorbic acid) was added into the solubilization mixture and the extract centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatant was collected, applied to a Microcon YM-3 (3000 molecular weight cut-off, Millipore) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 h. The filtrate (∼200 μl), which represented the total SR luminal glutathione (GSH + GSSG), was analyzed for [GSH]/[GSSG] as described below. The GSH and GSSG content of each luminal extract was determined in a manner similar to the method of Senft et al. (23Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), using the fluorescence probe o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) with a few modifications. To measure total glutathione (GSH + GSSG), 25 μl of each extract was added into 65 μl of 1 n potassium Pi buffer containing 100 μm dithionite to fully reduce GSSG. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by addition of 80 μl of 0.1 npotassium Pi. To quantify the total GSH product produced from the reduction reaction, 20 μl of OPA (5 mg/ml) was introduced into the mixture and permitted to incubate at room temperature for 90 min. OPA fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model F-2000, Hitachi) at excitation 365 nm/emission 430 nm. The portion of total glutathione attributable to GSH was analyzed in the manner described for total glutathione without the use of dithionite. To determine the original background content of luminal SR GSH and GSSG before the addition of exogenous glutathione, 100 μg of SR was incubated with alamethicin (0.1 mg/mg SR protein) to release the glutathione to the solution bathing the SR vesicles. These values were used as background correction for determining the net exogenous GSH and GSSG transported into SR vesicles. Reconstitution of RyR1 and recording of channel activity were performed as previously reported (24Feng W. Liu G. Xia R. Abramson J.J. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 821-831PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. RyR1 channels were reconstituted into planar lipid bilayer (5:2 phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylcholine, Northern Lipids Inc., 50 mg/ml in decane) by introducing SR vesicles to the cis chamber. The cis chamber contained 0.7 ml of 250 or 500 mm CsCl, 50–200 μmCaCl2,and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, whereas thetrans side (virtually grounded) contained 50 or 100 mm CsCl, 50–100 μm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Upon the fusion of SR vesicle into bilayer, cis chamber was perfused, and thecis/trans CsCl gradient were reversed. Single-channel activity was measured using a patch clamp amplifier (Dagan 3900) at a holding potential as indicted in each figure. The data were filtered at 1 kHz before being acquired at 10 kHz by a DigiData 1200 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The data were analyzed using pClamp 6 (Axon) and CDA 1.0 (provided by Dr. G. Liu) without additional filtering. The length of representative current traces was ≥1 s. Average P o was calculated from ≥1 min recording. Junctional SR membranes from rabbit skeletal muscle prepared in the presence of a [GSH]/[GSSG] redox buffer with a potential of −220 mV (calculated from the Nernst relationship (16Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar)) resulted in a high percentage (43%) of reconstituted channels (n = 102) exhibiting a characteristic low open probability (P o) gating mode (Fig.1 A). The remaining channels (57%) exhibited a high P o gating mode. This observation was consistent with those of previous reports (25Marengo J.J. Hidalgo C. Bull R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1263-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Murayama T. Oba T. Katayama E. Oyamada H. Oguchi K. Kobayashi M. Otsuka K. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17297-17308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Oba T. Murayama T. Ogawa Y. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 724Google Scholar). Although the molecular details underlying low P o and high P o gating modes has remained unclear, the oxidation of one or more classes of sulfhydryl moieties was implicated in stabilizing these experimentally observed gating modes. LowP o and high P o gating modes represent stable RyR1 channel gating behaviors that have been observed in BLM experiments. These gating modes appeared to depend on the overall redox state of the receptor complex because lowP o behavior was promoted by treatment with reducing agents, whereas high P o behavior was promoted by oxidizing agents. A characteristic of these gating behaviors was that once they were achieved, the channels did not require the continued presence of reducing or oxidizing equivalents to maintain their gating modes. This observation strongly suggested that lowP o and high P o gating behavior may result from the breaking or forming intra- of inter-subunit disulfide bonds (25Marengo J.J. Hidalgo C. Bull R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1263-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was further supported by the observation that gating behaviors can be interconverted by the subsequent addition of reducing or oxidizing reagent. Although channels exhibiting low and high P o gating modes were found to be tightly responsive to transmembrane RP, the present study focuses primarily on channels exhibiting the low P o gating mode. To test the response of the RyR1 channel to cytosolic oxidation, the channel was challenged with a highly oxidized RP of −180 mV generated by adding [GSH]/[GSSG] at a ratio of 3:1 (total [glutathione] = 4 mm) to the cis chamber of the BLM (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, the channel showed a negligible change in gating activity (P o = 0.011). However, immediately after the addition of 3:1 [GSH]/[GSSG] to generate the same redox potential of −180 mV on the luminal (trans) side of the channel, channel P oincreased 13-fold. (mean P o rose from 0.011 to 0.138 based on 2–4 continuous minutes of record before and after setting thetrans redox potential; Fig. 1 C). If channel activation were simply the result of inclusion of an oxidizing potential of −180 mV on the luminal face of the channel, then the higher channel activity should persist after removal cytoplasmic RP. However, removal of the cytoplasmic RP by extensive perfusion of thecis chamber with an identical solution lacking glutathione resulted in a 13-fold decrease in channel P o (meanP o from 0.138 to 0.011; Fig. 1 D). Responsiveness to transmembrane redox potential has been observed in 83 of 106 separate reconstitution experiments from junctional SR prepared with or without redox buffering in the initial steps (including channels exhibiting both low and high Po gating modes) and appears to represent a common feature of RyR1 channel regulation. RyR1 channels responded to local changes in transmembrane RP irrespective of the absolute concentration of glutathione used in the buffer. Both the cytoplasmic and luminal sides of the membrane were set to −180 mV using a variety of [GSH] and [GSSG] ranging from 0.1 to 4 mm (Fig. 2, top panel, conditions a–d). RyR1 channels exhibitedP o values ranging from 0.014 to 0.084 in the presence of 10 μm cis Ca2+ and undefined RP (no GSH/GSSG). RyR1 channels responded with a 7–8-fold enhancement in gating activity once a symmetrical −180 mV transmembrane RP was established (Fig. 2, lower panel). Inn = 19 separate reconstitution experiments, channel activity was enhanced to the same degree (7–8-fold of the respective control activity in the absence of a defined transmembrane RP) and was independent of the absolute [GSH] and [GSSG] used to obtain a symmetrical −180 mV RP. These results suggest that RyR1 channel activity responds to changing transmembrane RP and may modify sensitivity to cytoplasmic Ca2+. Thus, one unique physiologic role of redox sensing afforded to ER/SR Ca2+channels is the continuous alignment of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release gain with small changes of transmembrane redox potential. High concentrations of either GSH or GSSG (≥2 mm) added singly to the cytoplasmic side of the RyR1 channel resulted in persistent changes in channel gating behavior (data not shown) as previously reported (28Zable A.C. Favero T.G. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These effects are likely due to the extreme reduction and oxidation potentials that nonselectively alter protein thiols/disulfides and adversely impact a physiologically relevant transmembrane redox sensor (11Pessah I.N. Feng W. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Dulhunty A. Haarmann C. Green D. Hart J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2 (,): 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Zable A.C. Favero T.G. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In healthy non-muscle cells, the ER transmembrane RP gradient is maintained by one or more transporters that facilitate diffusion of either GSH or GSSG and the process is blocked by flufenamic acid (17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To establish the physiological relevance of a trans SR membrane redox sensor within the RyR1 complex, we determined whether or not junctional SR possesses a transport mechanism necessary to generate a transmembrane redox gradient. First, light scattering measured spectrally shows that transport of GSH or GSSG (10 mm) from the extravesicular space into the vesicle lumen (Fig.3 A). The rate of decline in fluorescence represents the uptake of GSH or GSSG into the SR vesicles (thereby decreasing light scattering). Based on the initial rate, junctional SR vesicles transported GSH ∼5 times faster than GSSG, consistent with recent measurements performed with liver microsomes (17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Despite the higher initial rates of GSH over GSSG, the steady state capacity of SR vesicles for GSH was only 2-fold higher than GSSG within 10 min (ΔF = 40 versus 80; Fig.3 A). Transport of glutathione is selective because the addition of equimolar sucrose to the transport medium produces only a very small change in light scattering in the same time frame as previously shown (21Meissner G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Flufenamic acid is a known blocker of glutathione transport across ER membrane vesicles prepared from liver (17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Likewise, movement of GSH and GSSG across junctional SR was fully inhibited by 1 mm flufenamic acid (Fig. 3 A). Second, we measured the transmembrane GSH and GSSG ratio at steady state (10 min) using o-phthaldialdehyde as a quantitative indicator (23Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This method permits direct quantitative analysis of total luminal glutathione (GSH + GSSG) and GSH. In this manner, the ratio of luminal GSH/GSSG can be measured in the presence of varying extravesicular RP Fig. 3 B shows several ratios of [GSH]/[GSSG] added to the SR buffer to give extravesicular RP ranging from −231 mV to −180 mV. After a 10-min equilibration, the vesicles were extracted and the relative concentration of GSH and GSSG inside the vesicle lumen determined using OPA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” [GSH] is determined directly by adding OPA, whereas total [glutathione] ([GSH] + [GSSG]) was determined after reducing the sample with dithionite (23Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Shertzer H.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Regardless of the extravesicular redox potential set experimentally, the luminal ratio of [GSH]/[GSSG] converged to 3:1 (Fig. 3 B, fifth column). These results reveal for the first time the ability of SR lumen to clamp the ratio of its [GSH]/[GSSG] within narrow limits, despite the presence varying cytoplasmic RP. A 3:1 ratio of [GSH]/[GSSG] is consistent with a significantly more oxidized microsomal lumen, as demonstrated previously (16Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Taken together, the present results reveal that junctional SR membranes, such as ER membranes from non-muscle origin (17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), possess a selective transporter for GSH and GSSG. Although a common feature of this microsomal transporter is a preference for GSH over GSSG (based on initial rates), steady state analysis reveals the ability of the ER/SR lumen to favor a 3:1 ratio of GSH/GSSG regardless of the cytosolic RP. A 3:1 GSH/GSSG is consistent with the observation that healthy cells maintain an oxidized luminal potential (∼−160 to −180 mV) relative to the cytosol (∼−220 mV) (16Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). How the ER/SR lumen maintains an oxidized potential despite the preference for transport of GSH is unclear. One possibility is that GSH is oxidized to GSSG within the ER/SR lumen and that the latter is preferentially retained (17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, there is evidence that GSSG can be formed locally within the ER lumen, although the mechanism(s) remain obscure (17Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Bánhegyi G. Marcolongo P.

Chem. 1990; 265: 15361-15364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of a GSH/GSSG transporter co-localized with RyR1 within junctional SR membranes would be expected if transmembrane redox sensing is a significant physiologic modulator of RyR1 function. The ability of the RyR1 complex to respond to transmembrane RP and the apparent ability of SR/ER to create a transmembrane redox gradient raises the possibility that RyR1 channel activity could be actively regulated by subtle localized changes in transmembrane RP Fig.4 show the typical response of RyR1 channels to small changes in transmembrane RP In the absence of a defined RP, low P o channels exhibited infrequent gating activity even when cis Ca2+ was present in an optimal range (30–100 μm) Ca2+(Fig. 4, A and C; top traces). Once the transmembrane RP was buffered to −220/−180 mV (cis/trans), the P o increased 2.7-fold from 0.019 to 0.052 (Fig. 4 A, middle trace). However, upon adjusting cis to a more oxidized −180 mV, the channel P o immediately increased an additional 2.1-fold (Fig. 4 A, bottom trace) for a total enhancement of nearly 6-fold. In this regard, RyR1 channels were under tight control by transmembrane RP, regardless of their gating mode (lowversus high P o). Fig. 4 B shows an example of a high P o channel closely following as little as +10–20 mV incremental jumps in RP on the cis side relative to a fixed luminal RP of −180 mV. Modulation of channel P o is independent of the direction in which the transmembrane RP is altered (reduction → oxidation or oxidation → reduction). For example, once the transmembrane RP was set to symmetrical −180 mV, theP o increased 4.2-fold compared with the initialP o under undefined RP (Fig. 4 C, comparetop and middle traces). Subsequent reduction ofcis to −210 mV reduced P o 2-fold. These results reveal that RyR1 channels tightly follow thecis/trans RP in both oxidizing and reducing directions. Similarly, the P o of low P o RyR1 channels closely followed as little as −10 mV incremental jumps in RP on the cis side relative to a fixed trans of −180 mV in transmembrane RP (Fig. 4 D). In separate experiments, the cytoplasmic RP was kept fixed at −160 mV and the luminal RP incrementally titrated from −160 to −190 mV in −5 to −10 mV increments (n = 4, data not shown). As the RP difference across the BLM increased, channel P oincreased accordingly (227% enhanced P o at −160 mVcis versus −190 mV trans). These results reveal that once RP is set on both the cis and transsides, RyR1 channel activity tightly follows incremental changes in RP on either side of the membrane. Tight regulation of gating activity by transmembrane RP may be likened to the tight voltage regulation observed with voltage-gated ion channels, therefore representing a fundamentally new mode in channel regulation. The response of the RyR1 channels to a physiologically relevant redox difference on cytoplasmic and luminal sides of the membrane indicates that an essential component of the redox sensing mechanism may span the ER/SR membrane and may involve the redox state of essential Cys moieties. The redox difference across the ER/SR membrane may therefore provide the driving force for electron transfer reactions that modify the gating kinetics in response to physiological ligands. From what has been known for many redox-sensitive biochemical processes, including targets of transcription factors, antioxidants, cytokines, as well as ion channels/transporters, cell growth-related genes, kinases, phosphatases, etc., electron flow through CH2-SH moieties of conserved Cys residues within proteins account for their redox-sensing properties (14Sen C. Biochem. Parmacol. 1998; 55: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). An essential component of RyR1 redox sensing may involve the transfer of electrons among two or more closely spaced Cys moieties within the channel complex. The RyR1 complex has been shown to possess a small number of highly reactive sulfhydryl moieties in which chemical reactivity appears to dramatically increase with decreasing P o by the presence of mmMg2+ and/or nm Ca2+ (18Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol.

Consistent with previous reports (18Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the fast labeling kinetics of these hyperreactive thiols by the fluorescent maleimide CPM (7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin) took place under conditions that favor RyR1 channel closure (e.g. 10 mm Mg2+). The hyperreactive SR thiols rapidly formed thioether adducts with 0.2–1 pmol of CPM/μg of SR protein (t 12 of 11.67–15.37 s; n = 4, data not shown). To determine whether chemical modification of hyperreactive Cys moieties alter gating behavior, channels were arylated with CPM under conditions known to promote selective labeling of only hyperreactive Cys residues and the functional consequences determined in the BLM. Fig. 5, A andC, reveals that short-term (≤5 min) exposure of a channel to 40 and 50 nm CPM, respectively, caused negligible changes of P o (Fig. 5, A andC) and mean open dwell time (Fig. 5 B) (n = 8). Reconstitution of RyR1 channel from such specifically CPM-relabeled SR vesicles also demonstrated unchanged channel gating behavior (n = 13, data not shown). However, prolonged incubation of CPM produced additional nonspecific interactions with less reactive Cys residues and thus led to a time-dependent irreversible inactivation of the channel (Fig. 5 C; n = 3). These results reveal that formation of thioether adducts with the most reactive (hyperreactive) Cys residues within the RyR1 complex does not alter overt aspects of channel gating behavior. Are the hyperreactive thiols associated with the RyR1 complex an essential component of the transmembrane redox sensor? Fig.6 addresses this important question by comparing the responses of two separate channels to parallel changes in transmembrane RP without and with chemical modification of the hyperreactive Cys residues with CPM. Both channels responded strongly to the instillation of a symmetric −180 mV transmembrane RP and were negatively regulated by a −220/−180 mV cis/trans gradient (compare Fig. 6, A and B, traces 2–4). The channel in panel B, after exposure to 20 nm CPM for 120 s, failed to respond to a −180/−180 mV symmetric cis/trans redox gradient (Fig.6 B, compare traces 6 and 7), whereas the control channel maintained its redox-sensing properties (Fig.6 A, compare traces 6 and 7). Despite the loss of transmembrane redox sensing, the CPM-modified channel, as predicted, maintained unchanged gating behavior and sensitivity to 10 μm ryanodine (Fig. 6 B, short trace, labeled Ry). In separate experiments, RyR1 channels had been reconstituted in BLM after hyperreactive thiols were specifically arylated by CPM under the conditions described above. It was found that these pretreated channels gated normally but lacked sensitivity to transmembrane RP changes (n = 3, data not shown). Our findings reveal the existence of a transmembrane redox sensor within a microsomal Ca2+ channel and represent the first direct evidence linking transmembrane RP with a specific biochemical mechanism regulating microsomal Ca2+ transport. Small changes in localized RP appear to dramatically influence the RyR1 activity regardless of cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. Redox sensing is therefore likely to have significant regulatory impact on Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Considering the broad distribution of IP3R and RyR receptors, redox control of microsomal Ca2+ release channels may represent a fundamental mechanism by which mammalian cells regulate Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis in response to localized changes in redox potential. Hyperreactive thiols within the channel complex are an essential component of a transmembrane redox sensor, which is likely to contribute important regulatory functions during normal intracellular signaling (mediated for example by nitric oxide) (31Aghdasi B.

Here we have isolated, cloned, and characterized a novel protein from PC12 cells, termed Kidins220 (kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa), as the first identified PKD physiological substrate. Kidins220 contains 11 ankyrin repeats and four transmembrane domains within the N-terminal region. We have shown that Kidins220 is an integral membrane protein selectively expressed in brain and neuroendocrine cells, where it concentrates at the tip of neurites. In PC12 cells, PKD co-immunoprecipitates and phosphorylates endogenous Kidins220. This phosphorylation is increased after stimulating PKD activity in vivo by phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate treatment. A constitutively active PKD mutant (PKD-S744E/S748E) phosphorylates recombinant Kindins220-VSVG in vitro in the absence of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate. Conversely, Kidins220-VSVG phosphorylation is abolished when a dominant negative mutant of PKD (PKD-D733A) is used. Moreover, a peptide within the Kidins220 sequence, containing serine 919 in a consensus motif for PKD-specific phosphorylation, behaved as the best peptide substrate to date. Substitution of serine 919 to alanine abrogated peptide phosphorylation. Furthermore, by generating an antibody recognizing Kidins220 phosphorylated on serine 919, we show that phorbol ester treatment causes the specific phosphorylation of this residue in PC12 cells in vivo. Our results provide the first physiological substrate for PKD and indicate that Kidins220 is phosphorylated by PKD at serine 919 in vivo."

In both cases, rare alleles may be advantageous, but it remains unclear which mechanism maintains the genetic polymorphism for specificity in self/nonself recognition. Contrary to earlier reports, we show that mate selection cannot be a strong force maintaining allorecognition polymorphism in two colonial marine invertebrates.

The MMPs are zinc-dependent multidomain endopeptidases that, with few exceptions, share a basic structural organization comprising propeptide, catalytic, hinge, and C-terminal (hemopexin-like) domains (1Nagase H.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). All MMPs are produced in a latent form (pro-MMP) requiring activation for catalytic activity, a process that is usually accomplished by proteolytic removal of the propeptide domain. Once activated, all MMPs are specifically inhibited by a group of endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) that bind to the active site, inhibiting catalysis (1Nagase H.

Over the last 5 years, the MMP family has been expanded to include a new subfamily of membrane-tethered MMPs known as membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs), which to date includes six members (6Sato H.

The MT-MMPs, with the exception of MT4-MMP, are unique because they are anchored to the plasma membrane by means of a hydrophobic stretch of approximately 20 amino acids, leaving the catalytic domain exposed to the extracellular space. This organization makes the MT-MMPs perfectly suited for regulation of pericellular proteolysis. MT1-MMP (MMP-14) was the first member of the MT-MMP family to be discovered and has been shown to be the major physiological activator of pro-MMP-2 (gelatinase A) on the cell surface (6Sato H.

Studies on the mechanism of activation of pro-MMP-2 by MT1-MMP revealed a complex role for TIMP-2 in this process.

This ternary complex has been suggested to cluster pro-MMP-2 at the cell surface near a residual TIMP-free active MT1-MMP molecule, which is thought to initiate activation of the bound pro-MMP-2. Pro-MMP-2 activation would occur only at low TIMP-2 concentrations relative to MT1-MMP, which would permit availability of active MT1-MMP to activate the pro-MMP-2 bound in the ternary complex (39Jo Y. Yeon J. Kim H.J. Lee S.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, under restricted conditions, TIMP-2 is thought to promote the activation process by acting as a molecular link between MT1-MMP and pro-MMP-2. We have recently shown that TIMP-2, besides its role in ternary complex formation, has direct and critical effects on MT1-MMP processing, which influence the profile and spatial localization of MT1-MMP forms (40Hernandez-Barrantes S.

Biochemical and cellular evidence showed that binding of TIMP-2 to active MT1-MMP (57 kDa) inhibits autocatalytic degradation, leading to accumulation of active MT1-MMP on the cell surface. In the absence of TIMP-2, MT1-MMP is rapidly processed to a 44-kDa membrane-bound inactive enzyme (40Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R.

Thus, under controlled conditions, TIMP-2 may act as a positive regulator of MT1-MMP activity by promoting the availability of active MT1-MMP on the cell surface and consequently may support pericellular proteolysis. Since some of the effects of TIMP-2 on MT1-MMP activities are related to its inhibitory activity, we wished to examine the effects of synthetic and physiological MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) on MT1-MMP processing and its ability to promote pro-MMP-2 activation with TIMP-2.

Here we show for the first time that synthetic MMPIs and a C-terminally truncated TIMP-2 but not TIMP-4, which inhibit MT1-MMP activity, act synergistically with TIMP-2 to promote pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP. These studies demonstrate the complexity of MT1-MMP regulation and provide new insights into the roles of TIMP-2, TIMP-4, and MMPIs in this process.

To express MT1-MMP, confluent cultures of BS-C-1 or Timp2 mutant cells in 6- or 12-well plates were co-infected with 5–10 pfu/cell each of vTF7–3 and vT7-MT1 viruses for 45 min in infection medium (DMEM plus 2.5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics) at 37 °C. As control, the cells were infected only with the vTF7–3 virus as described (40Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). After infection, the media were aspirated, and the cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM and replaced with fresh serum-free DMEM supplemented with or without various doses of purified human recombinant TIMP-2. After various times at 37 °C, the media were aspirated; the cells were rinsed with DMEM and then incubated (15–30 min, 37 °C) in fresh media supplemented with 10 nm pro-MMP-2. The media were then collected, and the cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate fractions were analyzed for pro-MMP-2 activation by gelatin zymography and/or immunoblot analysis for assessment of MT1-MMP forms. To examine the effects of synthetic MMP inhibitors, Δ−TIMP-2, Ala + TIMP-2, and TIMP-4 on TIMP-2-dependent activation of pro-MMP-2, the MT1-MMP-infected cells were treated (16 h, 37 °C) with the appropriate MMP inhibitors (various doses) diluted in serum-free DMEM. Then the media were aspirated, and the cells were rinsed with DMEM. TIMP-2 (10 nm) was then added to the cells in serum-free DMEM for a 5–30-min incubation at 37 °C. The media were aspirated followed by a wash with DMEM to remove unbound TIMP-2. The cells were then incubated (15 min, 37 °C) with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 nm pro-MMP-2. Analysis of pro-MMP-2 activation and of the profile of MT1-MMP forms in the cell lysates were carried out as described below. Gelatin zymography was performed using 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. Briefly, samples of lysates or media were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (60Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar) without reducing agents and without heating and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described previously (61Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3159-3167PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, the cell lysates were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE following by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane essentially as described (61Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Fridman R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3159-3167PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of the immune complexes was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MT1-MMPcat activity was monitored with the fluorescence-quenched substrate MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)-AR-NH2 (62Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured with a Photon Technology International (PTI) spectrofluorometer interfaced to a Pentium computer, equipped with the RatioMasterTM and FeliXTM hardware and software, respectively. The cuvette compartment was maintained at 25 °C. Excitation and emission passes of 1 and 3 nm, respectively, were used. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored at emission and excitation wavelengths of 328 and 393 nm, respectively. Fluorescence measurements were taken every 4 s. Less than 10% hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate was monitored, as described by Knight (62Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 18-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For slow binding inhibition, progress curves were obtained by adding enzyme (0.5 nm) to a mixture of fluorogenic substrate (7 μm) and varying concentrations of inhibitor in buffer R (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij-35, and 1–5% Me2SO; final volume 2 ml) in acrylic cuvettes with stirring and monitoring the increase in fluorescence with time for 15–30 min. The progress curves were nonlinear least squares fitted to Equation 1(63Muller-Steffner H.M. Malver O. Hosie L. Oppenheimer N.J. Schuber F. J. Biol.

The obtained kvalues, v0, and vs were further analyzed according to Equations 2 and 3 for a one-step association mechanism.k=koff+kon [I]/(1+[S]/Km)Equation 2 (vo−vs)/vs=[I]/(Ki(1+[S]/Km))Equation 3 The Km and kcat values for the reaction of MT1-MMPcat with the fluorogenic substrate were determined to be 6.9 ± 0.6 μm and 0.67 ± 0.03 s−1, respectively. Intercept and slope values, obtained by linear regression of the k versus inhibitor concentration plot (Equation 2), yielded the association and dissociation rate constants konand koff, respectively, and the inhibition constant Ki(koff/kon). Alternatively, Ki was determined from the slope of the (v0 −vs)/vs versus[I] plot according to Equation 3. The dissociation rate constant was determined independently from the enzyme activity recovered after dilution of a preformed enzyme-inhibitor complex. To this end, typically 50 nm of enzyme was incubated with 80 nm of inhibitor for a sufficient time to reach equilibrium (>45 min) at 25.0 °C. The complex was diluted 400-fold into 2 ml of buffer R containing fluorogenic substrate (10 μm final concentration). Recovery of enzyme activity was monitored for ∼60 min. The fluorescence versus time trace was fitted, using the program SCIENTIST, to Equation 4,F=vst+(vo−vs)(1−exp(−kofft))/koff+F0Equation 4 where v0 represents the initial rate (very small), vs is the rate observed when theEI complex is completely dissociated, andkoff is the first order rate constant ofEI dissociation. In light of the slow dissociation of the MT1-MMPcat-TIMP-2 complex, the direct analysis of thekoff parameter for the wild type TIMP-2 was not possible and was estimated based on a 10-fold difference observed between the slopes of the linear portions of the dissociation curves for the complexes of MT1-MMPcat with Δ-TIMP-2 (steady state rate) and wild type TIMP-2. For competitive inhibition, initial rates were obtained by adding enzyme (0.5 nm) to a mixture of fluorogenic substrate (7 μm) and varying concentrations of inhibitor in buffer R (final volume 1 ml) in quartz semimicro cuvettes and monitoring the increase in fluorescence with time for 5–10 min. The initial velocities were determined by linear regression analysis of the fluorescence versus time traces using FeliXTM. The initial rates were fitted to Equation 5(64Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics.

Low aluminum abundances for all regions argue against global differentiation of Eros. Magnesium/silicon, aluminum/silicon, calcium/silicon, and iron/silicon ratios are best interpreted as a relatively primitive, chondritic composition. Marked depletions in sulfur and possible aluminum and calcium depletions, relative to ordinary chondrites, may represent signatures of limited partial melting or impact volatilization."
https://openalex.org/W2122667134,"Abstract The focal adhesion (FAK) non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) links both extracellular matrix/integrin and growth factor stimulation to intracellular signals promoting cell migration. Here we show that both transient and stable overexpression of the FAK C-terminal domain termed FRNK (FAK-relatednon-kinase) inhibits serum and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration in wound healing and in vitro Boyden Chamber chemotaxis assays, respectively. Expression of FRNK, but not a point mutant of FRNK (FRNK L1034S), disrupted the formation of a complex containing both FAK and the activated PDGF-β receptor and resulted in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous FAK at the Tyr-397 binding site for Src family PTKs. As demonstrated using FAK-deficient and FAK-reconstituted fibroblasts, FAK positively contributed to PDGF-BB-stimulated ERK2/MAP kinase activity, and in SMCs, ERK2/MAP kinase activity was required for PDGF-BB-stimulated chemotaxis. Stable expression of FRNK but not FRNK L1034S expression in SMCs lowered the extent and duration of stimulated ERK2/MAP kinase activation at low but not at high PDGF-BB concentrations. Importantly, stable expression of FRNK in SMCs did not affect SMC morphology or proliferation in culture. Because the increased migration of vascular SMCs in response to extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors contributes to neointima formation, our results show that FAK inhibition by FRNK expression may provide a novel approach to regulate abnormal vascular SMC migration in vivo."

Binding of Ang-1 to Tie-2 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and recruitment of signaling intermediates. Several signaling proteins have been shown to bind Tie-2, including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, and adaptor proteins Grb2 and downstream of kinase-related (26Huang L. Turck C. Rao P. Peters K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jones N. Master Z. Jones J. Bouchard D. Gunji Y. Sasaki H. Daly R. Alitalo K. Dumont D.J. J. Biol.

In contrast to Tie-2, nothing is known about the cellular functions controlled by Tie-1 or the signaling pathways utilized by this receptor. In addition, ligands for Tie-1 have yet to be identified. Here we have examined the signaling potential of Tie-1 using a chimeric receptor approach. We find the receptor incapable of autophosphorylation or inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in endothelial cells. In accord with this baculovirus-expressed Tie-1 exhibits negligible tyrosine kinase activity. However, we also find that in endothelial cells Tie-1 physically associates with Tie-2. A number of previous reports have speculated that Tie-1 may have direct roles in Tie-2 signaling (14Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D.

The present findings strengthen this possibility and provide potential mechanisms whereby this could occur. The existence of a pre-formed Tie-1·Tie-2 complex suggests direct functional cooperation between these two receptors in control of endothelial behavior and blood vessel development. Antibodies directed against the extracellular domains of Tie-1 and -2 were obtained from R & D Systems Ltd., and those against the carboxyl-terminal sequences of Tie-1 and Tie-2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-TrkA monoclonal antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. The monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. cDNA corresponding to human full-length Tie-1 and -2 and the Tie-1 endodomain comprising the entire transmembrane and intracellular domains of Tie-1 (nucleotides 2274–3440) were obtained by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. These clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cDNA encoding TrkA was a kind gift from Dr. J. Tavare (University of Bristol). A HindIII restriction site was engineered at residue 408 of TrkA by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and was used to subclone the TrkA ectodomain in-frame with the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Tie-1 and Tie-2. For expression of intracellular sequences, Tie-1 was subcloned into the pSecTag expression vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the leader sequence. To incorporate an amino-terminal FLAG epitope tag, the Tie-1 endodomain was subcloned into the pFLAG vector (Sigma). Deleted forms of Tie-1 endodomain are detailed in Fig. 3 and were generated by using existing restriction sites. Sequences were confirmed using a 373A ABI automated DNA sequencer. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and CompleteTM protease inhibitor were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or sources described previously (30Glazebrook H. Hatch T. Brindle N.P.J. J. Vasc. Res. 1998; 35: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as described previously (30Glazebrook H. Hatch T.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were maintained in Medium 199 containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 20% fetal calf serum, 5 units/ml heparin, and 100 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transfections of BAEC were performed using SuperfectTM(Qiagen Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA encoding the intracellular domains of Tie-1 (amino acids 785–1138) and Tie-2 (amino acids 771–1124) were cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of baculovirus transfer plasmid pFastBac1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant baculovirus was prepared using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and used to infect 2 × 106/ml insect cells at multiplicity of infection of 1. Forty eight hours after infection cells were lysed in HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 10% glycerol; 1% Triton X-100; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were diluted with HNTG buffer to a final concentration corresponding to 107 cells/ml, cleared by centrifugation, and used as required or aliquoted and snap-frozen at −80 οC. Kinase assays were performed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates coated with the substrate poly(Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1. Diluted lysates containing 10 mm MnCl2, 5 μm ATP, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 25 mm dithiothreitol were incubated in the wells at 21 ο C for 60 min, and tyrosine phosphorylation of substrate was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Optical density of the wells was measured at 405 nm wavelength (Molecular Dynamics). Endothelial cells were washed in PBS and lysed at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm EGTA) and CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture. For examination of tyrosine phosphorylation in total cell extracts, aliquots of lysate were diluted with Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, lysates were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding 0.4 μg/ml of the appropriate antibody to the lysate and incubating with rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. Pre-washed protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose, as appropriate, was added to the protein-antibody complex and incubated for a further 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with appropriate antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a chemiluminescent detection system (33Matthews J.A. Batki A. Hynds C. Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Bands on films were quantitated by scanning with an LKB Ultrascan densitometer. In experiments with untransfected human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), confluent cells were placed in serum-free Medium 199 for 5 min before challenge with control vehicle or 10 ng/ml PMA for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS before cross-linking essentially as described previously (34Chan F.K.-M. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 35Hüttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in PBS containing 0.5 mmdithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) before quenching by the addition of 0.1 ml of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, followed by two washes with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed and proteins immunoprecipitated as described above. Despite the importance of Tie-1 in blood vessel formation, the signaling pathways utilized by this receptor and its cellular functions are not known. To gain insight into Tie-1 signaling and function we used a chimeric receptor approach. cDNA was constructed in which the extracellular domain of Tie-1 was replaced with that of the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA. Endothelial cells were transfected with TrkA/Tie-1 chimeric receptors and 24 h later challenged with nerve growth factor (NGF) or control vehicle (Fig. 1). The effects on tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins were examined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1 A). There was no detectable difference in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation or profile of phosphorylated proteins between control and NGF-treated cells. For comparison, parallel experiments were performed with cells transfected with chimeric receptors comprising the extracellular domain of TrkA and transmembrane and intracellular domains of Tie-2. A marked stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, most notably those of approximately 135, 90, 72/70, 58, and 43 kDa, was seen following NGF treatment of TrkA/Tie-2-expressing endothelial cells. To examine phosphorylation status of the chimeric receptors, endothelial cells expressing TrkA/Tie-1 or TrkA/Tie-2 were challenged with NGF, lysed, and the receptors recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies against TrkA ectodomain. As shown in Fig. 1 B TrkA/Tie-1 and TrkA/Tie-2 were recovered from the respective cell lysates. TrkA/Tie-2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated following NGF treatment of cells; however, TrkA/Tie-1 showed no evidence of tyrosine phosphorylation under control or NGF-stimulated conditions. These data suggest that Tie-1 is impaired in its ability to signal as a tyrosine kinase. To test this the intracellular domains of Tie-1 and Tie-2 were expressed in insect cells, and their kinase activity was measured. There was a significant difference between tyrosine kinase activity of Tie-1 and Tie-2 (Fig. 1 C). In contrast to Tie-2, Tie-1 exhibited no measurable tyrosine kinase activity above background (Fig. 1 C). Other receptor tyrosine kinases reported to have negligible kinase activity include the heregulin receptor ErbB3 and an orphan receptor H-Ryk (36Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A.

In the case of ErbB3, ligand-induced heterodimerization of the receptor occurs with kinase-active members of the ErbB family, the most favorable interaction being with ErbB2 (39Tzahar E. Waterman H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). This interaction activates phosphotyrosine signaling by ErbB2 and tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3, as well as stimulation of downstream pathways such as those involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (41Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway K.L.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Tie-1 could initiate signaling if it were to become phosphorylated as a result of interaction with an active tyrosine kinase. The ability of Tie-1 to interact with Tie-2 was therefore tested. Endothelial cells were lysed and Tie-2 immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for the Tie-2 ectodomain. Blots were probed for the presence of Tie-1. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Tie-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Tie-2 indicating that these two proteins were physically associated. Tie-1 undergoes regulated endoproteolytic cleavage resulting in release of its extracellular domain and retention of a membrane-associated receptor fragment composed of the transmembrane and intracellular domains (31McCarthy M.J. Burrows R. Bell S.C. Christie G. Bell P.R.F. Brindle N.P.J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 889-895PubMed Google Scholar, 43Yabkowitz R. Myer S. Yanagihara D. Brankow D. Staley T. Elliot G. Hu S. Ratzkin B. Blood. 1997; 90: 706-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Yabkowitz R. Meyer S. Black T. Elliott G. Merewether L.A. Yamane H.K. Blood. 1999; 93: 1969-1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the endodomain alone could interact with Tie-2. Endothelial cells were treated with PMA which led to formation of the 45-kDa cell-associated Tie-1 endodomain as described previously (31McCarthy M.J. Burrows R. Bell S.C. Christie G. Bell P.R.F. Brindle N.P.J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 889-895PubMed Google Scholar, 43Yabkowitz R. Myer S. Yanagihara D. Brankow D. Staley T. Elliot G. Hu S. Ratzkin B. Blood. 1997; 90: 706-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tie-2 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of these cells using an antibody that recognizes the extracellular domain of Tie-2 (Fig. 2 B). Probing these immunoprecipitates with an antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the Tie-1 intracellular domain revealed Tie-1 endodomain co-immunoprecipitated with Tie-2 demonstrating association between the two proteins. These data also indicate that the motif responsible for association of the two receptors lies in their intracellular regions. The intracellular domain of Tie-1 consists of a transmembrane domain, juxtamembrane region, a tyrosine kinase domain, and a carboxyl-terminal tail sequence. Previously, it has been suggested that sequences within the α-helical transmembrane domains of some receptor tyrosine kinases mediate receptor dimerization (45Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We used deletion analysis to determine which regions of the endodomain mediate the interaction between Tie-1 and Tie-2. Forms of Tie-1 endodomain with amino-terminal FLAG epitope tags were constructed composed of the complete endodomain, transmembrane and juxtamembrane deleted, and carboxyl-terminal deleted endodomain (Fig. 3 A). These constructs were expressed in endothelial cells together with TrkA/Tie-2. Immunoprecipitations were performed with an antibody recognizing the epitope tag, and the recovered protein was probed for the presence of bound TrkA/Tie-2. As a control for nonspecific binding, a non-epitope-tagged form of endodomain was expressed, and cell lysates were subjected to the same immunoprecipitation protocol. As shown in Fig. 3 B, all FLAG-tagged endodomains were immunoprecipitated. Probing for the presence of TrkA/Tie-2 revealed complete endodomain, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane deleted and carboxyl-terminal deleted forms of Tie-1 all bound to TrkA/Tie-2. Nonspecific recovery of Tie-2 was minimal (Fig. 3 B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase-negative receptors by active receptor tyrosine kinase partners within dimers or oligomers has been well documented (46Lammers R. Van Obberghen E. Ballotti R. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16886-16890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Herbst R. Lammers R. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2849-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Indeed, transphosphorylation of an inactive receptor tyrosine kinase can augment the downstream effects of the active receptor (50Hack N. Sue-A-Quan A. Mills G.B. Skorecki K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26441-26446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that phosphotyrosine-dependent signaling could be initiated from Tie-1 within the Tie-1·Tie-2 complex following unidirectional transphosphorylation by Tie-2. To examine this, Tie-1 holoreceptor was co-expressed with the chimeric TrkA/Tie-2 receptor in BAEC. Cells were stimulated by the addition of NGF and TrkA/Tie-2 immunoprecipitated with anti-TrkA antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, NGF stimulated phosphorylation of TrkA/Tie-2. Probing blots for the presence of Tie-1 confirmed this receptor-bound Tie-2. However, there was no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Tie-1 bound to Tie-2 recovered from either unstimulated or stimulated cells. In further experiments TrkA/Tie-2 was co-expressed with a truncated form of Tie-1 corresponding to the endodomain. Again, the Tie-1 endodomain bound to Tie-2 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated under basal or stimulated conditions (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that Tie-1 interaction with Tie-2 does not result in Tie-1 phosphorylation by the process of unidirectional transphosphorylation. The orphan receptor Tie-1 is essential for vascular development where it appears to have roles in promoting vessel integrity and stability. In the present study we have begun to investigate the signaling mechanisms used by this receptor. One of the principal findings of this work was that Tie-1 exists as a pre-formed complex in endothelial cells with the related protein Tie-2. In addition, Tie-1 has negligible kinase activity and does not appear capable of inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins within endothelial cells. It is therefore unlikely that Tie-1 signals through the classical receptor tyrosine kinase mechanism of ligand-induced kinase activation via homo-oligomerization. It is possible that Tie-1 signaling could involve some phosphotyrosine-independent mechanism. Indeed, the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase H-Ryk is capable of activating downstream signaling cascades in the absence of any measurable effects on receptor phosphorylation. However, the physical association between Tie-1 and Tie-2 indicates that at least some aspects of signaling by these two receptors is intimately linked and strongly suggests that an important function of Tie-1 may be to modulate or contribute to Tie-2 signaling. By densitometric analysis of blots of immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitated receptors to determine the fractions of complexed receptor, we estimate more than 80% of Tie-2 to exist in a complex with Tie-1. An extensive detailed analysis of relative distributions of the receptors between free and complexed forms, and the potential effects of agonists on this, is the subject of current investigations. The finding that Tie-1 and Tie-2 exist as a pre-formed complex concurs with recent observations that have expanded the traditional view of receptor signaling to encompass the concept that receptor oligomerization can occur prior to ligand binding (51Jiang G. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R568-R571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Receptors found to pre-assemble into complexes in the absence of ligand include members of the TNF receptor superfamily and the erythropoietin receptor (34Chan F.K.-M. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 52Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A.

Science. 2000; 288: 2354-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). In these cases, however, the complexes formed are homomeric. This contrasts with the current finding of heteromeric complexes between the related but distinct proteins Tie-1 and Tie-2. Ligand-independent association of members of the TNF receptor family has been shown to be mediated by a distinct motif, termed the pre-ligand binding assembly domain, present in the extracellular portion of the receptors (34Chan F.K.-M. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Tie-1 binding to Tie-2 is mediated by the intracellular domains of the receptors. Deletion analysis demonstrated a 236-amino acid sequence between residues 825 and 1061 in Tie-1 harbors the domain responsible for binding Tie-2. Further studies are underway to resolve more precisely the residues involved. The molecular basis for differences in kinase activity between Tie-1 and Tie-2 is not readily apparent. The kinase domains of the human Tie receptors share 84% amino acid sequence identity (7Partanen J. Armstrong E. Makela T.P. Korhonen J. Sandberg M. Renkonen R. Knuutila S. Huebner K. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1698-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 11Ziegler S. Bird T. Schneringer J. Schooley K. Baum P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 663-670PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, all of the critically conserved amino acid residues in the protein kinase family (54Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar) are present in Tie-1. One potential mechanism for initiating signaling from Tie-1 that would not require the receptor to have an active kinase would be through the creation of phosphotyrosine docking sites on Tie-1 by transphosphorylation following heterotypic interaction with an active receptor tyrosine kinase. A number of studies have demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase-poor partners in heterodimeric-oligomeric complexes by more active component receptor tyrosine kinases (46Lammers R. Van Obberghen E. Ballotti R. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16886-16890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Herbst R. Lammers R. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2849-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, although Tie-1 and Tie-2 were found to associate, under the conditions examined here we did not observe tyrosine phosphorylation of Tie-1 under basal conditions or following activation of Tie-2 phosphorylation. Of course it is possible that certain conditions, such as binding of some known or unknown ligand to Tie-2 or Tie-1, could induce a change in the relative position or orientation of the receptors and permit such a transphosphorylation. The newly emerging theme that some receptors exist as pre-assembled complexes that bind and respond to ligand (34Chan F.K.-M. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 51Jiang G. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R568-R571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) raises the intriguing possibility that a specific ligand may exist for the Tie-1·Tie-2 complex. The inability to detect Tie-2 transphosphorylation of Tie-1 suggests the complex may have functions other than initiating signaling from Tie-1. Close comparison of the phenotypes of Tie-1-deficient and Tie-2-deficient mice has led to the conclusion that Tie-1 counteracts some of the effects of Tie-2 on microvascular development (4Patan S. Microvasc. Res. 1998; 56: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several previous reports have speculated that Tie-1 may be directly involved in regulating Tie-2 signaling (14Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The present finding of a physical interaction between the receptors strengthens this possibility and provides a number of potential mechanisms by which this could occur. The presence of Tie-1 bound to the intracellular domain of Tie-2 could, for example, restrict recruitment of signaling intermediates to phosphotyrosine docking sites in Tie-2 resulting in differences in the downstream signaling cascades initiated by activated Tie-2·Tie-1 and free Tie-2. In this regard it is interesting to note that the downstream effects of VEGF receptor-2 are altered when it undergoes ligand-induced heterodimerization with the relatively poor tyrosine kinase VEGF receptor-1 (55Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Further ways in which association with Tie-1 could influence Tie-2 signaling would include regulation of ligand accessibility or affinity for Tie-2. The fact that the extracellular domain of Tie-1 can be released in response to VEGF and TNFα (43Yabkowitz R. Myer S. Yanagihara D. Brankow D. Staley T. Elliot G. Hu S. Ratzkin B. Blood. 1997; 90: 706-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Yabkowitz R. Meyer S. Black T. Elliott G. Merewether L.A. Yamane H.K.

https://openalex.org/W2088155080,"Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) is a trypsin-activated member of a family of G-protein-coupled PARs. We have identified a polymorphic form of human PAR2 (PAR2F240S) characterized by a phenylalanine to serine mutation at residue 240 within extracellular loop 2, with allelic frequencies of 0.916 (Phe240) and 0.084 (Ser240) for the wild-type and mutant alleles, respectively. Elevations in intracellular calcium were measured in permanently transfected cell lines expressing the receptors. PAR2F240S displayed a significant reduction in sensitivity toward trypsin (∼3.7-fold) and the PAR2-activating peptides, SLIGKV-NH2 (∼2.5-fold) and SLIGRL-NH2(∼2.8-fold), but an increased sensitivity toward the selective PAR2 agonist,trans-cinnamoyl-LIGRLO-NH2(∼4-fold). Increased sensitivity was also observed toward the selective PAR-1 agonist, TFLLR-NH2 (∼7-fold), but not to other PAR-1 agonists tested. Furthermore, we found that TLIGRL-NH2 and a PAR4-derived peptide,trans-cinnamoyl-YPGKF-NH2, were selective PAR2F240S agonists. By introducing the F240S mutation into rat PAR2, we observed shifts in agonist potencies that mirrored the human PAR2F240S, suggesting that Phe240 is involved in determining agonist specificity of PAR2. Finally, differences in receptor signaling were paralleled in a cell growth assay. We suggest that the distinct pharmacological profile induced by this polymorphism will have important implications for the design of PAR-targeted agonists/antagonists and may contribute to, or be predictive of, an inflammatory disease.

The peptide SLIGKV-NH2 is employed to activate human PAR2, although the mouse and rat sequence, SLIGRL-NH2, and the selective PAR2 agonisttrans-cinnamoyl-LIGRLO-NH2(tc-LIGRLO-NH2) are more potent PAR2 agonist peptides (PAR2-APs) (10Al-Ani B.

However, TFLLR-NH2 and Ala-parafluoro-Phe-Arg-cyclohexyl-Ala-citrulline-Tyr (Cit-NH2) are potent PAR1-APs (2–20 μm) that selectively activate PAR1 (13Kawabata A. Saifeddine M. Al-Ani B. Leblond L.

For example, the inflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and lipopolysaccharide, up-regulate endothelial PAR2 expression (24Nystedt S. Ramakrishnan V. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14910-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), while PAR2 activation stimulates inflammatory cytokine release from keratinocytes (21Wakita H. Furukawa F. Takigawa M. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1997; 109: 190-207PubMed Google Scholar) and promotes endothelial rolling and adhesion of leukocytes (26Vergnolle N. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5064-5069PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the administration of the PAR2-AP, SLIGRL-NH2, in vivo, induces an inflammatory response (27Vergnolle N. Hollenberg M.D. Sharkey K.A. Wallace J.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The resulting edema occurs via neuronal PAR2 activation (28Steinhoff M. Vergnolle N. Young S.H. Tognetto M. Amadesi S. Ennes H.S. Trevisani M. Hollenberg M.D. Wallace J.L. Caughey G.H. Mitchell S.E. Williams L.M. Geppetti P. Mayer E.A. Bunnett N.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Given that PAR2 agonists can initiate an inflammatory response, polymorphisms within PAR2 that alter receptor signaling may have important implications for disease. The mechanism whereby the tethered ligand activates PAR2 remains to be clearly established. Elegant studies with the closely related thrombin receptor (PAR1) have suggested that the tethered ligand interacts with extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), indicating that this domain is important for governing agonist specificity and receptor signaling (29Nanevicz T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has also implicated ECL2 of PAR2 as a critical region for agonist specificity (32Lerner D.J. Chen M. Tram T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13943-13947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and PAR2 function can be significantly altered by mutating the corresponding residues in ECL2 that were found to be of importance in PAR1 (33Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, natural mutations found within ECL2 may affect a PAR's ability to respond to its respective agonists. In the course of cloning PAR2, we discovered a PAR2 variant (PAR2F240S) with a phenylalanine to serine mutation at position 240 of ECL2. We sought to determine 1) the frequency of the variant in a normal Caucasian population and 2) whether the functional characteristics of the variant receptor differed from the wild-type receptor in terms of its activation by trypsin and a variety of PAR agonists. All peptides were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility (University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). Peptides were prepared in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, and were standardized by quantitative amino acid analysis to confirm peptide concentration and purity. The pGEM-T-Easy vector, Sau96I, Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, and 10× PCR buffer were purchased from Promega (Southampton, UK). All oligonucleotides were synthesized at Oswel Laboratories (Southampton, UK); FCS, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, nonenzymatic cell dissociation fluid, penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin, sodium pyruvate, Geneticin, and PBS (without calcium and magnesium) were from Life Technologies, Inc.; Porcine pancreatic type IX trypsin (13–20,000 units/mg; molar concentrations were calculated on the basis of 20,000 units/mg), sulfinpyrazone, and calcium ionophore (A23187) were from Sigma, and pcDNA3.1(+) were from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides targeted to sequences at the beginning of (1U-sense, 5′-CCA GGA GGA TGC GGA GC-3′) and the end of the PAR2 reading frame (1D-antisense, 5′-GAG GAC CTG GAA AAC TCA ATA-3′) were used to amplify the cDNA from a human colonic cDNA library. The PCR product was cloned into a pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding human PAR2 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+), and sequenced. To obtain a copy of PAR2 wild type cDNA (6Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Larsson A.K. Strombeck B. Sundelin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To establish whether the Phe240 residue was of importance for PAR2 activation in rat PAR2, we mutated T719 to C719 in a rat PAR2 clone (10Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Renaux B. Mokashi S. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar). The human wild-type clone and rat PAR2F240S receptor clones were sequenced to confirm the engineered mutations. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood of 125 normal Caucasian individuals by standard techniques (35Jones A.S. Nature. 1963; 199: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consent was obtained from all subjects, and ethical approval was granted by the Southampton and SouthWest Hampshire Joint Ethics Committee. PAR2 primers corresponding to nucleotides 699–718 in extracellular loop II (T2D-sense, 5′-GCT CTT GGT GGG AGA CAG GT-3′) and nucleotides 926–949 in extracellular loop III (T4U-antisense, 5′-GGC TCT TAA TCA GAA AAT AAT GCA-3′) were used to generate a PCR product of 250 bp from the genomic DNA samples. ASau96I site was designed into the T2D-sense primer and was accomplished by replacing nucleotide 716 (T) with G (see primer T2D above, wherein G (716) is underlined). A control Sau96I restriction site was present 100 bp from the 3′-end of the PCR product. The PCR was performed in a Gene Amp 2400 PCR System with 200 ng of DNA, 150 ng of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase in a 50-μl reaction volume starting at 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The 250-bp product was digested overnight at 37 °C with 6 units/reaction of Sau96I and then run on an acrylamide gel, stained in ethidium bromide, and observed by ultraviolet light. To confirm data obtained from the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 389–409 in extracellular loop I (S1D-sense, 5′-TGA AGA TTG CCT ATC ACA TAC-3′) and nucleotides 926–949 in extracellular loop III (T4U-antisense, 5′-GGC TCT TAA TCA GAA AAT AAT GCA-3′) were used to amplify human genomic DNA. The 560-bp products were purified before fluorescence-based automated cycle sequencing was performed on an ABI 377 sequencer (ABI PRISMTM Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing-21M13 FS and M13REV FS Ready Reaction Kits). Kirsten sarcoma-transformed rat kidney epithelial cells (KNRK; American Tissue Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were selected, since they have previously been employed to generate PAR2-expressing cell lines (5Bohm S.K.

Semiconfluent KNRK cells in 60-mm Petri dishes were transfected using the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were subcloned in Geneticin (0.6 mg/ml)-containing medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% FCS, 100 μm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B), and clones were initially selected by their ability to produce a calcium signal in response to trypsin and the PAR2-selective peptide tc-NH2. To obtain permanent cell lines, cells expressing high levels of PAR2 were isolated by FACS using the B5 anti-PAR2 polyclonal rabbit antibody (10Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Renaux B. Mokashi S. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar, 36Corvera C.U. Dery O. McConalogue K. Gamp P. Thoma M. Al-Ani B. Caughey G.H. Hollenberg M.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 517: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). All cell lines were propagated in Geneticin-containing medium without the use of trypsin in 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The rat PAR2 cell line has been described elsewhere (10Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Renaux B. Mokashi S. Hollenberg M.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 753-760PubMed Google Scholar, 33Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Clones with matched expression, as assessed by FACS analysis, were selected for functional studies. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (as described previously (37Compton S.J. Cairns J.A. Holgate S.T. Walls A.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1939-1946PubMed Google Scholar)) was then performed using the primers S1D and T4U on the human wild-type and PAR2F240S cell lines, and the 560-bp products were sequenced to confirm the single nucleotide difference (T719to C719) between the two cell lines. The calcium cell-signaling assay was performed as described previously (33Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells at 90% confluence in 80-cm2 flasks (Life Technologies, Inc.) were rinsed with PBS, lifted with nonenzymatic cell dissociation fluid, and pelleted before resuspension in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, and 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone. To the cells, 10 μl of 2.5 mg/ml Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added prior to gentle shaking for 35 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed in PBS and resuspended in calcium assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, pH 7.4). Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer fluorescence spectrometer 650-10S, with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and emission recorded at 530 nm. Cell suspensions (2 ml of 3 × 105 cells/ml) in 4-ml cuvettes were stirred with a magnetic flea bar and maintained at 24 °C. To establish concentration-effect curves, the signal produced by the addition of a test agonist was measured as a percentage of the fluorescence peak height yielded by the addition of 2 μm calcium ionophore (A23187, Sigma). Human wild-type PAR2- or PAR2F240S-transfected cells were seeded in six-well culture plates at 100,000 cells/well in fresh medium and incubated for 24 h. Medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with PBS before the addition of 2 ml of low serum medium (0.2%). Following a 24-h incubation, test agents were introduced. The test agent trypsin, was added in the absence of serum for 1 h, before a final concentration of 0.2% FCS was added. At 72 h, cells were rinsed with PBS and harvested for counting with nonenzymatic cell dissociation fluid. Cells were counted on an improved Neubauer hemocytometer (American Optics, Buffalo, NY). Results were analyzed for statistical significance by the paired Student's t test, takingp < 0.05 as statistically significant. A comparison of the sequence obtained for the polymorphic receptor with the published sequence of human PAR2 (6Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Larsson A.K. Strombeck B. Sundelin J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) revealed a transition from a thymine to a cytosine at nucleotide position 719. Sequencing of genomic DNA from a selection of Caucasian individuals confirmed the existence of the mutation (Fig. 1,upper). Individuals homozygous for wild type PAR2 were identified by a single thymine residue at position 719 (Fig. 1,upper (a)), while individuals homozygous for polymorphic PAR2 were identified by the presence of a cytosine at residue 719 (Fig. 1, upper (b)). Finally, heterozygous individuals were identified by the presence of both a thymine and a cytosine at residue 719 (Fig. 1, upper(c)). This mutation is predicted to result in a mutant receptor (PAR2F240S) with an amino acid change from Phe240 to Ser240. The site of the mutation is approximately 6 amino acids from the fifth putative transmembrane domain, in ECL2 (Fig. 1, lower).Figure 3Calcium signaling in human and rat wild-type and PAR2F240S cell lines in response to TLIGRL-NH2 and tc-YGPKF-NH2.

The frequency of the homozygous S/S genotype was found to be relatively uncommon (Table I). The data were found to agree with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (F2 + 2FS + S2 = 1 where F2represents homozygote F/F frequency, S2 represents homozygote S/S frequency, and 2FS represents heterozygote F/S frequency), indicating that the two alleles of the PAR2 gene are segregated in a Mendelian manner.Table IDistribution of the PAR2 alleles in a normal Caucasian populationSubjects (n = 125)Genotype 240 F/F106 (84.8%) 240 F/S17 (13.6%) 240 S/S2 (1.6%)Allelic frequency Phe2400.916 Ser2400.084Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of genomic DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) were used to genotype 125 normal individuals for PAR2 alleles (nucleotide T719 (Phe240) and/or nucleotide C719 (Ser240)).

Allele and gene frequencies are shown. The concentration-effect curves for trypsin and several selective PAR2-APs are shown in Fig. 2. For the wild-type receptor (solid lines), trypsin was 3 orders of magnitude more potent than the PAR2-APs, SLIGKV-NH2, tc-LIGRLO-NH2, and SLIGRL-NH2. The relative rank order of potencies was as follows: trypsin >>>> tc-LIGRLO-NH2 ≥ SLIGRL-NH2 > SLIGKV-NH2, which is in keeping with a previous report (33Al-Ani B. Saifeddine M. Kawabata A. Hollenberg M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the wild type receptor, trypsin stimulated a detectable calcium elevation at 2 nm, reaching a near maximum response at 100 nm. The effective response to the PAR2-AP, tc-LIGRLO-NH2, was between 1 and 100 μm, for SLIGKV-NH2 from 5 to 200 μm, and for SLIGRL-NH2 from 2 to 100 μm (solid lines, Fig. 2 a–d, respectively). For the PAR2F240S receptor (dashed lines), the potencies of all the PAR2 agonists were significantly different from those for the wild-type receptor. Trypsin was nearly 4-fold less potent (Fig. 2 a and Table II), activating the PAR2F240S receptor from 5 to 500 nm. The parent tethered ligand peptide, SLIGKV-NH2, was also less potent in this system by over 2-fold, activating the PAR2F240S receptor from 10 to 500 μm (Fig. 2 b and Table II). However, in both the wild-type and PAR2F240S receptor systems, the maximal response to SLIGKV-NH2 appeared to be lower than the maximal response obtained with the other PAR2 agonists (∼50versus ∼60% relative to calcium ionophore). Strikingly, tc-LIGRLO-NH2 was 4-fold more potent in the PAR2F240S receptor (Fig. 2 c and Table II), activating PAR2F240S from 0.2 to 20 μmcompared with 1–50 μm in the wild-type receptor. The potency of SLIGRL-NH2 was reduced by a similar degree to that of SLIGKV-NH2 (∼2.5-fold), activating PAR2F240S from 5 to 200 μm (Fig. 2 and TableII). The relative order of potencies for these agonists in the PAR2F240S system, which differed quantitatively from those for the wild-type receptor, was as follows: trypsin ≫ tc-LIGRLO-NH2 ≫ SLIGRL-NH2 > SLIGKV-NH2.Table IIRatio (polymorphic/wild) of agonist potencies between the PAR2F240S and wild-type receptor systemsAgonistRelative receptor sensitivityHuman PAR2F240SRat PAR2F240SPAR-2 agonists SLIGKV-NH22.50ND tc-LIGRLO-NH20.250.29 SLIGRL-NH22.792.8 Trypsin (×103)3.651.7PAR-1 agonists Cit-NH21.24ND SFLLR-NH20.84ND TFLLR-NH20.140.29The activity of each agonist in the PAR2F240S receptor system was expressed relative to the activity of the same agonist in the wild-type receptor.

We have previously observed transient G1 growth arrest at term, re-activation of proliferation immediately after birth, and a gradual transition to the quiescent adult hepatocyte phenotype after postnatal day 4. We hypothesized that these changes in proliferation are due in part to growth inhibitory effects mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. p38 kinase activity measurements showed an inverse relationship with hepatocyte proliferation during the perinatal and postnatal transitions, whereas p38 content remained constant. Anisomycin activated the p38 pathway in fetal hepatocyte cultures while inducing growth inhibition that was sensitive to the p38 inhibitor, SB203580. Activation of p38 in these cultures, via transient transfection with a constitutively active form of its upstream kinase MKK6, also inhibited DNA synthesis as well as reducing cyclin D1 content. Transfection with inactive MKK6 did neither. Furthermore, MKK6-induced growth arrest was sensitive to SB203580. Finally, administration of SB203580 to near-term fetal rats in uteroabrogated the transient hepatocyte growth arrest that occurs at term.

In the rat, a burst of hepatocyte proliferation results in the tripling of liver mass over the last 3 days prior to term (1Greengard O. Federman M. Knox W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This is followed by a marked decrease in hepatocyte proliferation during the 1st postnatal week (2Gruppuso P.A. Awad M.

Although late gestation fetal hepatocytes are highly proliferative both in vivo and in culture (2Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the hepatocytes in adult liver are quiescent, with only 1 in 20,000 showing cell cycle activity. In addition to this fetal-to-adult transition, we have observed a period of temporary hepatocyte growth arrest that occurs just prior to parturition in the rat (2Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C.

This is followed by a brief period of synchronized hepatocyte proliferation in the immediate postnatal period and a subsequent transition to the quiescent adult rat hepatocyte phenotype beyond the 1st postnatal week. The mechanisms that regulate these developmental changes in hepatocyte proliferation have not been characterized. Our work was motivated by the assumption that the elucidation of these mechanisms would contribute to understanding the pathophysiology of liver injury and carcinogenesis. The present series of experiments was based on studies demonstrating that perinatal rat hepatocytes are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and that this cell cycle arrest coincides with a decline in cyclin D1 content. Based on evidence indicating that control of cyclin D1 abundance may be downstream from the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase pathway (4Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 in response to non-physiologic mediators such as H2O2, UV light, and x-rays and physiological mediators such as TGF-β and inflammatory cytokines (e.g.interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α) has been shown to cause a variety of cellular responses in vitro. These include the promotion of apoptosis in various cellular systems (6Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Recent studies utilizing transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative p38 or a constitutively active form of the p38-activating kinase MKK6, as well as mice lacking MKK3, have begun to establish the role of p38 in normal physiology.

However, the potential involvement of the p38 pathway in hepatocyte growth regulation and liver development remains unexplored. The components of the p38 MAP kinase pathway have been partially characterized. Proximal kinases involved in the activation of p38 include the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family members TAK1, ASK1, and MTK1 (19Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N.

Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Downstream effectors of p38 include MAPKAP kinase-2, Mnk1/2, and the transcription factors ATF2, Elk-1, CHOP, MEF2C, and CREB (22Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol.

In CCL39 cells overexpressing the p38 kinase MKK3 together with p38, a significant decrease in mitogen-induced cyclin D1 expression was observed in vitro using a cyclin D1-luciferase reporter construct (4Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible transcriptional mechanism for p38-mediated growth arrest. In addition, there is evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by p38 (28Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemans I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.Q. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3113) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that p38 could be involved in either transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of hepatic cyclin D1. The following studies were undertaken in order to establish a role for p38 in the regulation of hepatocyte proliferation through the perinatal and neonatal-to-adult transitions. Pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratory, Wilmington, MA) of known gestational age (day of conception designated as E0, preterm as E19, and term as E21) were used for all studies. Given the importance of precisely determining timing at the end of gestation, term animals were identified by frequent observation for onset of parturition. Cesarean sections were performed using pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg body weight, given by intraperitoneal injection). For postnatal studies, mothers were allowed to deliver spontaneously. Pups were reared with their mothers and weaned on postnatal day 21–22. Fetal rat hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion as described previously (3Curran T.R.J. Bahner R.I.J. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analyses (3Curran T.R.J. Bahner R.I.J. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that these preparations consist of ∼90% hepatocytes, with the remaining cell population representing a mixture of nonparenchymal cell types. This level of hepatocyte predominance persists for up to 72 h in culture under the defined, mitogen-free conditions used for all experiments. Hepatocytes were cultured on Falcon Primaria plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate. Cells became attached within 2 h in minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with nutrients and cofactors as described previously (3Curran T.R.J. Bahner R.I.J. Oh W. Gruppuso P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After cell attachment, all studies were done after maintaining the cultured hepatocytes for 18 h in defined (serum-free) and supplemented MEM. For preparation of hepatocyte lysates, cultured cells were rinsed twice with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then scraped into 2 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 10% glycerol, 144 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were sonicated at 4 °C (full microtip power, two times for 10 s; Ultrasonic Homogenizer 4710 Series, Cole-Parmer, Chicago) and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Where indicated, anisomycin and SB203580 hydrochloride (water-soluble form; catalogue number 559395, Calbiochem) were added directly to culture media to achieve the desired final concentrations. This was done without changing the media. For preparation of whole liver homogenates, the pooled livers from one litter were combined in 1 ml of cold immunoprecipitation homogenization buffer (without Tween 20) per 100 mg of tissue and homogenized for 10 strokes at 700 rpm using glass-Teflon homogenization vessels. Tween 20 was then added to a final concentration of 0.1%. Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, frozen immediately on dry ice, and stored at −70 °C. BrdUrd incorporation and detection was performed as described previously (2Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using reagents obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. BrdUrd was added directly to culture medium to achieve a final concentration of 10 μm. Cells were incubated in the presence of BrdUrd for 12 h and then fixed with 100% cold methanol for 20 min at −20 °C. Incubation with mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody followed the manufacturer's directions. Hepatocytes were cultured in serum-free supplemented MEM for 18 h prior to transfection. After this period, expression vectors (10 μg each) for MKK6 (22Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) and a farnesylated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-F; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were combined with 50 μl of GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA) and added to the culture medium. Hepatocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. This was followed by addition of 10% fetal calf serum. After an interval appropriate for specific experiments, cells were fixed in 100% cold methanol for 20 min at −20 °C. p38 kinase activity was determined in p38 immunoprecipitates of hepatocyte lysates and liver homogenates (23Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). The p38 polyclonal rabbit antibody used for all experiments was raised against a mouse GST-p38α fusion protein. The level of phosphorylation of the p38 substrate, recombinant GST-ATF-2, was determined after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by autoradiography. For immunodetection of p38 by Western blot analysis, liver proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The aforementioned p38 antibody was used to assess total p38 content. A phospho-specific p38 rabbit polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was also used as an indirect indicator of p38 activation state. Detection employed chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was performed as described previously (2Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For cyclin D1 immunohistochemistry, formalin-fixed liver sections (6 μm) were covered with 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and heat-treated at 95 °C twice for 5 min. Sections were treated for 15 min at room temperature with avidin/biotin blocking solutions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and then with 5% normal horse serum in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sections were then incubated with 20 μg/ml cyclin D1 primary antibody (sc-8396; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by horse anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 dilution; Vector Laboratories). Signal was detected by incubation with fluorescein-streptavidin conjugate (Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in order to count the total number of nuclei. For in vivoexperiments aimed at examining the role of p38, the p38 inhibitor SB203580-HCl was administered to fetuses in situ by intraperitoneal injection. An initial laparotomy was performed on E20.5 timed pregnant rats, and fetuses were exteriorized in uterounder sterile conditions. Alternate fetuses were given intraperitoneal injections of either SB203580 (50 μg in 50 μl of normal saline) or 50 μl of saline vehicle as control. The fetuses were replaced; the laparotomy incision was closed, and gestation was allowed to continue for 24 h. At that time, Cesarean section was performed, and fetal livers were harvested, formalin-fixed, and sectioned for immunohistochemical analysis. For kinase assays, the level of substrate phosphorylation was determined by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Where noted, automated image analysis was used to quantify immunohistochemistry results. Images were acquired, and positive cells were counted using a SIT66 camera (Dage-MPIMTI, Michigan City, IN) and Perceptics Frame Grabber with Biovision software (Perceptics Corp., Knoxville, TN). In all cases, analyses were done with the observer unaware of the experimental conditions. To examine the possible involvement of p38 in mediating developmental changes in hepatocyte proliferation, p38 activity was determined in whole liver homogenates derived from perinatal and adult rat livers (Fig. 1). p38 activity was highest in livers in which hepatocyte proliferation was lowest (term (E21) and mature (28-day-old and 125–150-g adult) rats). Activity was lowest in preterm and immediate postnatal liver samples in which there is significant hepatocyte proliferation. This pattern of p38 activity was corroborated by a Western immunoblot using phospho-specific anti-p38 (not shown). p38 protein content did not change appreciably in liver throughout the developmental period studied, as determined by Western immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1).Figure 1p38 kinase activity in whole liver homogenates.

Ad, adult.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to study the effect of p38 activation in cultured hepatocytes on growth in vitro, the level of basal p38 activity in cultured fetal hepatocytes was measured (Fig. 2 A). p38 activity was lower in freshly isolated preterm (E19) hepatocytes than in term (E21) hepatocytes, consistent with the in vivo data. In preterm hepatocytes there was a peak of activity immediately after plating, possibly associated with the stress of isolation and/or the temporary growth arrest required for contact and adherence to the substratum. In order to assess the significance of this spontaneous activation of p38, we sought to activate maximally the pathway in cultured fetal hepatocytes. We accomplished this using anisomycin. Anisomycin is a protein synthesis inhibitor that, even at concentrations that are subinhibitory for protein synthesis (29Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Kracht M. Sachsenmaier C. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), potently activates the stress-activated protein kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 (30Sanchez I. Hughes R.T.

Results (Fig. 2 B) showed that a single dose of 0.2 μm anisomycin administered to cultured fetal hepatocytes resulted in maximal activation of p38 within 30 min. Activity decreased rapidly and was back to base line within 4 h. A higher dose of anisomycin (20 μm) resulted in a similar maximum level of p38 activation, although activation was sustained for at least 4 h. Of note, the basal activity that we observed in E19 hepatocytes was only 10–20% of the activity attained within 30 min of exposure to anisomycin at two concentrations, 0.2 or 20 μm (Fig. 2 B). Since we had confirmed potent p38 activation by anisomycin in our cultures, we tested the hypothesis that anisomycin-mediated growth arrest in fetal hepatocytes is mediated, at least in part, by p38 activation. Cultured E19 hepatocytes were exposed to anisomycin at the lower concentration of 0.2 μm in order to examine the effect of p38 activation on proliferation. Frequency of anisomycin exposure was varied and combined with SB203580 pretreatment (Fig. 3 A). Hepatocytes were monitored for changes in proliferation by calculating nuclear labeling indices (the percentage of cells incorporating BrdUrd over a 12-h period in culture). Changes in cellular viability were assessed by gross morphology. Both anisomycin treatment regimens resulted in similarly reduced rates of hepatocyte proliferation compared with controls (Fig. 3 B). There was no morphological evidence of hepatocyte apoptosis. The effect of the specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (33Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 34Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), was examined as an indicator of the proportion of anisomycin-mediated growth inhibition that could be attributed to p38 activation. Exposure to 10 μm SB203580 in both experimental designs reversed the anisomycin-induced growth arrest by half. Treatment with SB203580 alone did not significantly affect hepatocyte proliferation. Given that the attenuation of anisomycin-mediated growth arrest by SB203580 was partial and that anisomycin action probably occurs through multiple pathways, we took an alternative approach so that we might activate p38 in cultured hepatocytes with greater specificity than could be obtained with pharmacologic agents. This approach employed transient transfection of cultured fetal hepatocytes with expression vectors for constitutively active and inactive forms of an upstream, p38-activating kinase. Because MKK6 activates p38 more efficiently than MKK3 (22Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), vectors for the former were used. Two forms of MKK6 were co-transfected with EGFP-F into cultures of proliferating E19 fetal hepatocytes. MKK6(Glu) is a constitutively active MKK6 mutant that has two Glu residues replacing activating phosphorylation sites. MKK6(Ala) is inactive secondary to a mutation (alanine for lysine in position 82) in the ATP-binding site. The day following co-transfection, cells were exposed to BrdUrd for 12 h. Nuclear labeling indices were determined as the proportions of transfected cells (EGFP-F-positive) that were BrdUrd-positive. Nuclear labeling indices of hepatocytes that were transfected with MKK6(Ala) or EGFP-F alone approximated 50% (Fig. 4). In contrast, there was a marked reduction in the number of proliferative hepatocytes in the samples transfected with the constitutively active MKK6(Glu) mutant. There was no apparent difference in morphology between the different transfection conditions. Taken together with the results of the anisomycin experiments, these results were interpreted as indicating that p38 activation led to fetal hepatocyte growth arrest in vitro. In an additional experiment (Fig. 5), we were able to demonstrate that the inhibition of cell proliferation secondary to transient transfection with MKK6(Glu) was completely reversed by the addition of SB203580 at the time of transfection. The complete reversal of MKK6-mediated growth arrest by SB203580 indicates that, while p38 activation accounts for a significant proportion of anisomycin-mediated growth arrest, anisomycin also attenuates proliferation through other pathways. Presumably, these include the inhibition of protein synthesis that is considered the primary effect of this agent (29Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Kracht M. Sachsenmaier C. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although anisomycin also activates the JNK pathway, this is unlikely to account for fetal hepatocyte growth arrest in vitro given that this pathway is constitutively active in late gestation fetal hepatocytes in vivo (35Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1261-1269PubMed Google Scholar). In order to assess the effect of p38 activation on cyclin D1 content in hepatocytes, we performed immunocytochemistry for cyclin D1 on hepatocytes transfected with the active and inactive forms of MKK6. Results were similar to those obtained using BrdUrd incorporation. Cyclin D1 staining was prominent in approximately 50% of hepatocytes transfected with MKK6(Ala) plus EGFP-F or with EGFP-F alone (Fig. 6). Transfection with MKK6(Glu) resulted in a marked decrease in cyclin D1 staining that paralleled those results obtained using BrdUrd incorporation as an index of cell proliferation. In order to test whether p38 activation is involved in perinatal hepatocyte growth arrest in vivo, SB203580 was administered to fetal rats in situ. Saline vehicle or SB203580 were injected into alternate E20.5 fetuses in utero. Gestation was allowed to continue for another 24 h. Cesarean section was performed just prior to parturition (E21.5). Fetal livers were harvested, sectioned, and analyzed for PCNA staining (Fig. 7). Results obtained by image analysis and automated counting were confirmed by direct observation. Livers from saline-injected or uninjected term fetuses contained no or very few PCNA-positive cells. This is consistent with our previous findings (2Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, each of the SB203580-injected animals showed a clear increase in the number of PCNA-positive hepatocytes, ranging from 9 to 20% of all cells. Morphological inspection of the resulting stained sections confirmed that the PCNA-positive cells present in SB203580-injected fetuses were indeed hepatocytes. These results were interpreted as supporting an in vivo role for p38 activation in mediating the transient hepatocyte growth arrest seen in term liver. In order to understand the physiology of hepatocyte growth regulation, it will be important to identify the proximal and distal factors that participate in the p38 signaling pathway during development. Several physiological mediators have been described to activate p38 in vitro including TGF-β, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β), and oxidative stress. TGF-β has been postulated to be an activator for p38 via the MAPKKK family member TAK1 and its co-activator TAB1 (12Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Waller R.J. Sarsfield S. Lee J.C. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 36Wilhelm D. Bender K. Knebel A. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 mRNA levels have been demonstrated to be at peak levels during late gestation in liver development (37Fausto N. Mead J.E. Gruppuso P.A. Braun L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 593: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). p38 has also been shown to be regulated by changes in the reduction-oxidation status of cells in vitro (38Mendelson K.G. Contois L.R. Tevosian S.G. Davis R.J. Paulson K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Differences in the transmembrane potential and oxidative status of hepatocytes have been described in fetal versus adult liver in the mouse (39Chapman L.M. Wondergem R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, redox changes occurring at the end of gestation may be involved in the activation of hepatic p38 in the term rat fetus. Of note, CCl4-induced metabolic oxidative stress resulted in activation of JNK but inactivation of p38 in adult liver (38Mendelson K.G. Contois L.R. Tevosian S.G. Davis R.J. Paulson K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This may indicate that the mechanisms for transient hepatic p38 activation at term and tonic activation in the adult differ. The cyclin D1 promoter may also be a downstream target for p38 activity, but the mechanism of this interaction has not been characterized (4Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). However, our own data suggest that up-regulation of cyclin D1 in fetal hepatocytes is post-transcriptional (40Awad M.M. Gruppuso P.A. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that p38-mediated regulation of cyclin D1 abundance involves one or more post-transcriptional mechanisms. Cyclin D1 has been demonstrated to be a target of direct phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and proteolysis (41Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF-4E, has been implicated in cell cycle control by binding to and facilitating the translation of the cyclin D1 message (42Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris K.A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 43Rosenwald I.B. Kaspar R. Rousseau D. Gehrke L. Leboulch P. Chen J.J. Schmidt E.V. Sonenberg N. London I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21176-21180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These represent two potential pathways whereby p38 activation might modulate hepatocyte cyclin D1 content. Perhaps the most unexpected result of the present studies is the finding that in vivo inhibition of p38 resulting from direct administration of SB203580 was sufficient to stimulate hepatocyte cell cycle activity at term. These results are consistent with our earlier studies also indicating that the temporary hepatocyte growth arrest that occurs at the end of gestation is a result of growth inhibition, not diminished growth stimulation (2Gruppuso P.A. Awad M. Bienieki T.C. Boylan J.M. Fernando S. Faris R.A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 562-568Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We had arrived at this conclusion based on the finding that term hepatocytes, once isolated and cultured under defined conditions, spontaneously entered the cell cycle in a synchronous manner without growth factor stimulation. This is also consistent with findings indicating that, although activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway may be required for accumulation of cyclin D in growth-stimulated adult hepatocytes (44Talarmin H. Rescan C. Cariou S. Glaise D. Zanninelli G. Bilodeau M. Loyer P. Guguen G.C. Baffet G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), this pathway is uncoupled and inactive in late gestation fetal liver (45Boylan J.M. Gruppuso P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3784-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, our results indirectly support the conclusion that the high level of p38 activity in adult liver represents a tonic growth inhibitory influence. Thus, the regulation of p38 and its role in hepatocyte cell cycle regulation should be considered in studies aimed at understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of liver growth, carcinogenesis, and response to injury. We appreciate the assistance provided by Theresa Bienieki in the performance of the animal and cell culture experiments."

Although PLC-β deactivation may contribute to the transient nature of this response, the mechanisms governing PLC-β deactivation are poorly characterized. We investigated the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in the termination of PLC-β activation induced by endogenous P2Y2 purinergic receptors and transfected M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Activation of P2Y2 receptors causes Gαq/11 to associate with PLC-β3, whereas M3mAChR activation causes Gαq/11 to associate with both PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 in these cells. Phosphorylation of PLC-β3, but not PLC-β1, is induced by activating either P2Y2receptors or M3 mAChR. We demonstrate that PKC rather than protein kinase A mediates the G protein-coupled receptor-induced phosphorylation of PLC-β3. The PKC-mediated phosphorylation of PLC-β3 diminishes the interaction of Gαq/11 with PLC-β3, thereby contributing to the termination PLC-β3 activity. These findings indicate that the distinct temporal profiles of PLC activation by P2Y2 receptors and mAChR may arise from the differential activation of PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 by the receptors, coupled with a selective PKC-mediated negative feedback mechanism that targets PLC-β3 but not PLC-β1.

Many cell surface receptors activate PLC-β, including a significant proportion of the members of the super family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (2Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). GPCRs activate four isozymes of PLC-β (β1-β4) encoded by different genes (reviewed in Refs. 3Williams R.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Subsequent deactivation of PLC-β can also occur rapidly, causing PLC-β activity to subside within 20–90 s after the activation of some GPCRs (7Plevin R. MacNulty E.E. Palmer S. Wakelam M.J. Biochem.

However, PLC-β deactivation sometimes occurs much more slowly, resulting in sustained PLC-β activity even 10–30 min after GPCR activation (6Los G.V. Artemenko I.P. Hokin L.E.

The mechanism of PLC-β activation is fairly well characterized and involves the interaction of activated Gαq/11 proteins with PLC-β (2Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

In contrast, the mechanisms contributing to PLC-β deactivation are complex and not well understood. Multiple events may contribute to the rapid termination of PLC-β activity after GPCR activation. The phosphorylation and internalization of activated GPCRs may diminish GPCR-mediated signaling to PLC-β, causing PLC-β activity to subside (12Tobin A.B. Pharmacol.

Another proposed mechanism for PLC-β deactivation is the phosphorylation of PLC-β itself (17Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Strassheim D. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of PLC-β3 may limit PLC-β3 activity induced by platelet-activating factor in phagocytes (17Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and by the activation of opioid receptors in neuroblastoma cells (18Strassheim D. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). These findings support the previously proposed model that PKC acts in a negative feedback loop to limit PLC-β activity (4Nishizuka, Y. (1995) FASEB, J , 484–496.Google Scholar, 17Ali H. Fisher I.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that protein kinase A (PKA) can also phosphorylate PLC-β3 and limit its activity (19Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, this latter reported mechanism represents cross-regulation from adenylyl cyclase to PLC signaling systems and not classic negative feedback. Such cross-regulation is an unlikely mechanism for the termination of GPCR-activated PLC activity, because most Gαq/11-coupled GPCRs do not activate adenylyl cyclase. Thus, it is not clear whether PKC or PKA plays a more important role in agonist-induced phosphorylation of PLC-β. Additionally, it has not been determined how PLC-β phosphorylation may limit PLC-β activity. PKC activation diminishes GPCR-mediated IP3 generation and Ca2+ mobilization in many cell types (9Williams C. Lennon V. J. Biol.

However, PKC may act on proteins other than PLC-β to limit IP3 generation and Ca2+ mobilization after GPCR stimulation. For example, it has been reported that PKC-mediated phosphorylation may directly inhibit the activities of certain GPCRs (22Vazquez-Prado J. Medina L.C. Romero-Avila M.T. Gonzalez-Espinsoa C.

These potentially numerous targets for PKC-mediated inhibition make it difficult to determine unambiguously where PKC acts to limit PLC-β activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of PKC in the poorly characterized termination of GPCR-stimulated PLC activity. We investigated PLC-β activity regulated by endogenous P2Y2purinergic receptors (25Dickenson J.M. Blank J.L. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and transfected M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) (11Strassheim D. May L.G. Varker K.A. Puhl H.L. Phelps S.H.

It was previously reported that P2Y2receptors, like most GPCRs, transiently activate PLC-β (25Dickenson J.M. Blank J.L. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas M3 mAChR activate PLC-β for periods longer than 10 min (6Los G.V. Artemenko I.P. Hokin L.E.

We found that P2Y2 receptors functionally couple only to PLC-β3, whereas M3 mAChR functionally couple to both PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 in CHO cells. Activating P2Y2 receptors or M3 mAChR induces the phosphorylation of PLC-β3, but not PLC-β1, in these cells. We demonstrate that PKC, rather than PKA, mediates the GPCR-induced phosphorylation of PLC-β3. Thus, PLC-β3 phosphorylation does not result from cross-regulation by adenylyl cyclase acting on PLC signaling. Our results indicate that PKC participates in a negative feedback loop to inhibit the interaction of Gαq/11 with PLC-β3, limiting the duration of PLC-β3 activity. This PKC-mediated negative regulation of PLC-β3, coupled with the differential activation of PLC-β1 and -β3 by M3 mAChR and P2Y2 receptors, offers a mechanism for the distinct temporal profiles of PLC activation by these two receptors. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Gαq/11, PLC-β1, or PLC-β3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies, ECL reagents and [35S]GTPγS (specific activity, 1030 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [32P]Orthophosphate (specific activity, 74 Ci/mmol) and [35S]cysteine/methionine (specific activity, 1200 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). The fluorescent dye Fura-2 AM and pluronic were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] was obtained from Pierce. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted in the text. CHO-K1 sublines stably transfected with the M3 subtype of human mAChR were maintained in complete medium consisting of Ham's F-12 medium (Cellgro Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 5% calf bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), penicillin (20 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (20 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at densities that promoted exponential proliferation. For 35S labeling, cells were incubated for 12 h in cysteine- and methionine-free Ham's F-12 medium containing 20% normal Ham's F-12 medium and 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine, from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). For32P labeling, cells were incubated for 90 min in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 30 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid. Labeled cells were challenged with agonists for various times and subsequently lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 40 mmKH2PO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 15% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was rotated (90 min, 4 °C) with PLC-β1 or -β3 antibodies and protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.). After washing three times in lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted with sample buffer (30 min, 4 °C), subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes, and subjected to autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation of PLC-β1 or PLC-β3 with Gαq has been described previously (26Strassheim D. Shafer S.H Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2730-2736PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells were incubated for 2 h in serum-free medium and exposed to agonists for 1 min in the presence of 1 mmdithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] to induce protein cross-linking and subsequently lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer described above. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was rotated (90 min, 4 °C) with Gαq/llantibody and protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.). After washing three times in lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted with sample buffer (30 min, 4 °C), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. The PVDF membranes were blocked and probed by ECL-Western blotting as described below using antibodies to Gαq/ll, PLC-β1, or PLC-β3. Cells were lysed by periodic agitation for 15 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml leupeptin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mmsodium PPi, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). After centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), the supernatants were diluted with lysis buffer to equal protein concentrations and boiled for 5 min with sample buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). Aliquots containing equal protein concentrations were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 5% stacking gel and a 10% separating gel and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. The blocked PVDF membranes were incubated with antibodies to PLC-β1 or PLC-β3, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies. Bound antibody was visualized by ECL and quantified by densitometry. Binding of [35S]GTPγS to Gαq/11 was determined by modification of a method described previously (26Strassheim D. Shafer S.H Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2730-2736PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μm GDP, 150 nmGTPγS, pH 7.4), and subjected to a −70 °C freeze/thaw cycle to disrupt cell membranes. The freeze/thawed cells were incubated for 15 min (37 °C), with 30 nm [35S]GTPγS in the absence or presence of agonists for 10 min (37 °C). The samples were solubilized by rocking in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GDP, 100 μm GTP, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4). The samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatants were incubated (1.5 h, 4 °C) with Gαq/ll antibody and protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitates bound to protein A-agarose were washed two times in lysis buffer, resuspended in distilled water, and transferred to scintillation vials containing Ultima-Gold scintillation fluid (Packard Bioscience). The amounts of [35S]GTPγS bound to the immunoprecipitated Gαq/ll were determined by liquid scintillation counting using an LS-6000 β-counter. CHO cells were labeled for 24 h in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 5 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in reaction buffer (described above), and subjected to a −70 °C freeze/thaw cycle to disrupt cell membranes. Membranes were challenged with GTPγS for 10 min, 37 °C, after which the supernatant was removed for determination of released inositol phosphates by liquid scintillation counting as described previously (9Williams C.

Arachidonic acid release was measured as an indictor of phospholipase A2activity as described previously (28May L.G. Johnson S. Krebs S. Newman A. Aronstam R.S. Cell. Signaling. 1999; 11: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CHO cells were plated in 24-well culture plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. After incubation for 48 h, the medium was supplemented with 0.2 mCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid, and the cells were incubated overnight. The cells were rinsed three times in Ham's F-12 medium, followed by a 1-h incubation in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were exposed to carbachol for 15 min, and an aliquot of the culture supernatant was subjected to liquid scintillation counting to determine [3H]arachidonic acid content. Cells attached to glass coverslips were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.28 mg/ml probenecid, 0.03% pluronic F127, and 2 μg/ml FURA-2 AM in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. The cells were washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.28 mg/ml probenecid. The ratio of intracellular Fura-2 fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm was measured with a CMX Scanning Cation Microilluminator (Instruments, S. A., Edison, NJ). Ratios were converted to intracellular Ca2+ concentrations as described previously (9Williams C. Lennon V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1443-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Strassheim D. Shafer S.H Phelps S.H. Williams C.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2730-2736PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which PLC isoforms are expressed by CHO-m3 cells, PLC-β1 and -β3 were immunoprecipitated from 35S-labeled CHO cells, submitted to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1 A). By this method we found that significant levels of PLC-β1 and -β3 are expressed by these cells. In contrast, neither PLC-β2 nor -β4 could be detected in immunoprecipitates or immunoblots of the CHO-m3 cells (Fig. 1 B). Previous studies indicate that GPCR activation can induce phosphorylation of PLC-β3 isoforms (17Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

We investigated this phenomenon by immunoprecipitating PLC-β1 and -β3 from32P-labeled CHO-m3 cells exposed to carbachol or ATP. Both of these agonists induced a rapid and dose-dependent phosphorylation of PLC-β3 (Figs. 2 and3) but not PLC-β1 (Fig. 3). Carbachol and ATP typically stimulated 4-fold and 3-fold increases in PLC-β3 phosphorylation above basal levels, respectively. These results indicate that PLC-β1 and -β3 are regulated differently by GPCR activation in these cells.Figure 3PLC-β1 is not detectably phosphorylated by the activation of M3 mAChR or P2Y2 receptors in CHO cells. PLC-β1 or PLC-β3 was immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled CHO cells that were incubated with 10 μm carbachol, 10 μm ATP, or 50 nm PMA for the indicated times. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (top) or ECL-Western blotting using antibodies to PLC-β1 or PLC-β3, as indicated (bottom). Results are representative of three independent experiments that produced similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Confusion exists regarding the kinases mediating the GPCR-stimulated phosphorylation of PLC-β. Several studies have indicated roles for both PKC (17Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11706-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Strassheim D. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar) and PKA (19Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is more likely that PKC, rather than PKA, acts in a classical negative feedback loop to mediate rapid PLC phosphorylation and deactivation. The involvement of PKA may indicate cross-regulation, which is unlikely to be a mechanism for rapid PLC phosphorylation and deactivation, because Gαq/11-coupled receptors do not generally activate adenylyl cyclase. The ability of PKA to mediate agonist-induced phosphorylation of PLC-β3 was tested using the highly specific PKA antagonist, Rp-CAMPS. Concentrations of Rp-CAMPS well above those known to completely block PKA activation (28May L.G. Johnson S. Krebs S. Newman A. Aronstam R.S. Cell. Signaling. 1999; 11: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Adamson D.L. Harding S.E. Basic. Res. Cardiol. 2000; 95: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) had no effect on the carbachol-induced phosphorylation of PLC-β3 at (Fig. 4). This finding indicates that PKA does not participate in PLC-β3 phosphorylation induced by the M3 mAChR. The inability of PKA to mediate carbachol-induced PLC-β3 phosphorylation is not due to an inability of PKA to phosphorylate PLC-β3, because activation of PKA with forskolin induces PLC-β3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). In contrast to the effects of inactivating PKA, inactivation of PKC with the specific antagonist BIM significantly inhibited the carbachol- or ATP-induced phosphorylation of PLC-β3 (Fig. 4 A). This finding indicates that PKC participates in the agonist-induced phosphorylation of PLC-β3. Further evidence that PKC mediates PLC-β3 phosphorylation is provided by our finding that PLC-β3 is phosphorylated when PKC is directly activated by PMA (Figs. 3 and 4). PMA typically increased PLC-β3 phosphorylation 3–4-fold above basal levels. Interestingly, activation of PKC does not induce the phosphorylation of PLC-β1 (Fig. 4 B). This finding suggests that the lack of agonist-induced phosphorylation of PLC-β1 is due to an inability of PLC-β1 to serve as a substrate for PKC-mediated phosphorylation in these cells. The mechanism by which PKC inhibits PLC-β is poorly characterized. We found that treatment with PMA diminishes GTPγS-stimulated inositol polyphosphate generation in the CHO-m3 cells (Fig. 5). This result indicates that PKC stimulation diminishes the ability of GTPγS to activate PLC-β. This event may occur because PKC stimulation diminishes the ability of activated Gαq/11 proteins to associate with PLC-β. To investigate this possibility, we determined whether PKC stimulation alters the co-precipitation of PLC-β with Gαq/11 in agonist-treated cells (Fig. 6). Carbachol induces Gαq/11 to associate with PLC-β1 (Fig. 6 A, lane 3) and PLC-β3 (Fig. 6 B,lane 3). Treatment with PMA completely abolishes the carbachol-induced association of Gαq/11 with PLC-β3 (Fig. 6 B, lane 6). This result suggests that the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of PLC-β3 diminishes the interaction of Gαq/11 with the phospholipase. This response is not restricted to signaling by the muscarinic receptor, because treatment with PMA also diminishes the ATP-induced association of Gαq/11 with PLC-β3 (Fig. 6 B,lane 5). Treatment with PMA does not alter the agonist-induced association of Gαq/11 with PLC-β1 (Fig. 6 A, lane 6), consistent with our finding that PMA has no effect on PLC-β1 phosphorylation.Figure 6PKC activation inhibits the GPCR-induced association of Gαq/11 with PLC-β3 but not with PLC-β1. CHO cells were incubated in the absence (lanes 1–3) or presence (lanes 4–6) of 50 nm PMA for 15 min and then exposed to 10 μm ATP (lanes 2 and 5) or 10 μm carbachol (lanes 3 and 6) for 10 min. Gαq/11 was immunoprecipitated from the cells after protein cross-linking with dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] and subjected to ECL-Western blotting using antibodies to PLC-β1 (A), PLC-β3 (B), or Gαq/11(A and B). Similar results were obtained in two other independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether PKC activation alters other aspects of receptor signaling, the effects of PMA on the agonist-induced activation of Gαq/11 were investigated. Activation of P2Y2receptors stimulates an approximately 500% increase in Gαq/11 activation, as indicated by the binding of [35S]GTPγS to Gαq/11 (Fig. 7 A). This response is unaffected by pretreatment with PMA (Fig. 7 A). Similarly, the M3 mAChR-stimulated increase in Gαq/11activation is unaffected by PMA pretreatment (Fig. 7 A). These findings indicate that the GPCR-dependent activation of Gαq/11 is intact in PMA-treated cells. Consistent with this result, we found that PMA treatment actually enhances the ability of the muscarinic receptor to activate phospholipase A2, as indicated by arachidonic acid release (Fig. 7 B). The preceding results indicate that the GPCR-mediated activation of PKC stimulates PLC-β3 phosphorylation, resulting in reduced PLC-β3 activity because of diminished interactions of the phosphorylated PLC-β3 with Gαq/11. This model predicts that the activation of PLC-β3 by GPCR should be enhanced when PKC activity is inhibited and diminished when PKC activity is stimulated. To test this prediction, we measured the effects of pharmacologically altering PKC activity on GPCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, which is an indicator of PLC-β activity. We found that inactivation of PKC with BIM enhances Ca2+ mobilization induced by ATP (Fig. 8 A) and carbachol (Fig. 8 B). Conversely, activation of PKC with PMA diminishes Ca2+ mobilization induced by these agonists (Fig. 8). These findings support the model that the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of PLC-β3 diminishes the activity of the phospholipase. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the involvement of PLC-β phosphorylation in the termination of GPCR-dependent PLC activation. Activation of PLC-β by P2Y2 receptors and M3 mAChR was investigated because these GPCRs are known to stimulate transient and sustained PLC-β activity, respectively. Our results indicate that activation of these receptors induces the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of PLC-β3. This phosphorylation event may deactivate PLC-β3 by inhibiting the association of Gαq/11 with the phospholipase. In contrast, PLC-β1 is not phosphorylated by PKC and thus is not deactivated by this mechanism. Our results suggest that the activation of PLC-β1 by M3 mAChR, but not by P2Y2receptors, may contribute to the sustained PLC-β activity induced by M3 mAChR activation. This model is depicted in Fig. 9. The activation of PLC-β by GPCRs typically surges and declines rapidly (6Los G.V. Artemenko I.P. Hokin L.E. Biochem, J. 1995; 311: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Plevin R. MacNulty E.E. Palmer S. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Willars G.B. McArdel C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The GPCR-induced activation of PLC-β is usually detectable in just a few seconds and frequently peaks around 10–20 s before falling either to the base line or to a plateau level above the base line. These changes in PLC-β activity are mirrored by similar changes in [Ca2+]i concentration. Negative feedback inhibition of PLC-β by PKC is one mechanism that has been proposed for the rapid termination of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and [Ca2+]imobilization (4Nishizuka, Y. (1995) FASEB, J , 484–496.Google Scholar, 17Ali H. Fisher I. Haribabu B. Richardson R.M. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

However, investigations addressing the effects of PKC activation on the GPCR-activated PLC-β cascade have been limited by the inability to conclusively pinpoint the site of PKC action. Because of the large number and complexity of components involved, PKC could act at many sites in the GPCR signaling pathway to limit PLC-β activity. Direct activation of PKC with PMA is known to induce the phosphorylation of M3 mAChR, with undetermined effects on M3 mAChR function (12Tobin A.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This finding, along with demonstrations that some other GPCRs can be phosphorylated by PKC (22Vazquez-Prado J. Medina L.C.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5591-5599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), led to the speculation that PKC activation inhibits events at the receptor level. However, we found that activation of PKC with PMA does not alter the ability of M3 mAChR or P2Y2receptors to activate Gαq/11. This result indicates that PKC inhibits a post-receptor event. Consistent with this conclusion, we found that PKC activation inhibits IP3 generation that is induced by directly activating G proteins with GTPγS, without involving GPCRs. These findings indicate that PKC inhibits the GPCR signaling cascade only at a point after the activation of Gαq/11. Our studies show that PKC activation induces the phosphorylation of PLC-β3 and diminishes the ability of PLC-β3 to interact with Gαq/11. In contrast, PKC activation does not induce the phosphorylation of PLC-β1, nor does it affect the ability of PLC-β1 to associate with Gαq/11. These findings suggest that PKC inhibits PLC-β3 activity by phosphorylating PLC-β3 and diminishing the ability of PLC-β3 to interact with Gαq/11. Although PKC activation may inhibit other events following PLC-β activation, our results indicate that the PKC-mediated inhibition of Gαq/11 and PLC-β3 interactions is one way that the GPCR signaling cascade can be deactivated. It is intriguing that PKC activation induces phosphorylation of PLC-β3 but not PLC-β1. The reason for the lack of PLC-β1 phosphorylation is unknown. It is unlikely that any differences in the intracellular compartmentalization of PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 contribute to their different phosphorylation profiles in CHO-m3 cells, because PMA probably has equal access to different intracellular sites. It is conceivable that PLC-β1, but not PLC-β3, is associated intracellularly with protein partners that protect it from PKC-mediated phosphorylation, although evidence for this possibility is lacking. Activation of PKA, rather than PKC, has been found to induce PLC-β3 phosphorylation in some systems (19Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLC-β3 would represent cross-regulation between GPCRs that signal through adenylyl cyclase- and PLC-β-mediated pathways and not negative feedback control. This distinction is critical because PKC-mediated negative feedback can be a mechanism for the termination of PLC activity. In contrast, PKA-mediated cross-regulation is unlikely to be a mechanism for the termination of PLC activity because Gαq/11-coupled GPCRs do not generally activate adenylyl cyclase. We demonstrated that PLC-β3 phosphorylation induced by P2Y2 receptors or M3 mAChR is not mediated by the action of PKA nor by an increase in cAMP. Agents that elevate cAMP do not affect PLC-β activation by these receptors. Similarly, it was previously reported that signaling by the platelet-activating factor receptor, which activates PLC-β via Gαq/11 and induces PLC-β3 phosphorylation, is insensitive to the action of forskolin or other PKA-activating agents (30Ali H. Sozzani S. Fischer I. Barr A.J. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11012-11016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, we did find that agents that increase cAMP can stimulate modest increases in PLC-β3 phosphorylation (typically 1.5-fold). It is possible that PKA regulates PLC-β activity only when PLC-β is activated by specific GPCR-mediated signals that differ from those generated by M3 mAChR or P2Y2 receptor stimulation in CHO cells. This possibility is supported by a previous report that PKA activation alters signaling by the formyl peptide receptor (30Ali H. Sozzani S. Fischer I. Barr A.J. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11012-11016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which activates PLC-β via Gαi rather than via Gαq/11. The differential coupling of M3 mAChR and P2Y2receptors to PLC-β1 and PLC-β3 was somewhat surprising. Whereas the stimulation of M3 mAChR induced the interaction of Gαq/11 with PLC-β1 and PLC-β3, the stimulation of P2Y2 receptors only induced the interaction of Gαq/11 with PLC-β3. These differences may occur because greater levels of Gαq/11 are activated by stimulating M3 mAChR than by stimulating P2Y2 receptors in these cells. Stimulation of P2Y2 receptors may not activate enough Gαq/11 to allow the detectable association of PLC-β1 with Gαq/11 in our assays. Alternatively, it is possible that PLC-β1 is located in unique intracellular sites that make it more susceptible to activation by M3 mAChR than by P2Y2 receptors. Our results suggest an explanation for the ability of the M3 mAChR to induce sustained PLC-β activation. Sustained PLC-β activity is induced by stimulating endogenous M3mAChR in cultured neuronal and lung cancer cell lines (6Los G.V. Artemenko I.P. Hokin L.E.

Instead, our results suggest that sustained PLC-β activation may be induced by M3 mAChR because these receptors activate PLC-β1, which is not susceptible to PKC-dependent inhibition. In contrast, only transient PLC-β activation may be induced by P2Y2 receptors because these receptors activate only PLC-β3, which is susceptible to PKC-mediated inhibition. We found that inactivation of PKC with BIM converts P2Y2receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i mobilization from a transient event to a sustained event. According to our model, treatment with BIM diminishes the PKC-mediated inhibition of PLC-β3, resulting in prolonged activation of PLC-β3 and sustained [Ca2+]i mobilization after P2Y2receptor activation. In addition to this PKC-mediated regulation of PLC-β, other negative and positive feedback events undoubtedly contribute to the different abilities of the M3 mAChR and P2Y2 receptor to regulate PLC-β activity. However, the activation of specific PLC-β isoforms that have different susceptibilities to PKC-mediated inhibition provides an intriguing mechanism for the temporal regulation of PLC-β activity by GPCRs.

https://openalex.org/W2080954430,"To examine the relationship between mitochondrial energy coupling in skeletal muscle and change in uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) expression during the transition from the fed to fasted state, we used a novel noninvasive31P/13C NMR spectroscopic approach to measure the degree of mitochondrial energy coupling in the hind limb muscles of awake rats before and after a 48-h fast. Compared with fed levels, UCP3 mRNA and protein levels in the gastrocnemius increased 1.7- (p < 0.01) and 2.9-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, following a 48-h fast. Tricarboxylic acid cycle flux measured using 13C NMR as an index of mitochondrial substrate oxidation was 212 ± 23 and 173 ± 25 nmol/g/min (p not significant) in the fed and 48-h fasted groups, respectively. Unidirectional ATP synthesis flux measured using31P NMR was 79 ± 15 and 57 ± 9 nmol/g/s (p not significant) in the fed and 48-h fasted groups, respectively. Mitochondrial energy coupling as expressed by the ratio of ATP synthesis to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux was not different between the fed and fasted states. To test the hypothesis that UCP3 may be involved in the translocation of long chain free fatty acids (FFA) into the mitochondrial matrix under conditions of elevated FFA availability, [U-13C]palmitate/albumin was administered in a separate group of rats with (+) or without (−) etomoxir (an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I). The ratio of glutamate enrichment ((+) etomoxir/(−) etomoxir) in the hind limb muscles was the same between groups, indicating that UCP3 does not appear to function as a translocator for long chain FFA in skeletal muscle following a 48-h fast. In summary, these data demonstrate that despite a 2–3-fold increase in UCP3 mRNA and protein expression in skeletal muscle during the transition from the fed to fasted state, mitochondrial energy coupling does not change. Furthermore, UCP3 does not appear to have a major role in FFA translocation into the mitochondria. The physiological role of UCP3 following a 48-h fast in skeletal muscle remains to be elucidated.

The physiological role of UCP3 following a 48-h fast in skeletal muscle remains to be elucidated. uncoupling protein free fatty acid reactive oxygen species not significant Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs)1 play an integral role in regulating cellular energy consumption via nonshivering thermogenesis (1Himms-Hagen J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1989; 28: 67-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This is accomplished by diminishing the proton motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which results in uncoupling of respiration from ATP synthesis. Unlike UCP1, which is expressed exclusively in brown adipose tissue, the recently discovered homolog UCP3 is expressed primarily in muscle (2Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A. Rossier C. Dulloo A.

This paradoxical relationship may be a result of UCP3 mRNA expression not correlating with protein levels or possibly a result of alterations in the concentration of an unknown allosteric regulator to UCP3. It has also been suggested that UCP3 may play a role in the regulation of lipids as fuel substrate rather than mediators of regulatory thermogenesis (17Semec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Therefore, the UCP3 protein may function specifically as a free fatty acid anion translocator rather than a direct proton shuttle or as part of a proton-FFA cycle under conditions of elevated plasma FFA following a 48-h fast. It is now generally accepted that fatty acids are necessary in activating uncoupling proteins via direct or indirect mechanisms (15Weigle D.S. Selfridge L.E. Schwartz M.W. Seeley R.J. Cummings D.E.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), these measurements have not been made in explicit tissues of interest in situ. Additionally, although electric potential measurements across the inner mitochondrial membrane provide an index for potential energy uncoupling, they do not measure functional energy uncoupling. This is because of the non-ohmic nature of proton conductance, which is not linear with the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (22Brand M.D. Brindle K.M. Buckingham J.A. Harper J.A. Rolfe D.F.S. Stuart J.A. Int. J. Obes. 1999; 23 Suppl. 6: 4-11Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We recently reported on the development of a novel NMR spectroscopic method used to assess mitochondrial energy coupling in skeletal muscle, noninvasively, by combining 13C NMR spectroscopy to measure rates of mitochondrial substrate oxidation along with 31P NMR spectroscopy to assess rates of ATP synthesis in chronic T3 (triiodothyronine) treated rats (a model of increased UCP3 expression) (23Jucker B.M. Dufour S. Ren J. Cao X. Previs S.F. Underhill B. Cadman K.S. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6880-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we used this noninvasive NMR technique to determine if increased UCP3 mRNA and protein levels correlate with measurements of mitochondrial energy coupling in skeletal muscle of 48-h fasted rats. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that UCP3 may function as a fatty acid translocator under fasting conditions during which levels of plasma FFA are increased. Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Raleigh, NC) were individually housed in an environmentally controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and maintained on standard rat chow (Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis, MO). Two groups of rats were used: fed (n = 17) and 48-h fasted (n = 19). When weighing ∼300 g, the 48-h fasted rats had cannulas inserted into both the right jugular vein and carotid artery (24Smith D. Rossetti L. Ferrannini E. Johnson C.M. Cobelli L. Toffolo G. Katz L.D. DeFronzo R.A. Metabolism. 1987; 36: 1167-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and were allowed to recuperate for 5 days prior to fasting. Following fasting, these rats weighed ∼270 g. The fed group weight was pair-matched to the 48-h fasted group at the time of the experiment. On the day of the NMR experiment, rats were placed in a customized restraining tube that allowed their left hind limb to be secured to the outside of the tube in a manner to limit free movement of the leg for NMR measurements. The rats were transiently anesthetized (<30 s) with a low dose (2.5–5.0 mg) of thiopental (Sigma) in order to place them in the restraining tube. This protocol was approved by the Yale University Animal Care Committee. The 31P NMR measurements preceded the 13C NMR measurements in each experiment. During the 31P measurements, unlabeled acetate was administered at a constant infusion rate (138 μmol/kg/min). During the 13C measurements, [2-13C]acetate (sodium salt, 99% enriched; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) was administered in order to study the glutamate labeling kinetics for tricarboxylic acid cycle flux measurements (Fig. 1). The [2-13C]acetate infusion consisted of a bolus (100 mg/kg of body weight) for 1 min followed by a 138 μmol/kg/min continuous infusion for 150 min (sufficient time required to achieve isotopic steady state). Blood samples were drawn during the base-line NMR measurement, at 7.5 min, 15 min, and every 15 min thereafter to assess the [2-13C]acetate enrichment time course. At the end of the in vivo NMR experiment, rats were anesthetized with thiopental (50 mg/kg). Superficial skin was rapidly removed from the left hind quarter followed by in situ freeze clamping of the gastrocnemius and biceps femoris muscles. Rats were euthanized with a lethal dose of thiopental. All in vivo NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Biospec 7.0T system (horizontal/22-cm diameter bore magnet). Both13C observe/1H decouple and 31P observe NMR spectroscopy were performed using concentric surface coils (the outer 1H coil (30 mm) tuned to 300.54 MHz and the inner dual frequency 13C or 31P coil (18 mm) tuned to 75.59 and 121.66 MHz, respectively). The rat hind limb was positioned over the 13C/31P coil (vertical in plane) and placed in the magnet isocenter. Due to the13C/31P sensitivity in the hind limb experiments, it was necessary to measure the bulk signal from the larger tissue beds of mixed fiber type including the gastrocnemius and biceps femoris. Global 1H shimming was followed by localized shimming using a STEAM sequence over a 1 × 2 × 2-cm volume of the leg. Water line widths of 35–60 Hz, as a reflection of the average inhomogeneity caused by the subtle movements of the leg, were routinely achieved. The creatine/phosphocreatine peak (54.4 ppm) in the13C spectrum and β-ATP (−16.0 ppm) in the31P spectrum were used as an internal reference standard for movement of the leg. If severe movement compromised these peak integrals, the experiment was terminated. All spectra were processed off-line using Nuts NMR processing software (Acorn NMR Inc., Fremont, CA) with peak fitting capabilities. Base line-subtracted 13C NMR and 31P NMR spectra were processed using Gaussian filtering and a Gaussian weighted peak-fitting algorithm. The saturation transfer study requires that two sets of spectra be acquired: one with and one without steady state saturation. To measure the kinetics of Pi → ATP, a continuous wave selective saturation of the γ-ATP resonance was used. In the spectrum without γ-ATP saturation, the CW pulse was placed an equal frequency offset to the downfield side of Pi. The ratio of the resulting magnetization (Mz) to the equilibrium magnetization (M0) in the absence of γ-ATP saturation is given by the equation, Mz/M0=1/(1+kT1)Equation 1 where k is the first order rate constant describing the loss of magnetization from Pi, andT1 is the intrinsic spin lattice relaxation time for the Pi nucleus. A 90° pulse was optimized for the nonselective detection of both spectra (repetition time = 4.4 s, scans = 128, sweep width = 20 KHz, 4K data). The spin lattice relaxation time measured using an inversion recovery pulse sequence in the presence of continuous γ-ATP saturation is defined as the observed T1 (T1obs) and is related to T1 by the following equation.1/T1obs=1/T1+kEquation 2 An adiabatic half-passage pulse was used to invert all Pi spins in the inhomogenous volume of the surface coil (repetition time = 6.0 s, scans = 64, sweep width = 4 KHz, 4K data) for the 180° pulse of the inversion recovery sequence. The six variable delay lengths used in the inversion recovery experiment will be between 10 ms and 6 s. Solving the above two equations simultaneously (where ΔM =M0 − Mz) yields the following equation.k=1/T1obs×ΔM/M0Equation 3 Therefore, the rate constant (k) may be calculated after acquiring spectra for the two experiments described above (saturation transfer and inversion recovery). The unidirectional ATP synthesis flux was calculated as k × [Pi]. The Pi concentration was extrapolated from the baseline NMR spectrum (comparing peak integrals from Pi and γ-ATP) and [ATP] measurement using a biochemical assay. The NMR-measured unidirectional ATP synthesis flux results from flux through both the F1F0-ATP synthase enzyme and the coupled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase reactions. Although the net glycolytic contribution to the production of ATP (via glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase) versus that of oxidative phosphorylation is small, these enzymes are at near equilibrium, and consequently the unidirectional production of ATP (measured using the 31P saturation transfer experiment) via these enzymes can be high. We previously described a technique where uniformly labeled glucose (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6-D7) was administered to rats to determine whether there are differences in the glycolytic ATP synthesis flux contribution between groups (23Jucker B.M. Dufour S. Ren J. Cao X. Previs S.F. Underhill B. Cadman K.S. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6880-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In separate experiments, this technique was applied to both fed (n = 3) and 48-h fasted (n = 3) rats. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate M + 2/M + 4 (5.8 ± 1.1 versus 5.0 ± 1.3 in fedversus 48-h fasted, respectively) and M + 3/M + 4 (1.3 ± 0.7 versus 1.6 ± 0.5 in fed versus 48-h fasted, respectively) ratios were similar in both groups, suggesting no differences in the glycolytic ATP contribution. Observation of the 13C label turnover in the NMR-detectable glutamate pool in skeletal muscle was necessary for the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux calculation. Therefore, 1H-decoupled 13C NMR spectroscopy was performed in the following manner. An initial frequency-selective sinc pulse (20 ms) set on the low field side of the methylene carbon of lipids at 30 ppm was immediately followed by a nonselective hard pulse (approximately 70° flip angle, 5 mm from surface coil). The sinc pulse power was adjusted to eliminate most of the signal in that region. This method improved the base-line subtraction of lipid peaks between 22 and 30 ppm. Broadband1H Waltz-16 decoupling was applied during acquisition, and additional nuclear Overhauser effect was achieved using low power decoupling (0.4 W) during the relaxation delay (repetition time = 0.5 s, scans = 1800, sweep width = 20 KHz, 4K data). A 15-min base-line spectrum was followed by subsequent 15-min acquisitions throughout the duration of the experiment. Metabolic steady state equations were derived for isotopic mass flow into the tricarboxylic acid cycle as described previously in brain (25Fitzpatrick S.M. Hetherington H.P. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12187-12194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Yale University CWave software (Dr. Graeme F. Mason) was used to calculate the tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes. The mathematical modeling was based on nonlinear least squares fitting of the calculated parameters (e.g. 4-13C- and 2-13C-labeled citrate, α-ketoglutarate, glutamate, etc.) from the set of isotopic mass balance equations describing the label flow through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to the acquired NMR data using a Runge-Kutta algorithm with an adaptive step size. From the labeled mass flow schematic shown in Fig. 1, we obtain the following isotopic mass balance equations, which were used in the analyses, ∂C2AcCoA∂t=C3PyrPyrVpdh+C2AcetAcetVacet−C2AcCoAAcCoAVtcaEquation 4 ∂C4Cit∂t=C2AcCoAAcCoA−C4CitCitVtcaEquation 5 ∂C4α­KG∂t=C4CitCitVtca+C4GluGluVglu−1−C4α­KGα­KG(Vtca+Vglu)Equation 6 ∂C4Glu∂t=C4α­KGα­KGVglu+C4GlnGlnVgln−C4GluGlu(Vgln+Vgln−1)Equation 7 ∂C3Oaa∂t=0.5×C4α­KGα­KGVtca+0.5×C3α­KGα­KGVtca+C3AspAspVasp−1+C3PyrPyrVpc−C3OaaOaa(Vasp+Vtca+VOaa)Equation 8 ∂C2Cit∂t=C3OaaOaa−C2CitCitVtcaEquation 9 ∂C2α­KG∂t=C2CitCitVtca+C2GluGluVglu−1−C2α­KGα­KG(Vtca+Vglu)Equation 10 ∂C2Glu∂t=C2α­KGα­KGVglu+C2GlnGlnVgln−C2GluGlu(Vgln+Vgln−1)Equation 11 where AcCoA represents acetyl-CoA; Pyr is pyruvate; Acet is acetate; Cit is citrate; α-KG is α-ketoglutarate; Glu is glutamate; Gln is glutamine; Oaa is oxaloacetate; Asp is aspartate, and the C2, C3, or C4 prefix refers to 13C label at the respective carbon isotope positions. Vpdh represents pyruvate dehydrogenase flux; Vacet is acetate thiokinase flux; Vtca is tricarboxylic acid cycle flux; Vglu andVglu−1 are aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase flux, respectively; Vgln and Vgln−1 are glutamine synthetase and glutaminase flux, respectively; Vasp is aspartate aminotransferase flux; and Voaa is efflux from oxaloacetate (necessary to maintain steady state) The α-KG ⇄ Glu exchange via glutamate dehydrogenase and/or aminotransferase reaction (Vglu,Vglu−1) is rapid with respect to Vtca in the brain (26Mason G.F. Rothman D.L. Behar K.L. Shulman R.G. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1992; 12: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) but has been shown to be significantly slower in the heart (27Yu X.

Kobayashi K. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13785-13794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was necessary to include both 2-13C- and 4-13C-labeled glutamate turnover data in the mathematical analysis to discriminate between Vtca and Vglu. The glutamate pool concentration was determined in tissue extracts for use in the mathematical analysis, while all other intermediate pool concentrations were taken from the literature (27Yu X.

J. 1964; 93: 678-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the model, [2-13C]acetyl-CoA pool turnover was described as rapid and set equal to the [2-13C]acetate precursor pool turnover that was measured in plasma and tissue extracts. To test this assumption (i.e. [2-13C]acetate turnover = [2-13C]acetyl-CoA turnover), we used a non-steady state isotopic analysis of glutamate labeling derived from [2-13C]acetate measured in rats at 15, 30, 60, and 150 min. The rapid turnover of [2-13C]acetyl-CoA enrichment (58.7 ± 0.3, 59.4 ± 2.6, 53.6 ± 0.6, and 56.3 ± 5.0 at the respective time points) suggests that this assumption is valid. It has been shown that acyl-CoA synthetase can function to a low degree in the mitochondrial matrix (31Trevisan C. DiMauro S. Neurochem. Res. 1983; 8: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the capacity for UCP3 to function as a FFA translocator to increase β-oxidation in a separate group of rats. We measured relative rates of [U-13C]palmitate oxidation in skeletal muscle in vivo with (+) and without (−) carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibition by etomoxir in the fed and 48-h fasted groups. These measurements were performed in the fed rats to determine the relative decrease in palmitate oxidation resulting from carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibition. The control value (percentage decrease in palmitate oxidation in the fed group) was compared with the values obtained from the 48-h fasted group to determine whether or not UCP3 functions in part as a FFA translocator (i.e. percentage decrease is less than control percentage decrease). In the basal group ((−) etomoxir), a constant infusion (0.935 μmol/kg/min) of [U-13C]palmitate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) bound to 12% bovine albumin (Sigma) was administered for 120 min. In the etomoxir group, etomoxir (10 μmol/kg, gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb) in 100 μl of sterile water was administered 60 min prior to [U-13C]palmitate infusion (32Oakes N.D. Cooney G.J. Camilleri S. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A bolus administration (25 mg/kg) of nicotinic acid (Sigma) was given every hour to maintain basal FFA concentrations (33Sidossis L.S. Stuart C.A. Shulman G.I. Lopaschuk G.D. Wolfe R.R. J. Clin.

After 120 min, hind limb muscles were freeze-clamped in situ, and glutamate enrichments (index of relative palmitate oxidation) were measured in tissue extract using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (34Beylot M. David F. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The measured M + 2 glutamate enrichments (∼0.5–2%) were significantly greater than the 0.02% background enrichment. Muscle tissue extracts were prepared for high field NMR analysis by homogenizing approximately 1 g of combined quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscle as described previously (35Jucker B.M.

The Pi concentration was extrapolated from the base-line NMR spectrum (comparing peak integrals from Pi and (γ-ATP) and measured ATP concentration (ATP assay kit 366, Sigma-modified for tissue analysis). Plasma free fatty acids were determined using an acyl-CoA oxidase-based colorimetric kit (WAKO NEFA-C; WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Tissue extract glutamate concentration was determined using a 2300 STAT PLUS biochemical analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH). Skeletal muscles were homogenized in the buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.005 m MgCl2, 0.001 m EDTA, and freshly added protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After brief homogenization, samples were spun at 650 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was collected and transferred to a new tube and spun at 14,000 ×g for 10 min. Pellets were collected and resuspended in 0.15m KCl. Total RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, as described by Lehrach et al. (37Lehrach H. Frischauf A.M. Philipson L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1985; 177: 7-15PubMed Google Scholar), and transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting. Probes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to a specific radioactivity of approximately 2 × 108cpm/μg of DNA. RNA blots were hybridized in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 0.25 mNa2HPO4, 0.25 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C overnight and then washed in a solution containing 0.25 m Na2HPO4, 0.5% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 20 min. Blots were exposed to scientific imaging film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at −80 °C with intensifying screens. The signals on the membrane were quantified by an Instant Imager (Canberra Company, Meriden, CT). Mitochondrial protein (25 μg) was loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–15% Tris-HCl gradient gel; Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1 h.

Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The published cDNA sequence of SPBP is 3995 base pairs (bp) long with an open reading frame (ORF) of 2822 bp encoding a protein of 937 amino acids (1Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SPBP has also been called AR1 or TCF20 (2Rajadhyaksha A. Riviere M. Van Vooren P. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Babin J. Bina M. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1998; 81: 176-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stromelysin-1, also known as MMP3, is an extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinase that is active against a broad range of substrates. These proteases are invariably up-regulated in epithelial cancers, recognized as targets of oncogenic signal transduction pathways and shown to contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis (3Kahari V.M. Saarialho-Kere U. Ann. Med. 1999; 31: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 4Matrisian L.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 776-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that stromelysin-1 actually also promoted mammary carcinogenesis in a mouse model system. Overexpression of stromelysin-1 in the mammary gland of transgenic mice induced all stages of tumor progression from hyperplasia to malignant carcinomas (5Sternlicht M.D. Lochter A. Sympson C.J. Huey B. Rougier J.P. Gray J.W. Pinkel D. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Cell. 1999; 98: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). In such experiments, stromelysin-1 seems to act as a natural tumor promoter enhancing cancer susceptibility (6Sternlicht M.D. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).The transcriptional activity of the stromelysin-1 promoter is stimulated by PDGF, and SPBP is reported to contribute to this up-regulation (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T. Moscat J. Diaz Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10044-10049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of SPBP itself was also found to be induced by PDGF or serum (1Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The stromelysin-1 promoter contains three elements that are important for induction by mitogenic stimuli. These are an AP-1 element binding the c-Fos/c-Jun transcription factors, two head-to-head PEA3 elements binding Ets family transcription factors, and the SPRE element that binds SPBP (see Ref. 7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and references therein). The signal from the PDGF receptor is dependent on active Ras protein and bifurcates into one pathway that involves Raf-1 and activates the stromelysin-1 promoter via the AP-1 and PEA3 elements. The other pathway involves the atypical protein kinase C isoforms λ and ζ and acts via the AP-1 and SPRE elements (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Sanz L. Berra E. Municio M.M. Dominguez I. Lozano J. Johansen T. Moscat J. Diaz Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10044-10049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that SPBP cooperates with c-Jun to transactivate via the SPRE site, and these two proteins are found to interact in vitro (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Transcriptional regulation requires the concerted action of a large number of proteins, many of which act in multiprotein complexes (reviewed in Refs. 9Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 10Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These factors, termed transcription factors, transcriptional cofactors, or mediators, seem to be involved at two levels: 1) modulation of chromatin structure making DNA more or less accessible for other transcription factors to bind and 2) recruitment of the general transcriptional machinery to the promoter.Here we show that SPBP is twice as large as originally described. Due to alternative splicing, two isoforms with different C termini are produced (1983 and 1965 amino acids long for the murine protein). The human and murine proteins show a sequence identity of 92%. The murine gene is located on chromosome 15, while the human is found on chromosome 22 in positions q13.1 to q13.3. SPBP is expressed in most tissues except ovary and prostate. Functional mapping revealed SPBP to be a nuclear multidomain protein. It contains three nuclear localization signals, a novel type of DNA-binding domain with a single AT-hook, a transactivation domain in the N-terminal end, and in the very C-terminal end an evolutionary conserved zinc finger domain also found in the trithorax family of chromatin-based transcriptional regulator proteins. Interestingly, SPBP has the ability to enhance the transcriptional activity of various transcription factors, such as c-Jun, Ets, Sp1, and Pax6, suggesting that SPBP may be a novel transcriptional coactivator.DISCUSSIONWe show that SPBP, originally described as a 110-kDa novel transcription factor acting to regulate stromelysin-1 transcription, is actually a 220-kDa nuclear factor that is also able to function as a transcriptional coactivator. SPBP is expressed in most tissues, except for prostate and ovary. Two different isoforms, differing in their C termini, are produced by alternative splicing. The splicing pattern varies between different tissues and during embryonic development. The significance of the different isoforms is currently unknown. However, the differential expression of the two splice forms in the various tissues analyzed suggests that they may serve different roles or functions. Since SPBP is expressed in most tissues while stromelysin-1 expression is more restricted, SPBP may have a more general role in transcriptional regulation than only to control stromelysin-1 expression.Except for the evolutionary conserved ZNF2 zinc finger domain, we have been unable to detect sequences in the sequenced genomes ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, or Drosophila that could represent direct homologues of SPBP. Thus, SPBP may be a vertebrate-specific protein. By FISH analysis, the human gene encoding SPBP was located at 22q13.1–3, and the murine gene was localized to the syntenic chromosome 15E region. Consistently, while this work was in progress Rajadhyaksha et al. (2Rajadhyaksha A. Riviere M. Van Vooren P. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Babin J. Bina M. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1998; 81: 176-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that AR1 or TCF20 (other names for SPBP) is located at 22q13.3. We findSPBP to be located at position 26 Mb by alignment to the sequence data from chromosome 22q (21Dunham I. Hunt A.R. Collins J.E. Bruskiewich R. Beare D.M. Clamp M. Smink L.J. Ainscough R. Almeida J.P. Babbage A. Bagguley C. Bailey J. Barlow K. Bates K.N. Beasley O. et al.Nature. 1999; 402: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Several tumor forms have been associated with deletions and other lesions in this part of chromosome 22 including gliomas, meningiomas, and ovarian and colon cancers. However, the mapping data are too imprecise to say anything about a possible involvement of SPBP.SPBP was originally isolated by virtue of its ability to bind specifically to a concatenated SPRE probe (1Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We found the region from amino acid 1535 to 1584 to contain a minimal DNA binding domain (Min-DBD), but both the affinity and the specificity of the binding increased when the region was extended C-terminally to amino acid 1731 to give the maximal DNA binding domain (Max-DBD). The SPRE consists of an AT-rich palindrome (Pal-1), which partially overlaps with another palindrome (Pal-2). These two palindromes may constitute half-sites. Our results from GMSA with the Min- and Max-DBDs are compatible with the notion that SPBP binds as a dimer or multimer to the SPRE motif when the complete binding site is present and as a monomer when Pal-1 or Pal-2 is mutated. This notion is supported by the occurrence of a differently migrating complex when the Min- and Max-DBDs were mixed compared with the complexes observed when these two domains were assayed separately. Interestingly, the affinity of DNA binding increased significantly when the protein concentration was raised above a certain level. This is indicative of cooperativity in the DNA binding or dimerization. A cooperative, dimeric/multimeric DNA binding by SPBP is also supported by the hyperbolic activation kinetics of a SPRE reporter upon cotransfection of increasing amounts of SPBP-(1016–1965) (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Min-DBD contains a single AT-hook motif. Deletion of the AT-hook from the Min-DBD abolished DNA binding. The region C-terminal to the AT-hook, constituting the rest of the Max-DBD, does not show any sequence homology to any known classes of DBDs. By itself, this region is unable to bind to the SPRE motif, suggesting that the Min-DBD with an intact single AT-hook motif is essential for DNA binding. Multiple and single AT-hooks motifs are found in several multidomain proteins that associate with chromatin (27Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Interestingly, among these are members of the trithorax group of regulatory genes that also contain zinc finger domains (ZNF and PHD) with homology to the zinc finger domain of SPBP. Trithorax proteins are involved in chromatin decondensation (31Pirrotta V. Cell. 1998; 93: 333-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and their AT-hooks have been implicated in several chromosomal translocations resulting in different lymphoid leukemias (32Slany R.K. Lavau C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 33Tkachuk D.C. Kohler S. Cleary M.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 691-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 34Zeleznik-Le N.J. Harden A.M. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10610-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The type 1 AT-hook motifs such as the one found in SPBP seem to be auxiliary elements necessary for cooperation with other DNA binding activities in the same or different proteins (27Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our finding that SPBP has a Min-DBD with the AT-hook and a larger domain C-terminal to it that together with the Min-DBD constitutes the Max-DBD. AT-hooks are known to bind to AT-rich sequences in the minor groove of DNA. In doing so they often change the DNA conformation, making DNA more or less accessible for other DNA binding factors, depending on the sequence context. This suggests that the Min-DBD of SPBP recognizes the AT-rich Pal-1 of the SPRE motif, binds in the minor groove, and thereby makes the Pal-2 sequence more accessible for binding by another SPBP molecule.A dual picture of the function(s) of SPBP is emerging. On one hand, two previous reports suggest that SPBP acts as a classical sequence-specific transcriptional activator. SPBP-(1016–1965) and c-Jun were found to cooperate to transactivate a promoter under SPRE control (1Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we find that SPBP may act as a coactivator for structurally and functionally rather different transcription factors binding to distinct target sequences in promoters/enhancers. However, this is not inconsistent with the previously reported collaboration between c-Jun and SPBP-(1016–1965). In fact, it was found that c-Jun and SPBP bound to each other in vitro and that c-Jun could activate the reporter alone but that this activation was markedly increased upon coexpression of SPBP (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is in complete agreement with our finding of SPBP as a potent coactivator of c-Jun. Since SPBP coactivated such diverse transcription factors as Sp1, Pax6, c-Jun, and Ets-1, the mechanism(s) involved may be relatively general targeting common components. The finding that the zinc finger domain was necessary for stimulation of the c-Jun and Sp1 activity but not for the stimulation of the Ets-1 and Pax6 activity indicates that different parts of SPBP are involved, depending on the specific transcription factor. At what level does SPBP act to stimulate the transcription mediated by these factors? We found that SPBP does not act by increasing translation or increasing protein stability. The fact that SPBP did not enhance the transcriptional activation potential of E2F-1, together with the nonstimulatory effect of SPBP alone, suggests that SPBP does not act at the levels of pre-mRNA processing or mRNA stability of the luciferase reporter gene transcript. Thus, most likely, SPBP acts on the transcriptional initiation step, either at the chromatin/DNA level or in the recruitment of necessary factors to the initiation site. Several AT-hook-containing proteins play important roles in modulating chromatin structure and act as transcriptional cofactors (see Refs. 35Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S. Jain M.K. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). AT-hook proteins may act both as coactivators or corepressors. In addition to changing the DNA conformation, the stimulatory effect of some AT-hook-containing proteins is also dependent on protein-protein contacts (35Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S. Jain M.K. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, SPBP may stimulate the activity of other transcription factors both by changing the DNA conformation, making it more accessible, and by protein-protein contacts recruiting the transcription factors to DNA. In this context, it is noteworthy that the ZNF2 or extended PHD domain that SPBP shares with the trithorax family of chromatin-based transcriptional regulatory proteins is most likely a protein-protein interaction domain. We have found that a GST fusion of the ZNF2 domain of SPBP binds to in vitro translated full-length SPBP. Furthermore, in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the ZNF2 domain as bait, we isolated a part of murine GT1 corresponding to the GT1-F homology region of SPBP. 4E. Sjøttem and T. Johansen, unpublished results.In future studies, it will be important to interfere with or knock out the endogenous SPBP to determine what physiological processes may depend on active SPBP. Our attempts to inhibit the expression of endogenous SPBP using antisense RNA expression were unsuccessful. Thus, other strategies like microinjection of neutralizing antibodies (not presently available) or overexpression of dominant negative mutants and the production of knock-out mice are needed to study the effects on transcription and phenotypic changes associated with blockade of endogenous SPBP. SPBP (stromelysin-1PDGF1-responsive element-binding protein) was originally isolated from a murine λgt11 cDNA library as a protein that bound to the stromelysin-1 PDGF-responsive element (SPRE) of the human stromelysin-1 promoter (1Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The published cDNA sequence of SPBP is 3995 base pairs (bp) long with an open reading frame (ORF) of 2822 bp encoding a protein of 937 amino acids (1Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SPBP has also been called AR1 or TCF20 (2Rajadhyaksha A. Riviere M. Van Vooren P. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Babin J. Bina M. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1998; 81: 176-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stromelysin-1, also known as MMP3, is an extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinase that is active against a broad range of substrates. These proteases are invariably up-regulated in epithelial cancers, recognized as targets of oncogenic signal transduction pathways and shown to contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis (3Kahari V.M. Saarialho-Kere U. Ann. Med. 1999; 31: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 4Matrisian L.M. Curr.

Recently, it was reported that stromelysin-1 actually also promoted mammary carcinogenesis in a mouse model system. Overexpression of stromelysin-1 in the mammary gland of transgenic mice induced all stages of tumor progression from hyperplasia to malignant carcinomas (5Sternlicht M.D. Lochter A. Sympson C.J.

In such experiments, stromelysin-1 seems to act as a natural tumor promoter enhancing cancer susceptibility (6Sternlicht M.D. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of the stromelysin-1 promoter is stimulated by PDGF, and SPBP is reported to contribute to this up-regulation (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T.

The stromelysin-1 promoter contains three elements that are important for induction by mitogenic stimuli. These are an AP-1 element binding the c-Fos/c-Jun transcription factors, two head-to-head PEA3 elements binding Ets family transcription factors, and the SPRE element that binds SPBP (see Ref. 7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and references therein). The signal from the PDGF receptor is dependent on active Ras protein and bifurcates into one pathway that involves Raf-1 and activates the stromelysin-1 promoter via the AP-1 and PEA3 elements. The other pathway involves the atypical protein kinase C isoforms λ and ζ and acts via the AP-1 and SPRE elements (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that SPBP cooperates with c-Jun to transactivate via the SPRE site, and these two proteins are found to interact in vitro (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation requires the concerted action of a large number of proteins, many of which act in multiprotein complexes (reviewed in Refs. 9Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 10Lemon B.D. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These factors, termed transcription factors, transcriptional cofactors, or mediators, seem to be involved at two levels: 1) modulation of chromatin structure making DNA more or less accessible for other transcription factors to bind and 2) recruitment of the general transcriptional machinery to the promoter. Here we show that SPBP is twice as large as originally described. Due to alternative splicing, two isoforms with different C termini are produced (1983 and 1965 amino acids long for the murine protein). The human and murine proteins show a sequence identity of 92%. The murine gene is located on chromosome 15, while the human is found on chromosome 22 in positions q13.1 to q13.3. SPBP is expressed in most tissues except ovary and prostate. Functional mapping revealed SPBP to be a nuclear multidomain protein. It contains three nuclear localization signals, a novel type of DNA-binding domain with a single AT-hook, a transactivation domain in the N-terminal end, and in the very C-terminal end an evolutionary conserved zinc finger domain also found in the trithorax family of chromatin-based transcriptional regulator proteins. Interestingly, SPBP has the ability to enhance the transcriptional activity of various transcription factors, such as c-Jun, Ets, Sp1, and Pax6, suggesting that SPBP may be a novel transcriptional coactivator. DISCUSSIONWe show that SPBP, originally described as a 110-kDa novel transcription factor acting to regulate stromelysin-1 transcription, is actually a 220-kDa nuclear factor that is also able to function as a transcriptional coactivator. SPBP is expressed in most tissues, except for prostate and ovary. Two different isoforms, differing in their C termini, are produced by alternative splicing. The splicing pattern varies between different tissues and during embryonic development. The significance of the different isoforms is currently unknown. However, the differential expression of the two splice forms in the various tissues analyzed suggests that they may serve different roles or functions. Since SPBP is expressed in most tissues while stromelysin-1 expression is more restricted, SPBP may have a more general role in transcriptional regulation than only to control stromelysin-1 expression.Except for the evolutionary conserved ZNF2 zinc finger domain, we have been unable to detect sequences in the sequenced genomes ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, or Drosophila that could represent direct homologues of SPBP. Thus, SPBP may be a vertebrate-specific protein. By FISH analysis, the human gene encoding SPBP was located at 22q13.1–3, and the murine gene was localized to the syntenic chromosome 15E region. Consistently, while this work was in progress Rajadhyaksha et al. (2Rajadhyaksha A. Riviere M. Van Vooren P. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Babin J. Bina M. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1998; 81: 176-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that AR1 or TCF20 (other names for SPBP) is located at 22q13.3. We findSPBP to be located at position 26 Mb by alignment to the sequence data from chromosome 22q (21Dunham I. Hunt A.R. Collins J.E. Bruskiewich R. Beare D.M. Clamp M. Smink L.J. Ainscough R. Almeida J.P. Babbage A. Bagguley C. Bailey J. Barlow K. Bates K.N. Beasley O. et al.Nature. 1999; 402: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Several tumor forms have been associated with deletions and other lesions in this part of chromosome 22 including gliomas, meningiomas, and ovarian and colon cancers. However, the mapping data are too imprecise to say anything about a possible involvement of SPBP.SPBP was originally isolated by virtue of its ability to bind specifically to a concatenated SPRE probe (1Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We found the region from amino acid 1535 to 1584 to contain a minimal DNA binding domain (Min-DBD), but both the affinity and the specificity of the binding increased when the region was extended C-terminally to amino acid 1731 to give the maximal DNA binding domain (Max-DBD). The SPRE consists of an AT-rich palindrome (Pal-1), which partially overlaps with another palindrome (Pal-2). These two palindromes may constitute half-sites. Our results from GMSA with the Min- and Max-DBDs are compatible with the notion that SPBP binds as a dimer or multimer to the SPRE motif when the complete binding site is present and as a monomer when Pal-1 or Pal-2 is mutated. This notion is supported by the occurrence of a differently migrating complex when the Min- and Max-DBDs were mixed compared with the complexes observed when these two domains were assayed separately. Interestingly, the affinity of DNA binding increased significantly when the protein concentration was raised above a certain level. This is indicative of cooperativity in the DNA binding or dimerization. A cooperative, dimeric/multimeric DNA binding by SPBP is also supported by the hyperbolic activation kinetics of a SPRE reporter upon cotransfection of increasing amounts of SPBP-(1016–1965) (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Min-DBD contains a single AT-hook motif. Deletion of the AT-hook from the Min-DBD abolished DNA binding. The region C-terminal to the AT-hook, constituting the rest of the Max-DBD, does not show any sequence homology to any known classes of DBDs. By itself, this region is unable to bind to the SPRE motif, suggesting that the Min-DBD with an intact single AT-hook motif is essential for DNA binding. Multiple and single AT-hooks motifs are found in several multidomain proteins that associate with chromatin (27Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Interestingly, among these are members of the trithorax group of regulatory genes that also contain zinc finger domains (ZNF and PHD) with homology to the zinc finger domain of SPBP. Trithorax proteins are involved in chromatin decondensation (31Pirrotta V. Cell. 1998; 93: 333-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and their AT-hooks have been implicated in several chromosomal translocations resulting in different lymphoid leukemias (32Slany R.K. Lavau C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 33Tkachuk D.C. Kohler S. Cleary M.L.

A. 1994; 91: 10610-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The type 1 AT-hook motifs such as the one found in SPBP seem to be auxiliary elements necessary for cooperation with other DNA binding activities in the same or different proteins (27Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our finding that SPBP has a Min-DBD with the AT-hook and a larger domain C-terminal to it that together with the Min-DBD constitutes the Max-DBD. AT-hooks are known to bind to AT-rich sequences in the minor groove of DNA. In doing so they often change the DNA conformation, making DNA more or less accessible for other DNA binding factors, depending on the sequence context. This suggests that the Min-DBD of SPBP recognizes the AT-rich Pal-1 of the SPRE motif, binds in the minor groove, and thereby makes the Pal-2 sequence more accessible for binding by another SPBP molecule.A dual picture of the function(s) of SPBP is emerging. On one hand, two previous reports suggest that SPBP acts as a classical sequence-specific transcriptional activator. SPBP-(1016–1965) and c-Jun were found to cooperate to transactivate a promoter under SPRE control (1Sanz L. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we find that SPBP may act as a coactivator for structurally and functionally rather different transcription factors binding to distinct target sequences in promoters/enhancers. However, this is not inconsistent with the previously reported collaboration between c-Jun and SPBP-(1016–1965). In fact, it was found that c-Jun and SPBP bound to each other in vitro and that c-Jun could activate the reporter alone but that this activation was markedly increased upon coexpression of SPBP (7Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quinones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is in complete agreement with our finding of SPBP as a potent coactivator of c-Jun. Since SPBP coactivated such diverse transcription factors as Sp1, Pax6, c-Jun, and Ets-1, the mechanism(s) involved may be relatively general targeting common components. The finding that the zinc finger domain was necessary for stimulation of the c-Jun and Sp1 activity but not for the stimulation of the Ets-1 and Pax6 activity indicates that different parts of SPBP are involved, depending on the specific transcription factor. At what level does SPBP act to stimulate the transcription mediated by these factors? We found that SPBP does not act by increasing translation or increasing protein stability. The fact that SPBP did not enhance the transcriptional activation potential of E2F-1, together with the nonstimulatory effect of SPBP alone, suggests that SPBP does not act at the levels of pre-mRNA processing or mRNA stability of the luciferase reporter gene transcript. Thus, most likely, SPBP acts on the transcriptional initiation step, either at the chromatin/DNA level or in the recruitment of necessary factors to the initiation site. Several AT-hook-containing proteins play important roles in modulating chromatin structure and act as transcriptional cofactors (see Refs. 35Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S. Jain M.K.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). AT-hook proteins may act both as coactivators or corepressors. In addition to changing the DNA conformation, the stimulatory effect of some AT-hook-containing proteins is also dependent on protein-protein contacts (35Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S. Jain M.K. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, SPBP may stimulate the activity of other transcription factors both by changing the DNA conformation, making it more accessible, and by protein-protein contacts recruiting the transcription factors to DNA. In this context, it is noteworthy that the ZNF2 or extended PHD domain that SPBP shares with the trithorax family of chromatin-based transcriptional regulatory proteins is most likely a protein-protein interaction domain. We have found that a GST fusion of the ZNF2 domain of SPBP binds to in vitro translated full-length SPBP. Furthermore, in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the ZNF2 domain as bait, we isolated a part of murine GT1 corresponding to the GT1-F homology region of SPBP. 4E. Sjøttem and T. Johansen, unpublished results.In future studies, it will be important to interfere with or knock out the endogenous SPBP to determine what physiological processes may depend on active SPBP. Our attempts to inhibit the expression of endogenous SPBP using antisense RNA expression were unsuccessful. Thus, other strategies like microinjection of neutralizing antibodies (not presently available) or overexpression of dominant negative mutants and the production of knock-out mice are needed to study the effects on transcription and phenotypic changes associated with blockade of endogenous SPBP.

The energy stored in this gradient is used to drive uptake of nutrients through channels and H+-coupled carrier proteins. No P-type plasma membrane H+-ATPase has been found in mammalian cells. Cryoelectron microscopic images of the H+-ATPase ofNeurospora crassa (4Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) have been obtained at 8-Å resolution, and the crystal structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (5Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) has recently been solved at 2.6-Å resolution (6Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). These structures reveal the presence of 10 transmembrane α-helices connected to a large cytoplasmic region of the enzyme. Structural data indicate that the ATP-binding site is located in a distinct nucleotide-binding domain (domain N; Ref. 5Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 392: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) formed by part of the large cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane segments TM41 and TM5. A large body of biochemical evidence supports these data. For instance, ATP analogues are bound to amino acid residues in the large cytoplasmic loop (reviewed in Ref. 1Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the large cytoplasmic loop can be expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein that has ATP binding capacity, although this domain alone is not able to hydrolyze ATP (7Gatto C. Wang A.X. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10578-10585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast to ATP binding, the ion-binding sites of the mammalian Ca2+-ATPase are located in the transmembrane regions between TM4, TM5, TM6, and TM8 (6Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). A large amount of biochemical data support this model (8Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 9Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6262-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that one or more transmembrane helices in concert form the ion-binding site(s) in other related P-type ATPases. For example, most of the extramembraneous regions of the Na+/K+-ATPase can be removed by proteolytic digestion while the remaining portion of the enzyme maintains its ability to bind and occlude K+ (10Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10780-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutagenesis studies have identified a number of amino acid residues within M4, M5, and M6 of the Na+/K+-ATPase that appear to be critical for cation binding (11Arguello J.M. Peluffo R.D.

These residues are in general polar, and most are negatively charged. That the ATP- and ion-binding sites are separated in space in P-type ATPases implies that catalysis involves communication between different parts of the pump molecule. How hydrolysis of ATP by the large cytoplasmic domain is coupled to transport of the ion(s) bound in the transmembrane region is unknown. P-type ATPases are believed to go through a number of reaction intermediates during their transport of ions across the membrane, changing between two major conformational states, E1 and E2(reviewed in Ref. 15Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In the E1 conformation, ATP and the ion to be transported to the extracellular face are bound, and an aspartyl phosphate enzyme intermediateE1P is created by hydrolysis of ATP. The major conformational change is associated with the E1P to E2P transition. During transition to theE2P state, the ion-binding site is shifted from being exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane to facing the extracellular space where the ion is released. Following dephosphorylation to E2 the enzyme returns to the E1 conformation. When Na+/K+- and H+/K+-ATPases are digested by proteases in the absence of K+, M5 and M6 disappear from the membrane (16Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Gatto C. Lutsenko S. Shin J.M. Sachs G. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13737-13740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). M5 and M6 are connected by a very short loop of typically five or six extracellularly located amino acid residues, and are therefore expected to form a hairpin. It has been suggested that during catalysis M5 and M6 move in and out of the membrane, and that these movements are part of the E1-E2conformational change during catalysis. Several site-directed mutations have been produced in which the conformational equilibrium of P2-ATPases has been shifted toward either E1 or E2. Such mutants are potentially very useful as tools for understanding the molecular mechanism of ion transport by P-type ATPases. TheE1P − E2P conformational change is attracting special attention because it accompanies transport of charge across the membrane. P2-ATPase mutants that are blocked in conformational changes, either in the transition from E2 toE1 (18Sorensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or from E1 toE2, have been identified (19Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Dutra M.B. Ambesi A. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17411-17417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The H+-ATPase in the E1 conformation is expected to have high affinity for ATP and H+. For theSaccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane H+-ATPase PMA1, mutations in various domains produce enzymes that are likely to be predominantly in theE1 conformation. These mutants exhibit higher ATP affinity and have pH profiles shifted toward the alkaline, suggesting increased proton affinity (20Dutra M.B. Ambesi A. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17411-17417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Deletion of the COOH-terminal regulatory domain of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase results in mutants having a similar kinetic profile (21Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism behind H+-binding and transport in plant H+-ATPases, we made a number of site-directed mutants of transmembrane helix 6 in the Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2. In one of these mutants, Asp684 was exchanged for the amide-derived residue asparagine. We describe the expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of the Asp684 → Asn enzyme. The mutation caused a block in the E1P toE2P conformational change. We suggest a fundamental role for Asp684 in coordinating coupling of ATP hydrolysis to H+-transport in the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase. The results, furthermore, suggest a high degree of conservation in ion transport with respect to an conserved aspartate in transmembrane helix 6 of P2- and P3-type ATPases, this residue being required regardless of whether Na+, K+, Ca2+, or H+ is to be transported. The yeast multicopy vector YEp-351 (22Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), which contains the full-length cDNA of the A. thaliana plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoformAHA2 under control of the PMA1 promoter (23Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberian G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension polymerase chain reactions (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar) using standard methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Several silent mutations of AHA2 were generated, resulting in the insertion of eight new restriction enzyme cleavage sites in the coding region of AHA2, resulting in plasmid pMP-648 (26Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A COOH-terminal deletion of 73 amino acid residues and an MRGS(His)6 tag were introduced into pMP-648, resulting in pMP-652. This was done by replacing the cassette between the SfiI and SpeI sites with two oligonucleotides having the following sequences: 5′-GGATGAGAGGATCGCACCACCACCACCACCACTAGTAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTAGTTACTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCGATCCTCTCATCCATT-3′ (reverse). The mutation Asp684 → Asn was made by using the forward primer 5′-GACTTCTCAGCATTCATGGTTCTGATCATTGCCATTCTTAACAACGGTACCAT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAAAATTTCTTTAAGCTTCCAGCTATCAGG-3′ in a polymerase chain reaction using pMP-652 as a template. The resulting product was digested with HindIII and BsmI, and used to replace the corresponding fragment in pMP-652. DNA sequencing of the cassettes was used to verify that no other mutations were introduced into the coding regions. The S. cerevisiae strain RS-72 was transformed and cultured essentially as described previously (21Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). In RS-72 (MATa ade1–100 his4–519 leu2–3, 112), the natural constitutive promoter of the endogenous yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase PMA1 is replaced by the galactose-dependent promoter of GAL1. SincePMA1 is essential for yeast growth, it grows only on galactose media. Using this strain, plant H+-ATPases brought under control of the constitutive PMA1 promoter can be tested for their ability to rescue pma1 mutants on a glucose medium. Yeast cells were grown in 0.7% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids; Difco) supplemented with adenine (40 μg/ml), L-histidine (30 μg/ml), and 2% galactose (SGAH) or glucose (SDAH). Before harvesting, a saturated preculture was made from a fresh colony in 10 ml of SGAH, 3 × 100 ml of SGAH inoculated with the preculture, and this culture grown for 2 days at 28 °C. Finally the cells were transferred to 3 × 1 liters of medium containing 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, and 2% bactopeptone (YPD), and grown for 20 h at 28 °C. The cells were harvested and microsomes isolated as described (21Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). Yeast was grown for 3 days at 30 °C in liquid medium containing 2% galactose. Approximately 103 cells in 10 μl were spotted onto synthetic minimal media plates containing either 2% galactose at pH 5.5 or 2% glucose at pH values of 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, and 3.5. Growth was recorded after incubation for 3 days at 30 °C. The microsomal membrane fraction (4.5 ml; 10 mg of protein/ml) was mixed with 20 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.5, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.825 mg/ml ATP, 0.75 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside). Solubilization was for 30 min at 4 °C under gently shaking. After centrifugation for 1 h at 30,000 rpm (Beckman 70Ti rotor), 20 ml of washing buffer WB500 (50 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.5, 500 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.15% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1.5 ml of 50% Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) under gentle shaking. The Ni2+-NTA resin was then washed three times with 12.5 ml of WB500, twice with 12.5 ml of WB250 (as WB500 with 250 mm KCl), and twice with 12.5 ml of WB50 (WB500 containing 50 mm KCl). At each washing step the resin was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C. Protein was eluted from the resin by washing twice with 2 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.5, 50 mm KCl, 500 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.075% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside), and concentrated to 200 μl by ultrafiltration using a Centricon 100 spin column. The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All experiments were repeated with three independent membrane preparations. Protein was reconstituted as described (27Lanfermeijer F.C. Venema K. Palmgren M.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) at a lipid to protein ratio of 200. Reconstitution was performed in 10 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.5, 50 mm K2SO4, and 20% glycerol. Proton transport using 1.5 μg of protein in a 3-ml reaction cuvette was assayed as described (28Venema K. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19659-19667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) by monitoring fluorescence quenching of ACMA, a dye which upon protonation accumulates in an impermeant form inside vesicles. The reaction medium contained 10 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.5, 1 mm ATP, and 50 mmK2SO4. The reaction was started by addition of 2 mm MgSO4. ATPase activity was determined as described (21Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). The assay medium (300 μl) contained 20 mm MOPS, 4 mm MgSO4, and 3 mm ATP. The pH was adjusted to pH 6.5 with N-methyl-d-glucamine. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C and initiated by the addition of 0.1 μg of membrane protein in reactivation buffer (GTED 20, 10 μg/μl l-α-phosphatidylcholine, 0.7% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside). Membrane fractions or purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide using the system of Fling and Gregerson (29Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described (30Jahn T. Fuglsang A.T. Olsson A. Bruntrup I.M. Collinge D.B. Volkmann D. Sommarin M. Palmgren M.G. Larsson C. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1805-1814PubMed Google Scholar). After electrotransfer of the proteins to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), the blot was incubated with an monoclonal antibody raised against the H+-ATPase (a kind gift from W. Michaelke), or an antibody against the RGSH4epitope present at the COOH terminus (Qiagen). Phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP was carried out at 0 °C in a medium containing 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 6.5, withN-methyl-d-glucamine, 1 μm[γ-32P]ATP, and 0.5 μg of purified proteins in reactivation buffer. The reaction was initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP and stopped by addition of 6 volumes of stop solution (1 mm ATP, 1 mm Pi, and 7.5% trichloroacetic acid). After centrifugation of the samples, the pellet was washed three times with stop solution before resuspension in 2% SDS. The radioactivity associated with the pellet was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Blank samples were obtained by addition of stop solution before [γ-32P]ATP. The dephosphorylation kinetics were followed by phosphorylation as described for 20 s and initiated by addition of either 10 mm EDTA or 10 mm EDTA + 2 mm ADP to the samples. Reactions was stopped with stop solution, and treated as described above. Purified membrane protein (5 μg) in reactivation buffer was preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C in 20 mm MOPS, 4 mm MgSO4, pH 6.5, withN-methyl-d-glucamine in the absence or presence of 3 mm ATP or 250 μm vanadate. Tosylamidophenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) was thereafter added to a final trypsin to protein ratio of 1:1.5. Trypsination was stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid, the protein pelleted by centrifugation, the pellet washed in acetone at −18 °C acetone, resuspended in SDS-loading buffer, and Western blotting done as described above. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar) with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard. In order to identify plasma membrane H+-ATPase residues involved in proton binding and transport, we used a COOH-terminal truncated version of AHA2 as the starting point. The COOH terminus of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2 is a regulatory domain containing autoinhibitory residues (26Axelsen K.B. Venema K. Jahn T. Baunsgaard L. Palmgren M.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7227-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and removal of this domain, which was done at the gene level, renders the enzyme constitutively active (21Regenberg B. Villalba J.M. Lanfermeijer F.C. Palmgren M.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 10: 1655-1666Google Scholar). The resulting construct, encoding an H+-ATPase devoid of the 73 COOH-terminal residues, was also supplied with an Arg-Gly-Ser-His6 tag in the COOH-terminal end to facilitate later purification efforts (27Lanfermeijer F.C. Venema K. Palmgren M.G. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and was named aha2Δ73. The mutant species studied in this work contained an Asn mutation in Asp684 situated in the presumed transmembrane helix 6. The corresponding residue is strictly conserved in Na+/K+-, H+/K+-, and Ca2+-ATPases, and in the SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase it coordinates both of the two Ca2+ ions bound (6Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). It therefore seemed plausible that in other related pumps, such as the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, this residue could play a role in coordinating cations. A complementation assay at different pH values was performed to test the activity of the Asp684 → Asn mutant protein in a yeast strain (RS-72) devoid of the endogenous plasma membrane H+-ATPase PMA1. In RS-72, expression of PMA1 is under control of the inducible galactose promoter. When expressed in RS-72 under control of the constitutive PMA1 promoter, aha2Δ73 could complement for the function of PMA1 (Fig. 1). When yeast growth was dependent upon the Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme, the cells could no longer grow in the absence of PMA1 (Fig. 1). That a substitution of Asp684 was unable to support yeast growth in the absence of PMA1 could have been due to a loss of a specific function of the enzyme. However, it also could have been due to a number of other phenomena, such as lack of targeting to the plasma membrane or improper folding of the newly synthesized enzyme. When yeast membranes were separated according to density by centrifugation through a continuous sucrose gradient, aha2Δ73 co-localized with PMA1 at about 43% (w/v) sucrose as expected (data not shown). Despite the lack of complementation of PMA1, the Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme also showed this distribution, and with accumulation levels 2–3-fold higher than that of aha2Δ73. Apparently, the enzyme carrying a replacement at position 684 was translated and targeted into the plasma membrane at levels even higher than those of the wild-type. Previously, plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2 was purified from the S. cerevisiae strain RS-72. This was a full-length version of the enzyme supplied with an NH2-terminal tag of six consecutive His residues allowing for affinity purification by Ni2+-NTA chromatography. For our purpose, we added the His-tag to the COOH terminus of aha2Δ73 (see above). Fig. 2shows a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel documenting the purity of the preparations. Surprisingly, the mutated H+-ATPase was able to hydrolyze ATP. ATPase specific activity of the Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme was approximately 20% compared with that of aha2Δ73: 1.9 ± 0.1 μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein for the Asp684→ Asn mutant compared with 11.6 ± 0.7 μmol of Pi/min/mg of protein for aha2Δ73. SimilarKm values for ATP in both the Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme (75 ± 10 μm ATP) and aha2Δ73 (107 ± 10 μm ATP) were found, demonstrating that the substitution at position 684 does not abolish the ability of the enzyme to bind nucleotides and hydrolyze ATP. When ATPase activity was measured as a function of pH, the Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme showed a bell-shaped pH dependence profile like aha2Δ73 but was moved slightly toward acidic pH (Fig. 3). This might indicate a somewhat lower H+ affinity of the Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme compared with aha2Δ73. The observation that the Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme did not complement apma1 mutation of yeast, despite its relatively high level of ATP hydrolytic activity, made it likely that no H+-transport accompanied ATP hydrolysis. We tested proton pumping in reconstituted proteoliposome vesicles using ACMA as a fluorescent ΔpH probe (Fig. 4). No H+-transport could be observed for the Asp684substitution, either in the absence (data not shown) or presence (Fig. 4) of the K+ ionophore valinomycin. Thus, the Asp684 substitution suffered from complete uncoupling between ATP hydrolysis and H+-transport. One reason for the observed deficiency in H+-transport by the Asp684 → Asn mutant protein could be due to a back-leak of protons through the enzyme. To inhibit the formation of a membrane potential, which could drive countertransport of protons, 150 nm valinomycin were added to the assay. No ACMA quenching could be observed for the reconstituted Asp684 → Asn mutant in the presence of valinomycin, whereas this K+ionophore stimulated proton pumping by aha2Δ73 approximately 3-fold. This result further supports the notion that the Asp684 → Asn mutant does not pump protons. One way to explain the kinetic abnormalities associated with the Asp684 substitution is to postulate a defect in the conformational change from E1P toE2P during which the transported cation is moved from one side of the membrane to the other. In order to gain more insight into the effect of the Asp684 substitution on the steady state E1-E2conformational equilibrium, we employed vanadate as a conformational probe. Vanadate is a transition state analogue of inorganic orthophosphate (32Cantley Jr., L.C. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7361-7368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and competes with binding of Pi to theE2 conformation of P-type ATPase by forming a stable complex with the ATPase, inhibiting enzyme activity. A measurement of vanadate sensitivity is therefore an indirect measurement of the relative length of time in the reaction cycle, that the ATPase spends in the E2 conformation. The Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme was found to be more than 1000-fold less sensitive toward vanadate than aha2Δ73 (Fig. 5). Asp684 is presumably buried in the membrane and is unlikely to contribute directly to the properties of the vanadate-binding site. Furthermore, since the Asp684 → Asn mutant has a near-normalKm for ATP and is phosphorylated via ATP, the nucleotide-binding site is most likely intact. The vanadate insensitivity can more reasonably be accounted for by a slowing of theE1P to E2P conformational change; as a result, the ATPase accumulates inE1P, which has a low affinity for orthovanadate. In PMA1 the pattern of proteolytic fragments obtained following digestion with relatively high amounts of trypsin has been used as a tool to distinguish between the E1 andE2 conformations (e.g. Ref. 33Ambesi A. Miranda M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20545-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purified aha2Δ73 enzyme as well as the Asp684 → Asn mutant was degraded by trypsin in the absence of ligands (Fig. 6). In the presence of MgATP (3 mm), a fragment of approximately 70 kDa remained protected from further degradation in both enzymes (Fig. 6). These results confirm that both enzymes are able to attain theE1 conformation involved in binding MgATP. Addition of vanadate (VO4, 250 μm) was capable of reproducibly protecting a 42-kDa band in the aha2Δ73 enzyme but did not have such an effect on the Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme (Fig. 6). This indicates that the Asp684→ Asn mutant in contrast to aha2Δ73, does not proceed to theE2 conformation. The failure of the Asp684 → Asn mutant enzyme to reach theE2 conformation could be due to a block in one of the steps in the catalytic cycle following binding of ATP. To explore whether the catalytic cycle of the Asp684substitution was blocked before or after phosphorylation of the enzyme by ATP, the amount of phosphorylated intermediate was measured under steady-state conditions for both aha2Δ73 and the Asp684→ Asn mutant (Fig. 7 A). Under steady state conditions, the amount of phosphorylated intermediate (EP) was found to be approximately four times higher in the Asp684 → Asn mutant compared with aha2Δ73 (Fig. 7 A). This result indicates that the catalytic machinery in the Asp684 → Asn mutant is blocked after phosphorylation at a step prior to dephosphorylation, and as such could be blocked in the E1P-E2P transition. The stability of the phosphorylated intermediate was sensitive to ADP and disappeared within a second after addition of this nucleotide (Fig. 7 B). Since E1P, in contrast to E2P, is able to transfer the phosphate group to ADP, our data strongly suggests that the enzyme is blocked in the E1P state. The purification of a heterologously expressed P-type ATPase from transgenic yeast described in this work yields pure protein of high specific activity. The method is shown to be applicable to wild-type and mutant plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2 prot"

Stimulation of cells with a wide variety of inducers results in proteolytic degradation of these IκB proteins, leading to activation of NF-κB. The present study shows that interleukin-1 (IL-1) causes persistent activation of NF-κB in glial cells. Stimulation with IL-1 also causes rapid but transient degradation of IκB-α and IκB-ε. However, NF-κB remains active even after these IκB isoforms have returned to control levels. In contrast, the IκB-β isoform fails to reappear following its initial degradation by IL-1, coincident with sustained activation of NF-κB. In addition, in vivo overexpression of the various IκB isoforms revealed that IκB-β is the only isoform that has the ability to inhibit IL-1-induced NF-κB-driven transcription. The findings also suggest that the inability of IκB-α and IκB-ε to modulate NF-κB activity is due to their modification in vivo. These findings indicate that IκB-β is the key regulator of the activity of NF-κB in human glial cells.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kawakami K. Scheidereit C. Roeder R.G Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4700-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). NF-κB exists in the cytosol of resting cells as a homo- or heterodimer of proteins of the Rel family of transcription factors. Each member of this family contains a conserved N-terminal region called the Rel-homology domain, which contains the DNA-binding domain, the dimerization domain, and the nuclear localization signal (3Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Liou H.C. Tempst P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 961-969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To date, five Rel-related NF-κB proteins have been identified in mammalian cells: p65 (Rel A), Rel B, the proto-oncogene c-rel, p50/p105, and p52/p100. The transcriptional activity of the Rel proteins is tightly regulated by their association with members of the inhibitory molecule family, IκB (4May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Several IκB isoforms have been identified, but the most extensively characterized isoforms are IκB-α, IκB-β, and IκB-ε. This family of proteins share conserved motifs referred to as ankyrin repeats, which are required for their association with the Rel homology region of the NF-κB proteins. This association has two functions. First, IκB sequesters NF-κB in the cytosol by masking its nuclear localization signal through direct protein-protein interactions, and second, IκB can prevent NF-κB from binding to DNA by masking its DNA-binding domain (5Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to certain stimuli, e.g. the cytokines, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor or bacterial and viral products such as LPS, double-stranded RNA, and the Tax protein from the human T-cell leukemia virus 1, causes phosphorylation of IκB on two specific N-terminal serines: Ser-32 and Ser-36 on IκB-α (6Brown K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Such signal-induced phosphorylation is believed to be carried out by the newly discovered IκB kinases (10Regnier C.H.

This allows translocation of active NF-κB to the nucleus, where it binds to its consensus sequences within the promoter regions of genes, thus activating transcription (15Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A.

In addition to the signal-induced phosphorylation of the IκBs, it has also been shown that sites of constitutive phosphorylation exist within the C-terminal PEST (proline-, glutamic acid-, serine- and threonine-rich) domains of IκB-α and -β, which affect intrinsic protein stability (18Van Antwerp D.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6037-6045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell.

Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22377-22380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Casein kinase II has been shown to be responsible for this phosphorylation, which occurs preferentially on Ser-293 in IκB-α (20Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Ser-313 and Ser-315 in IκB-β (21McKinsey T.A. Chu Z.L. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22377-22380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation is required for efficient turnover of free IκB-α and IκB-β but is not involved in signal-induced IκB phosphorylation. The mechanism of degradation following this basal phosphorylation has yet to be characterized. Following stimulation, the nature of NF-κB activation may be transient or persistent, depending entirely on the cellular stimulus. Tumor necrosis factor and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate cause rapid but transient activation of NF-κB (22Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Typically, activity peaks within 30 min, followed by a return to basal activity within 4–6 h. In contrast, stimulation with IL-1, LPS, or the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus 1 Tax protein tends to result in long term persistent activation of NF-κB, which has been shown to last for up to 48 h (8McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. Al-Murrani S.W. Green P.L. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these studies reported that all stimuli of NF-κB activation cause degradation of IκB-α, whereas IκB-β is only degraded by those inducers that cause long term persistent activation of NF-κB. Preliminary studies on the recently discovered IκB-ε indicate that this isoform may also be degraded by all inducers of NF-κB (9Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Hence, it has been suggested that differential patterns of degradation of the IκB isoforms represent an important mechanism in the regulation of NF-κB activation. Previous work has shown that NF-κB activation is sustained in glial cells in response to stimulation with IL-1 (23Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Moynagh P.N. Williams D.C. O'Neill L.A.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2681-2690PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic basis for this persistent activation of NF-κB was not resolved. This is of clinical relevance, because the sustained activation of NF-κB in brain cells may lead to prolonged induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and chemokines that will facilitate cerebral recruitment of leukocytes, culminating in the generation of neuropathological states. The purpose of this study was to examine the relative importance of the IκB isoforms (α, β, and ε) in regulating the temporal activation of NF-κB in glial cells. We show that prolonged disappearance of IκB-β in response to IL-1 underlies concurrent sustained activation of NF-κB, and we provide direct evidence for the first time that NF-κB in glial cells is subject to selective inactivation by the β form of the IκB members. The human astrocytoma cell line 1321N1 was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK).

The C-terminal histidine-tagged recombinant forms of IκB-α, IκB-β, and IκB-ε were gifts from Jorg Eder (Novartis Pharma AG, Switzerland) and have been described previously (25Heilker R. Freuler F. Vanek M. Pulfer R. Kobel T. Peter J. Zerwes H.G. Hofstetter H. Eder J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6231-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The human astrocytoma cell line, 1321N1, was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) of fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All cells were passaged using 1% (w/v) of trypsin in DMEM. IL-1β stimulation was performed on cells in serum-containing medium at 37 °C for all experiments. 1321N1 astrocytoma were seeded into 25-cm2 flasks (5 ml; 2 × 105 cells/ml) and allowed to adhere for 72 h before stimulation. Cells were exposed to IL-1β for various times. Stimulation was terminated by removal of medium followed by washing of the adherent cells with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS. Washed cells were scraped into 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF). Cells were pelleted in hypotonic buffer by centrifugation at 21,000 ×g for 10 min and then lysed for 10 min on ice in hypotonic buffer (35 μl) containing 0.1% (v/v) of Nonidet P-40. Lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants constituted cytosolic extracts and were removed to new Minifuge tubes and stored at −20 °C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.9 (25 μl), containing 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated for 15 min on ice. Incubations were then centrifuged at 21,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatants were transferred to 10 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer, pH 7.9 (75 μl), containing 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmDTT. Such samples constituted nuclear extracts. Protein concentrations of the cytosolic and nuclear extracts were determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). All of the above steps were carried out at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts (4–10 μg of protein) were incubated with 20,000 dpm of a 22-bp oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence, which previously had been labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Incubations were performed for 30 min at room temperature in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 4% (w/v) glycerol, 4 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 mg/ml nuclease-free BSA. In the supershift analysis, polyclonal antisera (1 μl) against the NF-κB subunits p65, p50, p52, and c-rel were added to the extracts and incubated for 30 min on ice prior to incubation with labeled oligonucleotide. IκB-α, IκB-β, and IκB-ε were examined for their modulation of the DNA binding activity of NF-κB by incubating the extracts in the absence and presence of recombinant forms of IκB (1 μg) for 30 min at room temperature prior to incubation with labeled oligonucleotide. All incubations were subjected to electrophoresis on 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels that were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. Cytosolic extracts (20 μg of protein) were boiled in an equal volume of 2× sample buffer for 5 min prior to loading. 2× sample buffer consisted of 0.125m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 20% (w/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 1.4 m 2-β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The extracts and biotinylated molecular mass markers (14–100 kDa) were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 12% (w/v) resolving gel. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and blocked by overnight incubation at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl (TBS) and 5% (w/v) powdered milk (Marvel). The blots were washed three times (10 min each) in TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS) and then incubated for 2 h with primary polyclonal antibody against IκB-α or IκB-β (1 μg/ml) or antiserum against IκB-ε (1:2000) diluted in TTBS containing 1% (w/v) powdered milk (Marvel). The blots were subsequently washed in TTBS before incubation for 45 min with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution) and horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:5000 dilution). The blots were washed, and immunoreactive bands were detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection system from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA was extracted from cells by guanidinium thiocyanate and isolated as described previously (28Trienzenberg S.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 4.2.4-4.2.6Google Scholar). Total RNA (12 μg per sample) was separated by 1% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred overnight onto nylon membranes by capillary action. The RNA was cross-linked to the membranes by exposing to 120,000 μJ/cm2 for 30 s within the Stratagene Stratalinker UV cross-linker. The membranes were incubated at 42 °C for 15 min in a solution containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Radiolabeling of IκB-α, IκB-β, IκB-ε, and human β-actin cDNA probes was achieved by nick translation with [α-32P]dATP using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and DNase I (28Trienzenberg S.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 4.2.4-4.2.6Google Scholar). The probes were added to the hybridization solution at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, and hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C with rotation. The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS and twice with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature (low stringency). Two further washes were carried out using 0.2× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS at 42 °C (medium stringency), followed by two final washes with 0.1× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS at 68 °C (high stringency). High stringency washes were carried out on the IκB-α, IκB-β, and β-actin blots. IκB-ε was detected under medium stringency conditions. The blots were then rinsed in 2× SSC, covered in UV-transparent wrap, and autoradiographed at −70 °C for 72 h. The pCMV4-IκB-α, pCMV4-IκB-β, and pcDNA3β-IκB-ε constructs were described previously (8McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. Al-Murrani S.W. Green P.L. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). For control transfections, the empty pCMV4 vector was used. Human 1321N1 astrocytoma were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml and allowed to grow until confluent. Cells were trypsinized, and 1 × 107 cells were transfected by electroporation (using the Invitrogen Electroporator II) with 3 μg of NF-κB luciferase construct and 6 μg of either pCMV4, pCMV4-IκB-α, pCMV4-IκB-β, or pcDNA3β-IκB-ε. As an internal control for transfection efficiency, 2 μg of pHook-β-gal plasmid was co-transfected for all experiments. Aliquots (3 ml) of cells were then seeded into 6-well plates (4 × 105cells/well), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 48 h. Cells were then treated with or without IL-1β (10 ng/ml), and cellular extracts were prepared 12 h later using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Extracts were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using kits from Promega and Stratagene, respectively, according to the instructions of the manufacturers. Nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated and IL-1β-treated human 1321N1 astrocytoma and assayed for NF-κB activity by EMSA (Fig. 1). Trace levels of basal NF-κB activation were apparent in the form of faint DNA·protein complexes in extracts from unstimulated cells. Rapid and sustained activation of NF-κB was observed in response to stimulation with IL-1β and was represented as the appearance of a NF-κB·DNA complex of slow electrophoretic mobility. NF-κB activity was detectable after 5-min stimulation and remained for at least 72 h. Unbound radioactive probe migrated freely through the gel and appeared as a dark band at the bottom of the gel. The subunit composition of the NF-κB complexes induced by IL-1 was investigated by incubating nuclear extracts from IL-1-stimulated cells with antisera against p50, p65, p52, or c-rel and observing the effects on the electrophoretic mobility of the NF-κB·DNA complexes (Fig. 1 B). IL-1-induced complexes were unaffected by pretreatment with anti-c-rel, p52, and the non-immune IgG isotype control. In contrast, anti-p65 caused a reduction in the levels of the IL-1-induced complexes with the concomitant appearance of two supershifted complexes of slow electrophoretic mobility. The anti-p50 antibody also caused a reduction in the levels of the IL-1-induced complexes, albeit not to the same extent as the anti-p65 antibody, with the associated appearance of a single supershifted complex. The latter shows a similar mobility to the faster moving supershifted complex using anti-p65, suggesting that it consists of a p50·p65 heterodimeric complex. The supershifted complex of slowest electrophoretic mobility, using the anti-p65 antibody, is not formed by the other antibody, thus suggesting that this complex represents a p65·p65 homodimer. This would indicate that the IL-1-induced NF-κB complexes consist primarily of p50·p65 and p65·p65 dimers. Because the levels of NF-κB are controlled by the IκB isoforms, it was decided to probe the effects of IL-1 in relation to the levels of the three IκB isoforms (α, β, and ε) in an attempt to explain the underlying mechanisms to sustained activation of NF-κB in these cells. Cytosolic extracts were prepared from unstimulated and IL-1β-treated human 1321N1 astrocytoma and assessed for IκB-α protein levels by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A). High levels of IκB-α were detectable in cytosolic extracts from unstimulated cells. IκB-α was rapidly degraded upon stimulation with IL-1 and was undetectable in the cytosol after only 5 min of stimulation. This degradation was transient because the level of IκB-α returned to basal values after 1 h and remained at this level for up to 72 h. To characterize the mechanism of the transient degradation, the levels of mRNA encoding IκB-α were measured after IL-1 treatment. Total RNA extracts were prepared from unstimulated and IL-1β-treated human 1321N1 astrocytoma and assessed for IκB-α mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). A very low level of IκB-α mRNA expression was detectable in extracts from unstimulated cells. The expression of IκB-α mRNA was rapidly up-regulated within 30 min of IL-1 treatment and reached peak levels by 1 h. This up-regulation was sustained because levels remained elevated for at least 24 h. These findings are consistent with the rapid reappearance of the IκB-α protein in the cytosol of these cells, as detected by Western immunoblotting. The same blot was then reprobed for the housekeeping gene, β-actin. As expected, IL-1 had no effect on the expression of β-actin mRNA. The transient disappearance of IκB-α did not correlate with the sustained activation of NF-κB, suggesting that the other forms of IκB may be more important in regulating NF-κB. The regulation of IκB-β by IL-1 was next examined. Cytosolic extracts were prepared from unstimulated and IL-1β-treated cells and assessed for IκB-β protein levels by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A). High levels of IκB-β were detectable in cytosolic extracts from unstimulated cells. IκB-β was degraded more slowly than IκB-α upon stimulation with IL-1; high levels of IκB-β remained detectable in the cytosol after 5 min of stimulation. However, by 30 min of stimulation, IκB-β was undetectable. In contrast to IκB-α, IκB-β degradation was sustained, because the levels remained undetectable over most of the time points for up to 72 h. The mechanism of regulation of IκB-β was next assessed by characterizing the regulation of mRNA levels of IκB-β by IL-1. Total RNA extracts were prepared from unstimulated and IL-1β-treated cells and assessed for IκB-β mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 B). A low level of IκB-β mRNA expression was detectable in extracts from unstimulated cells. In contrast to IκB-α mRNA expression, the expression of IκB-β mRNA did not change from basal levels upon stimulation with IL-1. However the prolonged disappearance of IκB-β protein in response to IL-1 indicates that translation of IκB-β may be blocked or that IL-1 causes its continuous degradation. The sustained disappearance of IκB-β correlates well with prolonged activation of NF-κB, suggesting a crucial role for IκB-β in regulating NF-κB in glial cells. However, the relative role of IκB-ε remained to be determined. Cytosolic extracts were prepared from unstimulated and IL-1β-treated cells and assessed for IκB-ε protein levels by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 A). High levels of IκB-ε were detectable in cytosolic extracts from unstimulated cells. IκB-ε was degraded more slowly than IκB-α in response to IL-1; IκB-ε remained detectable in the cytosol after 5- and 30-min stimulation. However, similar to IκB-α, IκB-ε degradation was transient. The amount of IκB-ε returned to basal levels after 3 h of stimulation and remained at this level up to 72 h. Again, the basis of this resynthesis was assessed at the level of mRNA. Total RNA extracts were prepared from unstimulated and IL-1β-treated cells and assessed for IκB-ε mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4 B). A very low level of IκB-ε mRNA expression was detectable in extracts from unstimulated cells. The expression of IκB-ε mRNA was up-regulated upon stimulation with IL-1 and reached peak levels by 3 h. These findings are consistent with the rapid reappearance of the IκB-ε protein in the cytosol of these cells, as detected by Western blot. These findings suggest circumstantially that the IκB-β isoform is the crucial form in controlling the activity status of NF-κB in glial cells. However, the reappearance of IκB-α and -ε with no coincident reduction in NF-κB levels questions the role, if any, of these isoforms in controlling the activity of NF-κB in glial cells. To examine directly the relative contributions of each of the IκB isoforms in controlling NF-κB, genes encoding the three forms were cotransfected with a NF-κB-regulated reporter gene and examined for their inhibitory potential on the induction of the reporter gene. 1321N1 astrocytoma were transfected with the various expression vectors for the IκB isoforms, and the resulting cell lysates were analyzed for expression of the respective proteins by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 A). Lane 1corresponds to cells transfected with empty pCMV4 vector, and no IκB proteins were detectable in these extracts. It must be noted that these extracts contained considerably less protein than those in Figs. 2 A, 3 A, and 4 A, in which 20 μg of protein had been loaded per lane compared with 0.2 μg in this case. This explains why endogenous levels of the IκB isoforms were undetectable in these blots. Lanes 2, 3, and4, corresponding to cells transfected with expression vectors encoding IκB-α, IκB-β, and IκB-ε, respectively, show high levels of the respective IκB isoforms. This experiment confirms that the transfected plasmids are being expressed efficientlyin vivo. 1321N1 astrocytoma were co-transfected with the plasmids containing cDNAs encoding the various IκB proteins and a κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene and were subsequently stimulated in the absence and presence of IL-1. Cells lysates were then prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity (Fig. 5 B). In the presence of empty pCMV4 vector, IL-1 strongly induced transcription of the reporter gene (an 11-fold induction over control). IL-1 induced similar levels of luciferase expression in the presence of co-transfected IκB-α or IκB-ε. Therefore, expression of IκB-α or IκB-ε had no effect on κB-dependent transcription induced by IL-1. In contrast, cotra"
https://openalex.org/W2059957352,"The human hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS) gene is highly expressed in human megakaryoblastic cells, in which phorbol ester induces its expression. We characterized the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 (−1044 to +290) of the human H-PGDS gene in human megakaryoblastic Dami cells. Transient expression analysis using the luciferase reporter gene revealed that the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 were sufficient for efficient expression of the H-PGDS gene in Dami cells, but not in monocytic U937 cells. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the Oct-1 element in the 5′-flanking region decreased the promoter activity by ∼30% compared with that of the entire region from −1044 to +290. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that Oct-1 specifically bound to the promoter region. Interestingly, even only untranslated exon 1 (+1 to +290) showed ∼60% of the promoter activity of the entire region from −1044 to +290. Site-directed mutagenesis of the AP-2 element within the untranslated exon 1 abolished the basal promoter activity as well as its phorbol ester-mediated up-regulation. In AP-2-deficient HepG2 cells, the H-PGDS promoter activity was enhanced by coexpression with AP-2α. These findings indicate that the Oct-1 element in the 5′-flanking region acts as a positive cis-acting element and that the AP-2 element in the untranslated exon 1 is crucial for both basal and phorbol ester-mediated up-regulation of human H-PGDS gene expression in megakaryoblastic Dami cells.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). H-PGDS was crystallized, and its tertiary structure was determined, with a resolution of 2.3 Å by x-ray diffraction analysis, to possess a unique catalytic site within a wide cleft near the GSH-binding site (15Kanaoka Y.

Recently, the critical amino acid residues involved in the catalysis of H-PGDS were identified by a site-directed mutation study (18Pinzar E. Miyano M. Kanaoka Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31239-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the basis of molecular evolutional study, H-PGDS was shown to be a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family with significant homology to the invertebrate Sigma class GST. Since the Sigma class GST had been observed only in invertebrates, H-PGDS is the first identified vertebrate homolog of the Sigma class GST. Recently, we isolated the human and mouse genes for H-PGDS and determined the chromosomal positions to be 4q21-22 and 3B-C, respectively (17Kanaoka Y. Fujimori K. Kikuno R. Sakaguchi Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The positions of introns in the coding region were completely conserved between H-PGDSs and invertebrate Sigma class GSTs, indicating that H-PGDSs and invertebrate Sigma class GSTs evolved from a common ancestral gene (17Kanaoka Y. Fujimori K. Kikuno R. Sakaguchi Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also found that the expression profiles of the H-PGDS mRNAs were completely different among animal species (17Kanaoka Y. Fujimori K. Kikuno R. Sakaguchi Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, H-PGDS mRNA was actively expressed in human megakaryoblastic cell lines such as CMK11 and Dami (10Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Kanaoka Y. Sato T. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which had been established from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (19Komatsu N. Suda T.

In these cell lines, the expression of H-PGDS mRNA was induced by treatment of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (10Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Kanaoka Y. Sato T. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Mahmud I. Ueda N. Yamaguchi H. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Kanaoka Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

However, little is known about the activation mechanisms, including PMA-mediated induction, of human H-PGDS gene expression. To understand the regulatory mechanism for transcription of the human H-PGDS gene, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 of the gene and investigated thecis-acting elements and the trans-acting factors responsible for the transcriptional activation, including the PMA-mediated up-regulation, of the H-PGDS gene in megakaryoblastic Dami cells. This is the first report about the characterization of the transcriptional regulation of a gene in the Sigma class GST family. The human cell lines CMK11-5, Dami (megakaryoblastic leukemia), U937 (monocytic lymphoma), and HepG2 (hepatoblastoma) were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Total RNA was prepared from CMK11-5 cells as described previously (17Kanaoka Y. Fujimori K. Kikuno R. Sakaguchi Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and purified to poly(A)+ RNA with Oligotex-dT30 (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). A 27-mer antisense primer was synthesized (5′-AGGCCAGTCAGCTTGTTCTATTCTGTG-3′, corresponding to the cDNA sequence spanning positions +130 to +104) and labeled with an infrared dye, IRD41 (Nisshinbo, Tokyo, Japan), at its 5′-end. One μg of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from CMK11-5 cells or human placenta (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was dissolved in 20 μl of a solution containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 40 mm PIPES (pH 6.4) and mixed with the IRD41-labeled primer (1 pmol). The reaction mixtures were denatured at 80 °C for 15 min and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Hybridization products were precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) containing 75 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmdithiothreitol, to which were added 1 mm dNTPs and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation at 42 °C for 1 h, the samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in gel loading buffer containing 95% (v/v) formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.6), 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and analyzed on a 6% Long Ranger and 7 m urea sequencing gel (FMC Corp. BioProducts, Rockland, ME) in 1.2× Tris borate/EDTA (106.8 mm Tris borate and 2.4 mm EDTA). Signals were detected with an automated DNA sequencer system (Model 4000, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Total RNAs were prepared as described previously (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar) and used for reverse transcription-PCR analysis. The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with oligo(dT) adapter primer (Takara Shuzo) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Takara Shuzo) at 50 °C for 30 min after denaturation at 72 °C for 3 min. Nested PCR was performed with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo) and 1 μl of the reverse transcription reaction products with the following gene-specific primer sets for AP-2 subtypes. The first PCR step was carried out with the M13M4 primer (Takara Shuzo) and primer AP-2αF (5′-ATGCTTTGGAAATTGACGGATAATATC-3′ for AP-2α), AP-2βF (5′-ATGCTCTGGAAGCTTGTGGAG-3′ for AP-2β), or AP-2γF (5′-ATGTTGTGGAAAATAACCGATAATGTC-3′ for AP-2γ). In the nested PCR, AP-2αF and AP-2αR (5′-GTTTGATCTGGGATGTTAATACCC-3′), AP-2βF and AP-2βR (5′-ATAGATTCATGCCGCTGTTATTG-3′), and AP-2γF and AP-2γR (5′-GTGGGGCAGCAGCAGGTCGGAGC-3′) were used. PCR was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and PCR amplification for 20 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 74 °C for 40 cycles. The resultant PCR products were electrophoretically analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel. An ∼1.3-kilobase pair fragment (−1044 to +290) consisting of the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 of the human H-PGDS gene was amplified by PCR with the gene-specific primer sets withHindIII (sense) and BglII (antisense) sites at their respective 5′-ends. PCR fragments doubly digested withHindIII and BglII were cloned into the upstream region of the luciferase reporter gene of the pGL3-Enhancer vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase reporter construct carrying the promoter region from −1044 to +290 is designated as −1044/+290. A deletion series of the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 was constructed in the same manner. Site-directed mutations were introduced into the putative cis-acting elements by PCR using mutated primers. All constructs were subjected to nucleotide sequencing to verify the correct sequence and orientation. Cells grown to ∼70% confluence were cotransfected with each construct (1 μg) and pRL-SV40 (0.2 μg; Promega) carrying theRenilla luciferase gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter as the internal control. Transfection was achieved with Effectene reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and cell extracts were prepared. The luciferase activities were measured by a microplate luminometer (Lucy 1, Anthos, Salzburg, Austria) and a dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Each value was normalized to that of the Renilla luciferase control. The reporter activity of each construct was calculated relative to that of the pGL3-Enhancer vector, which was defined as 1. All transfections were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. The relative promoter activities are indicated as means ± S.D. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (H1 from −374 to −335 and H2 from +210 to +254) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The32P-labeled probe was mixed with nuclear extracts (5 μg) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mmNaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and then incubated in the presence or absence of the competitor probes for 20 min at room temperature. The Oct-1 oligonucleotide (5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′), the Oct-1 mutant oligonucleotide (5′-TGTCGAATGCAAGCCACTAGAA-3′, the mutated nucleotides are underlined), the AP-2 oligonucleotide (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′), and the AP-2 mutant oligonucleotide (5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCTTGCGGCCCGT-3′, the mutated nucleotides are underlined) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For the supershift assay, nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-Oct-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. The mixtures were analyzed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris acetate/EDTA (40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and analyzed with an FLA2000 fluorescent imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). The coding region of AP-2α cDNA (23Williams T. Admon A. Lüscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using AP-2αF as the sense primer and 5′-TCACTTTCTGTGCTTCTCCTCTTTGTC-3′ as the antisense primer. The resultant PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA1.1/Amp expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) through cloning into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). HepG2 cells were cotransfected with the AP-2α expression vector and the −1044/+290 construct; and after 72 h, the luciferase activities were measured as described above. Previously, we isolated the gene for human H-PGDS (17Kanaoka Y. Fujimori K. Kikuno R. Sakaguchi Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the transcription initiation sites and the nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 of the human H-PGDS gene (Fig. 1,A and B). The transcription initiation sites of the human H-PGDS gene were identified by primer extension analysis with poly(A)+ RNAs from human CMK11-5 cells and placenta. In both mRNAs, two predominant transcription initiation sites were detected, one at 299 base pairs and the other at 270 base pairs upstream from the A of the ATG initiation codon for translation. The transcription initiation site at 299 base pairs upstream from the ATG codon was defined as position +1. Neither the typical TATA nor CAAT box was identified around the transcription initiation sites. The 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 of the human H-PGDS gene contained several potential cis-acting elements recognized by the transcription factors that may play roles in the regulation of the human H-PGDS gene, including one Oct-1 element (position −357), five GATA elements (positions −912, −534, −307, +82, and +204), two PEA3 elements (positions +153 and +172), one CRE-like element (position +217), and one AP-2 element (position +227) (Fig. 1 B). Previous studies have shown that human megakaryoblastic cell lines such as CMK11-5 and Dami abundantly express H-PGDS mRNA (10Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Kanaoka Y. Sato T. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Mahmud I. Ueda N. Yamaguchi H. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Kanaoka Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28263-28266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, monocytic U937 cells did not express H-PGDS mRNA (data not shown). Since the transfection of Dami cells was more efficient than that of CMK11-5 cells (data not shown), we used Dami cells as the cell line expressing H-PGDS mRNA and U937 cells as one not expressing it for further studies of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the human H-PGDS gene. To define the regulatory elements for the cell type-specific expression of the human H-PGDS gene, we cloned a series of deletion constructs of the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 into a luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Enhancer vector, and transfected Dami or U937 cells with it. When the −1044/+290 construct was used for transfection, efficient reporter activity was detected in Dami cells, but was negligible in U937 cells (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the promoter region from −1044 to +290 contains the cis-acting element(s) for the Dami cell-specific expression of the human H-PGDS gene. No activity was detected when the longest region in the reverse orientation (+290 to −1044) was used as the promoter (Fig. 2), indicating that this promoter activity is orientation-specific. Progressive deletion analysis of the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 revealed that the deletion from −1044 to −527 led to an ∼15% increase in promoter activity, suggesting the presence of a suppressor element(s) in this region. Further deletion from −1044 to −335 reduced the reporter activity by nearly 30% compared with that of the −1044/+290 construct (Fig. 2), suggesting that a positive cis-acting element(s) lies in the region from −526 to −335. As we had found one Oct-1 element at position −357, we introduced a mutation into this element to verify whether Oct-1 was functional. Expression of the construct with the mutated Oct-1 element in Dami cells resulted in an ∼30% decrease in the reporter activity compared with the activity of the −1044/+290 construct, and this reduction was almost the same as that caused by the deletion from −1044 to −335 (Fig. 2). EMSA with the double-stranded H1 oligonucleotide containing the Oct-1 element and nuclear extracts prepared from Dami cells demonstrated the presence of one major DNA-protein complex (Fig. 3, lane 2). This DNA-protein complex was not formed in the absence of nuclear extracts (lane 1). The formation of the complex was inhibited by the addition of a 10- or 50-fold excess amount of the unlabeled H1 oligonucleotide (lanes 3 and 4) or of a 50-fold excess amount of the authentic Oct-1 oligonucleotide (lane 7), but was not affected by a 100-fold excess amount of the unrelated pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (lane 6) or the authentic Oct-1 mutant oligonucleotide (lane 8). In the supershift assay, the DNA-protein complex migrated slower upon the addition of anti-Oct-1 antibody (lane 5). Thus, Oct-1 could bind to the human H-PGDS promoter and up-regulate the level of transcription. In the analysis of the promoter activity as described above, deletion between +86 and +256 of the untranslated exon 1 completely abolished the reporter activity. To determine the promoter region and the putative cis-acting element(s) within the untranslated exon 1 of the human H-PGDS gene, we transfected Dami cells with a series of the deleted untranslated exon 1 fused with the luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 4, the untranslated exon 1 (the +1/+290 construct) as a promoter showed ∼60% of the reporter activity compared with that of the −1044/+290 construct. A lack of the region from +222 to +290 decreased this activity by ∼90%. On the other hand, deletion of the region from +257 to +290 did not reduce this reporter activity. These results indicate that the region from +222 to +256 is crucial for basal expression. Since this region contains one each of the GATA, CRE-like, and AP-2 elements, a site-directed mutation was introduced into the GATA, CRE-like, and/or AP-2 elements to investigate the possible function(s) of these cis-acting elements (Fig. 4). The reporter activity upon introduction of the mutation into the AP-2 element was decreased by ∼90% compared with that of the +1/+290 construct, whereas the mutation in the GATA or CRE-like element did not affect the reporter activity (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the AP-2 element is essential for the basal expression of the human H-PGDS gene in Dami cells. Binding of the nuclear factor(s) specific for the region from +222 to +256 was demonstrated by EMSA in which the double-stranded H2 oligonucleotide containing CRE-like and AP-2 elements was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from Dami cells. As shown in Fig. 5, one major DNA-protein complex was observed (lane 1). The specificity of this DNA-protein complex was shown by the competition experiment, in which the amount of the complex was significantly diminished by the addition of a 20- or 100-fold excess amount of the unlabeled H2 oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 3) or of a 50-fold excess amount of the authentic AP-2 oligonucleotide (lane 5). However, the complex formation was not inhibited by a 100-fold excess amount of the unrelated pBluescript vector (lane 4) or by a 50-fold excess amount of the authentic AP-2 mutant oligonucleotide (lane6). Therefore, AP-2 could bind to the untranslated exon 1 of the human H-PGDS gene. To identify the region involved in the enhanced transcription by PMA, we measured the promoter activity of deleted or mutated promoter-luciferase constructs in the presence or absence of PMA in Dami cells (Fig. 4). The reporter activity of the +1/+290 construct was enhanced ∼5-fold by PMA treatment. Almost the same -fold induction was detected when the −1044/+290 construct was used (data not shown). Deletion analysis demonstrated that PMA responsiveness was completely abolished when the region from +222 to +256 containing CRE-like and AP-2 elements was deleted (Fig. 4). Site-directed mutation of CRE-like and/or AP-2 element(s) demonstrated that mutation of the AP-2 element abolished the PMA responsiveness; in contrast, mutation of the CRE-like element did not affect PMA-mediated up-regulation in Dami cells (Fig. 4). These results clearly indicate that the AP-2 element within the untranslated exon 1 also contributes to the PMA-mediated up-regulation of the human H-PGDS gene in Dami cells. The AP-2 subtype expressed in Dami cells was determined by reverse transcription-PCR using each gene-specific primer set for AP-2α, AP-2β, or AP-2γ (Fig. 6 A). In Dami cells, AP-2α mRNA expression was detected (second lane), but the mRNA expression of the other subtypes (AP-2β and AP-2γ) was below the detection limit under our experimental conditions (third and fourth lanes). For further examination of AP-2 as a transcriptional activator, the expression vector carrying the human AP-2α cDNA was constructed and used to transfect HepG2 cells, which have been shown to be deficient in AP-2 activity (23Williams T. Admon A. Lüscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The reporter activity of the −1044/+290 construct in HepG2 cells increased upon coexpression with the expression vector for human AP-2α, and the increase was AP-2α dose-dependent (Fig. 6 B). These results, taken together, indicate that AP-2α activates human H-PGDS gene expression in Dami cells. Previous studies have shown that the H-PGDS gene is highly expressed in human megakaryoblastic cells and that its transcription can be induced by PMA (10Suzuki T. Watanabe K. Kanaoka Y. Sato T. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Mahmud I. Ueda N. Yamaguchi H. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Kanaoka Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28263-28266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the expression profiles of H-PGDS genes are divergent among animal species (17Kanaoka Y. Fujimori K. Kikuno R. Sakaguchi Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To date, however, there has been no study on the regulation of H-PGDS gene expression. In this study, we characterized, for the first time, the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 of the human H-PGDS gene to elucidate its regulatory mechanisms. Our proposed model of the activation mechanism of human H-PGDS gene expression in megakaryoblastic Dami cells is shown in Fig. 7. Two transcription initiation sites were identified by primer extension analysis to be 299 and 270 base pairs upstream from the ATG translation initiation codon (Fig. 1 A). Neither the typical TATA nor CAAT box was found near either transcription initiation site. This finding is in agreement with the fact that multiple initiation sites are often observed in genes utilizing a TATA-less promoter (24Widen S.G. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16992-16998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Weis L. Reinberg D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Like the human H-PGDS gene, the human cyclooxygenase-1 and thromboxane synthase genes involved in prostanoid biosynthesis also have TATA-less promoters with multiple transcription initiation sites (26Wang L.-H. Hajibeigi A. Xu X.-M. Loose-Mitchell D. Wu K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Lee K.-D. Baek S.J. Shen R.-F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Transient expression assays with a series of the human H-PGDS promoter-luciferase constructs demonstrated that an ∼1.3-kilobase pair region covering the 5′-flanking region and the untranslated exon 1 of the human H-PGDS gene had efficient promoter activity in megakaryoblastic Dami cells, but not in monocytic U937 cells (Fig. 2). In the human H-PGDS promoter, at least two regions (−526 to −335 and +222 to +256) are critical for cell type-specific expression in Dami cells. For the region from −526 to −335, the EMSA and site-directed mutation studies demonstrated that Oct-1 bound to ATGCAAAT (−357 to −350), which is a perfect match with the Oct-1 consensus sequence (28Sturm R.A. Das G. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1582-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and was probably responsible for the trans-activation of this element. However, in the luciferase reporter assay, deletion of the region containing the Oct-1 element caused only a 30% decrease compared with the activity found with the −1044/+290 construct (Fig. 2). Thus, Oct-1 can be considered to function as a minor transcriptional activator for the human H-PGDS gene. Efficient transcriptional activation through Oct-1 is dependent on the interaction with coactivators such as VP-16 (29O'Hare P. Goding C.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 435-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and Pit-1 (30Voss J. Wison L. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 5: 1309-1320Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional coactivators might be needed for more efficient transcriptional activation of the human H-PGDS gene via the Oct-1 element. The most important cis-acting element was located in the region from +222 to +256 containing CRE-like and AP-2 elements within the untranslated exon 1. Deletion and site-directed mutation of the AP-2 element, ACCCAAGGC (+227 to +235), whose consensus sequence is GCCNNNGGC (31Warren G. Gordon M. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Williams T. Genomics. 1996; 31: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), diminished the reporter activity to ∼10% of that obtained with the +1/+290 construct (Fig. 4). EMSA clearly indicated the specific binding of AP-2 to this element (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the reporter activity of the +1/+290 construct in Dami cells was enhanced ∼5-fold by PMA treatment (Fig. 4). A lack of the region from +222 to +256 containing CRE-like and AP-2 elements abolished the PMA responsiveness. Moreover, a mutation in AP-2 (but not in CRE-like) elements resulted in the loss of the responsiveness to PMA (Fig. 4), indicating that induction of human H-PGDS gene expression by PMA can be modulated only through the AP-2 element within the untranslated exon 1. Evidence supporting this result is that cotransfection of HepG2 cells with the −1044/+290 construct and the AP-2 expression vector increased the reporter activity (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that the untranslated exon 1 of the human H-PGDS gene is essential for the transcriptional activation and that especially the AP-2 element is crucial for both basal and PMA-mediated up-regulation of gene expression in Dami cells. Such an activation mechanism of the human H-PGDS gene resembles that of the human tissue-type plasminogen activator gene (32Medcalf R.L. Rüegg M. Schleuning W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14618-14626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whose basal and PMA-mediated expressions are regulated through the AP-2 element within the untranslated exon 1. It is interesting that even only the untranslated exon 1 of the human H-PGDS gene showed ∼60% of the promoter activity of the −1044/+290 construct, unlike the untranslated exon 1 of the human tissue-type plasminogen activator gene, which showed only 20–30% of the promoter activity found upon constitutive expression (32Medcalf R.L. Rüegg M. Schleuning W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14618-14626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AP-2 family consists of three members, AP-2α, AP-2β, and AP-2γ (33Williamson J.A. Bosher J.M. Skinner A. Sheer D. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which are involved in the regulation of a number of cellular events, including growth and differentiation (34Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and in the transcriptional activation from the signal derived from PMA (35Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 5: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) and retinoic acid and cAMP (36Lüscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 37Park K. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17811-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dami cells expressed AP-2α, but not the AP-2β and AP-2γ subtypes (Fig. 6 A). Therefore, the expression of the human H-PGDS gene was considered to be activated by AP-2α in Dami cells. However, it is known that AP-2 is expressed in U937 cells (38Fong C.W. Siddiqui A.H. Mark D.F. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but actually the U937 cells used in this study expressed AP-2γ (data not shown). AP-2γ might suppress human H-PGDS gene expression in U937 cells, or transcriptional activation of the human H-PGDS gene by AP-2 might require additional factors. In summary, this study has, for the first time, directly examined, by luciferase reporter assay, site-directed mutation study, and EMSA, the roles of specific transcription factors in the regulation of the human H-PGDS gene, which belongs to the Sigma class GST family. We have suggested that the Oct-1 element in the 5′-flanking region acts as thecis-acting element and that the AP-2 element in the untranslated exon 1 plays critical roles in the basal and PMA-mediated induction of human H-PGDS gene expression in megakaryoblastic Dami cells. A functional study using HepG2 cells indicated that AP-2α can activate human H-PGDS gene expression. We are grateful to Drs. Takeyuki Sato (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan) and Motowo Nakajima (Novartis Pharma, Tsukuba, Japan) for kindly providing CMK11-5 and HepG2 cells and to Dr. Osamu Hayaishi (Osaka Bioscience Institute) for encouragement of this study.

Transactivation required the presence of a hormone response element, despite the fact that SMADs could not bind directly to it. Cotransfection of SMAD3-SMAD4 along with hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 resulted in a strong synergistic transactivation of the −890/+24 apoCIII promoter, proximal promoter segments, or synthetic promoters containing either the apoCIII enhancer or the proximal apoCIII hormone response element. Inhibition of endogenous hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 synthesis by an antisense ribozyme construct reduced the constitutive activity of the apoCIII promoter in HepG2 cells to 10% and abolished the SMAD-mediated transactivation.

Chem. 1986; 261: 13268-13277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human apoCIII gene has been mapped in the long arm of chromosome 11 within a gene cluster that includes the genes for apolipoproteins A-I and A-IV. Previous studies using DNase I footprinting, gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and mutagenesis analyses have shown that the apoCIII promoter contains four proximal (A to D) and six distal (E to J) regulatory elements (10Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distal elements F to J (located between nucleotides −592 and −792) comprise a general transcriptional enhancer that potentiates the strength of the proximal apoCIII as well as that of the closely linked apoA-I and apoA-IV promoters (10Ogami K.

We and others have shown previously that proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1, which stimulate signal transduction pathways leading to the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB, c-Jun, activating transcription factor 2, and C/EBPδ, reduced apoCIII mRNA levels and promoter activity in HepG2 cells (16Lacorte J.M.

In this report, we examined the effect of the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β and its signal transducers SMAD proteins on the activity of the human apoCIII promoter. TGF-β is expressed constitutively in HepG2 cells in an autocrine fashion and affects hepatic gene expression by binding to type I and type II TGF-β receptors (20Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). Following TGF-β stimulation, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor and the latter binds to and phosphorylates thepathway-restricted SMAD2 and -3. The phosphorylated SMAD2 or -3 proteins subsequently bind to the common partner SMAD4, an event that triggers their translocation to the nucleus. There they affect the transcription of target genes that are involved in important biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, development, apoptosis, and anti-inflammation (21Zhang Y. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 274-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). SMAD proteins have been shown to mediate the transcriptional activation of various TGF-β-responsive genes such as collagen (22Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13053-13057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (23Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), the JunB protooncogene (24Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), among others. Activation may be achieved through direct interactions with DNA sequence elements present on the promoters of TGF-β-responsive genes or through interactions with other transcription factors. In this case, SMAD proteins could serve as co-activators. In addition, SMAD3 has been shown to synergize with the universal co-activator CBP/p300, which has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of an increasing number of genes (26Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 27Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R.

Thus, cross-talk between TGF-β and other signal transduction pathways may affect the transcription rate of a wide range of genes (21Zhang Y. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 274-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the present study using in vitro and in vivoapproaches, we show that SMAD3-SMAD4 complexes are transcriptional activators of the human apoCIII gene in HepG2 cells and exert their positive effect on the apoCIII promoter by physical and functional interactions with the orphan nuclear receptor HNF-4.

The latter was constructed by inserting a hexamerized c-Myc epitope tag into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pCDNA1-amp vector (Invitrogen Corp.). Human hepatoma HepG2 cells and monkey kidney COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. Transient transfections were performed using the Ca3(PO4)2 co-precipitation method (32Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar).

Expression of recombinant proteins in COS-7 cells and preparation of total cell extracts for gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays was performed as described previously (15Ladias J.A.A.

The GST and GST-SMAD fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia colistrain DH-10β. Bacteria were grown overnight, diluted 1:25, and after reaching an A600 of 0.7, were stimulated with 250 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were then harvested, resuspended in 0.03 volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sonicated for 1 min in PBS on ice, lysed by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%, and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, resulting in a first supernatant enriched in GST fusion protein. The pellets were redissolved in solubilization buffer (1 mmEDTA, 25 mm triethanolamine, 1.5%N-laurylsarcosine) at 4 °C for 30 min, with gentle agitation. Triton X-100 to a final concentration 2% and CaCl2 to a final concentration 1 mm were added, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, resulting in a second supernatant also enriched in GST-fusion proteins. Both supernatants were used for the GST protein-protein interaction experiments or the affinity purification. The solubilization of the expressed proteins was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Glutathione-Shepharose 4B beads were equilibrated in PBS and mixed with 1 volume of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins on a rotary shaker for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 10 volumes of PBS and equilibrated in washing buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinine). Fifty microliters of a 1:1 bead slurry in washing buffer was combined with 5–10 μl of COS-7 whole cell extracts in a final volume of 500 μl of washing buffer, 10% glycerol (interacting buffer) on a rotary shaker for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with 20 volumes of washing buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were visualized by Western blotting. For co-immunoprecipitation assays of Myc-tagged SMAD3 and SMAD4 and FLAG-tagged HNF-4 proteins, total detergent COS-7 cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmaprotinin at 4 °C. The cell extract was clarified from the insoluble material by a brief centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and was precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min. The precleared extract was incubated with the FLAG antibody at 4 °C for 2 h, and the immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose, washed with lysis buffer four times, and dissolved in Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Similarly, we prepared and analyzed extracts from HepG2 cells and the HepG2 anti-HNF-4 ribozyme cell line. After 7% SDS-PAGE, the resolved proteins were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the relevant proteins were detected after incubation with the anti-Myc (9E10) antibody followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and home-made enhanced chemiluminescent assay on x-ray film (Fuji). RT-PCR analysis was performed using the Superscript One Step RT-PCR system from Life Technologies, Inc. In each reaction, 1 μg of total RNA was incubated with 40 pmol of each 5′ and 3′ primer and 1 μl of Supersript II RT/Taq mix in a final volume of 50 μl. The reverse transcription reaction was performed at 50 °C for 30 min followed by a 2-min, 84 °C denaturation step. Following the RT step, PCRs were performed as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C for a total of 40 cycles followed by a 10-min final extension step at 72 °C. The same conditions were used for the PCR amplifications. The following primers were used in the PCRs and RT-PCRs: 5′ primer, 5′ AGA GAA TTC AGC ACT CGA AGG TGA AGC TAT 3′; 3′ primer, 5′ CCT GAT GAG GCC TCG AGG CCG AAA 3′. The 3′ primer is complementary to the catalytic domain of the hammerhead ribozymes. To investigate the potential role of the TGF-β signal transducers, the SMAD proteins, on the transcriptional regulation of the apoCIII gene in hepatocytes, HepG2 cells were transiently co-transfected with a reporter construct containing the human −890/+24 apoCIII promoter fused with the CAT reporter gene along with various wild type or mutant SMAD protein forms (Fig. 1 E) in the presence and absence of 400 pm TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the −890/+24 apoCIII promoter activity was reduced by 50% in the presence of the dominant negative SMAD4-(1–514) mutant in HepG2 cells, whereas wild-type SMAD4 caused only a small (1.2-fold) increase. These findings indicate that TGF-β and the endogenous SMAD proteins contribute to the constitutive apoCIII promoter activity in hepatic cells. Western blotting analysis of HepG2 total cell extracts using antibodies specific for SMAD3 and SMAD4 showed that SMAD3 and SMAD4 proteins are expressed constitutively in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 D). To investigate the ability of different SMAD proteins to transactivate the apoCIII promoter, we performed transient transfection experiments in HepG2 cells using the −890/+24 apoCIII promoter CAT construct along with expression vectors for human SMAD2, -3, and -4 proteins (Fig. 1 E) independently or in combinations in the presence and absence of 400 pm of TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 1 B, among the various SMAD proteins tested, SMAD3 showed the strongest transactivation potential (14-fold when transfected alone and 26-fold when co-transfected along with SMAD4). SMAD2, SMAD4, and SMAD2-SMAD4 had a minor effect. A SMAD3 mutant lacking the transactivation domain MH2 and part of the linker region (human SMAD3-(1–220), Fig. 1 E) was unable to transactivate the apoCIII promoter even when co-transfected with SMAD4 (Fig. 1 B). The addition of 400 pm TGF-β in the culture medium for 24 h did not affect significantly the TGF-β-mediated transactivation of the apoCIII promoter. Furthermore, the combination of TGF-β and SMAD3-SMAD4 did not affect the transactivation of a synthetic TGF-β responsive promoter containing 12 CAGA sequences in front of a minimal AdML promoter (Fig. 1 C). The SMAD3-SMAD4 proteins that had the strongest transactivation potential on the apoCIII promoter in HepG2 cells were subsequently used in all experiments. The observation that SMAD3-SMAD4 could act as transcriptional activators of the apoCIII promoter (Fig. 1 B) prompted us to identify SMAD-responsive elements in this promoter. For this purpose, a series of apoCIII promoter deletion fragments fused with the CAT reporter gene (Fig. 2 A) were transiently co-transfected into HepG2 cells along with expression vectors for SMAD3 and SMAD4 proteins. This analysis showed that a deletion of the apoCIII promoter extending to nucleotide −163 resulted in a reduction in both the constitutive and SMAD3-SMAD4-inducible apoCIII promoter activity. The -fold transactivation of the apoCIII promoter by SMADs, however, was similar to that of the wild type (−890/+24) apoCIII promoter (20- versus 26-fold). This finding indicates that the proximal −163/+24 apoCIII promoter contains SMAD-responsive element(s). A stronger transactivation by SMAD3-SMAD4 (50-fold) was achieved when the apoCIII promoter was further deleted to nucleotide −99. In contrast, an apoCIII promoter fragment extending to nucleotide −55 was transactivated by SMAD3-SMAD4 proteins only 5-fold, suggesting that a putative SMAD3-SMAD4-responsive element is localized within the −99/−55 apoCIII promoter region. This region contains a previously identified and characterized HRE (element CIIIB between nucleotides −92 and −67) that serves as the binding site for various orphan and ligand-dependent nuclear receptors such as HNF-4, ARP-1, EAR-2, homodimers of RXRα, and heterodimers of RXRα with RARα, T3Rβ, and human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α among others (11Talianidis I.

To test the role of the apoCIII enhancer (−790/−590) in SMAD3-SMAD4-mediated transactivation of the apoCIII promoter, a synthetic reporter construct consisting of the apoCIII enhancer fused with the heterologous AdML minimal promoter (−44/+1) (Fig. 2 A) was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells along with expression vectors for SMAD3 and SMAD4. As shown in Fig. 2 B, SMAD3-SMAD4 transactivated the apoCIII enhancer/AdML CAT construct 5-fold, whereas they caused a small 1.8-fold transactivation on the AdML-CAT construct that was used as a control. It was shown previously that the strong positive effect of the apoCIII enhancer in HepG2 cells on the activity of the homologous apoCIII promoter or the heterologous apoA-I promoter is diminished by point mutations at an HRE (element I4) localized between nucleotides −736 and −714 of the apoCIII enhancer (12Kardassis D.

Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This HRE binds strongly HNF-4, ARP-1, EAR-3, and RXRα/RARα heterodimers (37Lavrentiadou S.N. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 964-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutations in the HRE did not affect the activity of the apoCIII enhancer/minimal AdML promoter construct, but they diminished its transactivation by SMAD3-SMAD4 (1.8-fold for the mutant versus 5-fold for the wild type enhancer minimal AdML promoter construct). The overall findings of Fig. 2, A and B, indicate that the proximal and distal HREs present on the apoCIII promoter/enhancer contribute to optimal SMAD3-SMAD4-mediated transactivation of the apoCIII promoter/enhancer region. The observation that HREs play an essential role for the SMAD3-SMAD4-mediated transactivation of the apoCIII promoter/enhancer suggested that SMAD proteins could either bind directly to the apoCIII HREs or cooperate functionally with nuclear hormone receptors bound to these sites. To test whether SMAD proteins can bind directly to the proximal apoCIII HRE, a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the proximal apoCIII promoter region −92 to −67 as a probe (CIII −92/−67) (Fig. 3 A) and either HNF-4 expressed in COS-7 cells or a GST-SMAD3 fusion protein expressed in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 3 B(lane 2), HNF-4 bound efficiently to this oligonucleotide in accordance with our previous findings (15Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas no binding by GST-SMAD3 to this probe was observed (Fig. 3 B,lane 4). To ensure that the bacterially expressed GST-SMAD3 protein retained DNA binding capacity, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a dimerized SMAD binding element (2× CAGA) (Fig. 3 A) shown previously to bind SMAD3 proteins (24Jonk L.J.

https://openalex.org/W2017062755,"Proteins belonging to the superfamily of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes are currently classified into three functional groups and five distinct structural fold types. The variation within this enzyme group creates an ideal system to investigate the relationships among amino acid sequences, folding pathways, and enzymatic functions. The number of known three-dimensional structures of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes is rapidly increasing, but only for relatively few have the folding mechanisms been characterized in detail. The dimeric O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from Salmonella typhimurium belongs to the beta-family and fold type II group. Here we report the guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding of the apo- and holoprotein, investigated using a variety of spectroscopic techniques. Data from absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism, (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, and photon correlation spectroscopy indicate that the O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase undergoes extensive disruption of native secondary and tertiary structure before monomerization. Also, we have observed that the holo-O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase exhibits a greater conformational stability than the apoenzyme form. The data are discussed in light of the fact that the role of the coenzyme in structural stabilization varies among the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes and does not seem to be linked to the particular enzyme fold type."

DiRusso, unpublished data.Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase plays a central role in intermediary metabolism by catalyzing the formation of fatty acyl-CoA by a two-step process proceeding through an adenylated intermediate. In E. coli, the specificity of this enzyme is primarily directed toward long-chain fatty acids (C14:0-C18:1), but it is clear this enzyme can also activate medium-chain fatty acids (C8:0-C12:0) (25Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous work (26Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we characterized the FACS structural gene,fadD, and using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, identified a region of the enzyme hypothesized to contribute to the fatty acid-binding site (FACS signature motif). The FACS signature motif is common to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic fatty acyl-CoA synthetases indicating that it is important to the structure and/or catalytic efficiency of these enzymes. This sequence motif is present in acyl-CoA synthetases with medium- to long-chain specificity and not found in the very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases or acetyl-CoA synthetases suggesting it is fairly restrictive. Our studies identified specific mutations within fadD corresponding to the FACS signature motif that resulted in altering the chain length specificity of the enzyme. More specifically, we were able to generate altered forms of FACS that preferred medium-chain fatty acids as substrates as opposed to long-chain fatty acids (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this regard, we hypothesized this region of FACS is involved in fatty acid binding and provides a molecular ruler to specify chain length (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).The E. coli FACS is a central component of the long-chain fatty acid transport apparatus. Once transported across the cell envelope and activated to CoA thioesters, long-chain fatty acids are primarily degraded via β-oxidation but can be incorporated into phospholipids. In addition, exogenously derived long-chain fatty acyl-CoA acts as potent bioactive lipids by specifically regulating the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor FadR (15DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Weimar J.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the intracellular levels of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA are low, FadR is DNA bound and acts both to repress the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid transport, activation, and β-oxidation (fad) and activate the transcription of at least two genes required for fatty acid biosynthesis (fab) (18DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). FadR specifically binds long-chain fatty acyl-CoA as their intracellular level increase, which results in a loss of DNA binding activity. The net result is the derepression of the fad genes and a decrease in the expression of the fab genes. These observations support the notion that FadR responds to the intracellular pools of long-chain fatty acyl-CoA to coordinately regulate the differential expression of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation.In the present work, we have employed a direct biochemical approach using affinity labeling to probe the fatty acid-binding domain within purified E. coli FACS. These experimental methods identified a peptide containing the affinity labeled fatty acid that begins at Pro422 and contains the FACS signature motif supporting the proposal that this region of the enzyme represents the fatty acid-binding domain. These data, in combination with computer modeling to predict the structure of FACS and our past work using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, are in agreement with the hypothesis that the fatty acid and ATP-binding sites within the enzyme are localized within a cleft separating two distinct domains of the enzyme.DISCUSSIONFatty acyl-CoA synthetase represents a pivotal enzyme in lipid metabolism. The goal of our work is to define the biochemical mechanisms that underpin the role of FACS in the transport of exogenous fatty acids. We hypothesize fatty acid transport proceeds across the cell membrane through the vectorial esterification of exogenous fatty acids. In E. coli, the esterification of exogenous long-chain fatty acids with coenzyme A is tightly coupled to a regulatory network linking fatty acid import to the differential expression of genes involved in fatty acid degradation and biosynthesis (15DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Weimar J.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Mol. Cell.

There is emerging evidence that in a number of eukaryotic systems, the fatty acid activation-coupled transport also occurs, indicating this is a common mechanism promoting the movement of exogenous fatty acids across the membrane in a highly regulated manner (24DiRusso C.C.

In the present report, we provide experimental evidence defining the regions within FACS, which are essential for activity and estimate structural characteristics of the protein.The present work represents the first direct biochemical investigation into the identity and location of the fatty acid-binding domain within FACS. We have demonstrated the affinity labeled long-chain fatty acid, APNA, precisely modifies a region of the enzyme, which includes the FACS signature motif. This work confirms our hypothesis, based on alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the FACS structural gene (fadD), that this region of the enzyme contributes to the fatty acid-binding site (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). From these data and previous analyses offadD alleles with single amino acid substitutions, a number of conclusions can be drawn regarding the ligand-binding sites within the enzyme. First, the fatty acid-binding site, which includes the FACS signature motif, is predicted to be localized at the carboxyl end of the larger domain of the enzyme and extends into the linker separating the large NH2-terminal domain from the smaller COOH-terminal domain (corresponding to amino acid residues 431–455). This signature motif is predicted to be composed of a β strand followed by two anti-parallel β strands connected by a turn, which within the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme may contribute to a cavity that accommodates the acyl chain of the fatty acid. Second, the region of the enzyme containing the two sequence elements that comprise the ATP/AMP signature motif (hypothesized to be involved in ATP binding) are in juxtaposition with those that comprise the FACS signature motif. The first element of the ATP/AMP signature motif involved in ATP binding (residues 213–222) was found within two antiparallel β-strands connected by a disordered loop. The information gleaned from the firefly luciferase structure suggests this disordered loop contributes to a region of the enzyme that is flexible (33Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). And third, within the second sequence element of the ATP/AMP signature motif (residues 356–361) is an invariant glutamate (residue 361 in FACS), which is found in all adenylate-forming enzymes and is essential for maintaining catalytic proficiency. 4J. D. Weimar and P. N. Black, personal observations. The predicted structure of FACS places this residue in a turn that is in the same proximity as the two antiparallel β-strands that comprise the first sequence element of the ATP/AMP signature motif. Both elements of the ATP/AMP signature motif may act to anchor ATP, or alternatively, may interact with and participate in the expulsion of the pyrophosphate leaving group (34Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings support the proposal that the fatty acid- and ATP-binding sites are adjacent to each other within the predicted three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. We suggest this region of the enzyme, indeed comprises a common structural fingerprint for adenylate-forming enzymes and that the specificity for the second carboxyl-containing substrate is dictated by specific residues corresponding to the region that in the fatty acyl-CoA synthetases contains the FACS signature motif (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).On the basis of the predicted model for the E. coli FACS, the fatty acid-binding site extends into the cleft where we presume the acyl adenylate is formed. We have previously suggested that subtle changes in the region of the enzyme corresponding to the FACS signature motif results in marked changes with respect to substrate recognition (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both the Pseudomonas oleovarans fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (42van Beilen J.B. Eggink G. Enequist H. Bos R. Witholt B. Mol Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3121-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, Faa2p (43Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have specificity for medium-chain fatty acids and lack the lysyl residue at the position equivalent to Lys454 of the E. coli enzyme. In these two cases there is an aliphatic residue at this position (Ala and Val, respectively). Substitution of Lys454 within the E. coli enzyme with Ala results in a mutant form that has specificity toward medium-chain fatty acid substrates (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These data support the notion that this residue contributes to a region of the enzyme that acts as a molecular ruler and specifies the length of the fatty acid substrate.The role of FACS in fatty acid transport is somewhat controversial, but there is recent evidence supporting the capacity of this enzyme to function in a coupled import-activation mechanism. The seminal observations made by Overath and co-workers (22Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) demonstrated theE. coli FACS was localized in both cytosolic and particulate fractions within the cell. In fact, these early observations proposed that fatty acid import into the cell was driven by a vectorial esterification mechanism. More recent studies in both yeast and mammalian cells indicate that a similar process may also be operational. In yeast a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (Faa1p or Faa4p) is required for fatty acid import and activation of exogenous long-chain fatty acids (23Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10861-10867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An additional protein within yeast, Fat1p, is involved in fatty acid import and has an acyl-CoA synthetase activity, suggesting it may work in conjunction with either Faa1p or Faa4p to promote coupled fatty acid import activation (24DiRusso C.C. Connell E. Færgeman N.J. Hansen J.-K. Knudsen J. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 44Færgeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. Elberger A. Knudsen J. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the emerging evidence suggests that fatty acyl-CoA synthetase is, likewise, involved in fatty acid import (39Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Coe N.B. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I. Watkins P.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol.

The challenges that we are presently faced with not only include detailed mechanistic and structural investigations on the FACS family of enzymes, but also to more precisely determine how these enzymes function in fatty acid import. Our laboratory is presently investigating these questions. Over the past 15 years, there has been increasing interest in the roles played by bioactive lipids in cellular homeostasis, including fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives. It is now widely accepted that these compounds influence a wide variety of cellular processes including phospholipid synthesis (1Carmen G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol.

Our interest in bioactive lipids stems from investigations directed at elucidating the mechanisms governing how exogenous long-chain fatty acids traverse the membrane, become activated to CoA thioesters and influence downstream events using both bacterial and yeast model systems (20DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 41-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Black P.N. Færgeman N.J. DiRusso C.C. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 305-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is recognized that fatty acids traverse the cell envelope of Escherichia coli by a protein-mediated process involving both FadL (an outer membrane-bound long-chain fatty acid transport protein) and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (FACS1; fatty acid:CoA ligase, AMP forming; EC 6.2.1.3). The formation of the fatty acyl-CoA thioester by FACS renders this process unidirectional and thus the role this enzyme plays in transport has been described as vectorial esterification (22Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).

D. Weimar and P. N. Black, personal observations. The predicted structure of FACS places this residue in a turn that is in the same proximity as the two antiparallel β-strands that comprise the first sequence element of the ATP/AMP signature motif. Both elements of the ATP/AMP signature motif may act to anchor ATP, or alternatively, may interact with and participate in the expulsion of the pyrophosphate leaving group (34Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings support the proposal that the fatty acid- and ATP-binding sites are adjacent to each other within the predicted three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. We suggest this region of the enzyme, indeed comprises a common structural fingerprint for adenylate-forming enzymes and that the specificity for the second carboxyl-containing substrate is dictated by specific residues corresponding to the region that in the fatty acyl-CoA synthetases contains the FACS signature motif (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).On the basis of the predicted model for the E. coli FACS, the fatty acid-binding site extends into the cleft where we presume the acyl adenylate is formed. We have previously suggested that subtle changes in the region of the enzyme corresponding to the FACS signature motif results in marked changes with respect to substrate recognition (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both the Pseudomonas oleovarans fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (42van Beilen J.B. Eggink G. Enequist H. Bos R. Witholt B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16348-16356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have specificity for medium-chain fatty acids and lack the lysyl residue at the position equivalent to Lys454 of the E. coli enzyme. In these two cases there is an aliphatic residue at this position (Ala and Val, respectively). Substitution of Lys454 within the E. coli enzyme with Ala results in a mutant form that has specificity toward medium-chain fatty acid substrates (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These data support the notion that this residue contributes to a region of the enzyme that acts as a molecular ruler and specifies the length of the fatty acid substrate.The role of FACS in fatty acid transport is somewhat controversial, but there is recent evidence supporting the capacity of this enzyme to function in a coupled import-activation mechanism. The seminal observations made by Overath and co-workers (22Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) demonstrated theE. coli FACS was localized in both cytosolic and particulate fractions within the cell. In fact, these early observations proposed that fatty acid import into the cell was driven by a vectorial esterification mechanism. More recent studies in both yeast and mammalian cells indicate that a similar process may also be operational. In yeast a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (Faa1p or Faa4p) is required for fatty acid import and activation of exogenous long-chain fatty acids (23Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10861-10867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An additional protein within yeast, Fat1p, is involved in fatty acid import and has an acyl-CoA synthetase activity, suggesting it may work in conjunction with either Faa1p or Faa4p to promote coupled fatty acid import activation (24DiRusso C.C.

In mammalian cells, the emerging evidence suggests that fatty acyl-CoA synthetase is, likewise, involved in fatty acid import (39Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Coe N.B. Smith A.J. Frohnert B.I. Watkins P.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol.

The challenges that we are presently faced with not only include detailed mechanistic and structural investigations on the FACS family of enzymes, but also to more precisely determine how these enzymes function in fatty acid import. Our laboratory is presently investigating these questions. Fatty acyl-CoA synthetase represents a pivotal enzyme in lipid metabolism. The goal of our work is to define the biochemical mechanisms that underpin the role of FACS in the transport of exogenous fatty acids. We hypothesize fatty acid transport proceeds across the cell membrane through the vectorial esterification of exogenous fatty acids. In E. coli, the esterification of exogenous long-chain fatty acids with coenzyme A is tightly coupled to a regulatory network linking fatty acid import to the differential expression of genes involved in fatty acid degradation and biosynthesis (15DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Weimar J.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Mol. Cell.

There is emerging evidence that in a number of eukaryotic systems, the fatty acid activation-coupled transport also occurs, indicating this is a common mechanism promoting the movement of exogenous fatty acids across the membrane in a highly regulated manner (24DiRusso C.C. Connell E. Færgeman N.J. Hansen J.-K. Knudsen J. Black P.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J.

In the present report, we provide experimental evidence defining the regions within FACS, which are essential for activity and estimate structural characteristics of the protein. The present work represents the first direct biochemical investigation into the identity and location of the fatty acid-binding domain within FACS. We have demonstrated the affinity labeled long-chain fatty acid, APNA, precisely modifies a region of the enzyme, which includes the FACS signature motif. This work confirms our hypothesis, based on alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the FACS structural gene (fadD), that this region of the enzyme contributes to the fatty acid-binding site (27Black P.N. Zhang Q. Weimar J. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4896-4903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). From these data and previous analyses offadD alleles with single amino acid substitutions, a number of conclusions can be drawn regarding the ligand-binding sites within the enzyme. First, the fatty acid-binding site, which includes the FACS signature motif, is predicted to be localized at the carboxyl end of the larger domain of the enzyme and extends into the linker separating the large NH2-terminal domain from the smaller COOH-terminal domain (corresponding to amino acid residues 431–455). This signature motif is predicted to be composed of a β strand followed by two anti-parallel β strands connected by a turn, which within the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme may contribute to a cavity that accommodates the acyl chain of the fatty acid. Second, the region of the enzyme containing the two sequence elements that comprise the ATP/AMP signature motif (hypothesized to be involved in ATP binding) are in juxtaposition with those that comprise the FACS signature motif. The first element of the ATP/AMP signature motif involved in ATP binding (residues 213–222) was found within two antiparallel β-strands connected by a disordered loop. The information gleaned from the firefly luciferase structure suggests this disordered loop contributes to a region of the enzyme that is flexible (33Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). And third, within the second sequence element of the ATP/AMP signature motif (residues 356–361) is an invariant glutamate (residue 361 in FACS), which is found in all adenylate-forming enzymes and is essential for maintaining catalytic proficiency. 4J.

https://openalex.org/W1963893245,"There is growing evidence that glycogen targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1 play a critical role in regulation of glycogen metabolism. In the current study, we have investigated the effects of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a specific glycogen targeting subunit known as protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) in cultured human muscle cells. PTG was overexpressed both in muscle cells cultured at high glucose (glycogen replete) or in cells incubated for 18 h in the absence of glucose and then incubated in high glucose (glycogen re-synthesizing). In both glycogen replete and glycogen resynthesizing cells, PTG overexpression caused glycogen to be synthesized at a linear rate 1–5 days after viral treatment, while in cells treated with a virus lacking a cDNA insert (control virus), glycogen content reached a plateau at day 1 with no further increase. In the glycogen replete PTG overexpressing cells, glycogen content was 20 times that in controls at day 5. Furthermore, in cells undergoing glycogen resynthesis, PTG overexpression caused a doubling of the initial rate of glycogen synthesis over the first 24 h relative to cells treated with control virus. In both sets of experiments, the effects of PTG on glycogen synthesis were correlated with a 2–3-fold increase in glycogen synthase activity state, with no changes in glycogen phosphorylase activity. The alterations in glycogen synthase activity were not accompanied by changes in the intracellular concentration of glucose 6-phosphate. We conclude that PTG overexpression activates glycogen synthesis in a glucose 6-phosphate-independent manner in human muscle cells while overriding glycogen-mediated inhibition. Our findings suggest that modulation of PTG expression in muscle may be a mechanism for enhancing muscle glucose disposal and improving glucose tolerance in diabetes.

Our findings suggest that modulation of PTG expression in muscle may be a mechanism for enhancing muscle glucose disposal and improving glucose tolerance in diabetes. glycogen synthase glycogen phosphorylase protein phosphatase 1 protein targeting to glycogen Glycogen metabolism is regulated in part by a balance between glycogen synthase (GS)1 and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) activities. Both enzymes are known to be modified by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions. Dephosphorylation of GS causes its activation, while GP becomes inactivated. Dephosphorylation of glycogen metabolizing enzymes has been mainly attributed to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity (1Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Science. 1983; 221: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, PP1 is known to bind to the glycogen particle in muscle, and has also been shown to catalyze dephosphorylation of GS, GP, and phosphorylase kinase when assayed in vitro (2Ingebritsen T. Stewart A.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the mechanisms that control the specific action of PP1 on glycogen metabolizing enzymes in the intact cell.It is increasingly appreciated that the activity of PP1 is affected by proteins that bind to the enzyme and target it to specific intracellular sites. With regard to glycogen metabolism, a family of glycogen targeting subunits of PP1 have recently emerged. These proteins include GM or RGl (3Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swidenck K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which is expressed in skeletal muscle, GL (4Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), expressed mainly in the liver, and PPP1R5 or protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) (5Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 6Doherty M.J. Young P.R. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and PPP1R6 (7Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which are expressed in a wide variety of tissues. PTG is present in muscle and liver and has been shown to interact with PP1, GS, phosphorylase kinase, and possibly, GP (8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the metabolic impact of these protein/protein interactions is not fully understood, and has only been studied in a limited number of cell types. Previous studies of overexpression of PTG in fibroblasts (5Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), hepatocytes (9Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), or liver of intact animals (10O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have demonstrated this protein causes clear activation of GS and potent stimulation of glycogen synthesis. In hepatocytes or intact liver, PTG overexpression also appears to impair glycogenolysis induced by fasting or glycogenolytic agents (9Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies have shown that overexpression of the liver-specific isoform of glycogen targeting subunit, GL, has an even larger activating effect on GS and glycogen synthesis than PTG (11Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. De-Paoli A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23403-26396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar), while allowing efficient activation of glycogenolysis in response to forskolin. Thus, distinct metabolic and regulatory effects of different glycogen targeting subunit isoforms are beginning to emerge. This raises the issue of whether cellular context also affects the metabolic impact of these proteins. The current study sought to gain insight into this issue via adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PTG in human muscle cells, and comparison of our findings with those obtained previously in isolated hepatocytes.Glycogen synthesis in muscle is maximally activated after glycogen-depleting exercise. This effect has been ascribed to the activation of GS triggered by exhaustion of glycogen stores (12Montell E. Arias A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: R1489-R1495Google Scholar, 13Bräu L. Ferreira D.M.C.B. Nikolovski S. Raja G. Palmer T.N. Fournier P.A. Biochem.

Physiol. 1990; 258: E957-E963PubMed Google Scholar), mediated in turn by release of the inhibitory action of glycogen on PP1 (16Mellgren R.L. Coulson M. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1983; 114: 148-154Google Scholar). Additionally, at elevated glycogen levels, it has been suggested that glucose-6-P plays an important regulatory role by binding to GS and rendering it a better substrate for protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (17Villar-Palasi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 12: 261-267Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In support of these ideas, the increment in glucose-6-P caused by exposure of cells to glucose and insulin correlates with GS activity state (12Montell E. Arias A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: R1489-R1495Google Scholar, 18Shulman R.G. Bloch G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8535-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas it negatively correlates with glycogen concentration (14Munger R. Temler E. Jallut D. Haesler E. Felber J.P. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 36-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Laurent D. Hunda R.S. Dresner A. Price T.B. Vogel S.M. Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E663-E668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a second reason for overexpressing PTG in human muscle cells was to re-examine these concepts of regulation of glycogen metabolism in response to changes in glycogen targeting subunit expression.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined the effects of altered expression of PTG on regulation of glycogen metabolism in primary cultured human muscle cells. These experiments were conduced under two different conditions, namely in cells in which net glycogen synthesis was saturated due to prolonged incubation at high glucose concentrations, and in cells depleted of glycogen due to glucose deprivation. Overexpression of PTG in glycogen replete cells incubated at high glucose caused resumption of glycogen synthesis at a linear rate for at least 5 days, in contrast to control cells, which did not increase glycogen content during this time period. In glycogen-depleted cells, the overexpression of PTG also increased the rate of glycogen synthesis after glucose repletion compared with controls. In both situations, the effect of PTG on glycogen synthesis was correlated with activation of GS, but not with any change in GP activity.In muscle, GS is thought to be activated by glycogen depletion (12Montell E. Arias A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: R1489-R1495Google Scholar, 13Bräu L. Ferreira D.M.C.B. Nikolovski S. Raja G. Palmer T.N. Fournier P.A. Biochem.

Metabolism. 1993; 42: 36-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Bak J.F. Pedersen O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E957-E963PubMed Google Scholar), via release of an inhibitory effect of glycogen on PP1 (16Mellgren R.L. Coulson M. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1983; 114: 148-154Google Scholar), and by transient increments in glucose-6-P resulting from insulin and glucose stimulation (26Villar-Palası́ C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The current study demonstrates that these modes of regulation of GS activity are not required for activation of glycogen synthesis in muscle in response to PTG overexpression. Thus, overexpression of PTG increased the activity ratio of GS regardless of whether cells were depleted or loaded with glycogen. These data suggest that PTG is able to overcome the inhibitory effect of glycogen on PP1 activity. In addition, activation of GS was not related to increased glucose transport rates or intracellular glucose-6-P levels in PTG-overexpressing muscle cells compared with controls. Furthermore, the glucose concentration dependence of glycogen accumulation was unaltered in cells treated with AdCMV-PTG. Thus, while glycogen content was higher at each glucose concentration studied in PTG overexpressing cells, as expected in light of the higher GS activity ratio, glycogen accumulation became maximal at 5 mm glucose in both groups of cells, supporting a key regulatory role for the hexokinase reaction rather than GS in control of the glucose dependence of glycogen synthesis in muscle cells (24Baqué S. Montell E. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. Gómez-Foix A.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).It should also be noted that the effect of PTG to activate GS was limited, with the maximal activity ratio attained in the presence of overexpressed PTG of 0.3. In a recent study comparing the effects of overexpressed PTG, GM, and GL in isolated hepatocytes, a similar saturating effect of PTG overexpression on GS activation was noted, while overexpression of GL resulted in GS activity ratios of up to 0.7 (11Gasa R.

These observations might be explained by the fact that GS can be phosphorylated at multiple sites, with differential impacts on enzyme activity. In this context, our results could be interpreted to mean that PTG mediates the dephosphorylation of a subset of these sites, while GL may promote more complete dephosphorylation. In addition, it is possible that besides PP1, type 2 phosphatases could contribute to the activation of the enzyme within muscle cells, as has been shown in tissue extracts (1Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Science. 1983; 221: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 17Villar-Palasi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 12: 261-267Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the partial activation of GS induced by PTG overexpression is sufficient to stimulate glycogen synthesis in muscle cells over a period of at least 5 days.The impact of PTG overexpression on GP was also examined. In contrast to GS, GP activity ratio was only slightly decreased by the overexpression of PTG, both in glycogen-depleted and glycogen-replete cells. This suggests that the PTG-induced increment in glycogen synthesis is solely due to the activation of the synthetic enzyme rather than inactivation of the enzyme responsible for glycogen degradation. Therefore, even though muscle GP a has been shown to form complexes with PTG in vitro(8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), our data indicates that PTG does not seem to be crucial to the inactivation/dephosphorylation of GP by PP1 within muscle cells. This finding may be related to what has been described for GL, which shows distinct PP1-binding sites that enhance dephosphorylation of GP and GS in an independent fashion (27Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). If a similar mode of regulation exists in PTG, it could be reflected in different binding affinities for GS and GP.Tissue-specific metabolic effects of PTG overexpression emerge from comparison of the results of the current study in muscle cells with those of previous studies in hepatocytes (9Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or intact liver (10O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For example, PTG overexpression in muscle does not cause glycogen accumulation in the absence of glucose, whereas large amounts of glycogen are synthesized in the absence of glucose in isolated hepatocytes. Presumably, this stems from the fact that muscle cells lack expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes that are required for the indirect pathway of glycogen synthesis that take place in hepatocytes. In addition, GP and glycogenolysis are activated in an apparently normal fashion in response to glucose deprivation in PTG overexpressing muscle cells, while glycogenolytic responses to forskolin in intact hepatocytes (9Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), or to fasting in liver of intact animals (10O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), is clearly impaired by PTG overexpression. It has been suggested that among glycogen targeting subunit isoforms, GM contains 2 serines that may be targets for phosphorylation in response to glycogenolytic agents, while GL is regulated allosterically by binding of phosphorylase a to its COOH-terminal tail (28Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T.V. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Neither of these mechanisms appears to be operative in PTG (5Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The current study demonstrates that tissue context is another, heretofore unappreciated, factor in regulation of the activity of glycogen targeting subunits. The specific factors that allow normal regulation of glycogenolysis in the context of a PTG overexpressing muscle cell, but not in a PTG overexpressing liver cell remain to be identified.The implication of our data is that an increase in PTG expression in muscle might constitute a means of activating GS and glycogen synthesis independent of glycogen content or glucose-6-P levels, with possible therapeutic implications for lowering of blood glucose levels in diabetes. Nevertheless, extrapolation of our findings to the in vivo condition should be undertaken with caution, based on our demonstration that glucose transport is not limiting in cultured human muscle due to very high levels of GLUT1 (25Baqué S. Montell E. Camps M. Guinovart J.J. Zorzano A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In intact muscle in situ, GLUT-4-mediated glucose transport may exert a rate-limiting effect. It will therefore be necessary to test directly whether PTG overexpression and GS activation in muscle is sufficient to enhance muscle glucose disposal in vivo. This may be achieved in future studies in transgenic mice, or by direct injection of AdCMV-PTG into muscle of neonatal rats, as we have demonstrated for an adenovirus containing the glucokinase cDNA (29Jiménez-Chillarón J.C. Newgard C.B. Gómez-Foix A.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2160-2513Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additionally, it remains to be determined whether PTG content varies in muscle cells under different physiological conditions. Our clear finding that overexpression of PTG causes a persistent activation of GS independent of glycogen and glucose-6-P levels in human muscle cells provides impetus for further investigation of these issues. Glycogen metabolism is regulated in part by a balance between glycogen synthase (GS)1 and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) activities. Both enzymes are known to be modified by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions. Dephosphorylation of GS causes its activation, while GP becomes inactivated. Dephosphorylation of glycogen metabolizing enzymes has been mainly attributed to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity (1Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Science. 1983; 221: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, PP1 is known to bind to the glycogen particle in muscle, and has also been shown to catalyze dephosphorylation of GS, GP, and phosphorylase kinase when assayed in vitro (2Ingebritsen T. Stewart A.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the mechanisms that control the specific action of PP1 on glycogen metabolizing enzymes in the intact cell. It is increasingly appreciated that the activity of PP1 is affected by proteins that bind to the enzyme and target it to specific intracellular sites. With regard to glycogen metabolism, a family of glycogen targeting subunits of PP1 have recently emerged. These proteins include GM or RGl (3Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swidenck K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which is expressed in skeletal muscle, GL (4Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), expressed mainly in the liver, and PPP1R5 or protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) (5Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 6Doherty M.J. Young P.R. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and PPP1R6 (7Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which are expressed in a wide variety of tissues. PTG is present in muscle and liver and has been shown to interact with PP1, GS, phosphorylase kinase, and possibly, GP (8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the metabolic impact of these protein/protein interactions is not fully understood, and has only been studied in a limited number of cell types. Previous studies of overexpression of PTG in fibroblasts (5Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), hepatocytes (9Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), or liver of intact animals (10O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have demonstrated this protein causes clear activation of GS and potent stimulation of glycogen synthesis. In hepatocytes or intact liver, PTG overexpression also appears to impair glycogenolysis induced by fasting or glycogenolytic agents (9Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies have shown that overexpression of the liver-specific isoform of glycogen targeting subunit, GL, has an even larger activating effect on GS and glycogen synthesis than PTG (11Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. De-Paoli A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23403-26396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar), while allowing efficient activation of glycogenolysis in response to forskolin. Thus, distinct metabolic and regulatory effects of different glycogen targeting subunit isoforms are beginning to emerge. This raises the issue of whether cellular context also affects the metabolic impact of these proteins. The current study sought to gain insight into this issue via adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PTG in human muscle cells, and comparison of our findings with those obtained previously in isolated hepatocytes. Glycogen synthesis in muscle is maximally activated after glycogen-depleting exercise. This effect has been ascribed to the activation of GS triggered by exhaustion of glycogen stores (12Montell E. Arias A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: R1489-R1495Google Scholar, 13Bräu L. Ferreira D.M.C.B. Nikolovski S. Raja G. Palmer T.N. Fournier P.A. Biochem.

Metabolism. 1993; 42: 36-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Bak J.F. Pedersen O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E957-E963PubMed Google Scholar), mediated in turn by release of the inhibitory action of glycogen on PP1 (16Mellgren R.L. Coulson M. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1983; 114: 148-154Google Scholar). Additionally, at elevated glycogen levels, it has been suggested that glucose-6-P plays an important regulatory role by binding to GS and rendering it a better substrate for protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (17Villar-Palasi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 12: 261-267Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In support of these ideas, the increment in glucose-6-P caused by exposure of cells to glucose and insulin correlates with GS activity state (12Montell E. Arias A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: R1489-R1495Google Scholar, 18Shulman R.G. Bloch G. Rothman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8535-8542Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas it negatively correlates with glycogen concentration (14Munger R. Temler E. Jallut D. Haesler E. Felber J.P. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 36-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Laurent D. Hunda R.S. Dresner A. Price T.B. Vogel S.M. Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E663-E668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a second reason for overexpressing PTG in human muscle cells was to re-examine these concepts of regulation of glycogen metabolism in response to changes in glycogen targeting subunit expression. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined the effects of altered expression of PTG on regulation of glycogen metabolism in primary cultured human muscle cells. These experiments were conduced under two different conditions, namely in cells in which net glycogen synthesis was saturated due to prolonged incubation at high glucose concentrations, and in cells depleted of glycogen due to glucose deprivation. Overexpression of PTG in glycogen replete cells incubated at high glucose caused resumption of glycogen synthesis at a linear rate for at least 5 days, in contrast to control cells, which did not increase glycogen content during this time period. In glycogen-depleted cells, the overexpression of PTG also increased the rate of glycogen synthesis after glucose repletion compared with controls. In both situations, the effect of PTG on glycogen synthesis was correlated with activation of GS, but not with any change in GP activity.In muscle, GS is thought to be activated by glycogen depletion (12Montell E. Arias A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: R1489-R1495Google Scholar, 13Bräu L. Ferreira D.M.C.B. Nikolovski S. Raja G. Palmer T.N. Fournier P.A. Biochem.

Metabolism. 1993; 42: 36-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Bak J.F. Pedersen O. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E957-E963PubMed Google Scholar), via release of an inhibitory effect of glycogen on PP1 (16Mellgren R.L. Coulson M. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1983; 114: 148-154Google Scholar), and by transient increments in glucose-6-P resulting from insulin and glucose stimulation (26Villar-Palası́ C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The current study demonstrates that these modes of regulation of GS activity are not required for activation of glycogen synthesis in muscle in response to PTG overexpression. Thus, overexpression of PTG increased the activity ratio of GS regardless of whether cells were depleted or loaded with glycogen. These data suggest that PTG is able to overcome the inhibitory effect of glycogen on PP1 activity. In addition, activation of GS was not related to increased glucose transport rates or intracellular glucose-6-P levels in PTG-overexpressing muscle cells compared with controls. Furthermore, the glucose concentration dependence of glycogen accumulation was unaltered in cells treated with AdCMV-PTG. Thus, while glycogen content was higher at each glucose concentration studied in PTG overexpressing cells, as expected in light of the higher GS activity ratio, glycogen accumulation became maximal at 5 mm glucose in both groups of cells, supporting a key regulatory role for the hexokinase reaction rather than GS in control of the glucose dependence of glycogen synthesis in muscle cells (24Baqué S. Montell E. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. Gómez-Foix A.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).It should also be noted that the effect of PTG to activate GS was limited, with the maximal activity ratio attained in the presence of overexpressed PTG of 0.3. In a recent study comparing the effects of overexpressed PTG, GM, and GL in isolated hepatocytes, a similar saturating effect of PTG overexpression on GS activation was noted, while overexpression of GL resulted in GS activity ratios of up to 0.7 (11Gasa R.

These observations might be explained by the fact that GS can be phosphorylated at multiple sites, with differential impacts on enzyme activity.

Nevertheless, the partial activation of GS induced by PTG overexpression is sufficient to stimulate glycogen synthesis in muscle cells over a period of at least 5 days.The impact of PTG overexpression on GP was also examined. In contrast to GS, GP activity ratio was only slightly decreased by the overexpression of PTG, both in glycogen-depleted and glycogen-replete cells. This suggests that the PTG-induced increment in glycogen synthesis is solely due to the activation of the synthetic enzyme rather than inactivation of the enzyme responsible for glycogen degradation. Therefore, even though muscle GP a has been shown to form complexes with PTG in vitro(8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), our data indicates that PTG does not seem to be crucial to the inactivation/dephosphorylation of GP by PP1 within muscle cells.

If a similar mode of regulation exists in PTG, it could be reflected in different binding affinities for GS and GP.Tissue-specific metabolic effects of PTG overexpression emerge from comparison of the results of the current study in muscle cells with those of previous studies in hepatocytes (9Berman H.K.

Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). If a similar mode of regulation exists in PTG, it could be reflected in different binding affinities for GS and GP. Tissue-specific metabolic effects of PTG overexpression emerge from comparison of the results of the current study in muscle cells with those of previous studies in hepatocytes (9Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or intact liver (10O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For example, PTG overexpression in muscle does not cause glycogen accumulation in the absence of glucose, whereas large amounts of glycogen are synthesized in the absence of glucose in isolated hepatocytes. Presumably, this stems from the fact that muscle cells lack expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes that are required for the indirect pathway of glycogen synthesis that take place in hepatocytes. In addition, GP and glycogenolysis are activated in an apparently normal fashion in response to glucose deprivation in PTG overexpressing muscle cells, while glycogenolytic responses to forskolin in intact hepatocytes (9Berman H.K. O'Doherty R.M. Anderson P. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26421-26425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), or to fasting in liver of intact animals (10O'Doherty R.M. Jensen P.B. Anderson P. Jones J.G. Berman H.K. Kearney D. Newgard C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), is clearly impaired by PTG overexpression. It has been suggested that among glycogen targeting subunit isoforms, GM contains 2 serines that may be targets for phosphorylation in response to glycogenolytic agents, while GL is regulated allosterically by binding of phosphorylase a to its COOH-terminal tail (28Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T.V. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Neither of these mechanisms appears to be operative in PTG (5Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Brady M.J. Printen J.A. Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The current study demonstrates that tissue context is another, heretofore unappreciated, factor in regulation of the activity of glycogen targeting subunits. The specific factors that allow normal regulation of glycogenolysis in the context of a PTG overexpressing muscle cell, but not in a PTG overexpressing liver cell remain to be identified. The implication of our data is that an increase in PTG expression in muscle might constitute a means of activating GS and glycogen synthesis independent of glycogen content or glucose-6-P levels, with possible therapeutic implications for lowering of blood glucose levels in diabetes. Nevertheless, extrapolation of our findings to the in vivo condition should be undertaken with caution, based on our demonstration that glucose transport is not limiting in cultured human muscle due to very high levels of GLUT1 (25Baqué S. Montell E. Camps M. Guinovart J.J. Zorzano A. Gómez-Foix A.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In intact muscle in situ, GLUT-4-mediated glucose transport may exert a rate-limiting effect. It will therefore be necessary to test directly whether PTG overexpression and GS activation in muscle is sufficient to enhance muscle glucose disposal in vivo. This may be achieved in future studies in transgenic mice, or by direct injection of AdCMV-PTG into muscle of neonatal rats, as we have demonstrated for an adenovirus containing the glucokinase cDNA (29Jiménez-Chillarón J.C. Newgard C.B. Gómez-Foix A.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2160-2513Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Additionally, it remains to be determined whether PTG content varies in muscle cells under different physiological conditions. Our clear finding that overexpression of PTG causes a persistent activation of GS independent of glycogen and glucose-6-P levels in human muscle cells provides impetus for further investigation of these issues.

It is also a fruitful approach for isolating the genes involved in hereditary deafness, which affects about 1 individual in 1000 at birth (1Petit C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In mammals thus far, this strategy has resulted in the identification of six genes. Initially, the genes encoding α- and β-tectorin were isolated upon the purification of their corresponding proteins (2Legan P.K. Rau A. Keen J.N. Richardson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8791-8801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); mutations in TECTA, encoding α-tectorin in humans, are responsible for a form of nonsyndromic deafness (isolated deafness) (3Verhoeven K.

Recently, using another strategy based on cDNA subtractive methods, four other genes were isolated, which encode cochlin, otogelin, otoconin-95, and otoferlin (6Robertson N.G. Khetarpal U.

With the exception of the gene encoding otoconin-95, the major component of the biominerals of the vestibular apparatus (8Verpy E. Leibovici M. Petit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Guillaud L. Benichou J.-C. Petit C. Panthier J.-J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These genes are expressed in a variety of inner ear cell types. Cochlin is expressed by cells surrounding the auditory and vestibular nerve fibers (10Robertson N.G. Skvorak A.B. Yin Y. Weremowicz S. Johnson K.R. Kovatch K.A. Battey J.F. Bieber F.R. Morton C.C. Genomics. 1997; 46: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); α- and β-tectorins and otogelin are non-collagenous components specific to the acellular membranes of the inner ear, which cover the neuroepithelia, and are expressed by the non-sensory neuroepithelial cells (2Legan P.K.

Using a subtractive cDNA approach on mouse cochlea, we have isolated and characterized a new gene preferentially expressed in the inner ear, which we named Fdp for fibrocyte-derived protein. The expression pattern of Fdp during inner ear development, and its inhibition in vitro using an antisense oligonucleotide, suggest that Fdp could play a role in the early chondrogenesis of the periotic mesenchyme. Primers (see below) for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)1 using 2-day-old mouse oligo(dT)-primed cochlear cDNA, were designed from the 160-base pair (bp) cDNA subtracted clone (cDNA position 204–362), according to the Marathon cDNA protocol (CLONTECH). Amplifications were carried out using the Expand long template PCR Taq polymerase mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 3′ extension using the primer L136 (5′-GATCTATGTTTACTCCAAGCTGGT-3′) (cDNA position 204), and 5′ extension using the primer U1 (5′-GATCTCCTTGGTGGCCTCCTGGTA-3′) (cDNA position 362) exclusively resulted in PCR products of 750 and 361 bp, respectively, that were individually cloned and sequenced. DNA sequencing was carried out using the PRISM™ Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy™ terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI model 377 DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer APB Division). Total RNA from 2-day-old or adult mouse tissues, total E9.5, E10.5, and E11.5 embryos, and dissected E10.5 periotic mesenchymal cells (about 250,000 cells) was prepared by the guanidium isothiocyanate procedure. Gestational age was estimated by the vaginal plug method, with the day of plug occurrence designated as day 1 (E1). Reverse transcription was performed using 250 ng of total RNA (except for the E10.5 periotic mesenchyme, where all of the prepared RNA extracted from about 250,000 cells was used), a random hexamer mix as the primer, and the SuperScript™ II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). One tenth of the reaction product was PCR-amplified, in a total volume of 50 μl using the primers L136 (see above) and L511 (5′-GGAGTCAGAGCTGGGGAGAATGA-3′) (cDNA position 736). The primers derived from the ubiquitously expressed Hprt gene (GenBank™ accession no. J00423), Hprt.F (5′- GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT-3′) (cDNA position 576) and Hprt.R (5′- CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC3′) (cDNA position 813), were used in the control reaction. PCR amplification was carried out for 35 cycles under standard conditions using the Qiagen Taq polymerase. For Fdp, amplification specificity was verified by Southern transfer and hybridization of the amplified products with the internal oligonucleotide U1 (see above). Whole Swiss E17.5 mouse embryos or 4-day-old mouse heads were fixed for 4 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, embedded in sucrose 20% overnight at 4 °C, and frozen in Tissue-Tek (OCT) using liquid nitrogen. Sagittal and parasagittal cryosections (10 μm) were collected and treated for hybridization as described by Schaeren-Wiemers and Gerfin-Moser (12Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The 160-bp subtracted cDNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM-4Z vector (Promega). Sense and antisense RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP, and the hybridization signal was detected by sheep anti-digoxigenin antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase. The sense riboprobe was used in parallel experiments as a negative control. Periotic mesenchyme + otic epithelium were isolated from E10.5 C57BL/6 mouse embryos as described by Frenz and van De Water (13Frenz D. Van de Water T.R. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium in the presence at a concentration of 60 ng/ml or absence of oligonucleotides. The culture medium with the added oligonucleotides was changed daily. After a culture period of 3 days, sites of mesenchymal condensation, which precede cartilage development, were counted and used as an early indicator of chondrogenesis (13Frenz D. Van de Water T.R. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After a culture period of 7 days, the cells were fixed, then stained with Alcian Blue 8GX, pH 1.0. Binding of matrix-bound Alcian Blue stain was measured spectrophotometrically and also used as an indicator of chondrogenesis (13Frenz D. Van de Water T.R. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used:Fdp antisense (5′-CAATATCCTTGCCAT-3′) (cDNA position 23); Fdp sense (5′-ATGGCAAGGATATTG-3′) (cDNA position 23); β-globin (5′-AGTCCCGTTCACCAT-3′); random (5′-TACAGCTACTTACCT-3′). The specificity of the selected oligonucleotides was confirmed by sequence comparisons with the NCBI GenBank™ data base using the BLAST algorithm. Each experiment performed included one untreated culture, one or two antisense oligonucleotide treated-culture(s), one or two sense oligonucleotide treated-culture(s), and one or two random or β-globin oligonucleotide-treated culture(s). A total of four independent experiments were performed, which included five antisense oligonucleotide treated-cultures, six sense oligonucleotide treated-cultures, three random oligonucleotide treated-cultures, and five β-globin oligonucleotide-treated cultures. To determine the genome structure of Fdp, a 129sv mouse genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (Genome System) was screened by PCR using the primers U1 and L136 (see above). 1 μg of DNA from the positive BAC clone 96J02 was fully digested by Sau3A and cloned into aBamHI-linearized puc18 vector. Three contiguous subclones were found to contain the first three Fdp exons by hybridization with the Fdp cDNA as a probe. Their sequences were compared with that of the Fdp cDNA to determine the limits of the first two exons as well as the 5′ limit of the third exon. The 3′ limit of the third exon and the 5′ limit of the fourth exon containing the entire 3′-untranslated region, were determined by direct sequencing of the BAC DNA. To determine the genome structure of FDP, a human BAC genomic DNA library (Genome System) was screened by PCR using primers derived from the sequence-tagged site WI-16380, presenting with 67% homology to the Fdp 3′-untranslated region. 4 μg of DNA from the positive BAC clone 95H02 were sonicated to generate random fragments between 200 and 1000 bp in length. These fragments were end-filled using Klenow DNA polymerase and subsequently cloned into aSmaI-linearized and dephosphorylated M13mp18 vector. FDP-containing subclones were isolated by hybridization screening, using a probe containing the Fdp cDNA, and sequenced. A MspI restriction fragment length polymorphism was detected between the C57BL/6 and SEG mouse strains in the 3′-untranslated region ofFdp by the hybridization of a Fdp cDNA probe to a Southern blot containing genomic DNA of both strains. Bands of 3 and 5.5 kb were detected in C57BL/6 and SEG genomic DNA, respectively. The polymorphic MspI site (cDNA position 569) was identified by PCR amplification of mouse genomic DNA from both strains using the primers U245 (5′-AAGAAGTGGAAATAACTG-3′) (cDNA position446) and L892 (5′-TACCTAACATTCTTCT-3′) (cDNA position 892), and MspI digestion of the amplified products. Using this polymorphism, the segregation of Fdp was compared with that of marker loci from chromosome 2, the region homologous to chromosome band 20p11 containing the human ortholog, FDP. These marker loci were previously typed in backcross progeny of the C57BL/6 and SEG strains of the European Collaborative Interspecific Backcross panel (14Group T.E.B.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Using a PCR amplification-based approach, we recently generated a subtracted mouse cochlear cDNA library (8Verpy E. Leibovici M. Petit C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). From this library, we identified a 160-bp clone preferentially expressed in the inner ear (see below). 3′ and 5′ RACE-PCR experiments were performed to reconstitute a full-length cDNA of 918 bp (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1 A). A transcript of a similar size was detected on Northern blots using the full-length cDNA as a probe (data not shown). In reference to its site of expression, we named the corresponding gene Fdp, for fibrocyte-derived protein. The translation initiation site was identified by the presence of an adequate Kozak consensus sequence GGAAGATGG at position 9 (15Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar). The initiation codon was preceded by a 8-bp 5′-untranslated region, and followed by a 384-bp open reading frame and a 518-bp 3′-untranslated region. The predicted Fdp protein sequence starts with a 18-amino acid sequence rich in uncharged and hydrophobic residues, characteristic of a signal peptide (Fig. 1 A) (16Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). Its cleavage would leave His-19 as the N-terminal amino acid of a putative 110-residue mature protein, with a predicted molecular mass of 11 kDa. No evidence of either a transmembrane domain or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchorage sequence (17Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was found in the deduced amino acid sequence, indicating that this protein is likely to be secreted. It did not contain a glycosylation consensus site, or any previously identified protein domains. GenBank™ sequence comparison studies of the Fdp cDNA showed that it was approximately 65% homologous to the human, mouse, rat, and bovine MIA/CD-RAP cDNA (18Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Beht C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol.

Sandell L.J. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that Fdp and MIA/CD-RAP may form a new gene family. The Fdp protein sequence showed 44% identity and approximately 80% similarity with MIA/CD-RAP (Fig. 1 B). The four cysteine residues present in all MIA/CD-RAP orthologous proteins, which have been suggested to be involved in the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds (18Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Beht C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar), were also conserved in Fdp (Fig. 1 B). No noticeable amino acid conservation between Fdp and MIA/CD-RAP, which could be indicative of a protein domain, was found. The expression pattern of Fdpwas studied by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization at different stages of development. After birth (Fig. 2 A), RT-PCR experiments showed a strong Fdp expression in the cochlea, and a weak expression in the eyes and in cartilage from the clavicle, femur, and cranium. A very faint signal was also detected in the brain. No expression was detected in the liver, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, intestine, or testis. RT-PCR analysis of total embryos throughout development demonstrated that Fdp is expressed from E10.5 onward (Fig. 2 B). Finally, the embryonic inner ear expression of Fdp was analyzed in microdissected periotic mesenchyme. Fdp was amplified by RT-PCR from this tissue at E10.5 (Fig. 2 A). Localization of the Fdp transcript in the inner ear was then studied by in situ hybridization at different stages of development (see “Experimental Procedures”). From E11.5 to E16.5, no signal could be detected (data not shown), even in the periotic mesenchyme where Fdp was detectable by RT-PCR (see above), probably due to the low expression level of Fdp. At E11.5, the periotic mesenchyme has begun to aggregate, condense, and initiate prechondrogenic changes, characterized by the secretion of extracellular matrix components such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans (S-GAG). The chondrogenic program continues between E12 and E13, with a strong increase in S-GAG synthesis. However, at E14, this synthesis decreases in the mesenchymal cells immediately surrounding the otic epithelium, while it remains high in the other areas (21McPhee J.R. Van de Water T.R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1986; 97: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, morphological changes appear in the mesenchyme, with the formation of two concentric rings, the inner ring shows a reduced density compared with the outer ring. (22Knowlton V.Y. J. Morphol. 1967; 121: 179-208Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Sher A.E. Acta Otolaryngol. 1971; 285: 5-77Google Scholar). From E14 onward, the outermost ring continues its chondrogenesis and differentiates into cartilage, which ultimately gives rise to the bone of the otic capsule. The inner ring cells differentiate into fibrocytes, which have a characteristic shape formed by several cytoplasmic extensions (24Iurato S. Z. Zelforsch. 1962; 56: 40-96Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Takahashi T. Kimura R.S. Acta Otolaryngol. 1970; 69: 46-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At E17.5, Fdp was expressed in the fibrocytes surrounding the cochlear and vestibular duct (Fig. 3 A). At around E18, the fibrocytic tissue cavitates to form the scala vestibuli and scala tympani around the cochlear duct, which shows a typical snail shape of one and three-quarter turns (22Knowlton V.Y. J. Morphol. 1967; 121: 179-208Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Sher A.E. Acta Otolaryngol. 1971; 285: 5-77Google Scholar). After birth, in the cochlea,Fdp expression was detected in all types of fibrocytes in the spiral ligament behind the stria vascularis, in the suprastrial zone, in the spiral limbus, and in the surpralimbal zone, as well as in the mesenchymal cells underlying the basilar membrane (Fig. 3 B). No signal was detected in any of the inner ear epithelia or in the cartilage of the otic capsule. The same expression pattern was observed at postnatal day (P) 15 (data not shown). The expression pattern ofFdp in the E10.5 periotic mesenchyme suggests that this gene could play a role in the early chondrogenic events leading to the formation of the otic capsule. In order to test this hypothesis, we incubated E10.5 mesenchyme + otic epithelium micromass cultures with anFdp antisense oligonucleotide complementary to a region containing the Fdp ATG translation start codon (see “Experimental Procedures”). Otocysts with their associated periotic mesenchyme were microdissected and cultured following the micromass technique (26Ahrens P.B. Solursh M. Reiter S. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). On culture day 3, sites of mesenchymal condensation, which precede cartilage development, were counted and used as an early indicator of chondrogenesis (13Frenz D. Van de Water T.R. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In untreated cultures and cultures treated with the Fdp sense oligonucleotide, numerous mesenchymal condensations formed (Fig. 4; Table I). Condensations of similar size and morphology also developed in Fdp antisense oligonucleotide-treated cultures; however, their mean numbers were significantly reduced by 49% (Student's test, p < 0.05) in comparison to that of the control cultures (Table I). By culture day 7, mesenchymal condensations normally differentiate into chondrogenic foci which form the cartilage and synthesize a characteristic extracellular matrix rich in S-GAG. We reasoned that if Fdp is essential for chondrogenesis, then the observed effect of blocking Fdp with an antisense oligonucleotide on mesenchymal condensation should be reflected in the later chondrogenic event of S-GAG accumulation. We therefore examined the extent of chondrogenesis in response to oligonucleotide treatment by staining the cells with Alcian Blue (pH 1.0), which binds specifically to S-GAG, and quantifying the matrix bound Alcian Blue (see “Experimental Procedures”) (27Lev R. Spicer S.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Mean values for binding of Alcian Blue stain were comparable in untreated cultures and cultures treated with the sense oligonucleotide (Table I). However, in cultures treated with theFdp antisense oligonucleotide, the mean value for binding of Alcian Blue stain was significantly decreased by 48% (Student's test,p < 0.05) in comparison to that of the sense oligonucleotide-treated cultures. There is, therefore, a strict correlation between the effect of Fdp antisense oligonucleotide treatment on the number of foci and S-GAG accumulation. In order to test the possible cytotoxic effect of the oligonucleotide treatment, several controls were performed under the same conditions using a random oligonucleotide or an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to the initiation site of the murine β-globin gene. These treatments had no effect on mesenchymal condensation and S-GAG accumulation (Tables I). We could therefore conclude that the observedFdp antisense oligonucleotide effect on chondrogenesis was specific.Table IEffects of Fdp oligonucleotides on chondrogenesis in cultured E10.5 periotic mesenchyme + otic epitheliumTreatmentCondensation no. 1-aOn day 3 of culture, mesenchymal condensations were counted.S-GAG accumulation 1-bOn day 7 of culture, cells were fixed then stained with Alcian blue 8GX, pH 1.0.

Open table in a new tab Cultures of E10.5 periotic mesenchyme + otic epithelium were grown in the presence or absence of Fdp oligonucleotides. Values represent the mean for three to five cultures per experimental group (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based on the role of Fdp in the early chondrogenesis of the inner ear, this gene is a good candidate for deafness. We therefore determined the genomic structure ofFdp and its human ortholog FDP and mapped them to the murine and human genomes, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). BAC genomic clones containing the whole Fdpand FDP genes were isolated and analyzed (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1 C,Fdp contains four exons, which span an approximately 3.2-kb genomic region, as is also the case for FDP (data not shown). The FDP predicted protein sequence, deduced from the genomic sequence, was 86.7% identical to that of the mouse Fdp protein sequence (Fig. 1 B). Part of the human 3′-untranslated region of FDP is homologous to sequence-tagged site WI-16380 that maps to 20p11, near the D20S104 and D20S118 markers. The comparative mouse and human map predicted that the murine Fdp locus would map to the homologous region on mouse chromosome 2 (Mouse Genome Data Base). The co-segregation of Fdp and chromosome 2 markers in this region was therefore analyzed using an interspecific backcross panel (14Group T.E.B.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fdp was mapped between the D2Mit223 and D2Mit22 markers (Fig. 5). Here, we report the isolation of Fdp, a novel gene preferentially expressed in the inner ear that encodes a fibrocyte-derived protein. Fdp is highly homologous to MIA/CD-RAP (18Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Beht C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol.

Sandell L.J. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). They both possess a potential signal peptide and exhibit a similar hydrophobicity profile (data not shown) (18Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Beht C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, four cysteine residues, which are thought to form intradisulfide bonds in the human MIA, are also conserved. Fdp, like MIA, is therefore likely to be secreted as a small globular protein (18Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Beht C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar). TheFdp-encoding gene also has the same structure asMIA, i.e. four exons distributed over a 3.2-kb region. MIA and Fdp may thus constitute a new gene family. MIA/CD-RAP is a cartilage-specific gene. Its expression, which is restricted to chondrocytes and mature cartilage, is correlated with the expression of the chondrocyte-characteristic type IIB splice form of the type II procollagen, and is sensitive to retinoic acid treatment (19Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3311-3316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Bosserhoff A.K. Kondo S. Moser M. Dietz U.H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins M.A. Buettner R. Sandell L.J. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported to be regulated by Sox9, a transcription factor essential for the chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation (28Xie X.F. Zhang X. Sanako S. Lefebvre V. Sandell L.J. J. Bone Miner. 1999; 14: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). The role of MIA/CD-RAP in cartilage development remains to be clarified. It also has been found to be highly expressed in several malignant human melanoma cell lines, as well as in some neuroectodermally derived tumors, and a Swarm rat and human chondrosarcoma (18Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Beht C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bosserhoff A.K. Kondo S. Moser M.

Res. 1998; 16: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition to its action as a potent tumor cell growth inhibitor, by blocking DNA replication in human melanoma cell lines (18Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Beht C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar), MIA/CD-RAP also decreases the adhesive capacity of the cells. Therefore, it may promote tumoral invasion. The relationship between the expression of MIA/CD-RAP in malignant cells and in developing cartilage is still puzzling. Dietz et al. (19Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3311-3316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have suggested that, as described in tumors, it could control the shape and inhibit division of the chondrocytes that are essential for cartilage differentiation. Fdp is predominantly expressed in the inner ear, which undergoes chondrogenesis during development. Its expression is first detected in the periotic mesenchyme and then in the developing and mature fibrocytes, which form a loosely aggregated tissue in the perilymphatic spaces between the membranous duct and the cartilage of the otic capsule. The fibrocytes are large cells with several cytoplasmic extensions (24Iurato S. Z. Zelforsch. 1962; 56: 40-96Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Takahashi T. Kimura R.S. Acta Otolaryngol. 1970; 69: 46-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). They have been classified into five different classes, according to their localization, orientation, and ion transport activity (32Spicer S. Schulte B.A. Hearing Res. 1991; 56: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Spicer S.S. Schulte B.A. Hearing Res. 1996; 100: 80-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These cells, which are connected to each other by gap junctions, have been proposed to play a key role in the regulation of the potassium concentration of the endolymph which bathes the sensory epithelia of the inner ear (34Kikushi T. Adams J.C. Paul D.L. Kimura R.S. Acta Otolaryngol. 1994; 114: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 35Kikuchi T. Kimura R.S. Paul D.L. Adams J.C. Anat.

Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 294: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Indeed, the fibrocytes of the spiral ligament, in the lateral wall of the cochlea, are thought to drive the potassium to the stria vascularis, which is responsible for the endolymph secretion (33Spicer S.S. Schulte B.A. Hearing Res. 1996; 100: 80-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 37Minowa O. Ikeda K. Sugitani Y. Oshima T. Nakai S. Katori Y. Suzuki M. Furukawa M. Kawase T. Zheng Y. Ogura M.

The blocking of Fdp expression using antisense oligonucleotides inhibits chondrogenesis in microdissected periotic mesenchyme + otic epithelium in culture. This therefore implies that Fdp plays a role in the chondrogenic events that occur during otic capsule development. The controls included in our study demonstrate the specificity of the observed effect; however, the absence of a Fdp-specific antibody prevents us from determining whether a low level of Fdp expression may exist. The involvement of several growth factors in the early chondrogenesis of the otic capsule has already been demonstrated using similar strategies: fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3), using antisense oligonucleotides (38Frenz D.A. Liu W. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and transforming growth factor β 1 (39Frenz D.A. Galinovic-Schwartz V. Liu W. Flanders K.C. Van de Water T.R. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 324-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (40Frenz D.A. Liu W. Williams J.D. Hatcher V. Galinovic-Schwartz V. Flanders K.C. Van de Water T.R. Development. 1994; 120: 415-424PubMed Google Scholar), FGF2 and FGF3 (38Frenz D.A. Liu W. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and bone morphogenetic protein-2a (41Frenz D.A. Capparelli M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 785: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), using purified proteins and their corresponding antibodies. In these studies, as was observed for Fdp, the number of condensation foci is affected, rather than their size or morphology, which indicates that these factors play a role in the initiation of chondrogenesis. They are indeed part of a developmental switch, which thereafter leads to the formation of the cartilage of the perilymphatic spaces and to a distinct capsular morphology (13Frenz D. Van de Water T.R. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21McPhee J.R. Van de Water T.R. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1986; 97: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Gene inactivation approaches have also demonstrated the involvement of other molecules in the formation of the otic capsule, such as the retinoic acid receptors α and γ (42Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dollé P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Development. 1994; 120: 2723-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transforming growth factor β2 (43Sanford L.P. Ormsby I. Gittenberger de Groot A.C. Sariola H. Friedmann R. Boivin G. Cardell E.L. Doestchman T. Development. 1997; 124: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the transcription factor Brn4 (37Minowa O. Ikeda K. Sugitani Y. Oshima T. Nakai S. Katori Y. Suzuki M. Furukawa M. Kawase T. Zheng Y. Ogura M. Asada Y. Watanabe K. Yamanaka H. Gotoh S. Nishi-Takeshima M. Sugimoto T. Kikuchi T. Takasaka T. Noda T. Science. 1999; 285: 1408-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in this latter gene are responsible for a nonsyndromic form of deafness, linked to the X chromosome (44de Kok Y.J.M. van der Maarel S.M. Bitner-Glindzicz M. Huber I. Monaco A.P. Malcolm S. Pembrey M.E. Ropers H.-H. Cremers F.P.M. Science. 1995; 267: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The inactivation of Brn4 results in an abnormal morphology of the otic capsule (37Minowa O. Ikeda K. Sugitani Y. Oshima T. Nakai S. Katori Y. Suzuki M. Furukawa M. Kawase T. Zheng Y. Ogura M. Asada Y. Watanabe K. Yamanaka H. Gotoh S. Nishi-Takeshima M. Sugimoto T. Kikuchi T. Takasaka T. Noda T. Science. 1999; 285: 1408-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 45Phippard D. Lu L. Lee D. Saunders J.C. Crenshaw III, E.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5980-5989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the coexpression ofBrn4 and Fdp in the periotic mesenchyme, we could expect the same phenotype following inactivation of Fdp(46Phippard D. Heydemann A. Lechner M. Lu L. Lee D. Kyin T. Crenshaw III, E.B. Hearing Res. 1998; 120: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to the proposed role of Fdp in the early morphogenesis of the otic capsule, Fdp may later be involved in the differentiation of the fibrocytic tissue versus the cartilage, as suggested by its restricted expression in the fibrocytes. It could, as observedin vitro for MIA/CD-RAP (18Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Beht C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar), regulate cell density and shape, which control for fibrocyte differentiation. As discussed above, these cells are involved in the inner ear ion transport mechanisms. Malformation of the fibrocytic tissue, which is observed after inactivation of Brn4 (37Minowa O. Ikeda K. Sugitani Y. Oshima T. Nakai S. Katori Y. Suzuki M. Furukawa M. Kawase T. Zheng Y. Ogura M. Asada Y. Watanabe K. Yamanaka H. Gotoh S. Nishi-Takeshima M. Sugimoto T. Kikuchi T. Takasaka T. Noda T.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5980-5989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), results in abnormal ionic concentrations of the inner ear fluids, which greatly affect auditory function. The same effect could result from a mutation inFdp. To date, no locus for deafness has been mapped to the same chromosomal region as FDP. However, all loci responsible for deafness are far from being identified, as illustrated by their continuously growing number (47Petit C. Levilliers J. Marlin S. Hardelin J.-P. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, Montreal2000Google Scholar). According to the role of FDP in the development of the otic capsule that we demonstrate here using anin vitro approach, this gene could be a candidate for deafness associated with malformations of the otic capsule, which comprise approximately 13% of sporadic cases of isolated deafness (48Denoyelle F.

https://openalex.org/W1983007539,"A major function of tropomyosin (TPM) in nonmuscle cells may be stabilization of F-actin by binding longitudinally along the actin filament axis. However, no clear evidence exists in vitro that TPM can significantly affect the critical concentration of actin. We previously made a polymerization-defective mutant actin, GG (V266G, L267G). This actin will not polymerize alone at 25 °C but will in the presence of phalloidin or beryllium fluoride. With beryllium fluoride, but not phalloidin, this polymerization rescue is cold-sensitive. We show here that GG-actin polymerizability was restored by cardiac tropomyosin and yeast TPM1 and TPM2 at 25 °C with rescue efficiency inversely proportional to TPM length (TPM2 > TPM1 > cardiac tropomyosin), indicating the importance of the ends in polymerization rescue. In the presence of TPM, the apparent critical concentration of actin is 5.5 μm, 10–15-fold higher than that of wild type actin but well below that of the GG-actin alone (>20 μm). Non N-acetylated TPMs did not rescue GG-actin polymerization. The TPMs did not prevent cold-induced depolymerization of GG F-actin. TPM-dependent GG-actin polymerization did not occur at temperatures below 20 °C.

Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to 40 kDa for rat fibroblast TPM1 (2Huxley H.E. Nature. 1973; 243: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Tropomyosins possess a dimeric α-helical coiled-coil structure along virtually the entire length of the protein, and heptad repeat motifs with hydrophobic residues at positions 1 and 4 are found along the entire molecule. These quasirepeat regions appear to match up with actin monomers when tropomyosin binds to F-actin along the filament axis and may serve as weak actin binding regions. Tropomyosins have a basic amino terminus, which is usually N-acetylated, and for most tropomyosins, the acetyl group is believed to be important for preservation of the helical structure at the end of the protein (3Greenfield N.J. Stafford W.F. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 402-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Adjacent tropomyosins form head-to-tail overlapping interactions along the length of the actin filament (4McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and these overlaps are believed to be the major site of interaction between F-actin and tropomyosin (5Butters C.A. Willadsen K.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15565-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15565-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) loses the ability to bind to actin. The interaction between actin and the internal quasirepeat regions of tropomyosin is believed to be weaker but still critical for cooperative binding to F-actin actin (8Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. An Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3600-3603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and there is a hierarchy of importance among these quasirepeat regions (9Landis C. Back N. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31279-31285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The role of tropomyosin, along with troponin, as a mediator of calcium regulation of thin filament function in sarcomeric muscle is well established. However, its role in nonmuscle cells, where there is no troponin, is poorly understood. Based on its ability to interact simultaneously with a number of actin monomers along the actin helix, it has been hypothesized that tropomyosin functions as a stabilizer of actin filaments in nonmuscle cells. Even a modest effect of TPM on filament stability would be biologically significant because actin monomer binding proteins in the cell act to amplify any change in stability such as the critical concentration (10Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in vitro addressing this question, however, do not yield consistent results. Experiments in vitro using muscle actin and muscle tropomyosins showed that tropomyosin can alter the monomer association and dissociation rates at both ends of the filament, resulting in a small change in critical concentration (11Lal A.A. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1154-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Broschat et al.(12Broschat K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21323-21329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Broschat K.O. Weber A. Burgess D.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8501-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated that nonmuscle and muscle tropomyosins slowed depolymerization at the pointed end of the filament, while another study reported that tropomyosin prevented filament fragmentation but did not alter elongation rate (14Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Sampath P. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9182-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These differing results may derive from differences in muscle versus nonmuscle tropomyosin or from differences in experimental methodology. It is also possible that the low critical concentration and the stability of muscle actin filaments in vitro render the filament-stabilizing properties of tropomyosin difficult to measure reproducibly. This situation would also make it very difficult for one to determine the relative contribution of different parts of the tropomyosin molecule to actin filament stabilization. A valuable system for the assessment of tropomyosin in nonmuscle cells has been the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This yeast contains two tropomyosins, each encoded by a separate gene. TPM1, which contains five internal quasirepeat regions, constitutes about 85% of the cell's tropomyosin and is present in sufficient quantities to saturate the F-actin present in the cell (15Liu H.P. Bretscher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). TPM2, which contains only four quasirepeat regions, comprises 15% of the cell's tropomyosin (1Drees B. Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both bind to actin in a saturable fashion, with the binding of TPM2 less sensitive to higher salt than TPM1. The simultaneous deletion of both TPM genes results in cell death, whereas deletion of the TPM1 gene, alone, results in a mild tsphenotype, and disappearance of actin cables. These phenotypes can be partially rescued by overexpression of TPM2. Deletion of TPM2 alone produces no recognizable phenotype. We previously generated a mutant yeast actin, GG, with a polymerization defect in vitro. Cells expressing this as their only actin are viable but sick (16Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4412-4418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this actin, two hydrophobic residues, Val266 and Leu267, were simultaneously altered to glycines. These residues are at the amino-terminal end of a hydrophobic loop between actin subdomains 3 and 4, which, according to a model advanced by Holmes and colleagues (17Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar), interacts with a hydrophobic surface composed of two neighboring monomers on the opposing strand of the actin filament. Such an interaction would impart cross-strand stabilization to the filament structure. The model predicts that interference with this hydrophobic interaction should destabilize the filament, and we showed that this mutant actin would not polymerize at concentrations as high as 19 μm. Phalloidin, which forms a bridge between the two strands of the filament (18Drubin D.G. Jones H.D. Wertman K.F. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Beryllium fluoride (BeFx) also restores polymerizability to the actin. BeFx occupies the position on the actin monomer vacated by the inorganic phosphate that is slowly released following hydrolysis of ATP by actin during polymerization of the protein (21Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The binding of BeFx converts the filament to a more stable ADP-Pi-like state by strengthening intermonomer contacts along the filament axis such that the increased stability can compensate for the loss in cross-strand stabilization caused by the GG mutation (20Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic interactions are predicted to be cold-sensitive (22Privalov P.L. Gill S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 191-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). However, while phalloidin rescue is not cold-sensitive, BeFx rescue is; the GG-actin depolymerizes as the temperature decreases to 4 °C. Sac6p, the yeast homologue of the actin filament bundling protein fimbrin, binds to the actin filament between neighboring actin monomers along the filament axis, and in agreement with our BeFx results, this protein also rescues GG polymerization in a temperature-sensitive fashion (23Cheng D. Marner J. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35873-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The viability of GG-actin-expressing cells, despite the polymerization defect exhibited by the actin in vitro, implies that another protein within the yeast can rescue GG-actin function. A candidate for such a protein is tropomyosin due to its mode of binding to the actin filament and to the amount of TPM1 relative to the amount of actin in the cell. Although the binding of tropomyosin to actin depends on the integrity of the ends of TPM, the contribution of the internal repeats to formation of a stable tropomyosin-actin complex is still under debate. The side-binding nature of TPM suggests that it should rescue GG-actin polymerizability in much the same way that Sac6p does, and the availability of tropomyosins of different lengths allows us to also address the relative contribution of the ends of TPM versusthe internal quasirepeat regions in actin filament stabilization. In this paper, we assess the ability of N-acetylated and non-N-acetylated yeast TPM1 and TPM2 and bovine cardiac tropomyosin (CTPM) to rescue GG-actin polymerization at different temperatures. Affi-Gel 10 activated resin was purchased from Bio-Rad, and DNase I (grade D) was purchased from Worthington. DNase I affinity columns were made as described previously (24Cook R.K. Blake W.T.

Recombinant yeast TPM1 and TPM2, isolated from Escherichia coli and therefore possessing an unblocked NH2 terminus, were the generous gift of Dr. Larry Tobacman (University of Iowa). Recombinant chicken striated muscle α-tropomyosin produced from E. coli was a generous gift of Sarah Hitchcock-DeGregori (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). Yeast wild type and mutant GG-actins were purified in the Ca2+ form by a DNase I affinity chromatography protocol as described (20Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol.

Actins were converted to their Mg2+ form at 4 °C according to Strzelecka-Golaszewska et al. (25Strzelecka-Golaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and used within 12 h. Native bovine cardiac tropomyosin was prepared from an acetone powder of heart tissue according to the procedure of Butters et al. (5Butters C.A. Willadsen K.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15565-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based on heat fractionation, salt fractionation, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. To produce yeast TPM1, we first constructed a Δtpm2 haploid yeast strain (yPAR-5) and transformed it with a TPM1 overexpression plasmid in which expression of TPM1 was under control of the GAL1 promoter. For TPM2 production, a haploid Δtpm1strain (yPAR-6) was constructed and transformed with a TPM2 overexpression plasmid, also under galactose regulation. The TPM1 and TPM2 plasmids were kindly provided by A. Bretscher (Cornell University). TPM1 and TPM2 were purified according to a modification of the protocol of Drees et al. (1Drees B. Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Following induction of the plasmids with galactose for 12 h, cell lysates were made from 4-liter cultures and subjected to heat and salt fractionation followed by ion exchange chromatography on a Pharmacia MonoQ column. These two tropomyosins were subjected to an additional gel filtration step on Sephacryl 200 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm KCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The resulting protein was then dialyzed against the same buffer without the KCl. In each case, single bands were obtained following SDS gel electrophoresis. Tropomyosin concentrations (dimers) were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using the following extinction coefficients: ΔεCTPM = 0.01536 cm-1·M−1, ΔεTPM1= 0.02788 cm−1·m−1, and ΔεTPM2 = 0.03068 cm−1·m−1. Yields of the tropomyosins were 8.1 mg of TPM1 and 4 mg of TPM2 from 10 g of each cell type. Actin polymerization was assessed by following the increase in light scattering as a function of time. Experiments were performed in a 120-μl cuvette in a thermostatted cell chamber of a Spex Fluorolog 3 fluorescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 360 nm. For experiments at 25 °C, tropomyosin of the desired type and concentration was mixed with Mg2+-GG-actin in Mg2+-G buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm MgCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). Polymerization was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 50 mm, respectively. The steep deflection observed at the beginning of the kinetic trace is due to the opening and closing of the sample chamber during the addition of the salt. Actin polymerization data are normalized against the net increase in light scattering caused by the polymerization of 19 μm WT actin in the presence of saturating amounts of CTPM. Temperature was regulated with a thermostatted water bath attached to the cuvette chamber. In those cases where the temperature was lowered from 25 °C, the rate of decrease was about 2 °C per 3 min. In cases where we increased the temperature from 4 °C, the temperature was raised 5 °C over a 2-min period, after which the sample was allowed to remain at the new temperature for 10 min. Samples containing 19 μmactin were deposited on carbon-coated Formvar grids, negatively stained with 1.5% uranyl acetate, and observed on a Hitachi 7000 transmission electron microscope in the University of Iowa Central Electron Microscopy Facility. We first assessed the ability of different tropomyosins to restore the polymerizability of the Mg2+ form of GG-actin at 25 °C (Fig. 1). As reported previously, the addition of salt in the absence of tropomyosin causes an initial small increase in light scattering followed by a slow decrease toward base-line values. This change occurs without the formation of stable filaments as judged by electron microscopy (Fig. 3) and may involve an abortive attempt at filament formation following salt-induced nucleation. At saturating levels of tropomyosin, the three tropomyosins tested, CTPM, TPM1, and TPM2 (Fig. 1, A–C) all induced the same increase in light scattering in the presence of 19 μm GG-actin, although the rate of increase for the two yeast tropomyosins was faster than that observed for the cardiac protein. In each of these cases, electron microscopy showed that this stable increase in light scattering was accompanied by F-actin formation and did not merely result from salt-induced aggregation. Filaments were also observed (data not shown) at subsaturating tropomyosin concentrations in which the final extent of increased light scattering was reduced by about 60%.Figure 5Concentration dependence of the ability of tropomyosins to restore GG-actin polymerizability. In each case, 19 μm actin was combined with different amounts of CTPM (A), yeast TPM1 (B), and yeast TPM2 (C), and polymerization was assessed as in Fig. 1. Tropomyosin concentrations are presented on a weight rather than a molar basis (see “Results”), and results are normalized to the light scattering achieved with 19 μm WT actin plus saturating CTPM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1CTPM and yeast TPM1 and TPM2 restore the polymerizability of GG-actin. For these experiments, 15 μm tropomyosin was added to 19 μmMg2+-GG-actin followed by the addition of 2 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm KCl to induce polymerization. The increase in light scattering was then monitored as a function of time. In each panel, curve 1 is 19 μm WT actin with saturating CTPM, which serves as a control for the maximum light scattering possible if all of the actin in the sample polymerized.

Although the physiologically relevant form of actin has Mg2+ bound at this site, the protein is often prepared and studied in the Ca2+ form because of its enhanced stability. Previous work has shown that there are distinct differences in the dynamic properties of these two forms of actin. We thus determined the ability of TPM1 to induce polymerization of the Ca2+ form of GG-actin (Fig. 2). With Ca2+ actin, the initial rise in light scattering seen in the absence of tropomyosin does not occur, in contrast to the situation with the Mg2+form of actin, in agreement with previous results (20Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The addition of saturating TPM1 induced the same degree of light scattering increase observed with the Mg2+ form, and EM demonstrated again that this increased light scattering resulted from formation of F-actin (Fig. 3). However, the rate of increase for the Ca2+ form of actin is slower than that observed with the Mg2+ form and may simply reflect the faster rate of polymerization of the Mg2+ form of WT actin alone in comparison with its Ca2+ form. It had been shown previously that removal of the N-terminal acetyl group from sarcomeric tropomyosins prevented their binding to F-actin. We therefore assessed the effect of this post-translational modification on the ability of muscle and both yeast tropomyosins to rescue the polymerization of GG-actin. The unacetylated proteins were obtained from E. coli that had been transformed with plasmids carrying the tropomyosin coding sequences. We utilized chick skeletal muscle α-tropomyosin instead of the CTPM because of its availability as a recombinant protein. None of these nonacetylated tropomyosins were able to restore GG-actin polymerization at concentrations where the rescue by the acetylated proteins was maximal (Fig. 4), and EM confirmed the absence of actin filaments in these preparations (Fig. 3, F–H). It had previously been demonstrated that extension of the N terminus of a nonacetylated sarcomeric tropomyosin by addition of an Ala-Ser restored the ability of the tropomyosin to bind to F-actin and to restore thin filament regulation (26Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This tropomyosin also restored GG-actin polymerization although to a lesser extent than WT acetylated tropomyosin (data not shown). These experiments underscore the importance of the tropomyosin N terminus in the rescue of GG-actin polymerization and suggest that tropomyosin end-end overlap plays an important role in the establishment of GG-actin filament stability. To further establish the relative importance of the tropomyosin ends versus internal quasirepeat regions in the rescue of GG-actin polymerization, we assessed the relative ability of different concentrations of CTPM (seven quasirepeating regions), TPM1 (five quasirepeating regions), and TPM2 (four quasirepeating regions) to polymerize 19 μm Mg2+-GG-actin. Per length of actin filament, at saturating conditions, there should be more ends with the shorter tropomyosins and hence a tighter interaction between actin and tropomyosin if the hypothesis is correct. The results are displayed in Fig. 5 and are presented on a weight basis with respect to the amount of tropomyosin used. The use of weight rather than molarity allows one to account for differences in the molecular weights of the three different tropomyosins used. Because of this molecular weight difference, approximately the same weight of each of the tropomyosins, not the same number of molecules, should be bound per length of actin filament at saturating concentrations. The results show that the efficiency of rescue of GG-actin polymerization varies inversely with the length of the tropomyosin used. Saturation was approximately achieved with 360 μg/ml of CTPM, 225 μg/ml of TPM1, and 171 μg/ml of TPM2. A plot of these concentrationsversus the number of quasirepeats in the tropomyosin yields a straight line (Fig. 6), suggesting that the number of ends per length of actin is a central factor in rescue efficiency. The incomplete polymerization of GG-actin produced in the presence of saturating tropomyosin concentrations (Figs. 1 and 8) indicates that the critical concentration of GG-actin in the presence of tropomyosin is much higher than the value for wild type actin, 0.4 μm (27Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine an approximate value for the critical concentration of GG-actin, we incubated the G form of Mg2+-GG-actin at concentrations between 1 and 19 μm with 7.5 μm CTPM, TPM1, or TPM2 in F-buffer at 25 °C and recorded the final increase in light scattering. This concentration of tropomyosin is well above that needed for saturation for each of the tropomyosins based on the results of Fig. 7. The final net increase in light scattering was then plotted as a function of actin concentration. Fig. 7 shows that for each of the three tropomyosins, the critical concentration for Mg2+-GG-actin was approximately 5.5 μm. Thus, although each of the tropomyosins tested can lower the critical concentration of actin from ≫20 to about 5 μm, the final value is still 10–15 times that observed for the critical concentration of WT actin in the absence of tropomyosin. The side-binding nature of the tropomyosin-F-actin interaction predicts that tropomyosin's ability to rescue GG-actin polymerization should display a cold sensitivity similar to that seen with BeFx or Sac6p-induced rescue. To test this hypothesis, 19 μm GG-actin was polymerized in the presence of 500 μg/ml CTPM, TPM1, or TPM2 at 25 °C (Fig. 8 A). This concentration was well above saturating levels for each of the tropomyosins in question. The results show a TPM-dependent acceleration of polymerization with TPM2 > TPM1 > CTPM. The temperature was then lowered to 4 °C over about a 30-min period with continuous monitoring of the light scattering of the sample. With each of the three tropomyosins, we observed a decrease in light scattering, which reached a plateau at between 4 and 8% above background (Fig. 8 B). Electron microscopic examination of these samples revealed mostly small aggregates with occasional filament-like structures observed (Fig. 9). The relative rates of depolymerization were much more similar for these three samples than were the relative polymerization rates. Additionally, the filament stability order was reproducibly different as well from what we observed for polymerization efficiency: CTPM > TPM2 > TPM1. We then determined whether this cold-induced depolymerization was reversible and, if so, what the temperature dependence of repolymerization was. No light scattering increase was observed when any of the samples were raised to 10 or 15 °C (Fig. 8 C). However, elevation of the sample to 20 °C resulted in an increased light scattering (Fig. 8 D), which EM showed was due to repolymerization of the actin (Fig. 9). These last results are remarkable for two reasons. First, the plateau level reached is significantly lower that that achieved initially at 25 °C, demonstrating the extreme temperature sensitivity of GG F-actin stability in the presence of tropomyosin. Second, the order of repolymerization efficiency with respect to tropomyosin is identical to the polymerization efficiency order seen originally at 25 °C. However, the relative differences between the ability of these three tropomyosins to induce polymerization are much greater at lower temperatures, suggesting that as the temperature is lowered, the tropomyosin end interactions become more crucial in the rescue process. If the sample is jumped to 25 °C (data not shown), the light scattering reaches the same plateau that we observed in Fig. 8 A, demonstrating the total reversibility of this process. The focus of this work was to determine whether or not tropomyosin, because of its ability to bind F-actin along the filament axis, could restore polymerizability to GG-actin, a polymerization-defective mutant yeast actin. If so, then tropomyosin would become a prime candidate for a protein that is required for GG-actin to function in vivo in a manner compatible with cell viability. Our results clearly demonstrate the ability of not only both yeast tropomyosins but also a sarcomeric tropomyosin to restore GG-actin polymerizability. All three tropomyosins do this in a saturable manner by a mechanism that apparently requires the ability of the ends of tropomyosin to interact with one another, based on our results with the nonacetylated proteins. Furthermore, all three tropomyosins confer the same apparent critical concentration on the actin, about 5.5 μm. In the absence of TPM, the critical concentration is so high that stable polymers will not form at 25 °C at concentrations as high as 19 μm GG-actin. Therefore, the interaction of the TPM with the actin monomers at or near the end of the filament must change their conformations via strengthened intermonomer contacts such that the addition of a new monomer to the filament end becomes favorable. We believe this is, if not the first, then certainly one of the clearest demonstrations of tropomyosin's ability to act as an F-actin stabilizer by significantly lowering the critical concentration of the actin as opposed to protecting the filament against severing. As impressive as this rescue is, it is much less efficient than the ability of yeast fimbrin to restore GG-actin polymerizability. At 25 °C, saturating concentrations of the yeast fimbrin, Sac6p, at any of the actin concentrations we examined, drove all of the GG-actin into filament bundles, implying that the critical concentration for actin in this case was equal to or less than that exhibited by WT actin. We believe this difference in rescue efficiency reflects the very different modes by which Sac6p and tropomyosin bind to the actin filament. For tropomyosin, it has been hypothesized that the strongest interactions with actin monomers involve the interacting ends of adjacent TPMs with weaker interactions involving the internal quasirepeat regions. Thus, with the tropomyosins we employed, there would be a strong contact between every four and seven actin monomers depending on the tropomyosin. On the other hand, the actin binding domain of Sac6p binds between adjacent monomers, forming a very tight bridge between them, and we have shown that one Sac6p contact per two actin monomers was needed for stable filament formation. Furthermore, at 25 °C with Sac6p in vitro, one does not observe single filaments but ordered bundles due to the cross-linking nature of the protein. This added stabilization may well play a significant role in the enhanced ability of the Sac6p to restore GG-actin polymerization. At very low temperatures, isolated single actin filaments were observed in the presence of Sac6p, presumably due to the effect of the lowered temperature on the ability of the protein to cross-link filaments. Tropomyosin's longitudinal stabilization of monomers within the F-actin helix predicts that tropomyosin-dependent rescue should exhibit the same cold sensitivity observed with BeFx- and Sac6p-dependent rescue of GG-actin polymerization. In terms of the Holmes model of the actin filament, the hydrophobic plug, which was mutated to form GG-actin, is involved in a cross-strand stabilization of F-actin by virtue of its ability to contact a hydrophobic surface made up by the interface of two monomers on the opposing strand (17Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar, 19Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Because hydrophobic interactions are cold-sensitive, elimination of two-thirds of the hydrophobicity in this plug reduces this interaction to such an extent that filament stability can no longer be maintained. Enough residual stabilization remains at 25 °C such that strengthening longitudinal monomer-monomer contacts can at least partially overcome this plug deficit. However, lowering the temperature reduces this residual cross-strand stabilization to the point where it can no longer be compensated for by increased longitudinal contacts, and the filament disassembles. To a first approximation, our data support this cold sensitivity prediction. However, there are significant differences between the sensitivity of the GG-actin to depolymerization in the presence of Sac6p versus tropomyosin. Possibly because of the enhanced longitudinal stabilization or the additional stabilization due to filament bundling, lowering the temperature to 4 °C in the presence of Sac6p did not result in complete depolymerization based on light scattering and what looked like the appearance of small aggregates under EM. Subsequent raising of the temperature produced no additional increase in light scattering until 15 °C, with further increase observed until 25 °C when recovery was complete. EM showed that this increased light scattering represented F-actin formation. Sac6p is a Ca2+-sensitive bundling protein, and when the residual assemblies at 4 °C were eliminated by treatment of the samples with Ca2+ followed by removal of the Ca2+ with EGTA, then polymerization was not observed until ≥20 °C. We interpreted this difference in temperature response to reflect the elongation of the filament (≥15 °C) versus nucleation (≥20 °C). With tropomyosin, depolymerization appeared complete at 4 °C, and repolymerization, based on light scattering, did not occur until ≥20 °C. This temperature dependence again reflects the relative lack of efficiency of tropomyosin in allowing GG-actin repolymerization, and it also implies that tropomyosin-induced repolymerization requires de novo polymer nucleation. Two of our observations provide further insight into what might be the mechanism by which tropomyosin facilitates the polymerization of GG-actin: the requirement for N-terminal acetylation of tropomyosin and the inverse relationship between the number of tropomyosin internal quasirepeats and the kinetic efficiency with which the tropomyosin affects rescue of polymerization. Rescue clearly depends heavily on the length of the tropomyosin and the ability of neighboring tropomyosins to interact with one another through their ends. The binding of a single tropomyosin molecule to a stable F-actin filament, let alone three or four actin monomers, is very weak, and if the actin filament itself is inherently unstable, this is not likely to occur to any significant extent. We suggest that the addition of salt induces nucleation and subsequent elongation, leading to the generation of unstable GG F-actin oligomers of different lengths. Since stable filaments do not form with GG-actin alone, the distribution of these oligomers will probably be skewed toward those with shorter rather than longer lengths. The extended structure of tropomyosin together with its quasirepeat structure makes it somewhat like a template, suggesting that a stable interaction between the two proteins requires a long enough oligomer to span the length of the tropomyosin. The relatively greater efficiency of rescue exhibited by the shorter tropomyosin could then be attributed to a greater number of oligomers available to interact with the shorter tropomyosin molecules during the polymerization process than the longer ones. Subsequent filament formation could then result from elongation and stabilization by tropomyosin or by annealing of these tropomyosin-stabilized oligomers. This oligomer capture model is supported by other experiments in our laboratory. 2X. Yao and P. A. Rubenstein, unpublished data. This work shows that exposure of GG-actin to F-buffer, in the absence of a stabilizing factor, induces an F-actin-like ATPase activity that reflects a need for oligomerization despite the inability of the protein to form stable actin filaments. Actin function in vivo in yeast requires the involvement of individual actin filaments, not bundles like those formed by Sac6p. Our work clearly demonstrates that tropomyosin can allow GG-actin to form individual filaments by significantly affecting the critical concentration of the actin. The question remains as to whether or not tropomyosin is required to function in this manner in GG-actin-expressing cells and to what extent tropomyosin functions this way in general in nonmuscle cells as has so often been hypothesized. We are currently addressing this question in yeasts expressing GG-actin as their sole actin."

Hypertension. 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Gene knockout studies on the mouse Ren locus have shown thatRen-2-null mice have no significant cardiovascular phenotype (9Sharp M.G. Fettes D. Brooker G. Clark A.F. Peters J. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 1126-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Homozygous Ren-1 d knockout mice, however, have nongranulated JG cells and altered macula densa cell number and morphology (10Clark A.F. Sharp M.G.F. Morley S.D. Fleming S. Peters J. Mullins J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18185-18190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that expression ofRen-2 can partially compensate for the loss ofRen-1 d with respect to maintaining arterial blood pressure but is unable to maintain normal juxtaglomerular apparatus structure. During mouse embryogenesis, renin is first expressed in the developing vessels of the kidney around E14.5 (11McGowan R. Renin Expression in Mice Tissues. Ph.D. Thesis. SUNY, Buffalo1987Google Scholar). As the more distal vessels become differentiated, renin expression parallels the progression of vasculogenesis and is no longer observed in the proximal arteries. During post-natal renal maturation, renin expression becomes restricted to the distal portion of the afferent arterioles in the JG cells (12Gomez R.A. Lynch K.R. Sturgill B.C. Elwood J.P. Chevalier R.L. Carey R.M. Peach M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F850-F858PubMed Google Scholar). Previous attempts to direct reporter gene expression under defined renin promoter sequences have had mixed success. Using a 4.6-kbRen-2 promoter fragment, T-antigen expression was restricted to JG cells in the adult kidney, but confounding effects of Tag expression may have led to apoptosis (13Sigmund C.D. Jones C.A. Fabian J.R. Mullins J.J. Gross K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Under the same promoter, theEscherichia coli LacZ gene was not expressed at all in adult kidney. 2J. J. Mullins, unpublished data.2J. J. Mullins, unpublished data. To date no murine renin transgenic studies have completely replicated wild type levels of expression, presumably because key control elements were missing from the transgene or because expression was adversely affected by the insertion site (14Mullins J.J. Sigmund C.D. Kane-Haas C. Gross K.W. McGowan R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Tronik D. Dreyfus M. Babinet C. Rougeon F.

To achieve site-independent expression, large transgenes derived from PACs (17Sternberg N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), BACs (18Shizuya H. Birren B. Kim U.-J. Mancino V. Slepak T. Tachiri Y. Simon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8794-8797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), and YACs (19Burke D.T. Carle G.F. Olson M.V. Science. 1987; 236: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar) are now routinely used. Increased clone size makes modification by standard restriction-ligation protocols unfeasible because of a lack of unique restriction sites, but several homologous recombination strategies have now been devised for BAC modification (20Yang X.W. Model P. Heintz N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 21Jessen J.R. Meng A. McFarlane R.J. Paw B.H. Zon L.I. Smith R.J. Lin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We report the successful modification of a 145-kb BAC clone encompassing the entire mouse renin locus to engineer a reporter of renin transcription and to provide suitable reagents for functional rescue experiments. The use of the modified BAC, together with its parental BAC clone, in the phenotypic rescue of theRen-1 d knockout mouse demonstrates the critical role for renin-1 in determining JGA morphology and function. The strategy of BAC modification and functional complementation outlined illustrates the potential for in vivo molecular dissection of key physiological mechanisms. BAC clones were isolated from a commercial 129/Sv mouse BAC library (Research Genetics Inc.) using the mouse Ren-2 cDNA probe and were mapped as described previously (23Mullins L.J. Kotelevtseva N. Boyd A.C. Mullins J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2539-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 a). Southern blots of digested DNA were probed with PCR products generated using map pairs,D1Mit30 and D1Mit287 (24Dietrich W.F. Millar J.C. Steen R.G. Merchant M. Damron D. Nahf R. Gross A. Joyce D.C. Wessel M. Dredge R.D. Marquis A. Stein L.D. Goodman N. Page D.C. Lander E.S. Nat. Genet. 1996; 7: 220-225Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar), which identify simple sequence length polymorphisms. Primers were obtained from Research Genetics Inc, and PCR reactions were as described (94 °C for 3 min; 25–30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 2 min; and then 72 °C for 7 min; Ref. 25Dietrich W. Katz H. Lincoln S.E. Shin H.-S. Friedman J. Dracopoli N.C. Lander E.S. Genetics. 1992; 131: 423-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An IRESβ-Geo cassette (26Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) modified to include the engrailed splice acceptor and nuclear localization signal was excised from pKL53 (a gift from Dr. Austin Smith, CGR, University of Edinburgh) on aSalI fragment (27Payne C.M. Mullins L.J. Mullins J.J. J. Human Hypertens. 1999; 13: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The cassette was introduced into the unique SalI site of pR1KO plasmid (10Clark A.F. Sharp M.G.F. Morley S.D. Fleming S. Peters J. Mullins J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18185-18190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), so that β-Geo was flanked on each side with 3.5 kb ofRen-1 d sequence, generating pR1SAIRESβ-Geo (see Fig. 2). The suicide vector, pSV1.RecA, was modified by the introduction of a multiple cloning site cassette to yield pSV1.RecA60, and the incoming recombination cassette from pR1SAIRESβ-Geo was then inserted on anAscI/SalI fragment (28Payne C.M. Visualising Ren-1d Gene Expression in Transgenic Mice by using in Vivo Modified Genomic Clones . University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK1999Google Scholar). The resulting suicide plasmid was electroporated into DH10B E. coli cells (10 ng of plasmid into 40 μl of electrocompetent cells; BIORAD electroporator: 2.5 volts, 25 μF, 250 Ω; Ref. 29Sheng Y. Mancino V. Birren B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) containing BACN10 and grown at 30 °C under tetracycline (12.5 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) selection. Resistant bacteria were then incubated at 43 °C, and five BAC-specific co-integrants were identified, following alkaline lysis, by restriction digestion withEcoRI or PvuII and Southern blot hybridization with probes specific to exon 1 or exon 9, respectively. These co-integrants were grown on chloramphenicol plates containing 12 μg/ml fusaric acid, and a similar screening strategy was applied, using an additional probe internal to the reporter sequences. All restriction enzymes and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from Roche (Lewes, UK) and were used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The BACs (wild type or modified) were linearized at the unique loxP site and purified by preparative pulse field gel electrophoresis, β-agarase treatment (New England Biolabs), and dialysis against injection buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm EDTA with 100 mm NaCl) (23Mullins L.J. Kotelevtseva N. Boyd A.C. Mullins J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2539-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). DNA at 1 μg/ml was microinjected using standard techniques. Transgene-positive animals were identified by PvuII digestion of tail DNA, which was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using a renin cDNA probe. BACN10 gave aRen-1 d-specific fragment of 10.6 kb and aRen-2-specific fragment of 7.9 kb in addition to theRen-1 c fragments at 7.5 and 2 kb (see Fig. 1 b, lane 1). N10β-Geo transgene-positive animals yielded a triplet with the targetedRen-1 d fragment at 8.6 kb, the wild typeRen-2 fragment at 7.9 kb, and theRen-1 c fragment at 7.5 kb, as well as a β-geo-specific fragment of 6 kb (see Fig. 1 b,lane 6). In BACN10/Ren-1 d-null crosses, the loss of the smaller 2-kb CBA-specific fragment and the gain of theRen-1 d 10.6-kb fragment was followed for genotyping, whereas for the modified BAC, the loss of the CBA-specific fragment and the addition of the 6-kb β-Geo-specific fragment were utilized. Copy number was determined by comparison of signal intensity with that of the endogenous 2-kb CBA-specificRen-1 c fragment. Renin transcription was followed by Northern blot hybridization and was quantified by slot blot and phosphorimage analysis using total RNA (loading was controlled by hybridization with a U1 probe). Captopril was administered to male animals in their drinking water, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 10 days prior to sacrifice. All tissues were frozen directly on dry ice prior to RNA extraction and analysis. To distinguish between the transgene-derived and endogenous transcripts, a 156-bp RT-PCR product was generated using primers JJM 336 (AGGAGCGGGGAGTGGACATG), and JJM135 (AAGGTCTGGGGTGGGGTACC), which flank the exon 2-exon 3 junction and bind with equal affinity to each transcript. The products generated fromRen-1 d, Ren-1 c, andRen-2 are differentially digested using the restriction enzyme Sau3A. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was annealed with primer JJM135 at 65 °C for 10 min and was then cooled rapidly on ice. Reverse transcriptase (AMV; Promega) was added in the presence of 1× RT buffer, 10 mm deoxynucleotides, and RNAsin, and the reaction was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, 10 min at 37 °C, 50 min at 42 °C, and 2 min at 94 °C and was then transferred to ice. Following adjustment of the buffer (with PCR primers, fresh deoxynucleotides, and MgCl2) the PCR step was initiated (PCR conditions: 94 °C for 2 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 61 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s; and 1 cycle 68 °C for 7 min). Products were purified using the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) restriction digested with Sau3A according to manufacturers instructions and separated on a 12% nondenaturing acrylamide gel, stained by SYBR green I (Molecular Probes), and electroblotted onto positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following hybridization, using an exon 3-specific oligonucleotide (ACTGGGTATTCAGGTAGTTGGTGAGGACCACGGGGGAGGTAAGA), and phosphorimage analysis, the following products were detected: a 156-bp product from Ren-1 c (together with any undigested transgene-derived product), an 86-bp product fromRen-1 d, and a major 56-bp product (plus minor bands of 130 and 82 bp depending on completion of digestion) fromRen-2 (see Fig. 3 b). Timed matings were set up (with E0.5 taken as the day of plug formation) and kidneys were removed from E14.5-day-old pups through to adult. One kidney was immersion fixed in 10% formalin or 4% paraformaldehyde for subsequent embedding in paraffin wax and preparation of 2–4 μmsections, which were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by standard light microscopy. Immunocytochemistry on sequential sections was undertaken using anti-renin antibody (gift from Prof. Inagami; 1:10,000 dilution) and anti β-galactosidase antibody (ICN Biologicals; 1:600 dilution), respectively, which were visualized by streptavidin-biotin/peroxidase and developed by diamino-benzidine precipitation. To estimate the proportion of glomeruli with associated renin-positive JGA, which were also positive for β-galactosidase (andvisa versa), 50 glomeruli were counted in each of three sections from each of two animals. The second kidney was immersed in gluteraldehyde fixative (0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.2% gluteraldehyde, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mmMgCl2) for 1 h at room temperature (overnight for adult kidneys), followed by three 20-min washes (0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 2 mmMgCl2, 0.01% (v/v) deoxycholate, and 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and staining in X-gal solution (1 mg/ml in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 0.4 mK4Fe(CN)6·3H2O) for 48 h at room temperature. The staining was stopped by rinsing the kidneys three times for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (v/v) Me2SO. Finally the whole mount kidneys were rinsed three times in 70% ethanol and stored at 4 °C, prior to sectioning sagitally, and were then viewed and photographed under a dissecting microscope (Fig. 4 a). β-Galactosidase staining was performed at pH 8.5 to minimize background staining in the kidney from endogenous β-galactosidase-like activity (30Alam J.M. Cory S. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Samples were immersion fixed in 4% gluteraldehyde in cacadylate buffer at 4 °C. Tissues were processed and embedded in araldite blocks, and semi-thin sections were cut and stained in toluidine blue for orientation of specimen. Ultrathin sections were cut, mounted on copper grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Grids were viewed on a Phillips CM12 transmission electron microscope. A breeding strategy was designed to introduce one copy of the BAC transgene (wild type or modified) onto theRen-1 d knockout background. Briefly, an animal homozygous for the BAC (on a Ren-1 c background) was crossed to an animal homozygous for Ren-1 dknockout. The F1 animals were backcrossed to homozygousRen-1 d knockout animals, and 25% of the progeny were classed as hemizygous for BAC and homozygous forRen-1 d-null. The clone BACN10 contained both Ren-1 d andRen-2, located centrally, with approximately 45 kb of flanking sequences upstream and downstream of the structural genes (for restriction map see Fig. 1 a). BACN10 was screened for simple sequence repeats, previously found to map at or near the renin locus (24Dietrich W.F. Millar J.C. Steen R.G. Merchant M. Damron D. Nahf R. Gross A. Joyce D.C. Wessel M. Dredge R.D. Marquis A. Stein L.D. Goodman N. Page D.C. Lander E.S. Nat. Genet. 1996; 7: 220-225Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar), to ascertain whether or not the clone was chimeric. Sequences homologous to the map pairsD1Mit30 and D1Mit287 were identified, the former mapping 3–4 kb downstream of both Ren-1 d andRen2, and the latter mapping within an 11-kb XhoI fragment upstream of Ren-2. The recombination cassette, designed to specifically replace exons 3 and 4 of Ren-1 dwith the IRESβ-Geo (26Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) reporter sequences, included homology arms identical to those used to generate theRen-1 d knockout mice (10Clark A.F. Sharp M.G.F. Morley S.D. Fleming S. Peters J. Mullins J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18185-18190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a splice acceptor to ensure that splicing did not occur around exons 3 and 4, and a nuclear localization signal to direct β-galactosidase activity to the nucleus (Fig. 2). By using a suicide plasmid to introduce both the recombination cassette and RecA into the BAC host strain, DH10B, exposure of the BAC to RecA was minimized, thus lowering the risk of recombination within the BAC. Co-integrants incorporating the suicide plasmid, generated by switching to the nonpermissive temperature (43 °C), were screened by Southern blot hybridization using appropriate restriction enzymes and probes located outside the arms of homology (Fig. 2 a), to determine whether integration had occurred by homologous recombination or random integration. To remove the suicide vector and duplicated renin sequences, co-integrants were selected on chloramphenicol plates containing fusaric acid, and a single clone was found to have correctly integrated the reporter gene within Ren-1 d. The modified BAC, N10β-Geo, was analyzed to confirm accurate recombination by utilizing rare-cutting restriction enzyme sites, which were either included within the β-Geo construct or distinguished between Ren-1 d andRen-2 (Fig. 1 and 2 d). Comparison of BACN10 and N10β-Geo confirmed the predicted changes toRen-1 d, whereas Ren-2 remained unaltered, indicating the specificity of the BAC modification. Both BACN10 and the modified clone N10β-Geo were prepared for microinjection using Cre-lox linearization (23Mullins L.J. Kotelevtseva N. Boyd A.C. Mullins J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2539-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and used to generate transgenic mice by pronuclear microinjection of fertilized C57Bl/6 × CBA/Ca F2 oocytes. Three lines, two carrying one copy and one carrying three copies of BACN10, were characterized in detail and Northern blot hybridization indicated renin expression in an appropriate range of tissues in all lines. RT-PCR confirmed thatRen-2 was the major renin transcript in the transgenic submandibular gland, a key indicator tissue for expression of the murine Renlocus. 3L. J. Mullins, manuscript in preparation.. Kidney renin expression was not significantly different between transgenic and nontransgenic littermates, irrespective of transgene copy number (Fig. 3 a). RT-PCR, however, clearly demonstrated the expression ofRen-1 d and Ren-2 (at levels analogous to those of the 129/Ola kidney) in addition to the endogenousRen-1 c gene (Fig. 3), indicating that all three genes are subject to physiological feedback control. Treatment of transgenic and nontransgenic males with captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme, increased kidney renin expression between 4- and 8-fold, all three genes being derepressed (Fig. 3 a,c). N10β-Geo was independently introduced into the mouse germline, and three founder transgenic animals were identified that had integrated either one (TGM(N10β-geo)1) or two (TGM(N10β-geo)2) complete copies of the modified BAC. To establish the developmental profile of β-galactosidase expression and to ascertain whether it was correctly restricted to the JG cells in adults, progeny were analyzed at the time points noted (Fig. 4 a). The blue staining observed in progeny of the line TGM(N10β-geo)2 at E16.5 extended into the kidney from the renal artery, in progenitors of the interlobar arteries. By E17.5 staining branched into the developing arcuate artery, and by E18.5 staining was only observed in the arcuate and interlobular arteries. At 1 week of age (P7), expression in the large proximal arteries had ceased, with staining restricted to the afferent arterioles, and by P14 distinct foci of blue staining were observed, indicating that β-galactosidase expression had become restricted to a small subset of cells within the kidney (not shown). This staining pattern is consistent with the published developmental profile for renin (11McGowan R. Renin Expression in Mice Tissues. Ph.D. Thesis. SUNY, Buffalo1987Google Scholar, 12Gomez R.A. Lynch K.R. Sturgill B.C. Elwood J.P. Chevalier R.L. Carey R.M. Peach M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F850-F858PubMed Google Scholar). Weaker staining was observed in equivalent samples taken from TGM(N10β-geo)1 (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry using both renin and β-galactosidase antibodies, performed on sequential sections of adult kidney, indicated that β-galactosidase expression co-localized with renin (Fig. 4 b), β-galactosidase showing nuclear localization and renin being detected in the cytoplasmic granules of JG cells. (Comparison of adjacent sections showed that 78.3% of glomeruli associated with renin positive JGA were also positive for β-galactosidase, whereas 85.7% of β-galactosidase positive JGA were positive for renin.) These results confirm that modification of the Ren-1 d gene did not compromise the developmental restriction of expression. To test whether or not the phenotypic changes observed in Ren-1 d-null mice were due to the absence of the renin-1 protein, appropriate breeding strategies were devised to introduce either the wild type or modified BAC (using TGM(BACN10)1or TGM(N10β-Geo)1 respectively) onto theRen-1 d knockout background. Briefly, females homozygous for each BAC (on a Ren-1 c background; Fig. 1 c, lanes 1 and 4, respectively) were crossed to animals homozygous for theRen-1 d knockout on a 129/Ola background (Fig. 1 b, lanes 2 and 5). The F1 progeny, which were obligate heterozygotes forRen-1 c and Ren-1 d-null and hemizygous for the corresponding BAC, were backcrossed to homozygous Ren-1 d knockout animals, and the F2 progeny were screened by PvuII restriction digestion and Southern blot hybridization with a Ren-2 cDNA probe (Fig. 1). 25% of the progeny were classed as hemizygous for the BAC and homozygous for Ren-1 d-null (Fig. 5 a, class d). These were compared with Ren-1 d knockout littermates lacking the respective BACs. Histological analysis demonstrated hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the macula densa in homozygote knockout animals and littermates containing the modified BAC (Fig. 5 b, panels 6 and7, respectively). In the presence of wild type BACN10, however, the macula densa were indistinguishable from control 129/Ola samples (Fig. 5 b, panels 8 and 5), being less columnar in shape. Electron microscopy showed that 100% of JG cells in transgenic mice harboring BACN10 exhibited a clear granulated morphology (Fig. 5 b, panel 4) with granules of different size visible throughout the cytoplasm. By contrast, no granules were observed in renal sections from knockout animals carrying N10β-Geo, indicating that the modified BAC, which is incapable of directing renin-1 synthesis, does not rescue the JG cell phenotype observed in the Ren-1 d-null mice (Fig. 5 b,panels 2 and 3). The presence of an activeRen-1 gene is therefore both essential and sufficient for the normal morphology of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. The isolation of a BAC clone spanning the renin locus, in conjunction with the successful application of BAC modification techniques, has provided valuable tools with which to investigate renin gene regulation and the minimum genetic requirements for normal JG and macula densa cell morphology. Kidney renin gene expression is under tight physiological feedback control, which can be derepressed by pharmacological treatment such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (e.g. the administration of captopril). Low level expression of both BAC-specific renin genes (Ren-1 d and Ren-2) in addition to the endogenous Ren-1 c gene, could be demonstrated by analytical RT-PCR in untreated animals, suggesting that all three renin genes were under tight physiological feedback control. Following captopril administration, expression of each renin gene was derepressed. A 45-kb human renin transgene including 25 kb of upstream sequences was reported to exhibit appropriate regulation of expression and secretion in transgenic mice (31Yan Y. Hu L. Chen R. Sealey J.E. Laragh J.H. Catanzaro D.F. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas more recently, 140- and 160-kb human renin PAC transgenes (containing 35 and 75 kb of upstream sequences, respectively) were expressed in the kidney at levels equivalent to the endogenous mouse renin gene and were up-regulated by captopril administration (32Sinn P.L. Davis D.R. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35785-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The introduction of β-Geo into theRen-1 d coding region located within BACN10 was accomplished using the BAC targeting strategy (20Yang X.W. Model P. Heintz N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). BAC modification proved to be highly specific, albeit rare, because modification was limited entirely to Ren-1 d even in the presence of the highly homologous Ren-2 sequences (97% at the DNA level). A similar experiment using a P1 clone (P1–1251, which only contains Ren-1 d), produced a significantly higher number of correctly targeted clones (27Payne C.M. Mullins L.J. Mullins J.J. J. Human Hypertens. 1999; 13: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 28Payne C.M. Visualising Ren-1d Gene Expression in Transgenic Mice by using in Vivo Modified Genomic Clones . University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK1999Google Scholar). A comparison of the two recombination experiments indicated a decreased recombination efficiency for the BAC clone, which may reflect plasmid size (100-kb P1 clone, compared with the 145-kb BAC) or sequence-specific effects. Previous transgenic lines generated to direct reporter gene expression to the JG cells either failed to express the gene in the adult or displayed aberrant expression throughout the renal vasculature (8Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the present study, reporter expression from N10β-Geo did not compromise normal developmental restriction to the JG cells during kidney maturation, and immunohistochemistry confirmed that β-galactosidase expression coincided with renin expression in adult kidneys. In many transgenic studies β-galactosidase is silenced in adult tissues (33Cui C. Wani M.A. Wight D. Kopchick J. Stambrook P.J. Transgen. Res. 1994; 3: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Thorey I.S. Meneses J.J. Neznanov N. Kulesh D.A. Pederson R.A. Oshima R.G. Dev. Biol. 1993; 160: 519-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Clearly sequences present within the BAC clone are “immune” to any aberrant developmental repression ofLacZ within the kidney, making these animals a potentially useful source for FACs sorted “renin”-expressing cells at any time during development. Introduction of the modified and wild type BAC transgenes onto theRen-1 d-null background has confirmed that the presence of renin-1 is essential for granule formation and that the knockout renal phenotype is not due to an unrelated mutation introduced during gene targeting. Importantly, renin-1 appears to be essential for development of storage granules in the JG cell but is not essential for the development of these cells, because reporter expression in theabsence of renin-1 indicates that the agranular cells have not dedifferentiated and are still bona fide JG cells. Recently, a Ren-1 c-null mouse was generated (35Yanai K. Saito T. Kakinuma Y. Kon Y. Hirota K. Taniguchi-Yanai K. Nishijo N. Shigematsu Y. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and similar changes in kidney morphology to theRen-1 d knockout model were reported, consistent with our interpretation that expression of renin-1 is not causal in the differentiation of JG cells. During chronic hypotension the smooth muscle cells neighboring JG cells can be recruited and modified to a renin expressing phenotype by a process termed metaplastic differentiation (36Taugner R. Hackenthal E. The Juxtaglomerular Apparatus. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1989: 215-220Crossref Google Scholar). The genetic cues required for metaplastic differentiation remain unknown, but the BAC transgenics may prove useful in addressing the mechanisms behind metaplastic differentiation of smooth muscle cells and also the contribution of the macula densa to the tubuloglomerular feedback loop. Renin-1 expression is necessary for normal macula densa morphology because only the wild type BACN10 was able to prevent hyperplasia and hypertrophy on the Ren-1 d knockout background. Because renin is not expressed in macula densa cells, and there is no immunohistochemical evidence to suggest uptake of renin from the circulation, the effect of renin-1 on macula densa morphology may be mediated either by a direct signal from the JG cells or in response to altered cues from tubular fluid. One of the primary biochemical differences between renin-1 and renin-2 is the lack of three potential N-linked glycosylation sites that are located in both renin-1c and renin-1d but not renin-2. Importantly, both the single rat and human renin genes also encode two of the three potential glycosylation sites. Because the presence of renin-1 is essential for granule formation, it is possible that renin glycosylation may be the signal for renin trafficking to dense granules in the JG cell, where it is stored until required. Using BAC modification to introduce subtle changes into the renin genes, we can now ascertain which epitopes within the protein are determinants of its maturation, transport, and physiological action in vivo. The general applicability of combining knockout, BAC modification, and complementation to dissect important physiological systems will add to the increasing arsenal of functional genomic approaches (37Antoch M.P.

GnRH neurons originate in the olfactory region and migrate into the forebrain during development. We recently implicated adhesion related kinase (Ark) in GnRH neuron development based on its differential expression in two GnRH producing cell lines, GT1-7 and Gn10. The Ark membrane receptor encodes an extracellular domain resembling cell adhesion molecules and an intracellular tyrosine kinase. Ark is expressed in Gn10 cells derived from migrating GnRH neurons but not GT1-7 cells of the post-migratory phenotype. Here, we show that Ark and GnRH transcripts are colocalized in the cribriform plate at midgestation, suggesting that Ark is expressed in migrating GnRH neurons in vivo. Furthermore, we have identified the GnRH gene as a downstream target of Ark signaling. Ark inhibits GnRH gene expression in GnRH neuronal cells via the coordinated binding of myocyte enhancer factor-2B and -2C (MEF-2B and -2C) and a putative homeoprotein within the proximal rat GnRH promoter. Given that MEF-2 proteins are widely expressed in the brain, these studies provide further evidence for MEF-2 action during neuronal development. Moreover, our studies elucidate a potential role for Ark in regulating GnRH gene expression during GnRH neuronal migration.

Subsequently, the Ark cDNA was cloned based on homology to the bek fibroblast growth factor receptor (14Rescigno J. Mansukhani A. Basilico C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1909-1913PubMed Google Scholar). Ark/Axl belongs to a novel subclass of receptor tyrosine kinases that includes Tyro3 and Mer (15Crosier K.E. Crosier P.S.

The murine Gas6 is a member of the vitamin K-dependent protein family and has 44% amino acid identity with human protein S, a negative regulator of blood coagulation. Like protein S, the carboxyl terminus of Gas6 shows similarity to steroid binding globulin; however, Gas6 does not contain the thrombin cleavage site present in protein S required for negative feedback in the blood coagulation cascade (27Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Although related to protein S, Gas6 does not play a role in coagulation but rather activates anti-apoptotic and mitogenic pathways in various cell types (28Bellosta P. Zhang Q. Goff S.P. Basilico C.

Similarly, preliminary studies in our laboratory suggest that Gas6-Ark signaling potentiates Gn10 neuronal migration (38Allen M.P. Swartz C.D. Tobet S.A. Varnum B. Wierman M.E. Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 2000; 26: 1352Google Scholar). This diversity in Ark function argues that members of this receptor family may have multiple functions in vivo that may vary depending on the cell type. Indeed, mice harboring null mutations in Axl family receptors were recently generated (39Lu Q. Gore M. Zhang Q. Camenisch T. Boast S. Casagranda F. Lai C. Skinner M.K. Klein R. Matsushima G.K.

In this report, we identified the GnRH promoter as a nuclear target of Ark signaling in GT1-7 GnRH neuronal cells. Our studies delineate a novel pathway whereby Ark negatively regulates GnRH gene expression via myocyte enhancer factors-2B and 2C (MEF-2B and -2C) in concert with a putative homeoprotein. The MEF-2 family of MADS (MCM1, agamous, deficiens, serum response factor)-box transcription factors play critical roles in the development and differentiation of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle (41Black B.L.

Herein, we have identified the GnRH promoter as a downstream target of the tyrosine kinase receptor, Ark. The Ark signaling cascade converges on MEF-2B and -2C and a putative homeoprotein that in turn inhibit neuronal GnRH gene expression, thus implicating GnRH as the first physiologically relevant promoter negatively regulated by MEF-2 transcription factors.

Total RNA from GT1-7, Gn10 cells, and E13 mouse brain regions was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). Five micrograms of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.4% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose. Antisense RNA probes for Ark and GnRH were synthesized using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled nucleotides (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The Ark probe contained the antisense sequence spanning nucleotides 401–819 of the Ark cDNA, and the GnRH probe encoded the mouse antisense GnRH sequence. The probes were hybridized at 68 °C for 16 h in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, and 0.2% SDS (probe concentrations, Ark, 0.4 μg/ml; GnRH, 0.1 μg/ml). The filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature and twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 15 min. To visualize bound probe, a Roche Molecular Biochemicals DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit was used. Briefly, filters were washed in 0.1m maleic acid, 0.3% Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5, and blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer (0.1 mmaleic acid, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The filters were incubated in anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:5000) diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min and washed twice in 0.1 m maleic acid, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min. Bound antibody was detected using an enzyme catalyzed color reaction with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium salt. GT1-7 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of the luciferase construct (rGnRH-LUC, hGnRH-LUC, ERE-TK-LUC, α−subunit-LUC, MMTV-LUC, TRE-TK-LUC (-333/-16GnRH)RSV180-LUC, or RSV180-LUC), 5 μg of pRK5-Ark, and 0.5 μg of RSVβgal to control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of plasmid was maintained constant at 20 μg with the inclusion of empty vector, pRK5. Cells were harvested 16–18 h post-transfection, and the lysate was assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (62Kepa J.K. Wang C. Neeley C.I. Raynolds M.V. Gordon D.F. Wood W.M. Wierman M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1393-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For the dominant negative MEF-2C studies, 5 μg of pcDNA1-MEF2C-S387A was used. GT1-7 and Gn10 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and lysed in 0.1 ml of cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma). Following addition of lysis buffer, the cells were sonicated for 10 pulses using a Branson sonifier 250 (Branson Sonic Power Co.; settings, duty cycle 30 and output control 3). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Inc., Rockford, IL). Twenty micrograms of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5–12% gels and transferred to Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation, 1.5 mg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with 4G10 antibody. The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk/TBS-T buffer (137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated for 1 h in primary antibody and washed three times in TBS-T for 15 min. The membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody for 30–60 min, washed three times in TBS-T for 15 min, and incubated in enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunodetection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The double-stranded GnRH oligomers used in the EMSA studies are described in Table I and were synthesized as complimentary pairs (Life Technologies, Inc.). Double stranded oligomers were end-labeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 3000 Ci/mmol) to a specific activity of 10,000–30,000 cpm/ng. The labeled oligomers were purified using a Sephadex G-25 spin column (5-Prime → 3-Prime, Boulder, CO). GT1-7 and Gn10 nuclear extracts were prepared as described (68Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). For EMSAs, nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10–20 ng/μl poly(dG-dC), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, and 50–100,000 cpm of oligomer in a total volume of 20 μl. For competition experiments, the unlabeled DNA competitors were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 20 min at 4 °C followed by another 20-min incubation in the presence of labeled oligomers. Subsequently, the reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 3% glycerol and 0.25 × TBE (1 × TBE, 90 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). The gels were run at 4 °C for 4 h at 250 V. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to film at −70 °C for 16–24 h.

https://openalex.org/W2067768430,"The transcription factor serum amyloid A (SAA)-activating factor (SAF), a family of zinc finger proteins, plays a significant role in the induced expression of the SAA gene. Activity of SAF is regulated by a phosphorylation event involving serine/threonine protein kinase (Ray, A., Schatten, H., and Ray, B. K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 4300-4308; Ray, A., and Ray, B. K. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol. 18, 7327-7335). However, the identity of the protein kinase has so far remained unknown. Induction of SAA by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a known agonist of protein kinase C (PKC), suggested a potential role of the PKC signaling pathway in the activation process. The DNA binding activity of endogenous SAF was increased by agonists of PKC. In vitro phosphorylation of SAF-1 by PKC-beta markedly increased its DNA binding ability. Consistent with these findings, treatment of cells with activators of PKC or overexpression of PKC-betaII in transfected cells increased expression of an SAF-regulated promoter. Further analysis with a GAL4 reporter system indicated that PKC-mediated phosphorylation mostly increases the DNA binding activity of SAF-1. Together these data indicated that the PKC signaling pathway plays a major role in controlling expression of SAF-regulated genes by increasing the interaction between promoter DNA and phosphorylated SAF."
https://openalex.org/W2042133959,"Capacitance measurements were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which imidazoline compounds inhibit glucagon release in rat pancreatic α-cells. The imidazoline compound phentolamine reversibly decreased depolarization-evoked exocytosis >80% without affecting the whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. During intracellular application through the recording pipette, phentolamine produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the rate of exocytosis (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.7 μm). Another imidazoline compound, RX871024, exhibited similar effects on exocytosis (IC<sub>50</sub> = 13 μm). These actions were dependent on activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G<sub>i2</sub>proteins but were not associated with stimulation of ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels or adenylate cyclase activity. The inhibitory effect of phentolamine on exocytosis resulted from activation of the protein phosphatase calcineurin and was abolished by cyclosporin A and deltamethrin. Exocytosis was not affected by intracellular application of specific α<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>1</sub>, and I<sub>2</sub>ligands. Phentolamine reduced glucagon release (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.2 μm) from intact islets by 40%, an effect abolished by pertussis toxin, cyclosporin A, and deltamethrin. These data suggest that imidazoline compounds inhibit glucagon secretion via G<sub>i2</sub>-dependent activation of calcineurin in the pancreatic α-cell. The imidazoline binding site is likely to be localized intracellularly and probably closely associated with the secretory granules."
https://openalex.org/W2061178067,"To explore the role of highly conserved tyrosine residues in the putative cytoplasmic domains of the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled opioid receptors, we expressed the rat κ-opioid receptor (KOR) in Xenopus oocytes and then activated the intrinsic insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. KOR activation by the agonist U69593 produced a strong increase in potassium current through coexpressed G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (KIR3). Brief pretreatment with insulin caused a 60% potentiation of the KOR-activated response. The insulin-induced increase in κ-opioid response was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. In contrast, insulin had no effect on the basal activity of KIR3, suggesting that KOR is the target of the tyrosine kinase cascade. Mutation of tyrosine residues to phenylalanines in either the first or second intracellular loop of KOR to produce KOR(Y87F) and KOR(Y157F) had no effect on either the potency or maximal effect of U69593. However, neither KOR(Y87F)- nor KOR(Y157F)-mediated responses were potentiated by insulin treatment. Insulin pretreatment shifted the dose-response curve for U69593activation of KOR by increasing the maximal response without changing the EC50 value for U69593. These results suggest that insulin increases the efficacy of KOR activation by phosphorylating two tyrosine residues in the first and second intracellular loops of the receptor. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation may provide an important mechanism for modulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling.

Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation may provide an important mechanism for modulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel κ-opioid receptor Brain-derived neurotrophic factor Opioid receptors are widely expressed throughout the nervous system, and opioid drugs affect pain perception, learning and memory, epilepsy, and food intake, among other diverse functions (1Olson G.A. Olson R.D. Vaccarino A.L. Kastin A.J. Peptides. 1998; 19: 1791-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A common mechanism for post-translational regulation of protein function is by phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of opioid receptors is likely to regulate opioid actions. For example, phosphorylation by G protein receptor kinases following agonist treatment has been proposed to play a role in opioid receptor desensitization and tolerance (2Law P. Wong Y. Loh H.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Other serine/threonine kinases such as protein kinase C and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II in some systems may also regulate opioid receptors (3Koch T. Kroslak T. Mayer P. Raulf E. Hollt V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1767-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To date, few studies have reported any effects of tyrosine kinases on acute opioid receptor function. Tyrosine residues in the putative cytoplasmic domains of G protein-coupled receptors are extremely common, and regulation of opioid receptor signaling by tyrosine kinase cascades would provide a powerful mechanism of cellular coordination. Indeed, a portion of the agonist-induced internalization of the μ-opioid receptor is dependent on tyrosine kinase activation (4Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. Wang J.B. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27610-27616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Polakiewicz R.D. Schieferl S.M. Dorner L.F. Kansra V. Comb M.J. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Opioid receptor activation has been shown to increase tyrosine kinase activity (7Fukuda K. Kato S. Morikawa H. Shoda T. Mori K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 8Belcheva M.M. Vogel Z. Ignatova E. Avidor-Reiss T. Zippel R. Levy R. Young E.C. Barg J. Coscia C.J. J Neurochem. 1998; 70: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the agonist-induced internalization mediated by tyrosine kinase could potentially involve a process that is directly activated by opioid receptors. These findings are consistent with data on the β2-adrenergic receptor in which tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail was shown to play a role in the desensitization and internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (9Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In addition to the inhibitory effects of tyrosine kinases on G protein-coupled receptor function, Valiquette et al.(10Valiquette M. Parent S. Loisel T.P. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5542-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor on the second intracellular loop potentiated β2-adrenergic receptor activation of adenylate cyclases. Although the interactions are not yet clear, these initial studies suggest that tyrosine kinase cascades may regulate G protein-coupled receptors to produce either increases or decreases in functioning. To explore these mechanisms further, we examined the effect of tyrosine kinase activation on κ-opioid receptor coupling to the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (KIR3).1 To do this, we utilized the Xenopus oocyte expression system and took advantage of the endogenously expressed insulin receptor tyrosine kinase cascade (11Grigorescu F. Baccara M.T. Rouard M. Renard E. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). U69593 ((+)-(5α,7α,8β)-N-methyl-N-[7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro(4,5)dec-8-yl]benzeneacetamide) was obtained from Research Biochemicals International. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The rat κ-opioid receptor (KOR) was obtained from Dr. David Grandy (GenBankTM/EBI accession number D16829). cDNAs for KIR3.1 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number U01071) and KIR3.2 (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberU11859) were obtained from Drs. Cesar Lebarca and Henry Lester, respectively. Dr. John Adelman provided KIR3.4 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number X83584). KIR3.2(S146T) was made as described previously (12Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Bio;. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Point mutations were made in wild-type KOR to produce KOR(Y87F) and KOR(Y157F). Mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with complementary oligonucleotide primers incorporating the desired mutation. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid templates for all constructs including KOR mutants were linearized prior to cRNA synthesis, and the mMESSAGE MACHINE kit (Ambion Inc.) was used to generate capped cRNA. Defolliculated stage IV oocytes were prepared as described (13Leonard J.P. Snutch T.P. Chad J. Wheal H. Molecular Neurobiology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 161-182Google Scholar) and incubated for 2–3 days after injection of the cRNAs in normal oocyte saline buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with sodium pyruvate (2.5 mm) and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). cRNAs were injected (50 nl/oocyte) with a Drummond microinjector. Each oocyte was injected with 1 ng of KOR cRNA and either 0.1 ng of KIR3.1 and KIR3.2 wild-type potassium channel or 1 ng of KIR3.2(S146T) pore mutant channel cRNA. A few sets of oocytes were injected with KIR3.4 cRNA instead of KIR3.2 as controls for direct effects of insulin-activated cascades on the channel. Oocytes were voltage-clamped at −80 mV with two electrodes filled with 3 m KCl having resistances of 0.3–3.0 megaohms using an Axoclamp 2A unit and pCLAMP Version 6 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Membrane current traces were recorded using a chart recorder. To facilitate the recording of inward K+ currents through the KIR3 channels, the normal oocyte saline buffer was modified to increase the KCl concentration to 96 mm K+. The concentration of NaCl was correspondingly decreased to maintain osmolarity. EC50 values and curve fitting were determined using Nfit software (Island Products, Galveston, TX). Confidence intervals were used for comparison of the independent means. Student's t test was used for comparison of independent means, with values reported as two-tailed p values. Rat KOR was coexpressed in Xenopusoocytes with KIR3.1 and KIR3.2 (Fig. 1). When the concentration of potassium was increased in the extracellular recording solution, the basal current through the inwardly rectifying potassium channel was readily detected. Activation of KOR by the κ-opioid-selective agonist U69593caused an increase in the potassium current, as has been shown previously (14Henry D.J. Grandy D.K. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar, 15Appleyard S.M. Celver J. Pineda V. Kovoor A. Wayman G.A. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23802-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Brief (12–15 min) pretreatment of the oocytes with 8 μm insulin activated the endogenously expressed insulin receptor and potentiated the response produced by the κ-agonist. In contrast, insulin pretreatment had a small and variable inhibitory effect on the basal KIR3 current (Fig. 2).Figure 1Insulin potentiates KOR activation of KIR3 channels. Oocytes were injected with 1 ng of rat KOR and 0.1 ng each of KIR3.1 and KIR3.2. Representative traces are shown from an untreated oocyte and an oocyte treated with 8 μm insulin for 12–15 min. This concentration of insulin was found to produce a maximal effect (data not shown). The oocyte membrane potential was clamped at −80 mV while bathed in normal saline buffer containing 2 mm KCl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oocytes were then superfused with a saline buffer in which the KCl concentration was increased to 96 mm. This does not activate the channel, but allows the basal inward current to flow through the inwardly rectifying potassium channels at the −80-mV holding potential (IBasal). After equilibration with the high K+ buffer (hK), application of the κ-opioid receptor agonist U69593 (500 nm) increased the inward current (IU69593). The increase in inward current through KIR3 channels caused by agonist activation of KOR was defined by the difference evident after addition of naloxone, an effective κ-receptor antagonist. Oocytes injected with KIR3 alone did not respond to U69593, and oocytes injected with KOR alone did not show an increase in potassium current (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2Insulin pretreatment produces potentiation of the evoked current response generated by the stimulation of the κ-opioid receptor. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for the κ-opioid receptor (κOR) and the KIR3.1/KIR3.2 channel (A) or KIR3.2(S146T) (B), a variant of KIR3.2 that more readily forms homotetrameric channels. Data were collected from untreated control oocytes (open bars) or oocytes pretreated with 8 μm insulin for 12–15 min prior to recording (closed bars). The HK bars represent the channel response to addition of high potassium buffer, a response that was not significantly changed by pretreatment with insulin. The response evoked following stimulation of the κ-opioid receptor with 500 nmU69593 (a maximally effective concentration) is shown on the left. Insulin pretreatment caused a significant potentiation of the U69593-induced response with both types of channel (*, p < 0.05 compared with untreated oocytes). The data represent summarized recordings taken from 18–22 oocytes for each bar. Differences were determined through comparison of control and insulin-pretreated conditions by Student'st test. Identical results were obtained using oocytes expressing KIR3.4 in place of KIR3.2 (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The lack of a robust effect of insulin on the basal current carried by the KIR3.1/KIR3.2 heteromultimer was different from the strong inhibitory actions of other tyrosine kinase cascades on potassium channel conductance. Activation of the endogenously expressed insulin receptor had previously been shown to inhibit the basal activity of a different inwardly rectifying potassium channel (KIR2.1) expressed in oocytes (16Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Karschin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34063-34068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rogalskiet al. (12Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Bio;. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB by BDNF inhibited KIR3.1. To distinguish possible effects on the channel from those on the receptor, we tested the effects of insulin pretreatment on three different forms of the channel: KIR3.1 with KIR3.2, KIR3.1 with KIR3.4, and KIR3.2(S146T) alone. The latter is a mutant form of KIR3.2 that allows the 3.2 subunit to function as a homomultimer (17Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Vivaudou M. Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Jan L.Y. Reuveny E. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31553-31560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and KIR3.2(S146T) is insensitive to the effects of BDNF-activated tyrosine kinase cascades (12Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Bio;. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). If insulin-activated tyrosine kinase cascades affected the KIR3 channel in a manner similar to the BDNF-activated TrkB cascade, the insulin-induced effect would depend on the channel subunit composition. Insulin pretreatment had no significant effect on the basal channel conductance of any of the three KIR3 combinations (Fig. 2). Insulin pretreatment consistently potentiated the effects of KOR activation of each of the three forms of the KIR3 channel (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the potentiation of U69593 actions is not mediated by a direct effect on the KIR3 channel. The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is known to activate a cascade of downstream effectors, including both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (19Nystrom F.H. Quon M.J. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of insulin were through a tyrosine kinase, we used the nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (20Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which genistein inhibits insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity is unclear (21Abler A. Smith J.A. Randazzo P.A. Rothenberg P.L. Jarett L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3946-3951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this inhibitor is a commonly used to block insulin effects (22Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J.

Insulin potentiated the U69593-activated potassium current to 146 ± 12% (n = 12) compared with controls not pretreated with insulin. In contrast, for oocytes pretreated for 25–30 min with 100 μm genistein, insulin had no significant effect on the KOR response (p > 0.05); the response to U69593 after genistein/insulin treatment was 105 ± 12% (n = 11 oocytes) compared with matched controls not pretreated with genistein/insulin. The results suggest that insulin potentiates the opioid-activated response through tyrosine kinase activation. As the potentiating effects of insulin required activation of tyrosine kinases, we mutated specific tyrosine residues in KOR to determine whether this would attenuate the insulin effect. We substituted phenylalanine for tyrosine at two sites within the KOR sequence, KOR(Y87F) and KOR(Y157F) (Fig. 3 A), as a tyrosine residue in the second intracellular loop was previously shown to be responsible for the effects of insulin on the β2-adrenergic receptor (9Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 10Valiquette M. Parent S. Loisel T.P. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5542-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). U69593 dose-response analysis showed that the EC50values for activation of wild-type and mutant KORs were not significantly different (Fig. 3 B). The EC50values (with 95% confidence intervals) were as follows: wild-type KOR, 160 () nm; KOR(Y87F), 138 () nm; and KOR(Y157F), 76 (48–119) nm. The lack of effect on agonist potency suggests that the mutations did not directly alter the coupling to the channel and that the tyrosines were not required forU69593 affinity. However, insulin did not potentiate the response toU69593 in oocytes expressing either KOR(Y87F) or KOR(Y157F) (Fig. 4) compared with matched controls expressing wild-type KOR. The results support the hypothesis that insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation occurs at these two sites on KOR. The levels of receptor expression were too low to obtain direct evidence of phosphotyrosine production by Western analysis (data not shown). To examine the mechanism by which insulin caused a potentiation of the KOR response, we generatedU69593 dose-response curves either before or after insulin treatment. There was no significant change in the EC50 value forU69593 in oocytes pretreated with insulin compared with untreated oocytes (p > 0.05). The control EC50 value (with 95% confidence intervals) was 160 () nm, and the EC50 value for U69593 was 192 () nmin oocytes pretreated with insulin. However, the maximal response to the κ-agonist was increased by insulin pretreatment at U69593 doses above 100 nm (Fig. 5). An increase in agonist efficacy could have been caused either by a functional increase in receptor number in the plasma membrane or by an increase in efficiency of G protein activation. The major finding of this study is that insulin treatment potentiates the activation of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel by the κ-opioid receptor. This potentiation may require tyrosine kinase activation, as the insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase, and the effects in this study were blocked by genistein. Furthermore, the regulation caused by insulin requires specific tyrosine residues in the first and second intracellular loops of the κ-opioid receptor. In addition, analysis of the dose-response curves demonstrated that the potentiation results from an increase in κ-agonist efficacy. These results indicate that the insulin potentiation of the κ-opioid response is caused by a change in the phosphorylation state of the receptor. Several possible cellular mechanisms might underlie the insulin potentiation of the κ-opioid response. First, insulin receptor activation might cause a direct phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in KOR. Activated insulin receptors have been shown to phosphorylate other receptor proteins (24Karoor V. Wang L. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 273: 33035-33041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Second, the complex cascade activated by insulin receptors might be indirectly altering the κ-opioid response by activation of a tyrosine phosphatase (25Taha C. Klip A. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 169: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Third, the effects of insulin on the opioid receptor could be mediated through an auxiliary protein that requires Tyr87and Tyr157 for its association with the κ-opioid receptor. The latter alternative is least likely, as the mutations did not cause a gross alteration in receptor conformation, evident by the lack of U69593 affinity change. Direct measures of phosphorylation of specific residues in KOR were not feasible; we obtained insufficient32P incorporation into KOR expressed in oocytes to resolve the phosphopeptide fragments derived from the immunoprecipitated receptor. Thus, the results do not distinguish between potentiation through an increase in phosphotyrosine or a decrease in basal tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates KOR signaling. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of opioid receptors has been shown to inhibit the coupling of opioid receptors to their effectors (for review, see Ref. 2Law P. Wong Y. Loh H.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). This is the first demonstration that regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of KOR modulates receptor function. A previous study by Pak et al. (4Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F. Wang J.B. George S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27610-27616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is required for a portion of agonist-induced internalization. Furthermore, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have also been shown to inhibit agonist-induced internalization (5Polakiewicz R.D. Schieferl S.M. Dorner L.F. Kansra V. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12402-12406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Schmidt H. Schulz S. Klutzny M. Koch T. Handel M. Hollt V. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The effects of insulin on the acute responses to κ-receptor activation seen in this study suggest a different regulatory role for tyrosine phosphorylation than that documented in the desensitization studies. We are studying the effect of insulin on the initial coupling of KOR, not agonist-dependent desensitization and internalization. In this study, we have shown that other signaling pathways can affect opioid receptor coupling through modulation of tyrosine residues, illustrating a novel mechanism of cross-talk between opioid receptor signaling and tyrosine kinase cascades. The modulation of KOR signaling reported here is through conserved tyrosines in the first and second intracellular loops. This supports the emerging theory that G protein-coupled receptors may generally be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Previously, β2-adrenergic receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase was shown to be potentiated by insulin in HEK293 cells, and this potentiation of β2-adrenergic receptor coupling by insulin was also attenuated by mutation of a tyrosine in the second intracellular loop (10Valiquette M. Parent S. Loisel T.P. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5542-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, Morris and Malbon (9Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) report that insulin activation of either the insulin receptor or the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibits β2-adrenergic receptor signaling through modulation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail and second intracellular loop, respectively. Furthermore, they showed that phosphorylation leads to interactions with Grb2 and other proteins and to eventual internalization of the receptor (9Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The basis for the discrepancy between these two reports is not clear, but presumably is due to the different conditions used. However, it appears that regulation of G protein-coupled receptors through modulation of specific tyrosine residues is likely to be found in more members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The results of this study also show that insulin has no significant effect on the basal channel activity of KIR3. This finding is in contrast to the reported effects of insulin on another inwardly rectifying potassium channel (KIR2.1) (16Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Karschin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34063-34068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The lack of effect of insulin is also in contrast to the large inhibitory effect of BDNF on KIR3 through activation of TrkB receptors (12Rogalski S.L. Appleyard S.M. Pattillo A. Terman G.W. Chavkin C. J. Bio;. Chem. 2000; 275: 25082-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that KIR3 maybe differentially modulated by receptor tyrosine kinases. Another possible explanation is the level of activation of tyrosine kinases. In this study, insulin acted through an endogenously expressed receptor, whereas BDNF acted through the exogenously expressed TrkB receptor. The higher levels of tyrosine kinase expression under the latter conditions could lead to a higher kinase activity, although this was not specifically examined. The insulin receptor is known to activate a large number of signaling cascades (for review, see Ref. 19Nystrom F.H. Quon M.J. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our results show that the potentiating effect of insulin requires activation of tyrosine kinases; however, the tyrosine kinase that directly phosphorylates KOR was not identified. The Xenopus oocyte expresses both the insulin receptor and the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, which bind and are activated by insulin; but in our study, we did not address which of these receptors mediates the effects of insulin (for review, see Ref. 11Grigorescu F. Baccara M.T. Rouard M. Renard E. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the fact that a conservative mutation of specific tyrosine residues to phenylalanines attenuates the effects of insulin argues that the regulation is through direct regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of KOR. The increase in KOR coupling seen here appears to be due to an increase in efficacy and not a shift in the affinity of κ-ligands, as shown by the increase in the maximal effect without a shift in the EC50 values for the κ-agonist. A change in efficacy could be due to an increase in the total number of receptors or to an increase the ability of each receptor to activate its effector, in this case, KIR3. These studies were carried out under conditions in which there were no spare κ-receptors (15Appleyard S.M. Celver J. Pineda V. Kovoor A. Wayman G.A. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23802-23807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and we did not distinguish between these two possible mechanisms for an increase in agonist efficacy in this study. The critical tyrosine residues are located in the first and second intracellular loops of KOR. This region is thought to be involved with G protein binding along with the third intracellular loop and the C-terminal tail (26Georgoussi Z. Merkouris M. Mullaney I. Megaritis G. Carr C. Zioudrou C. Milligan G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1359: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Koch T. Kroslak T. Averbeck M. Mayer P. Schroder H. Raulf E. Hollt V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is possible that regulation of the phosphorylation state of these residues alters the affinity of KOR for the GTP-bound state of the G protein, and so more receptors are associated with G proteins and available to activate the downstream effectors. Interestingly, both Tyr87 and Tyr157were required for the effect of insulin, suggesting that regulation of both tyrosine residues is important for the changes in efficacy and that the contribution of both residues is not additive. The physiological relevance of these findings remains to be determined. The insulin receptor kinase is a member of a family of receptor kinases that include growth factor, cytokine, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors. It is possible that other members of this family of receptor tyrosine kinases also could modulate opioid receptor function in the same way. Opioid receptors are expressed along with growth factors and cytokines in many different regions both centrally and peripherally. This mechanism could therefore have the potential for cross-talk with growth factors and cytokines in diverse opioid functions such as in the regulation of pain, epilepsy, and learning and memory. In conclusion, this study shows that insulin potentiates the coupling of KOR to KIR3. This potentiation is through activation of a tyrosine kinase and requires specific tyrosine residues in the first and second intracellular loops of KOR. These results suggest the possibility of a novel mechanism of cross-talk between receptor tyrosine kinases and opioid receptors. We thank Jeremy Celver and Janet Lowe for help.

NEM (5 mm) decreased, increased, and then decreased the open probability (P o) of the channel by thiol alkylation, a reaction not reversed by reducing agents. We now show that low NEM concentrations (20–200 μm) elicit Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles, but contrary to expectations, the effect was fully reversed by reducing agents or by washing SR vesicles. In bilayers, NEM (0.2 mm) increased P o of RyRs within seconds when added to the cis (not trans) side, and dithiothreitol (DTT; 1 mm) decreased P o in seconds. High (5 mm) NEM concentrations elicited SR Ca2+ release that was not reversed by DTT, as expected for an alkylation reaction. A non-sulfhydryl reagent structurally related to NEM, N-ethylsuccinimide (0.1–0.5 mm), also elicited SR Ca2+ release that was not reversed by DTT (1 mm). Other alkylating agents elicited SR Ca2+ release, which was fully (N-methylmaleimide) or partially (iodoacetic acid) reversed by DTT and inhibited by ruthenium red. Nitric oxide (NO) donors at concentrations that did not activate RyRs inhibited NEM-induced Ca2+ release, most likely by an interaction of NO with NEM rather than an inactivation of RyRs by NO. Thus, at low concentrations, NEM does not act as a selective thiol reagent and activates RyRs without alkylating critical thiols indicating that the multiple phases of ryanodine binding are unrelated to RyR activity or to NEM alkylation of RyRs.

Such studies demonstrated that skeletal and cardiac RyRs contain hyper-reactive or critical thiols of low pK avalues that could be oxidized and reduced to reversibly open and close the Ca2+-release channel (7Zaidi N.F.

Heavy metals and sulfhydryl oxidants, much like Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, exhibit biphasic effects on RyRs, where low concentrations activate and high concentrations inhibit the open probability of the channel (10Salama G.

Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) first showed that NO donors oxidize free thiols on RyRs causing an increase in the open probability of the channel (P o) and eliciting Ca2+release from skeletal and cardiac SR vesicles. NO gas and NO donors interact with RyRs to promote channel opening by a nitrosylation of critical sulfhydryl sites involved in the modulation of channel gating, and the effect is reversed by sulfhydryl-reducing agents (e.g. reduced glutathione, GSH; dithiothreitol, DTT; andl-cysteine) (10Salama G. Menshikova E.V. Abramson J.J. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Stoyanovsky D.A. Murphy T. Anno R.P. Kim Y.-M. Salama G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). NO gas elicited SR Ca2+but required high concentrations both in ambient oxygen levels (200–400 μm) and deoxygenated solutions (60–200 μm). Because SR Ca2+ transport is not altered by oxygen levels this indicated that direct nitrosylation of RyRs by NO gas is not biologically significant (13Stoyanovsky D.A. Murphy T. Anno R.P. Kim Y.-M. Salama G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Unlike authentic NO and non-thiol NO donors, nitrosothiols such asS-nitrosocysteine (cys-SNO) andS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d-l-penicillamine (SNAP) were potent at activating RyRs even in the presence of ambient oxygen levels because of a robust transnitrosylation of NO from the donor to critical thiols on RyRs (13Stoyanovsky D.A. Murphy T. Anno R.P. Kim Y.-M. Salama G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). As with other sulfhydryl oxidants, the binding of radiolabeled [3H]ryanodine to its receptor was inhibited by the NO donor cys-SNO, whereas the activity of Ca2+-ATPases was not altered by NO (13Stoyanovsky D.A. Murphy T. Anno R.P. Kim Y.-M. Salama G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In contrast, Mészàros et al. (14Mészàros L.G. Minarovic I. Zahradnikova A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) reported that SNAP inhibited SR Ca2+ release by partially reversing caffeine-induced Ca2+ release and decreasedP o of cardiac RyRs in planar bilayers (15Zahradnikova A. Minarovic I. Venema R.C. Mészàros L.G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies confirmed that sulfhydryl NO donors activate cardiac RyRs (16Xu L. Eu J.P. Meissner G. Stamler J.S. Science. 1998; 279: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) and showed that NO-like sulfhydryl oxidants and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release elicits a biphasic response, first an activation at low NO concentrations and then an inhibition at higher concentrations (17Suko J. Drobny H. Hellmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Hart J.D. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The divergent findings of the effects of NO on Ca2+-release channel could arise from differences in the reaction conditions and/or NO concentration. Aghdasi et al. (19Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) proposed that NO acts at different classes of thiols depending on the NO concentration. Low NO concentrations oxidize thiols that inhibit channel activity, and high NO levels oxidize thiols that activate RyRs (19Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Their conclusions were based on the multiple classes of sulfhydryls with which the sulfhydryl-alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) could interact (19Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In RyRs reconstituted in planar bilayers, NEM (5 mm) produced 3 phases of channel modification as a function of time. First, there was a decrease in P o after 2 min (phase 1), then there was an increase after 10 min (phase 2), and finally there was a decrease after 12 min (phase 3) (19Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Low NEM (0.2 mm) concentrations decreased P o of the channel, and a subsequent addition of NEM (5 mm) increased P o (19Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The three phases of channel activity elicited by NEM (5 mm) seemed to represent three phases of alkylation to three classes of sulfhydryl sites on RyRs, with decreasing affinity for NEM. This interpretation was supported by parallel changes of [3H]ryanodine binding (i.e. a decrease, increase, and then decrease inB max). In addition, the sulfhydryl cross-linking reagent, diamide, was shown to activate RyRs in bilayers and to cross-link RyR monomers to form dimers. RyRs activated by diamide could be activated further by NEM (5 mm), and alkylation with NEM (0.5 mm) blocked the cross-linking of monomers by diamide. This implied that alkylation of phase 1 sulfhydryls by NEM prevents the formation of dimers elicited by diamide (19Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Low NEM concentrations (≤5 mm) alkylate high affinity sulfhydryl sites (phase 1) reducing RyR activity (P o) and do not to proceed to phase 2 and 3 alkylation according to ryanodine binding and changes in P o. Most intriguing was that NO donors (0.1 to 0.5 mm) like SNAP, NOC-9, and NOC-15 blocked phase 1 alkylation of RyRs, measured as an increase in ryanodine binding during phase 1 of NEM alkylation (20Aghdasi B. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25462-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). NO donors also blocked intersubunit cross-linking induced by diamide. In contrast, high concentrations of NOC-9 and NOC-15 (5 mm) activated RyRs by increasing P o and induced intersubunit cross-linking (20Aghdasi B. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25462-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) concluded that NO interacts with at least two classes of sulfhydryls on RyRs sites, a high affinity site where NO protects against oxidants (site of phase 1 alkylation) and a low affinity site where NO acts as an oxidant to directly activate RyRs and promote intersubunit cross-linking. These results are opposite to the biphasic effects of NO, Ca2+, and other sulfhydryl reagents where low concentrations first activate and higher concentrations inhibit channel activity (10Salama G. Menshikova E.V. Abramson J.J. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Hart J.D. Dulhunty A.F. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The dual role of NO as an antagonist to other oxidants and as an oxidant of free thiols was previously demonstrated with SR, but the protective effects against oxidative stress were attributed to direct interaction between NO and the oxidant (21Gorbunov N.V. Tyurina Y.Y. Salama G. Day B.W. Claycamp H.G. Argyros G. Elsayed N.M. Kagan V.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,22Menshikova E.V.

The present study re-examines the triphasic effect of NEM on channel activity for the following three reasons: 1) The selectivity of NEM as a thiol-alkylating reagent cannot be relied upon. 2) The level of ryanodine binding is not equivalent to a measurement of channel activity, particularly for activation of the channel by sulfhydryl oxidants and nitrosylation of the channel. C) Evidence that NEM alkylates free sulfhydryl on RyRs was lacking, leaving the possibility that NEM interacted with RyRs by other mechanisms that could be reversed by sulfhydryl-reducing agents, particularly at low NEM concentrations. Skeletal SR vesicles were isolated from rabbit white muscle from the hind leg, as described by Salama and Scarpa (23Salama G. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6525-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles were suspended in sucrose (0.29m) medium with histidine (20 mm) buffer at pH 7.0 and kept in liquid nitrogen until use. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Heavy SR vesicles were prepared to reconstitute RyRs by fusing heavy SR vesicles with planar lipid bilayers for single channel recordings (24Hilkert R.N. Zaidi N.F. Shome J. Nigam M. Lagenaur C. Salama G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, SR vesicles were resuspended in a medium containing 0.6 m KCl, 100 μm EGTA, 75 μm CaCl2, 10 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.4, and were then loaded on top of a 15-ml tube in which a sucrose gradient was layered (5 ml of 20%, 5 ml of 35%, and 8 ml of 40%). The tube was centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor (SW 28 Beckman rotor) at 26,000 rpm for 16 h. Heavy SR vesicles were collected from the 35–40% sucrose interface, and 2 volumes of 0.4 m KCl solution was added to the heavy SR fraction and centrifuged at 18,500 rpm for 90 min. The heavy SR pellet was resuspended in a medium containing 0.29 m sucrose, 5 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.4, and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Ca2+ uptake and efflux from SR vesicles was measured spectrophotometrically through the differential absorption changes of antipyrylazo III (AP III) at 720–790 nm (23Salama G. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6525-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements were performed in a temperature-controlled cuvette under continuous stirring. Ca2+ uptake by the SR vesicles was measured in a reaction medium containing the following (in mm): 100 KCl, 0.2 AP III, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 ATP, 4 phosphocreatine, 20 HEPES, and 2.5 units/ml creatine kinase, pH 7.0, at 37 °C. Creatine kinase and phosphocreatine provided an ATP-regenerating system to maintain a constant concentration of ATP and free Mg2+ during Ca2+ transport. Calibration of AP III responses was obtained for each experiment by adding 12 μmCa2+ to the reaction medium, in the presence or absence of SR vesicles. Ca2+-release channels were reconstituted through the fusion of heavy SR vesicles. SR 0 (.5–1 μg protein/ml) was added to the cis side under an osmotic gradient to drive vesicle fusion with a planar lipid bilayer composed of phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine at a ratio of 5:3:2, as described previously (9Abramson J.J.

Biophys. 1992; 292: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The lipids were dissolved in decane at a total concentration of 50 mg/ml, and planar bilayers were formed across a 200-μm diameter hole in a Kynar cup. Single channel activities were recorded in the following asymmetrical solutions: cis side, 250 mm cesium gluconate;trans side, 50 mm cesium gluconate. Thecis and trans solutions were kept at pH 7.4 with 10 mm Tris-HEPES and pCa of 6.5 buffered with 1 mm EGTA. Channel activity was recorded at holding potentials varying from ± 40 mV, and P ovalues were calculated from a minimum of 3 min of continuous recordings under each condition. An Axopatch 1D (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) amplifier with a CV-3B head stage was used to measure picoampere current fluctuations. Data were digitized (model VR-10; Instrutech Corp.) and stored on video tape for subsequent analysis of channel activity. Analog data output from the video recorder was digitized with an analog to digital converter (Labmaster TM-40; Scientific Solutions, Solon, OH), transferred to computer, and analyzed using pClamp software (Axon Instruments). cys-SNO was prepared by mixing equal volumes of l-cysteine (0.6 m) and NaNO2 (4.0 m) as described previously (13Stoyanovsky D.A. Murphy T. Anno R.P. Kim Y.-M. Salama G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Excess NaNO2 was used to ensure that all the cysteine was converted to cys-SNO, because residual cysteine would act as a sulfhydryl-reducing agent to reverse the oxidation of RyRs by cys-SNO. All NO solutions were freshly prepared before an experiment. antipyrylazo III was purchased from ICN Biochemicals (Cleveland, OH). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. NEM is an alkylating agent that has been extensively used to label or block thiol residues on proteins with the presumption that the interaction is specific for thiols and is irreversible. As stated in a review article by Brocklehurst (25Brocklehurst K. Br. J. Biochem. 1979; 10: 259-274Google Scholar), a general criticism of such alkylating reagents (like NEM) is that they often require long reaction times, and the presence of excess reagent and their specificity for thiols cannot be relied upon. The specificity problem appears to be particularly serious in the case of maleimide derivatives that react with other nucleophiles such as amino and imidazole groups. Fig.1 A shows the effect of different concentrations of NEM on isolated skeletal SR vesicles. Once the SR vesicles were loaded with Ca2+, NEM (20–200 μm) was added to the reaction medium, which elicited Ca2+ release. DTT was then added to test whether NEM was alkylating thiols on the SR. DTT reversed the effects of NEM (20–200 μm) resulting in Ca2+ reuptake via the SR Ca2+ pumps. An addition of the Ca2+ ionophore,A23187, released the Ca2+ stored in the vesicles indicating that in DTT, the vesicles reaccumulated the Ca2+released (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, DTT did not reverse NEM-induced Ca2+ release when high concentrations of NEM (1–5 mm) were used, consistent with an alkylation of RyRs, which elicited a fast release of nearly 100% of the stored Ca2+. At an intermediate concentration of NEM (0.5 mm), DTT partially reversed NEM-induced Ca2+release, indicating that alkylation requires a higher concentration of the substrate compared with the non-covalent interaction between NEM and RyRs. To determine whether the effect of NEM on SR Ca2+ release can be reversed by washing out the vesicles, skeletal SR vesicles were incubated in low concentration of NEM for 5 min and then washed of NEM by rapid centrifugation and resuspended in NEM-free reaction medium. SR vesicles pretreated with NEM were then tested for their capacity to actively load Ca2+ compared with control vesicles, which were treated in an identical manner but were resuspended with NEM in the reaction medium. Fig. 1 B (dotted line,trace 1) illustrates that SR vesicles resuspended with NEM in the medium sequester Ca2+ upon the addition of ATP during an early phase of rapid Ca2+ transport and then release Ca2+ because of NEM-induced Ca2+release. The rapid initial phase of Ca2+ uptake indicated that NEM acts primarily by activating Ca2+-release channels rather than inhibiting Ca2+ uptake by Ca2+-ATPase pumps. The addition of DTT reverses the effect of NEM resulting in complete reuptake of Ca2+ by the vesicles (trace 1). In contrast, SR vesicles that were exposed to NEM and then resuspended in NEM-free medium sequestered the same amount of Ca2+ as control vesicles, which were never exposed to NEM, and DTT had no further effect on enhancing SR Ca2+ uptake (solid line, trace 2). Hence, the pretreatment of vesicles with NEM (100 μm) was fully reversed by washing the vesicles. Fig.2 A shows that SR Ca2+ release induced by low NEM concentrations was reversed by all of the sulfhydryl-reducing agents that were tested. The order of relative potency was DTT > GSH >l-cysteine > mercaptoethanol. Ruthenium red was effective but did not fully inhibit NEM-induced Ca2+release, supporting the view that release occurred mostly through an activation of RyRs (Fig. 2 A). The inhibition of NEM-induced Ca2+ release by NO was examined by testing the effect of several NO donors. We tested several NO donors at a wide range of concentrations and found that the inhibition of NEM-induced Ca2+ release by NO donors was dependent on the concentrations of the NO donor relative to that of NEM. The inhibition by NO was best studied at the lowest possible NEM (25 μm) concentration that caused release such that equally low concentrations of NO donors could be tested. This is important, because the higher concentrations of NO donor themselves elicit SR Ca2+release. Fig. 2 B illustrates that NEM (25 μm) induces Ca2+ release from SR vesicles (control, trace 4) and was inhibited by the prior addition of NO donors. The order of potency of NO donors as inhibitors of NEM was SNAP (trace 1) > NOC-15 (PAPA-NONOate) (trace 2) > cys-SNO (trace 3). At the concentration used here, these NO donors had no detectable effect on SR Ca2+transport. The effect of low NEM concentrations on single channel fluctuations of skeletal muscle RyRs was investigated by reconstituting Ca2+-release channels through the fusion of heavy SR vesicles with planar bilayers. Single channel fluctuations were measured in asymmetrical solutions across the bilayer with cesium as the conducting ion (Fig. 3 A). As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, NEM (200 μm) added to the cis side (but not trans) produced a marked increase in P o within 30 s. There was no detectable effect on single channel conductance at potentials ranging from ± 40 mV. In four separate channels, meanP o increased from 0.28 ± 0.05 to 0.75 ± 0.1 in the presence of NEM. Continuous recordings showed that the presence of NEM (200 μm) on the cis side for up to 20 min did not cause further changes in P o(n = 3), and an initial inhibition of the channel was not observed. Lower concentrations (10, 25, and 50 μm) of NEM had no effect on single channel properties for ∼15 min, and 100 μm NEM also increased P o but with a slower onset of activation (∼2 min). In three bilayers, the effect of NEM was tested on the trans side before testing it on thecis side. Single channel activation by NEM (200 μm) was effectively reversed by 1 mm DTT, resulting in a decrease in P o to 0.05 in ∼30 s (Fig. 3 C). N-methylmaleimide (NMM) had similar effects as NEM on SR Ca2+ release. As shown in Fig.4 A, NMM at 50–200 μm caused SR Ca2+ release, which was fully reversed by DTT. Higher NMM concentrations (1–5 mm) elicited release that was not reversed by DTT. Other alkylating agents like iodoacetic acid (IAA) (Fig. 4 B) and iodoacetimide (not shown) also elicited SR Ca2+ release but with slower kinetics, and they were partially reversed by DTT. As for NEM, ruthenium red inhibited release by these alkylating reagents but did not fully block release (Fig. 4, A and B) consistent with a possible inhibition of SR Ca2+-ATPase (26Hasselbach W. Weber H.H. Molecular Bioenergetics and Macromolecular Biochemistry. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, and New York1972: 149-171Crossref Google Scholar, 27DeMeis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Interestingly, control experiments with a non-thiol-reactive compound, which is structurally related to NEM, N-ethyl succinimide (NES) also elicited SR Ca2+ release at 100–500 μm, and as shown for IAA, the rate of release was slower compared with NEM and NMM (Fig. 4 C). NES-induced Ca2+ release was not reversed by DTT as expected for a non-sulfhydryl reagent and was effectively blocked by ruthenium red, consistent with an activation of RyRs. Several studies have shown that sulfhydryl oxidation-reduction plays an important role in the pathophysiology of skeletal and cardiac muscle (10Salama G. Menshikova E.V. Abramson J.J. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that skeletal and cardiac RyRs contain critical thiols of low pK a that can be oxidized and reduced to reversibly open and close the Ca2+-release channel. Free thiols on RyR can also be oxidized by NO donors resulting in an increase in the open probability of the channel and Ca2+ release from skeletal and cardiac SR vesicles (13Stoyanovsky D.A. Murphy T. Anno R.P. Kim Y.-M. Salama G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 16Xu L. Eu J.P. Meissner G. Stamler J.S.

Channel activation most likely occurs through the transnitrosylation of critical sulfhydryl sites on RyRs resulting in the formation of stable S-nitrosothiol residues or transient S-nitrosothiol bonds followed by disulfide bond formation with vicinal thiols on RyR. The complex effects of NO and other sulfhydryl oxidants highlight the multiple interactions that can occur and the need to identify the critical cysteine residues on RyRs to better understand the role of NO in the regulation of force in striated muscle (10Salama G. Menshikova E.V. Abramson J.J. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The main findings of this study are that low and high NEM concentrations act by different mechanisms. Low concentrations of NEM (20–200 μm) activate RyRs but do not alkylate the protein, because the effect is fully reversed by washing out NEM or by adding sulfhydryl-reducing agents. High concentrations of NEM (5 mm) also activate the channel but are not reversible with sulfhydryl-reducing agents. It is important to note that low NEM concentrations activate RyRs and may partially inhibit Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPases, because NEM effects were not fully reversed by ruthenium red. The Ca2+-ATPase enzyme is known to be inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents and up to three sulfhydryl groups out of the 24 cysteines of the enzyme are considered essential for full enzymatic activity (26Hasselbach W. Weber H.H. Molecular Bioenergetics and Macromolecular Biochemistry. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, and New York1972: 149-171Crossref Google Scholar, 27DeMeis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 28Murphy A.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4492-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Greeen N.M. Nature. 1985; 316: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). High concentrations of alkylating reagents are typically required and used to inhibit Ca2+-ATPase activity. Low concentrations of alkylating agents are ineffective, which is consistent with the fast initial phase of Ca2+ uptake seen after a brief exposure of the SR vesicles to NEM (Fig. 1 B, trace 1). On the other hand, prolonged exposure of SR vesicles with low NEM concentrations may partially inhibit Ca2+-ATPase activity, as shown in Fig.1 B. The reversal of NEM-induced Ca2+ release by DTT indicates that the exogenously added DTT neutralizes the effect of NEM by the alkylation of DTT by NEM and that NEM did not significantly inhibit Ca2+-ATPase activity, because the vesicles take up the release Ca2+. These findings indicate that at low concentrations, NEM activates RyRs by a non-covalent interaction and at high concentrations by alkylating free thiols on RyRs. The NO donors SNAP, NOC-15 (PAPA-NONOate), and cys-SNO were tested at concentrations that had no effect on channel activity and were found to inhibit NEM-induced Ca2+ release from SR vesicles. NO donors most likely inhibit the effect of low NEM by interacting with NEM, because the inhibition is only seen at low NEM concentrations compared with NO donor concentrations and at NEM levels that do not alkylate the RyR. Thus, inhibition of NEM-induced Ca2+ release by NO cannot be explained by a poly-s-nitrosylation of essential cysteine residues on RyRs, because the action of NEM does not involve a sulfhydryl-mediated reaction. These findings are supported by equivalent measurements with other alkylating agents and with a non-thiol-reactive compound, structurally related to NEM. In all cases, these reagents elicited SR Ca2+ release, and the effects of the thiol reagents were reversed by DTT, and as expected, the non-thiol reagent was not reversed by DTT. The finding that NES, a non-thiol reagent structurally related to NEM, elicits SR Ca2+ release demonstrates that such release occurs without the possibility of a sulfhydryl interaction with RyRs. The block of NES-induced Ca2+ release by ruthenium red (Fig.4 C) confirms that NES acts at RyRs. Aghdasi et al. (19Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported three distinct time-dependent phases of channel modification primarily from measurements of ryanodine binding with the tacit assumption that ryanodine binding is a direct measurement of single channel activity. The greater the binding, the more active the channel. In general, it is known that agents that increase and decrease channel activity typically increase and decrease ryanodine binding (B max), respectively. However, that is not always the case, because sulfhydryl reagents that activate RyRs have the opposite effect on ryanodine binding. The heavy metal Ag+ is a robust activator of RyRs (4Salama G. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13363-13369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dissociates ryanodine from its high affinity binding site in seconds instead of the normally very slow rate of dissociation (>45 min) (30Pessah I.N. Stambuk R.A. Casida J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 31: 232-238Google Scholar). Similarly, reactive disulfide compounds and NO activate RyRs and inhibit ryanodine binding (7Zaidi N.F. Lagenaur C.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) found that low NEM concentrations alkylate thiols involved in phase 1 channel inhibition without progressing to phases 2 and 3. This was shown as an inhibition of RyR activity with 0.2 mmNEM in bilayers and a decrease in ryanodine binding with 0.5 and 1.0 mm NEM (19Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, no evidence was given to indicate that low NEM concentrations alkylate thiols or that 0.5 or 1 mm NEM inhibited activity in single channel recordings before progressing to phases 2 and 3 of channel modification. In contrast, we found that low concentrations of NEM (0.2 mm) activated RyRs in bilayer experiments, and we found no signs of channel inhibition in either bilayer or SR vesicle measurements. In bilayer experiments, the activation of the channel by low concentrations of NEM was reversed by DTT (Fig. 4 C) consistent with the reversal of NEM-induced Ca2+ release in vesicle experiments by washing out NEM or adding DTT. The most likely explanation is that DTT interacts directly with NEM to neutralize NEM and NEM-induced Ca2+ release. At high NEM concentrations (5 mm), Ca2+ release from SR was not reversed by DTT as expected for an alkylation of thiol groups. Several studies have shown that NO donors activated (13Stoyanovsky D.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) proposed that low levels of NO inactivate and high levels activate the receptor. Their conclusions were based on the findings that NEM could interact with multiple classes of sulfhydryls resulting in inactivation or activation of RyR as a function of time and NEM concentration (19Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NO and H2O2 blocked the phase 1 inhibitory effect of 5 mm NEM. NO donors, at low concentrations that have no detectable effect on channel activity, blocked intersubunit cross-linking, whereas higher NO levels activate the channel (17Suko J. Drobny H. Hellmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that the two effects of NO resulted from interaction with distinct sulfhydryls. Our data show that NO donors can partially reverse the effects of low concentration of NEM, but the reversal of this reaction can also be accomplished by washing the SR vesicles or by adding a sulfhydryl-reducing agent. When SR vesicles were preincubated with NO donors at subactivating concentrations of NO donors, the subsequent NEM-induced Ca2+ release was inhibited but not fully blocked. In this case, NO appears to interact directly with NEM, decreasing its effective concentration rather than causing an indirect inhibition of NEM-induced Ca2+ release through an inactivation of RyRs. The present findings indicate that 5 mm NEM alkylates thiols on RyRs, but low concentrations (20–200 μm) act by a reversible non-covalent interaction indicating that phase 1 effects measured as a decrease in ryanodine binding do not correspond to the inhibition of the channel with low NEM concentrations. The latter interpretation of the data rests heavily on ryanodine binding measurements and the questionable assumption that ryanodine binding is a measure of channel activity under all conditions."

At the first active site, to which ATP, Pi and Mg(II) are bound, His455 attacks the β-P of ATP, forming a pyrophosphorylhistidine enzyme intermediate (E-PP) and AMP (Scheme 1). The Pi ligand then reacts with the terminal phosphoryl group of E-PP to form a phosphorylhistidine intermediate (E-P) and PPi. The phosphorylhistidine of E-P then moves to the second active site where pyruvate, Mg(II), and a monovalent cation (K+ or NH4+) are bound. Upon transfer of the phosphoryl group to pyruvate to form the final product PEP, the His455 residue returns to the first active site to initiate a new catalytic cycle. The x-ray crystal structure (2Herzberg O. Chen C.C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L.J. Noh S.J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A Mg(II) cofactor and the ATP and Pi substrate ligands have been modeled into the structure at the N-terminal “ATP grasp” domain (residues 2–430). The locations of the ligand binding sites (comprising active site 1) within the N-terminal domain are supported by the results from earlier affinity labeling and mutagenesis studies (4McGuire M. Huang K. Kapadia G. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13463-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5McGuire M. Carroll L.J. Yankie L. Thrall S.H. Dunaway-Mariano D.

As His455is located in close proximity to active site 1, the PPDK crystal structure, with some local adjustments, corresponds to a conformer competent to catalyze the ATP/Pi partial reaction (Scheme 1). Henceforth, this conformer will be referred to as “conformer 1.” ATP/Pi Partial Reaction at Active Site 1 on N-terminal Domain: (1)E+ATP+Pi→E·ATP·Pi→E­PP·AMP·Pi (2)E­PP·AMP·Pi→E­P·AMP·PPi→EP+AMP+PPi Pyruvate Partial Reaction at Active Site 2 on C-terminal Domain: (3)E­P+pyruvate→E­P·pyruvate→E­P·PEP→E+PEPScheme 1. The ATP/Pi and pyruvate partial reactions of pyruvate phosphate catalysis (1Wood H.G. O'Brien W.E. Micheales G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Affinity labeling and mutagenesis studies have shown that the pyruvate ligand binds at a second active site, located on the α/β barrel C-terminal domain (residues 534–874) (6Xu Y. Yankie L. Shen L. Jung Y.S. Mariano P.S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Martin B.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2181-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Yankie L. Xu Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2188-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A model of an enzyme conformer (illustrated at the bottom of Fig. 1; henceforth referred to as “conformer 2”) judged to be effective in catalysis of the pyruvate partial reaction, was generated from the original structure by transferring the central domain (residues 390–504) from its binding site at the concave surface of the N-terminal domain to the concave surface of the C-terminal domain (2Herzberg O. Chen C.C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L.J. Noh S.J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mg(II) and PEP were modeled into active site 2 of conformer 2 (2Herzberg O. Chen C.C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L.J. Noh S.J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as pictured in Fig. 1 (bottom). In this model, the PEP phosphoryl group is aligned for nucleophilic attack by the catalytic His455 residue. We anticipate that the rotation about the two interdomain linkers (residues 341–389 and 505–533), as required by the conformer 1 ↔ conformer 2 model of Fig. 1, occurs freely in solution, thus allowing the central domain to “swivel” between the two active sites. Full catalytic turnover on the enzyme will thus require that ATP, Pi, and Mg(II) first bind to active site 1 of conformer 2 (see Scheme 2). The central domain must then dissociate from the C-terminal domain and bind with the N-terminal domain to form conformer 1. Despite the fact that the rotation about the linkers is intrinsically fast (ns time scale), the central domain must remain docked long enough for catalysis at active site 1 to be completed (millisecond time scale (Ref. 3Carroll L.J. Mehl A.F. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5965-5967Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar)), but not so long as to impede the ensuing reaction of His(P)455 with pyruvate at active site 2. The transition from conformation 1 to conformation 2 allows dissociation of the AMP and PPi product ligands from active site 1 as well prepares the enzyme for catalysis at active site 2, provided that this active site was “pre-loaded” with pyruvate and the Mg(II)/NH4+ cofactors while the enzyme was in conformation 1. Following catalytic turnover at active site 2 in conformer 2, the central domain must dissociate from the C-terminal domain to allow release of the PEP product from conformer 1. If active site 1 contains ATP and Pi, the next catalytic cycle can directly follow from this conformer. The separate site catalysis of PPDK thus requires the transient formation of precisely oriented domain-domain complexes. An alignment made of the 17 known PPDK sequences (see Fig. 1 in supplemental materials, available in the on-line version of the journal) shows that a majority of the residues defining the proposed binding surfaces on the N- and C-terminal domains are stringently conserved as are many of the surface residues surrounding the catalytic His455 on the central domain (see Fig. 2). In contrast, the surface residues on the opposite, solvent-exposed faces of the three domains are variable. The conservation of residues at the respective domain-domain interfaces of the observed and modeled conformers has been necessary throughout evolution for productive domain docking and accurate targeting of the catalytic His455.Figure 2Front and back views of the space filling models of the PPDK conformers 1 and 2 of Fig. 1 are shown to illustrate the conservation of residues at the domain-domain interface regions. The dark green, dark blue, and gold residues are stringently conserved among the 17 known PPDK sequences, while the pastel blue, pastel green, andyellow residues are variable.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Through inspection of the domain-domain interface region of the x-ray structure of apo-PPDK and of the alignment made of the PPDK sequences, two stringently conserved residues of the N-terminal domain (namely Arg219 and Glu271), whose side chains are positioned for favorable polar interaction with side chain and/or backbone atoms of the central domain, were identified. As is shown in Fig. 3, the guanidinium group of Arg219 is within interaction distance of the carboxylate groups of the central domain residues Glu434 (Glu or Asp conserved) and Glu437 (not conserved). The carboxylate group of Glu271 is within interaction distance of the hydroxyl group of the central domain Thr453 and the backbone amide NHs of Thr453 and Met452. In addition, N-terminal domain residues Ser262 and Lys149, which are not conserved among all of the PPDK sequences, are also positioned for favorable interaction with the central domain. The hydroxyl group of Ser262 is within H-bonding distance of the backbone C=O of central domain residue Ala398. The side-chain ammonium group of Lys149is located 4.4 Å from the central domain Glu430carboxylate, which is too far for significant interaction. However, if the side chain of the Lys149 is free to rotate from the conformation observed in the crystal, it can move within 3.5 Å of the carboxylate, close enough for favorable interaction to occur. Since productive domain-domain binding is an integral component of PPDK catalysis (Scheme 2), an examination of the roles of Arg219, Glu271, Ser262, and Lys149 in domain docking can be made by replacing these residues with amino acids that can not interact favorably and evaluating the catalytic efficiencies of the corresponding mutant enzymes. In the text that follows, we report on the steady-state and transient kinetic properties of the C. symbiosum PPDK mutants R219A, R219E, E434A/E437A, E271A, T453A, S262A, S262W, and K149A. The rate constants obtained for the mutants in catalysis of the full reaction and the E + ATP → E-PP·AMP,E + ATP + Pi →E-P·AMP·PPi, and E + PEP →E-P·pyruvate partial reactions are compared with those determined in an earlier kinetic analysis of the wild-type PPDK (8Mehl A. Xu Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the productive docking of the central domain is controlled, in part, through the interaction of N-terminal domain residues Arg219 and Glu271 with central domain residues Glu434/Glu437 and Thr453/Met452, respectively. The N-terminal domain Ser262 and Lys149 residues, on the other hand, do not appear to play a vital role in orienting or stabilizing the domain-domain complex. Mutant genes were prepared from the plasmid pACYC184-D12 (9Pocalyko D.J. Carroll L.J. Martin B.M. Babbitt P.C. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using polymerase chain reaction techniques analogous to those described in (4McGuire M. Huang K. Kapadia G. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13463-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers, 18–22 base pairs in length, were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. BglII and BstXI restriction sites were employed in the construction of the Lys149, Arg219, Ser262, and Glu271 mutants, whereas BstXI and KpnI sites were used for the Glu434/Glu437 and Thr453 mutants. The sequences of the isolated mutant genes were determined at the Center for Agricultural Biotechnology at the University of Maryland. Wild-type and mutant PPDK genes were expressed in Escherichia coli JM101 cells, and the protein products were purified to homogeneity (judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis) in yields of 20–25 mg/g cell as described in Ref. 4McGuire M. Huang K. Kapadia G. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13463-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. The chromatographic properties of the mutant proteins as well as their stability to storage in buffered solutions at 4 οC were observed to be very similar to the chromatographic properties and stability of the wild-type enzyme. The spectrophotometric assay described in Ref. 10Wang H.C. Ciskanik L. Dunaway-Mariano D. von der Saal W. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar was used to monitor the initial velocity of the PPDK-catalyzed reaction of AMP, PPi, and PEP to ATP, Pi, and pyruvate. Initial velocities were measured as a function of the concentration of the varied substrate (in a range of 0.5–10-fold Km) at fixed, saturating concentrations of cosubstrates (0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP, 1 mm PPi) and metal ion cofactors (5 mm MgCl2 and 40 mmNH4Cl) in 20 mm imidazole (pH 6.8, 25 °C). The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 1 and the computer programs of Cleland (11Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 500-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The kcat was calculated from vmax/[E]. v0=vmax [S]/(Km+[S])Equation 1 v0 is the initial velocity, [E] is the enzyme concentration, [S] is the substrate concentration, vmax is the maximum velocity, andKm is the Michaelis constant. TheKi values for the competitive inhibitors AMPPNP and PNP were determined from initial velocity data obtained at varying AMP or PPi concentrations and fixed, saturating concentrations of cosubstrates and cofactors. The initial velocity data were analyzed using Equation 2, where Ki is the inhibition constant and [I] the inhibitor concentration.v0=vmax [S]/[Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S]]Equation 2 [32P]PEP was prepared from [β-32P]ATP according to the procedure described in Carroll et al. (3Carroll L.J. Mehl A.F. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5965-5967Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). [β-32P]ATP (specific activity > 1 Ci/mmol) was custom-synthesized by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The single-turnover reactions of 40 μmwild-type or mutant PPDK, 5 μm [32P]PEP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmNH4Cl in 50 mm K+Hepes (pH 7.0, 25 °C) were carried out in a rapid quench apparatus from KinTek Instruments. Reactions were initiated by mixing 32 μl of buffered enzyme/cofactors with 32 μl of buffered substrate and then terminated at varying conversion with 182 μl of 0.6 m HCl. The protein was precipitated from quenched solutions by vigorous mixing with CCl4 and separated by centrifugation. The protein pellet (dissolved in 500 μl of boiling 10 nH2SO4) and supernatant were analyzed for32P by scintillation counting. The percentage of conversion was deduced from the ratio of the radioactivity in the pellet to the total radioactivity in the pellet and supernatant. The concentration of [β-32P]E-P was calculated from 40 μm X% conversion and plotted as a function of reaction time. The resulting time course was fit to a single exponential equation (Equation 3) using the KaleidaGraph computer program to yield the reported rate constants.[B] t=[B] f×(1−exp(kobs×t))Equation 3 [B]t is the product concentration at time t, [B]f is the product concentration at equilibrium, and kobs is the observed rate constant for the reaction. [14C]ATP was synthesized from [14C]AMP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as follows. A 1-ml reaction containing 0.08 μm [14C]AMP (50 μCi), 50 μm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NH4Cl, 6 units of PPDK in 50 mm K+Hepes (pH 7.0) was carried out at 25 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then chromatographed on a 9-ml DEAE-Sepharose column using a linear gradient (0.25–1.1 m) of triethylamine bicarbonate (pH 7) as eluant. The fractions containing [14C]ATP were pooled and concentrated in vacuo (rotary evaporation) at room temperature. Excess triethylamine bicarbonate was removed by repeated water dilution followed by evaporation. The resulting [14C]ATP was stored frozen in 50 mmK+Hepes buffer (pH 7.0) at −30 °C. Single-turnover reactions of 40 μm wild-type or mutant PPDK, 10 μm [14C]ATP, 2.5 mmCoCl2, and 10 mm NH4Cl in 50 mm K+Hepes (pH 7.0, 25 °C) were carried out in the presence or absence of 11 mm Pi using a rapid quench device as described previously. The protein was removed from the acid quenched samples by centrifugation through a 500-μl filter (cut-off molecular mass of 30 kDa) purchased from Pall Gelman Inc. The unconsumed [14C]ATP and [14C]AMP product were separated by HPLC using a Beckman ultrasphere C18 reversed-phase analytical column and 25 mmKH2PO4, 2.5% triethylamine, and 5% methanol as the mobile phase. The fractions containing ATP and AMP were analyzed for 14C content by liquid scintillation counting. The time course for a single-turnover reaction was constructed, and thekobs was calculated, in the manner described in the previous section. The crystallization conditions used for the C. symbiosum T453A PPDK mutant were the same as those used for the wild-type enzyme (2Herzberg O. Chen C.C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L.J. Noh S.J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Single crystals were obtained at 30 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. Protein drops were equilibrated against reservoir solutions containing 50–55% saturated ammonium sulfate and 100 mmHepes buffer (pH 7.0). The drops consisted of protein solution (10 mg/ml, 20 mm imidazole buffer (pH 6.5), 100 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm mercaptoethanol), diluted by an equal volume of reservoir solution. The crystals belong to space group P2, and within the accuracy of the data the unit cell dimensions are the same as those of the wild-type protein crystals (Table II). The crystal was transferred to a mother liquor solution containing 20% glycerol, and then flash-frozen using an Oxford cryosystem. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Siemans area detector mounted on a three-circle goniostat, with a monochromated CuKα x-ray supplied by a Rigaku Rotaflex RU200BH rotating anode generator. Data were processed with the XENGEN package (12Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Ohlendorf D.H. Salemme F.R. J. Appl.

The PPDK mutants were first screened by measuring kcatand Km values for substrates andKi values for competitive inhibitors. The steady-state kinetic constants were determined for the AMP + PPi + PEP → ATP + Pi + pyruvate reaction (with Mg2+ and NH4+ serving as cofactors) using a continuous spectrophotometric assay to monitor pyruvate formation. PPDK adheres to an ordered, nonclassical bi (ATP, Pi) bi (PPi, AMP) uni (pyruvate) uni (PEP) kinetic mechanism (10Wang H.C. Ciskanik L. Dunaway-Mariano D. von der Saal W. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For convenience, the Km (and Vm) for each substrate was evaluated from initial velocity data measured with the concentrations of the two co-substrates held constant at saturating levels, while the concentration of the third substrate was varied at ∼0.5–10-fold the Km value. TheKi values of the ATP analog AMPPNP (versus AMP) and PPi analog PNP (versus PPi) were determined from the initial velocity data measured in the absence and presence of the inhibitor. The Ki, Km, andkcat values obtained for wild-type PPDK and the PPDK mutants at pH 6.8 and 25 °C are listed in TableI. Except for S262A and K149A, each of the mutants display significantly reduced catalytic efficiency compared with that of the wild-type PPDK. The kcat is deceased ∼10-fold for the R219A, R219E, and E434A/E437A mutants, ∼20-fold for T453A, ∼100-fold for S262W, and >5000-fold for E271A. As will be described in the section that follows, the reduction inkcat derives from a reduction in the rate of the nucleotide partial reaction.Table ISteady-state kinetic constants for wild-type and mutant PPDK catalysis of AMP + PPi + PEP → ATP + Pi + pyruvate in 20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 40 mmNH4Cl and 5 mm MgCl2 at 25 °CSampleKmkcatKimms−1mmWild-type (0.006–0.02 μm) Vary AMP 1-aReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP.0.009 ± 0.00222 ± 20.07 ± 0.01 (AMPPNP) Vary PPi 1-bReactions contained 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP.0.088 ± 0.00528 ± 10.031 ± 0.02 (PNP) Vary PEP 1-cReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm AMP.0.027 ± 0.000525 ± 1R219E (0.045–0.21 μm) Vary AMP 1-aReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP.0.010 ± 0.0023.2 ± 0.20.09 ± 0.01 (AMPPNP) Vary PPi 1-bReactions contained 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP.0.22 ± 0.013.8 ± 0.20.71 ± 0.06 (PNP) Vary PEP 1-cReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm AMP.0.0055 ± 0.00034.2 ± 0.5R219A (0.053–0.21 μm) Vary AMP 1-aReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP.0.0044 ± 0.0051.83 ± 0.060.08 ± 0.01 (AMPPNP) Vary PPi 1-bReactions contained 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP.0.158 ± 0.0062.8 ± 0.1>3 (PNP) Vary PEP 1-cReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm AMP.0.010 ± 0.0012.14 ± 0.04E434A/E437A (0.055–0.24 μm) Vary AMP 1-aReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP.0.004 ± 0.0012.21 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.01 (AMPPNP) Vary PPi 1-bReactions contained 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP.0.091 ± 0.0042.72 ± 0.06>4 (PNP) Vary PEP 1-cReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm AMP.0.0048 ± 0.00032.64 ± 0.05E271A (10 μm)< 0.005T453A (0.11–0.42 μm) Vary AMP 1-aReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP.0.0029 ± 0.00021.14 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.01 (AMPPNP) Vary PPi 1-bReactions contained 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP.0.078 ± 0.0021.52 ± 0.02>4 (PNP) Vary PEP 1-cReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm AMP.0.0044 ± 0.00021.34 ± 0.02S262A (0.004–0.017 μm) Vary AMP 1-aReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP.0.0033 ± 0.000221 ± 10.11 ± 0.01 (AMPPNP) Vary PPi 1-bReactions contained 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP.0.067 ± 0.00525 ± 10.03 ± 0.002 (PNP) Vary PEP 1-cReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm AMP.0.0037 ± 0.000220 ± 1S262W (1.2–2.3 μm) Vary AMP 1-aReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP.0.0075 ± 0.00030.15 ± 0.010.32 ± 0.02 (AMPPNP) Vary PPi 1-bReactions contained 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP.0.187 ± 0.0060.27 ± 1>4 (PNP) Vary PEP 1-cReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm AMP.0.002 ± 0.00030.45 ± 0.03K149A (0.013–0.031 μm) Vary AMP 1-aReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP.0.0103 ± 0.000814.4 ± 0.60.30 ± 0.01 (AMPPNP) Vary PPi 1-bReactions contained 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP.0.082 ± 0.00515.6 ± 0.50.011 ± 0.006 (PNP) Vary PEP 1-cReactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm AMP.0.0043 ± 0.000315.4 ± 0.81-a Reactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm PEP.1-b Reactions contained 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm PEP.1-c Reactions contained 1.0 mm PPi, 0.5 mm AMP. Open table in a new tab The abilities of the mutant enzymes to bind ATP and PPi are reflected by the Ki values measured for the inert analogs AMPPNP and PNP. AMPPNP competes with AMP for the same binding site on conformer 1 of the free and phosphorylated forms of the enzyme (see Scheme 2). Likewise, PNP competes with PPi for the same site on the AMP complex of the free or phosphorylated enzyme in conformation 1. An increase in theKi value may signify that the structure or electronic environment of the binding site has been altered by the mutation. Alternatively, if the ligand binding site is changed by domain-domain association, a mutation that affects domain binding can affect the Ki of the inhibitor.

Based on the AMPPNP Ki values listed Table I, it is evident that the ATP binding affinity is not altered in the R219E, R219A, E343A/E347A, S262A, and T453A mutants, despite the fact that all but the S262A mutant has a significantly lower turnover rate. On the other hand, the AMPPNP Ki values measured for the S262W and K149A mutants are ∼4-fold larger than that measured for wild-type PPDK. The exact cause of reduced ATP binding in these mutants is presently unknown; however, since the Ser262 and Lys149 residues do not appear to function as docking residues (i.e., the kcat values of the Ala mutants are normal), we have not pursued the issue further.

https://openalex.org/W2094663606,"The pancreatic elastase I gene (ELA1) is selectively transcribed to high levels in pancreatic acinar cells. Pancreatic specificity is imparted by a 100-base pair enhancer that activates transcription in β-cells of the islets of Langerhans as well as in acinar cells. Adjacent to the enhancer is a silencer that renders transcription specific to acinar cells by selectively suppressing the inherent β-cell activity of the enhancer. We show that the selective repression of β-cell transcription is due neither to a β-cell specific activity of the silencer nor to selective interference with β-cell-specific transcriptional activators acting on the enhancer. Rather, the silencer is effective in both pancreatic endocrine and acinar cell types against all low and moderate strength enhancers and promoters tested. The silencer appears to act in a binary manner by reducing the probability that a promoter will be active without affecting the rate of transcription from active promoters. We propose that theELA1 silencer is a weak off switch capable of inactivating enhancer/promoter combinations whose strength is below a threshold level but ineffective against stronger enhancer/promoters. The apparent cell-specific effects on the ELA1 enhancer appear due to the ability of the silencer to inactivate the weak β-cell activity of the enhancer but not the stronger acinar cell activity.

Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In many instances transcriptional enhancers direct expression to several cell types in an organ, generally due to the action of an organ-specific, but not cell-specific, transcriptional activator or combination of activators. Cell-specific expression is then resolved by the action of a repressor/silencer region that prevents transcription in the inappropriate cell type(s). The basis for cell type restriction by transcriptional silencers is not well understood, although recent evidence indicates repressive chromatin structure may be initiated by targeted recruitment of histone deacetylases or other chromatin-modifying enzymes (for reviews see Refs. 2Ayer D.E.

For example, the restricted transcription of insulin in pancreatic β-cells (7Nir U. Walker M.D. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is mediated by the complementary action of enhancers and silencers. β-Cells and acinar cells are constituents of the endocrine and exocrine compartments, respectively, of the compound pancreatic gland. Most of the pancreas is exocrine, organized into acinar structures that secrete a set of digestive hydrolases such as amylase, ribonuclease, and elastase into the intestine. Only approximately 2% of the pancreas is endocrine tissue, organized into islets of Langerhans comprising four cell types, each producing one principal polypeptide hormone. The majority of islet cells are β-cells, which produce insulin. During embryonic pancreatic development mature acinar and islet cells arise from transitional epithelial cells that express both acinar- (e.g. amylase) and islet (e.g. insulin)-specific markers (11Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Teitelman G. Development. 1995; 121: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiation of these transitional cells leads to silencing of acinar genes in islet cells and vice versa. The elastase I gene (ELA1) is one of the complement of pancreatic genes encoding digestive enzymes that are expressed selectively in the acinar cells. In this report we describe a transcriptional silencer that prevents expression of rat ELA1 in islet cells while permitting expression in acinar cells.Activation and repression of ELA1 gene transcription is mediated through 5′-proximal gene flanking sequences (Fig. 1). A 100-bp,1 three element transcriptional enhancer (−195 to −96 relative to the transcriptional start) contains regulatory information that directs pancreatic expression to both acinar and β-cells of transgenic mice (10Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Hammer R.E. Swift G.H. Ornitz D.M. Quaife C.J. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2048-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The endogenous ELA1 gene as well as transgenes containing as little as 501 bp of 5′-flanking sequences are not expressed in pancreatic islets, however (15Ornitz D.M. Palmiter R.D. Messing A. Hammer R.E. Pinkert C.A. Brinster R.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 399-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The appropriate acinar-specific transcription is imposed by a negative regulatory region located immediately upstream of the enhancer (between −501 and −202) (10Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).The acinar and β-cell specific activities of the ELA1enhancer have been assigned to two separate transcriptional elements (Fig. 1), based on their activity in transgenic animals and transfected pancreatic cell lines (10Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Rose S.D. Kruse F. Swift G.H. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The 25-bp A element is the sole positively acting transcriptional element for acinar transcription. The latent β-cell specific activity of the three-element enhancer is due to a 12-bp transcriptional element, the B element. The B element is also active in acinar cells, but in these cells it has a different function, which is to augment the activity of the acinar-specific A element (13Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A third element (C) is inactive on its own, but in combination with either the A or the B element augments their activity nearly 10-fold without contributing to or affecting cell specificity (13Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4385-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In β-cells the activity of the enhancer is mediated by the combination of the B and C elements, whereas in acinar cells all three elements are active. The silencer region (−501 to −202) suppresses the BC element activity in β-cells of mice without detectably altering the activity of the three-element (ABC) enhancer in acinar cells (10Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).We set out to determine the regulatory strategy that the silencer uses to suppress selectively the action of the ELA1 enhancer in pancreatic β-cells. For example, the silencer might selectively antagonize the action of the enhancer B element, which is responsible for the β-cell activity. Alternatively, the silencer may be active in β-cells but not in acinar cells; for example, the factors that mediate its activity may be present selectively in β-cells. We report that the action of the silencer is specific neither for the B element nor to β-cells. Instead we present evidence that the apparent selective action of the enhancer is based on its ability to suppress effectively the relatively weak two-element (B + C) enhancer active in β-cells but not the complete enhancer with the three elements (A + B + C) working in concert in acinar cells. We show that the silencer acts in a binary manner to block effectively transcription from a promoter with a weak enhancer.RESULTSInitially we tested two likely mechanisms for the β-cell-specific suppression of the ELA1 enhancer by the silencer. For mechanism 1, the silencer might selectively antagonize the action of the pancreatic transcription factor PDX1, which mediates the action of the B element in islet β-cells (16Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For mechanism 2, the silencer may be inactive in acinar cells; for example, the factors that bind to and mediate the activity of the silencer may be absent from acinar cells.To test these mechanisms, it was first necessary to verify that the silencer, active in β-cells of transgenic mice, was also active in transfected pancreatic β-cell lines. RIN1046-38 (hereafter RIN38) is a well differentiated, insulin-synthesizing β-cell line (24Phillipe J. Chick W.L. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). At low passages (as in these experiments) RIN38 cells retain many differentiated characteristics of pancreatic β-cells, including moderate levels of insulin mRNA and glucose-regulated secretion of insulin (25Clark S.A. Burnham B.L. Chick W.L. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The β-cell activity of the B element can be mimicked in transgenic animals and cultured cells by linking a pentamer of the B element to the minimal ELA1 promoter spanning nucleotides −92 to +8 (Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). In animals the minimal ELA1 promoter is inactive, and the addition of the B pentamer activates transcription selectively in β-cells (10Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In transfected RIN38 cells the low activity of the minimal promoter is increased 20-fold by the B element pentamer (Fig. 2, constructs A andB). The B pentamer is also active in a second independently derived and well differentiated β-cell line, βTC3 (Ref. 16Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and data not shown), but is inactive in non-β-cell lines, such as pancreatic acinar effectively, NIH3T3, and Rat2 fibroblast lines (16Swift G.H. Liu Y. Rose S.D. Bischof L. Steelman S. Buchberg A.M. Wright C.V.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5109-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).The 300-bp ELA1 silencer region (−501 to −202) reduced the activity of the B pentamer in transfected RIN38 cells (Fig. 2 C), consistent with its ability to suppress the action of the ELA1 enhancer in β-cells of transgenic mice. The silencer decreased the activity of the B pentamer 12–15-fold, so that the residual activity was approximately that of the minimal promoter alone. The silencer also was effective in reverse orientation (Fig. 2 D). However, the silencer region was not effective when moved to the other side of the hGH reporter gene; this position is 2.2 kb downstream and 2.8 kb upstream of the promoter in the circular plasmid (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, the action of the silencer is independent of its orientation but affected by distance from the promoter.The ELA1 Silencer Is Not Specific for the ELA1 Minimal Promoter or the B ElementTo test whether the specificity of the silencer may be due to selective interference with the islet-specific activity of the B element (mechanism 1), we measured the effects of the silencer on the activity of a variety of other promoters and enhancers, both cellular and viral, containing a wide variety of transcriptional elements. First, the activity of the silencer is not restricted to constructs containing the cognate ELA1 minimal promoter, because it also repressed the activity of the B pentamer coupled to thehsp70 minimal promoter (Fig. 3, compare constructs C andD). Moreover, the silencer inhibited the activity of the 49-bp H-2 Kb cellular enhancer driving either the hsp70 or the ELA1 minimal promoter (85 and 95% reduction, respectively; Fig. 3, compare E with F andH with I). The H-2 Kb enhancer has an exceedingly broad cell-type expression pattern (26Kimura A. Israel A. Le Bail O. Kourilsky P. Cell. 1986; 44: 261-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and therefore is likely driven by ubiquitous factors. The silencer region also reduced the activity of the HSV tk promoter by 95% (Fig. 3, J andK) and the SV40 enhancer/promoter by 80% (Fig. 3,L and M). The viral HSV tk promoter contains binding sites for common factors and is active in a wide variety of cell lines (27Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The SV40 early enhancer/promoter is also active in a variety of cell types, although individual elements within the enhancer display a unique pattern of cell-specific activity (28Schirm S. Jiricny J. Schaffner W. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Ondek B. Shepard A. Herr W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that the silencer region can interfere with the activity of a wide variety of heterologous promoters and enhancers. Consequently, its ability to repress selectively the ELA1enhancer in transgenic mouse islets appears not due to an effect specific to the B element or to PDX1, which binds and mediates the activity of the B element (mechanism 1).Figure 2Repression of B element activity in transfected RIN1046-38 β-cells. The activity of each test gene and the effects of the silencer were measured by transient transfection in RIN38 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The gene fragments in each fusion construct are discussed in the text and are identified as follows:EIp, the ELA1 minimal promoter; B, the B element of the ELA1 enhancer; Sil, theELA1 silencer region in the normal orientation (−501/−202); and liS, the silencer region in the reverse orientation (−202/−501); hGH, the 2.2-kb human growth hormone reporter gene.

Palmiter R.D. Messing A. Hammer R.E. Pinkert C.A. Brinster R.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 399-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); they retain properties of differentiated acinar cells, including the expression of cell-specific genes for the digestive enzymes elastase I, trypsinogen I, and amylase (30Swift G.H. Kruse F. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the silencer region inhibited the activity of the cellular H-2 Kb enhancer driving either thehsp70 or the ELA1 minimal promoter in transiently transfected 266-6 acinar cells (Fig. 4, compare C with D and F withG). The silencer also suppressed the activity of the viral HSV tk promoter in this acinar cell line (Fig. 4, compareH and I). When the activity of the silencer with these identical enhancer and promoter constructs are compared for the acinar and β-cell lines, the silencer was at least as effective in the acinar cells. These results suggest that the differential action of the silencer in islet versus acinar cells of mice is due neither to cell-specific activity (mechanism 2) nor to specificity toward the B element (mechanism 1).Figure 4Repression of heterologous promoters and enhancers in 266-6 acinar cells. These data show that the silencer is also active in an acinar cell line derived from transformed pancreatic acinar cells. EIe represents the ELA1gene enhancer.

Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), its ability to repress heterologous promoters in the 266-6 acinar cell line (Fig. 4) led us to test whether it was effective against theELA1 enhancer in these cultured cells. The silencer did indeed repress the activity of the ELA1 enhancer about 90% (Fig. 5, compare B andC). The residual activity in the presence of the silencer was still at least 10-fold greater than that of the ELA1minimal promoter without the enhancer (Fig. 5; compare A andC). Therefore, the silencer appears unable to suppress the activity of the enhancer in the acinar tumor cells as effectively as it does the B element multimer in insulinoma cells. This significant residual acinar activity may account in part for the continued expression of the identical silencer construct (as C of Fig. 5) in the pancreatic acinar cells of transgenic mice (10Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Due to the difficulty in comparing expression levels of different constructs in transgenic animals (e.g. Ref. 30Swift G.H. Kruse F. MacDonald R.J. Hammer R.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), quantitative effects of the silencer in acinar cells in vivo may not be evident.Figure 5A distant upstream region relieves repression of the ELA1 enhancer in acinar cells but not in β-cells. These transfection data show the activity of the silencer in ELA1 gene constructs in 266-6 acinar cells (top panel) and RIN38 β-cells (bottom panel). The dotted lines in the figure represent a deletion of the silencer region from −501 to −202 and a fusion of the boundary at −502 to the boundary of either the ELA1enhancer or the B element multimer. Levels of activity are expressed as a percent of the activity of the ELA1 enhancer/promoter (construct A) in 266-6 cells and as a percentage of the activity of 5B.EIp.hGH (construct G) in RIN38 cells. All the designations for the gene fragments are described in the legends for previous figures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether additional regulatory elements contribute to the control of the endogenous ELA1 gene, we examined the regulatory properties of the region upstream of the silencer. When an additional 4 kb of ELA1 5′-flanking DNA was included with the silencer, enhancer and promoter, the repression by the silencer in 266-6 acinar cells was lost (Fig. 5, compare C andD). However, in the absence of the silencer (Fig. 5 E) the upstream region did not increase the expression from the enhancer. Therefore, the upstream region may interfere directly with the silencer rather than indirectly by increasing the strength of the enhancer and thereby overcoming the influence of the silencer.In contrast to the effects in transfected 266-6 acinar cells, the upstream region could not overcome the action of the silencer in RIN38 β-cells (Fig. 5, compare H and I). Moreover, this upstream region suppressed the activity of the B element in RIN38 cells in the absence of the −501 to −202 silencer region (Fig. 5 J), suggesting the presence of additional silencing activity in the upstream region that is not manifested in 266-6 acinar cells (Fig. 5 D). In summary, the region 4 kb upstream of the silencer contains two classes of regulatory elements that help confer cell type-specific expression, additional negative control elements that suppress β-cell expression and others that interfere with the action of the silencer in acinar cells. The overall effect of the upstream region is to reinforce expression in acinar cells and to suppress it in β-cells.The Silencer Is Ineffective with Strong Enhancer/Promoter RegionsAn apparent discrepancy remains for the selective action of the 300-bp silencer in animals compared with cultured cells.In vitro the silencer is neither specific for theELA1 B element, because it acts on heterologous promoters and enhancers (Fig. 3), nor for β-cells, because it also acts in acinar cells (Figs. 4 and 5). Although other regulatory sequences in the endogenous locus may complement the action of the silencer (Fig. 5), in transgenic animals the 300-bp silencer effectively silenced theELA1 enhancer in islet cells while acinar activity was maintained (10Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). There are at least three possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, the RIN38 β-cell and 266-6 acinar cell lines may not accurately reproduce the differential activity of the silencer in β-cells and acinar cells in situ. Because islet and acinar cells have a common developmental origin, retro-differentiation of the acinar cell line may acquire some endocrine properties, including β-cell proteins for the silencer. Second, the silencer may also decrease the activity of the ELA1 enhancer in the acinar cells of animals but not completely; because of the difficulty of accurately quantifying transgenic expression in mice, this effect may have been overlooked.A third possibility is a previously unsuspected basis for the differential action of a silencer. In transfected RIN38 cells the silencer is able to repress the B element pentamer activity completely to the level of the ELA1 minimal promoter (Fig. 2), whereas in acinar cells it is unable to repress the ELA1 enhancer completely to the level of the same minimal promoter (Fig. 5). The post-repression activity of the −500EIhGH construct in acinar cells is at least 10-fold greater than that of the ELA1 minimal promoter (Fig. 5, construct C). Thus, the silencer is only partially effective on the three-element ELA1 enhancer but is much more effective on the synthetic B element multimer, which is a much less potent enhancer. This raises the possibility that the effectiveness of the silencer may depend on the strength of the enhancer with which it is paired. Thus, the 300-bp silencer may be able to suppress the action of a weak enhancer completely but only partially suppress a stronger enhancer.To test whether the effectiveness of the silencer depends on the strength of the paired enhancer/promoter, we measured the ability of the silencer to repress the activity of the potent RSV and CMV promoters in both acinar and β-cell lines. The silencer had no significant effect on the activity of these extremely strong promoters in either cell type (Fig. 6), consistent with the notion that the effectiveness of the silencer is dependent on the strength of the positively activating control sequences it antagonizes. The ability to affect weak but not strong promoters is also a property of a silencer from the chicken lysozyme gene (31Baniahmad A. Muller M. Steiner C. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because only the B and C elements of the ELA1 enhancer are active in β-cells, whereas all three elements are active in acinar cells (13Kruse F. Rose S.D. Swift G.H. Hammer R.E. MacDonald R.J. Mol.

RSV and CMV LTR represent the long terminal repeats containing the promoter/enhancer region of the early genes of the Rous sarcoma virus and the cytomegalovirus, respectively. The activity of the various constructs are expressed relative to the activity of theELA1 promoter (EIp.hGH), which was arbitrarily designated as 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binary Action of the SilencerMany enhancers appear to affect transcription by increasing the probability of a promoter being active without increasing the rate of initiation at the promoter (6Fie"
