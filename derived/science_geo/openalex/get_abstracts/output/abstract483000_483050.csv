https://openalex.org/W2119259385,"Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has long been known to play an important role in decision making. However, the exact nature of that role has remained elusive. Here, we propose a unifying theory of OFC function. We hypothesize that OFC provides an abstraction of currently available information in the form of a labeling of the current task state, which is used for reinforcement learning (RL) elsewhere in the brain. This function is especially critical when task states include unobservable information, for instance, from working memory. We use this framework to explain classic findings in reversal learning, delayed alternation, extinction, and devaluation as well as more recent findings showing the effect of OFC lesions on the firing of dopaminergic neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) in rodents performing an RL task. In addition, we generate a number of testable experimental predictions that can distinguish our theory from other accounts of OFC function."

The molecular mechanism by which the plasma membrane initiates changes in the cell expansion rate remains elusive. We found that a secreted peptide, RALF (rapid alkalinization factor), suppresses cell elongation of the primary root by activating the cell surface receptor FERONIA in Arabidopsis thaliana . A direct peptide-receptor interaction is supported by specific binding of RALF to FERONIA and reduced binding and insensitivity to RALF-induced growth inhibition in feronia mutants. Phosphoproteome measurements demonstrate that the RALF-FERONIA interaction causes phosphorylation of plasma membrane H + –adenosine triphosphatase 2 at Ser 899 , mediating the inhibition of proton transport. The results reveal a molecular mechanism for RALF-induced extracellular alkalinization and a signaling pathway that regulates cell expansion."
https://openalex.org/W1977502547,"Memories are acquired and encoded within large-scale neuronal networks spanning different brain areas. The anatomical and functional specificity of such long-range interactions and their role in learning is poorly understood. The amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are interconnected brain structures involved in the extinction of conditioned fear. Here, we show that a defined subpopulation of basal amygdala (BA) projection neurons targeting the prelimbic (PL) subdivision of mPFC is active during states of high fear, whereas BA neurons targeting the infralimbic (IL) subdivision are recruited, and exhibit cell-type-specific plasticity, during fear extinction. Pathway-specific optogenetic manipulations demonstrate that the activity balance between pathways is causally involved in fear extinction. Together, our findings demonstrate that, although intermingled locally, long-range connectivity defines distinct subpopulations of amygdala projection neurons and indicate that the formation of long-term extinction memories depends on the balance of activity between two defined amygdala-prefrontal pathways."

Putative attractor circuitry in the hippocampal CA3 region is thought to be the final arbiter between these two processes. Here we present direct, quantitative evidence that CA3 produces an output pattern closer to the originally stored representation than its degraded input patterns from the dentate gyrus (DG). We simultaneously recorded activity from CA3 and DG of behaving rats when local and global reference frames were placed in conflict. CA3 showed a coherent population response to the conflict (pattern completion), even though its DG inputs were severely disrupted (pattern separation). The results thus confirm the hallmark predictions of a longstanding computational model of hippocampal memory processing.

The results thus confirm the hallmark predictions of a longstanding computational model of hippocampal memory processing. The hippocampus is crucial for spatial, contextual, and episodic memory (Eichenbaum, 2004Eichenbaum H.

Neurosci. 2004; 27: 279-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar), but the precise computations performed by the hippocampus in support of these functions are unknown. It is thought that the hippocampus integrates external sensory information from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) with self-motion-based spatial information from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to create context-specific representations necessary for the recall of individual events (Knierim et al., 2006Knierim J.J.

A longstanding computational theory suggests that, to maximize the storage of information with minimal interference, associative networks such as the hippocampus perform two competing, yet complementary, processes (Guzowski et al., 2004Guzowski J.F.

Neural Networks and Brain Function. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). Pattern separation refers to the ability of the network to reduce the overlap between similar input patterns before they are stored in order to reduce the probability of interference in memory recall. Pattern completion refers to the ability of the network to retrieve stored output patterns when presented with partial or degraded input patterns. In many models of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus (DG) region is regarded as a preprocessing stage that performs pattern separation on entorhinal cortex inputs. In contrast, the extensive network of recurrent collaterals in CA3 may produce attractor dynamics that result in pattern completion (or generalization) when input representations are similar to stored memories (attractor basins) or pattern separation when input representations are more distinct (Guzowski et al., 2004Guzowski J.F.

Neural Networks and Brain Function. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998Google Scholar). Previous studies have provided evidence consistent with the hypothesized roles of the DG and CA3 in pattern separation and pattern completion (for reviews, see Santoro, 2013Santoro A. Reassessing pattern separation in the dentate gyrus.Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 96Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Yassa and Stark, 2011Yassa M.A. Stark C.E. Pattern separation in the hippocampus.Trends Neurosci. 2011; 34: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). However, a rigorous test of these functions requires measuring both the input and output representations of the brain structures, to test explicitly whether the outputs are more similar (pattern completion) or less similar (pattern separation) than the inputs. Previous investigations of CA3 and DG lacked critical information about the inputs, making it uncertain whether the putative pattern separation or completion was inherent to the region under investigation or merely a reflection of processing that already occurred upstream (e.g., Gold and Kesner, 2005Gold A.E.

Knierim J.J. Comparison of population coherence of place cells in hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3.Nature. 2004; 430: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This uncertainty is magnified by the paucity of published studies on the nature of DG neural representations in freely moving animals. Other studies that investigated both input and output patterns worked under experimental conditions in which CA3 reflected pattern separation, precluding a test of its hypothesized pattern completion functions (Bakker et al., 2008Bakker A.

Pattern separation in the human hippocampal CA3 and dentate gyrus.Science. 2008; 319: 1640-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Pattern separation in the dentate gyrus and CA3 of the hippocampus.Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). An experimental protocol utilizing local-global reference frame conflicts has been shown to result in CA3 neural responses that resemble pattern completion. Lee et al., 2004Lee I. Yoganarasimha D. Rao G. Knierim J.J. Comparison of population coherence of place cells in hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3.Nature. 2004; 430: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar showed that the population of CA3 cells responded to the local-global conflict more coherently than did the population of CA1 cells. In the present study, we recorded single-unit activity simultaneously from CA3 and DG in the same protocol to directly test whether the DG input patterns to CA3 were degraded in the cue-conflict environment (as predicted from pattern separation hypotheses) and whether the CA3 representation of the altered environment was more similar to the familiar environment, compared to its DG inputs. The results show that CA3 produced an output pattern closer to the originally stored representation than the degraded input patterns from the DG, providing direct, quantitative, neurophysiological evidence for pattern completion of severely degraded inputs in the DG-CA3 circuit. Single-unit activity was recorded from the DG and CA3 of freely moving rats using multitetrode arrays (Figures 1A and 1B ). The CA3 tetrodes were localized to the pyramidal cell layer, primarily in the CA3a and CA3b regions. The DG tetrodes were localized in (or just external to) the granule cell layer (n = 33) or in the hilus (n = 23); none of the tetrode tips encroached upon the CA3c layer. As discussed at length in a paper that presented data from the same animals as those reported here (Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012Neunuebel J.P. Knierim J.J. Spatial firing correlates of physiologically distinct cell types of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is impossible to distinguish from histology alone whether any individual, extracellularly recorded unit is a mature granule cell; an adult-born, immature granule cell; or a cell in the hilus. The cells recorded here had properties that are consistent with previous publications of DG neural activity (Gothard et al., 2001Gothard K.M. Hoffman K.L. Battaglia F.P. McNaughton B.L.

Approximately half of the cells in our sample fired in multiple, irregularly spaced subfields as rats ran in a large, open field after the main experiment each day (Figures S1 and S2 available online). This pattern of activity was ascribed to granule cells by Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I.

(Subsequent work has suggested that such patterns may be preferentially associated with newborn granule cells or hilar cells [Alme et al., 2010Alme C.B. Buzzetti R.A. Marrone D.F. Leutgeb J.K.

Spatial firing correlates of physiologically distinct cell types of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar].) Other cells that were included in the analysis either fired at a low rate (<1 Hz) with little spatial specificity or had a single place field in the open field. These cells were considered by Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012Neunuebel J.P. Knierim J.J. Spatial firing correlates of physiologically distinct cell types of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar as likely candidates for mature granule cells. Because it is unknown whether the different firing profiles corresponded to different morphological cell types, we did not segregate different subtypes of DG cells in the primary analyses (but we confirmed the main results by analyzing different subclasses in the Supplemental Information). Rats ran clockwise (CW) around a track centered in a black-curtained, circular environment (Figure 1C). Four local cues tiled the surface of the track, and six global cues were placed on or near the curtains (Knierim, 2002Knierim J.J. Dynamic interactions between local surface cues, distal landmarks, and intrinsic circuitry in hippocampal place cells.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6254-6264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rats experienced a standard configuration of these cue sets for an average of 16 days before the experiments started. Recording sessions consisted of three standard (Std) sessions separated by two mismatch (Mis) sessions, in which graded changes in sensory input were produced by rotating the global cues CW and the local cues counterclockwise (CCW) by the same amount, for net cue mismatches of 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180°. Over the course of 4 days, the rats experienced each mismatch amount twice. During the experiment, 399 CA3 units and 341 DG units were recorded during baseline (BL) sessions in which the rat sat quietly or slept in a towel-lined dish. These BL sessions were used to judge stability of the recordings within a day. Subsets of these cells were active during any given behavioral session and were analyzed quantitatively. During behavior on the track, the CA3 cells could be classified into putative principal cells and putative interneurons on the basis of firing rates and spike widths (Figure 1D), with putative principal cells having lower firing rates and wider spikes and putative interneurons having higher firing rates and narrower spikes. The DG units, on the other hand, segregated into three clusters of points (Figure 1E). Preliminary analysis of the data showed that some DG units fired at very low rates on the track, but the locations of these spikes were consistent across individual laps. The DG mossy fiber synapse onto CA3 is very large, and it is conceivable that even these low-rate cells might exert a significant influence on the CA3 network response. Therefore, to include these very low-rate cells and to exclude the high-firing-rate putative interneurons, we restricted our analyses to cells with ≥20 spikes in a given session and a mean firing rate <10 Hz, respectively. We applied these criteria to both CA3 and DG to remain consistent between regions and to remain consistent with the criteria of our previous report on the entorhinal inputs to the DG and CA3 (Neunuebel et al., 2013Neunuebel J.P. Yoganarasimha D. Rao G. Knierim J.J. Conflicts between local and global spatial frameworks dissociate neural representations of the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 9246-9258Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), thus allowing direct comparison to those results. Approximately 37% of CA3 (146) and 28% of DG (96) units met these inclusion criteria during the first Std session of the day (although many additional cells met the inclusion criteria in later sessions of the day; Figures S1–S3). Figures 1F and 1G show that both CA3 and DG had a similar range of spatial information scores, although the median score of the CA3 neurons was greater than the DG neurons (CA3: median 0.9, IQR 0.4–1.4; DG: median 0.6, IQR 0.1–1.2; Mann-Whitney U test, z = 3.1, p < 0.03). Similar to previously published reports of hippocampal subregions CA3 and CA1 (Lee et al., 2004Lee I. Yoganarasimha D. Rao G. Knierim J.J. Comparison of population coherence of place cells in hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3.Nature. 2004; 430: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and their entorhinal inputs (Neunuebel et al., 2013Neunuebel J.P. Yoganarasimha D. Rao G. Knierim J.J. Conflicts between local and global spatial frameworks dissociate neural representations of the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 9246-9258Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), individual cells responded differently to the double rotation manipulation. Classification of cells into different response types leads to arbitrary distinctions in many cases, and, therefore, we did not perform statistical or quantitative analyses on these categories. We present them here to provide a useful description of the types of single-unit responses that underlie the quantitative population analyses presented below. The firing fields of some cells rotated CCW with the local cues or CW with the global cues. This rotation was determined by correlating the Mis rate map with the Std 1 rate map at each of 72 rotational increments (each increment was 5°) and using the location of the peak correlation as an indicator of cue control. The peak correlation was required to exceed a threshold set at 0.6, which was a level that most reliably captured experienced observers’ evaluations of the similarity between two rate maps. Figure 2 shows examples of CA3 cells that were classified as CCW (cells 1–5) and CW (cells 6b and 7). Cell 1 had a firing field near the 4 o’clock position on the track in both Std sessions (Std 1 and Std 2). In the 180° cue-Mis session, the firing field rotated CCW, which indicated local cue control. The maximum correlation occurred when the rate map was rotated 275° degrees CW (i.e., 85° CCW) and surpassed the 0.6 threshold (green line). Cells 2–5 are other examples of local-cue-controlled cells. A smaller number of CA3 place fields were controlled by the global cues, rotating their firing fields CW (cells 6b and 7). In agreement with Lee et al., 2004Lee I. Yoganarasimha D. Rao G. Knierim J.J. Comparison of population coherence of place cells in hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3.Nature. 2004; 430: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, the local-cue-dominated firing fields (n = 101) far outnumbered the global-cue-dominated fields (n = 40). A number of cells (n = 60) had place fields that met inclusion criteria in both the Std and Mis sessions, but their responses were considered ambiguous (i.e., the peak rotational correlation was <0.6). Many of these cells had fields that became more diffuse during the Mis session (cells 8 and 9). For other cells, the activity criteria were reached in only one of the two sessions. Cells 10 and 11 are examples of strong fields (n = 64) that developed during the Mis session despite firing only a few spikes in the Std session. Cells 6a and 12 are examples of fields (n = 64) that were present in the Std session but were silent in the Mis session. Cell 6 is classified as disappear during the first Mis session (labeled as 6a) and as CW for the second Mis session (labeled 6b), showing that, as in prior reports (Knierim, 2002Knierim J.J. Dynamic interactions between local surface cues, distal landmarks, and intrinsic circuitry in hippocampal place cells.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6254-6264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2004Lee I. Yoganarasimha D. Rao G. Knierim J.J. Comparison of population coherence of place cells in hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3.Nature. 2004; 430: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), the same cell could respond differently to the manipulation in different sessions. The appearance or disappearance of the fields was not an artifact of recording instability, since the tetrode cluster patterns were similar during BL sessions recorded before and after the behavioral sessions, indicating that the same cells were present throughout the experiment. Examples of DG responses to the double rotation are shown in Figure 3. Similar to CA3, DG cells could also be classified as CCW, CW, ambiguous, appear, or disappear. Many of the DG cells fired in single or multiple locations on the track (Jung and McNaughton, 1993Jung M.W. McNaughton B.L. Spatial selectivity of unit activity in the hippocampal granular layer.Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.B.

Knierim J.J. Spatial firing correlates of physiologically distinct cell types of the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and fired consistently across the Std sessions. For example, cell 1 had two small fields (at 3 o’clock and 8 o’clock) in both Std sessions. During the 135° Mis session, one field apparently rotated to the 10 o’clock position and stretched in length while the other field rotated to 6 o’clock and the size remained similar. Because the peak correlation was just below the threshold, the cell’s response was considered ambiguous, a classification consistent with the changes in field size that indicated that the response was not simply a rotation of the firing fields. Cells 2 and 3 are other examples of cells that met activity criteria in both sessions and could not be described as simple rotations (n = 49). Other cells had place fields that rotated either CW or CCW (cells 4–7), according to the >0.6 rotational correlation threshold. Unlike CA3, there was not a large difference between the number of rate maps that rotated CCW (n = 36) or CW (n = 23). Similar to CA3, some of the cells were classified as appear (n = 49; e.g., cells 8–10) or disappear (n = 29; e.g., cells 11–12b). To analyze differences at the neural population level between CA3 and DG in response to the double rotation manipulation, we created spatial correlation matrices from the population firing rate vectors at each location on the track (Figure S4) (Gothard et al., 2001Gothard K.M. Hoffman K.L. Battaglia F.P. McNaughton B.L. Dentate gyrus and ca1 ensemble activity during spatial reference frame shifts in the presence and absence of visual input.J.

Head direction cell representations maintain internal coherence during conflicting proximal and distal cue rotations: comparison with hippocampal place cells.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 622-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The mean firing rate of every cell in the sample (normalized to its peak rate) was calculated for each 1° bin of the circular track to create 360 firing rate vectors. The firing rate vectors of a Std session (Std 1) were correlated with the firing rate vectors from either the next Mis session (Mis) or the next Std session (Std 2). The Std 1-versus-Std 2 correlation matrices for CA3 produced a band of high correlation on the main diagonal, showing that most CA3 cells fired at a similar location in both Std sessions (Figure 4, column 1). In every Mis session, CA3 maintained a band of highly correlated activity (Std 1 versus Mis; Figure 4, column 2). This band shifted downward from the main diagonal (dashed line), indicating that the CA3 representation was controlled coherently by the local cues (see below for analyses demonstrating that the high-correlation bands match precisely the angles of rotations of the local cues). However, the correlation structure degraded with increasing mismatch amounts, indicating that increasing cue mismatches caused increasing changes to the CA3 representation (Lee et al., 2004Lee I. Yoganarasimha D. Rao G. Knierim J.J. Comparison of population coherence of place cells in hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3.Nature. 2004; 430: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The critical question for the present study is (1) whether the coherence in the CA3 response was a reflection of an active pattern completion (or pattern generalization or error correction) computation performed by CA3 circuitry on degraded or corrupted input patterns or (2) whether the coherence was merely a passive reflection of input patterns that were already coherent prior to CA3. To answer this question, we analyzed the input representations from the cells recorded from the DG in the same animals. In the Std 1-versus-Std 2 correlation matrix (Figure 4, column 3), the DG showed a band of high correlation at the main diagonal, consistent with a reproducible pattern between standard cue configuration sessions (although the correlation matrices showed a noisier overall distribution compared to CA3; see below). In the critical Std 1-versus-Mis matrices, the DG showed only weak evidence of a high-correlation band (Figure 4, column 4), consistent with the computational models that propose a pattern separation function for the DG. These results demonstrate that the CA3 representation remains stable in the presence of a severely degraded input from DG, implying that CA3 can retrieve a previously stored pattern based on that degraded input. The Std 1-versus-Std 2 matrices for the DG (Figure 4, column 3) showed less coherence than their CA3 counterparts (Figure 4, column 1) (i.e., in addition to the high correlations along the main diagonal of the DG Std 1-versus-Std 2 matrices, there were additional pixels with high correlations away from the main diagonal). This finding raises the question of whether the DG supported coherent spatial representations even in the Std sessions. The matrices used all of the putative principal cells with mean firing rates <10 Hz. As shown in Figure 1D, the DG population shows three clusters of cells in the spike-width-versus-firing-rate scatterplot: (a) a group of cells with very low rates (<2 Hz) and a wide distribution of spike widths; (b) a group of cells with moderate firing rates (2–10 Hz) and medium spike widths; and (c) a group of cells with high firing rates (>10 Hz) and narrow spike widths. The last group consisted of presumed interneurons that were dropped from the analysis. It is possible that the middle class of cells was not as spatially modulated as the low-rate cells, and inspection of the rate maps confirmed this suspicion for most (but not all) of these cells (Figures S1 and S2). We thus generated the correlation matrices based only on the low-rate cluster of cells (group a). These matrices showed a cleaner coherence band in the Std 1-versus-Std 2 matrices compared to the larger data set (Figure 4, column 5), demonstrating that the low-rate cells had highly reproducible firing patterns in the Std sessions. Moreover, the Std 1-versus-Mis matrices still showed a st"

Vitamin A deficiency is one of the most common micronutrient deficiencies and is associated with profound defects in adaptive immunity. Here, we found that type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are severely diminished in vitamin A–deficient settings, which results in compromised immunity to acute bacterial infection. However, vitamin A deprivation paradoxically resulted in dramatic expansion of interleukin-13 (IL-13)–producing ILC2s and resistance to nematode infection in mice, which revealed that ILCs are primary sensors of dietary stress. Further, these data indicate that, during malnutrition, a switch to innate type 2 immunity may represent a powerful adaptation of the immune system to promote host survival in the face of ongoing barrier challenges."

https://openalex.org/W1987922392,"Maternal metabolic homeostasis exerts long-term effects on the offspring's health outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that maternal high-fat diet (HFD) feeding during lactation predisposes the offspring for obesity and impaired glucose homeostasis in mice, which is associated with an impairment of the hypothalamic melanocortin circuitry. Whereas the number and neuropeptide expression of anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, electrophysiological properties of POMC neurons, and posttranslational processing of POMC remain unaffected in response to maternal HFD feeding during lactation, the formation of POMC and AgRP projections to hypothalamic target sites is severely impaired. Abrogating insulin action in POMC neurons of the offspring prevents altered POMC projections to the preautonomic paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), pancreatic parasympathetic innervation, and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in response to maternal overnutrition. These experiments reveal a critical timing, when altered maternal metabolism disrupts metabolic homeostasis in the offspring via impairing neuronal projections, and show that abnormal insulin signaling contributes to this effect."

We have developed a transgenic mouse in which all β-actin mRNA is fluorescently labeled. We found that β-actin mRNA in primary fibroblasts localizes predominantly by diffusion and trapping as single mRNAs. In cultured neurons and acute brain slices, we found that multiple β-actin mRNAs can assemble together, travel by active transport, and disassemble upon depolarization by potassium chloride. Imaging of brain slices revealed immediate early induction of β-actin transcription after depolarization. Studying endogenous mRNA in live mouse tissues provides insight into its dynamic regulation within the context of the cellular and tissue microenvironment."

However, the contribution of central terminal TRPV1 in the dorsal horn to chronic pain has not been investigated directly. Combining primary sensory neuron-specific GCaMP3 imaging with a trigeminal neuropathic pain model, we detected robust neuronal hyperactivity in injured and uninjured nerves in the skin, soma in trigeminal ganglion, and central terminals in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Extensive TRPV1 hyperactivity was observed in central terminals innervating all dorsal horn laminae. The central terminal TRPV1 sensitization was maintained by descending serotonergic (5-HT) input from the brainstem. Central blockade of TRPV1 or 5-HT/5-HT3A receptors attenuated central terminal sensitization, excitatory primary afferent inputs, and mechanical hyperalgesia in the territories of injured and uninjured nerves. Our results reveal central mechanisms facilitating central terminal sensitization underlying chronic pain."

We report that the lipidome changes with the cell cycle. LC-MS-based lipid profiling shows that 11 lipids with specific chemical structures accumulate in dividing cells. Using AFM, we demonstrate differences in the mechanical properties of live dividing cells and their isolated lipids relative to nondividing cells. In parallel, systematic RNAi knockdown of lipid biosynthetic enzymes identified enzymes required for division, which highly correlated with lipids accumulated in dividing cells. We show that cells specifically regulate the localization of lipids to midbodies, membrane-based structures where cleavage occurs. We conclude that cells actively regulate and modulate their lipid composition and localization during division, with both signaling and structural roles likely. This work has broader implications for the active and sustained participation of lipids in basic biology."
https://openalex.org/W2082832087,"The physical manifestation of learning and memory formation in the brain can be expressed by strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections through morphological changes. Local actin remodeling underlies some forms of plasticity and may be facilitated by local β-actin synthesis, but dynamic information is lacking. In this work, we use single-molecule in situ hybridization to demonstrate that dendritic β-actin messenger RNA (mRNA) and ribosomes are in a masked, neuron-specific form. Chemically induced long-term potentiation prompts transient mRNA unmasking, which depends on factors active during synaptic activity. Ribosomes and single β-actin mRNA motility increase after stimulation, indicative of release from complexes. Hence, the single-molecule assays we developed allow for the quantification of activity-induced unmasking and availability for active translation. Further, our work demonstrates that β-actin mRNA and ribosomes are in a masked state that is alleviated by stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2060230550,"Selective neuronal loss is the hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), most motor neurons die but those innervating extraocular, pelvic sphincter, and slow limb muscles exhibit selective resistance. We identified 18 genes that show >10-fold differential expression between resistant and vulnerable motor neurons. One of these, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), is expressed only by fast motor neurons, which are selectively vulnerable. In ALS model mice expressing mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1), reduction of MMP-9 function using gene ablation, viral gene therapy, or pharmacological inhibition significantly delayed muscle denervation. In the presence of mutant SOD1, MMP-9 expressed by fast motor neurons themselves enhances activation of ER stress and is sufficient to trigger axonal die-back. These findings define MMP-9 as a candidate therapeutic target for ALS. The molecular basis of neuronal diversity thus provides significant insights into mechanisms of selective vulnerability to neurodegeneration."

The underlying mechanisms of this complex molecular cross-talk remain elusive. Here, we show that the expression of Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) in LSECs is dynamically regulated after partial hepatectomy. During the early inductive phase of liver regeneration, Ang2 down-regulation leads to reduced LSEC transforming growth factor–β1 production, enabling hepatocyte proliferation by releasing an angiocrine proliferative brake. During the later angiogenic phase of liver regeneration, recovery of endothelial Ang2 expression enables regenerative angiogenesis by controlling LSEC vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expression. The data establish LSECs as a dynamic rheostat of liver regeneration, spatiotemporally orchestrating hepatocyte and LSEC proliferation through angiocrine- and autocrine-acting Ang2, respectively."

Functionally, this chromatic complexity has presented a mystery ( 3 – 5 ). Why use 12 color channels when three or four are sufficient for fine color discrimination? Behavioral wavelength discrimination tests (Δλ functions) in stomatopods revealed a surprisingly poor performance, ruling out color vision that makes use of the conventional color-opponent coding system ( 6 – 8 ). Instead, our experiments suggest that stomatopods use a previously unknown color vision system based on temporal signaling combined with scanning eye movements, enabling a type of color recognition rather than discrimination."

Although the most likely dust source for the South Pacific is Australia and New Zealand, the glacial-interglacial pattern and timing of lithogenic sediment deposition is similar to dust records from Antarctica and the South Atlantic dominated by Patagonian sources.

The layered rocks are overlain by breccias, and both units are cut by calcium sulfate veins precipitated from fluids that circulated after the Endeavour impact. Compositional data for fractures in the layered rocks suggest formation of Al-rich smectites by aqueous leaching.

We modified genomic loci encoding synaptic proteins within bacterial artificial chromosomes such that these proteins, expressed at endogenous levels and with normal spatiotemporal patterns, were labeled in an inducible fashion in specific neurons through targeted expression of site-specific recombinases. Within the Drosophila visual system, the number and distribution of synapses correlate with electron microscopy studies. Using two different recombination systems, presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations of synaptic pairs can be colabeled. STaR also allows synapses within the CNS to be studied in live animals noninvasively. In principle, STaR can be adapted to the mammalian nervous system."

CTVT is remarkably stable and lacks subclonal heterogeneity despite thousands of rearrangements, copy-number changes, and retrotransposon insertions. More than 10,000 genes carry nonsynonymous variants, and 646 genes have been lost. CTVT first arose in a dog with low genomic heterozygosity that may have lived about 11,000 years ago.

https://openalex.org/W2042363995,"The brain demands high-energy supply and obstruction of blood flow causes rapid deterioration of the healthiness of brain cells. Two major events occur upon ischemia: acidosis and liberation of excess glutamate, which leads to excitotoxicity. However, cellular source of glutamate and its release mechanism upon ischemia remained unknown. Here we show a causal relationship between glial acidosis and neuronal excitotoxicity. As the major cation that flows through channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is proton, this could be regarded as an optogenetic tool for instant intracellular acidification. Optical activation of ChR2 expressed in glial cells led to glial acidification and to release of glutamate. On the other hand, glial alkalization via optogenetic activation of a proton pump, archaerhodopsin (ArchT), led to cessation of glutamate release and to the relief of ischemic brain damage in vivo. Our results suggest that controlling glial pH may be an effective therapeutic strategy for intervention of ischemic brain damage."

https://openalex.org/W2167753025,"Place coding in the hippocampus requires flexible combination of sensory inputs (e.g., environmental and self-motion information) with memory of past events. We show that mouse CA1 hippocampal spatial representations may either be anchored to external landmarks (place memory) or reflect memorized sequences of cell assemblies depending on the behavioral strategy spontaneously selected. These computational modalities correspond to different CA1 dynamical states, as expressed by theta and low- and high-frequency gamma oscillations, when switching from place to sequence memory-based processing. These changes are consistent with a shift from entorhinal to CA3 input dominance on CA1. In mice with a deletion of forebrain NMDA receptors, the ability of place cells to maintain a map based on sequence memory is selectively impaired and oscillatory dynamics are correspondingly altered, suggesting that oscillations contribute to selecting behaviorally appropriate computations in the hippocampus and that NMDA receptors are crucial for this function."

Hunting bats ( Trachops cirrhosus ) can echolocate this signal by-product and prefer to attack model frogs when ripples are added to the acoustic component of the call.

This study investigated whether associations between sedentary behaviour and cardio-metabolic biomarkers remain when analyses are adjusted for total physical activity. Methods Cross-sectional analyses were undertaken on 4,618 adults from the 2003/04 and 2005/06 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Minutes of sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and total physical activity (total daily accelerometer counts minus counts accrued during sedentary minutes) were determined from accelerometry. Associations between sedentary behaviour and cardio-metabolic biomarkers were examined using linear regression. Results Results showed that sedentary behaviour was detrimentally associated with 8/11 cardio-metabolic biomarkers when adjusted for MVPA. However, when adjusted for total physical activity, the associations effectively disappeared, except for C-reactive protein, which showed a very small, favourable association (β = −0.06) and triglycerides, which showed a very small, detrimental association (β = 0.04). Standardised betas suggested that total physical activity was consistently, favourably associated with cardio-metabolic biomarkers (9/11 biomarkers, standardized β = 0.08–0.30) while sedentary behaviour was detrimentally associated with just 1 biomarker (standardized β = 0.12). Conclusion There is virtually no association between sedentary behaviour and cardio-metabolic biomarkers once analyses are adjusted for total physical activity. This suggests that sedentary behaviour may not have health effects independent of physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2063482551,"Although protein-misfolding-mediated neurodegenerative diseases have been linked to aging, how aging contributes to selective neurodegeneration remains unclear. We established spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17) knockin mice that inducibly express one copy of mutant TATA box binding protein (TBP) at different ages by tamoxifen-mediated Cre recombination. We find that more mutant TBP accumulates in older mouse and that this accumulation correlates with age-related decreases in Hsc70 and chaperone activity. Consistently, older SCA17 mice experienced earlier neurological symptom onset and more severe Purkinje cell degeneration. Mutant TBP shows decreased association with XBP1s, resulting in the reduced transcription of mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), which is enriched in Purkinje cells. Expression of Hsc70 improves the TBP-XBP1s interaction and MANF transcription, and overexpression of MANF ameliorates mutant TBP-mediated Purkinje cell degeneration via protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent signaling. These findings suggest that the age-related decline in chaperone activity affects polyglutamine protein function that is important for the viability of specific types of neurons."

In contrast, the Dm8 amacrine neurons form a wide dendritic field to receive ∼16 R7 photoreceptor inputs. R7- and R8-derived Activin selectively restricts the dendritic fields of their respective postsynaptic partners, Dm8 and Tm20, to the size appropriate for their functions. Canonical Activin signaling promotes dendritic termination without affecting dendritic routing direction or layer.

A plethora of CRISPR-Cas versions exist, with more than 40 different Cas protein families and several different molecular approaches to fight the invading DNA. One of the key players in the system is the CRISPR-derived RNA (crRNA), which directs the invader-degrading Cas protein complex to the invader. The CRISPR-Cas types I and III use the Cas6 protein to generate mature crRNAs. Here, we show that the Cas6 protein is necessary for crRNA production but that additional Cas proteins that form a CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense (Cascade)-like complex are needed for crRNA stability in the CRISPR-Cas type I-B system in Haloferax volcanii in vivo. Deletion of the cas6 gene results in the loss of mature crRNAs and interference. However, cells that have the complete cas gene cluster (cas1-8b) removed and are transformed with the cas6 gene are not able to produce and stably maintain mature crRNAs. crRNA production and stability is rescued only if cas5, -6, and -7 are present. Mutational analysis of the cas6 gene reveals three amino acids (His-41, Gly-256, and Gly-258) that are essential for pre-crRNA cleavage, whereas the mutation of two amino acids (Ser-115 and Ser-224) leads to an increase of crRNA amounts. This is the first systematic in vivo analysis of Cas6 protein variants.

Synaptically evoked Ca(2+) influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) activates spine SK channels, reducing EPSPs and the associated spine head Ca(2+) transient. However, results using glutamate uncaging implicated Ca(2+) influx through SNX-482-sensitive (SNX-sensitive) Cav2.3 (R-type) Ca(2+) channels as the Ca(2+) source for SK channel activation.

Canonical PCDs play an important role in amino acid hydroxylation, a reaction not associated with carbon fixation. We determined the crystal structure of an α-carboxysome PCD-like protein from the chemoautotrophic bacterium Thiomonas intermedia K12, at 1.3-Å resolution. The protein retains a three-dimensional fold similar to canonical PCDs, although the prominent active site cleft present in PCD enzymes is disrupted in the α-carboxysome PCD-like protein. Using a cell-based complementation assay, we tested the PCD-like proteins from T. intermedia and two additional bacteria, and found no evidence for PCD enzymatic activity. However, we discovered that heterologous co-expression of the PCD-like protein from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus with RuBisCO and GroELS in Escherichia coli increased the amount of soluble, assembled RuBisCO recovered from cell lysates compared with co-expression of RuBisCO with GroELS alone. We conclude that this conserved PCD-like protein, renamed here α-carboxysome RuBisCO assembly factor (or acRAF), is a novel RuBisCO chaperone integral to α-carboxysome function."

Furthermore, we studied whether this neuroplasticity contributed to spinal neuron sensitization and neuropathic pain states. CCI-ION caused orofacial hypersensitivity that correlated with Cavα2δ1 up-regulation in trigeminal ganglion neurons and Vc/C2. Blocking Cavα2δ1 with gabapentin, a ligand for the Cavα2δ1 proteins, or Cavα2δ1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides led to a reversal of orofacial hypersensitivity, supporting an important role of Cavα2δ1 in orofacial pain processing. Importantly, increased Cavα2δ1 in Vc/C2 superficial dorsal horn was associated with increased excitatory synaptogenesis and increased frequency, but not the amplitude, of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in dorsal horn neurons that could be blocked by gabapentin. Thus, CCI-ION-induced Cavα2δ1 up-regulation may contribute to orofacial neuropathic pain states through abnormal excitatory synapse formation and enhanced presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter release in Vc/C2.

In our study we show in a co-culture model of the undeveloped small intestine that members of Lactobacillus spp. influence STAT1 and NF-kB p65 nuclear translocation in both intestinal epithelial cells as well as underlying macrophages. Moreover, by using imaging flow cytometry we were able to monitor each individual cell and create a framework of the percentage of cells in which translocation occurred in challenged versus control cell populations. We also observed a significant difference in baseline translocation in intestinal cells when cultured alone versus those in a co-culture model, underpinning the importance of 3D models over monolayer set-ups in epithelial in vitro research. In conclusion, our work offers new insights into the potential routes by which the commensal microbiome primes the early immune system to fight pathogens, and shows how strain-specific these mechanisms really are."
https://openalex.org/W2016585809,"Trait anxiety is recognized as an individual risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders but the neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown. Here we test whether trait anxiety is associated with impaired fear inhibition utilizing the AX+/BX- conditional discrimination procedure that allows for the independent evaluation of startle fear potentiation and inhibition of fear [1]. Sixty undergraduate students participated in the study - High Trait Anxious: n = 28 and Low Trait Anxious: n = 32. We replicated earlier findings that a transfer of conditioned inhibition for startle responses requires contingency awareness. However, contrary to the fear inhibition hypothesis, our data suggest that high trait anxious individuals show a normal fear inhibition of conditioned startle responding. Only at the cognitive level the high trait anxious individuals showed evidence for impaired inhibitory learning of the threat cue. Together with other findings where impaired fear inhibition was only observed in those PTSD patients who were either high on hyperarousal symptoms [2] or with current anxiety symptoms [3], we question whether impaired fear inhibition is a biomarker for the development of anxiety disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1976290939,"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter-proximal pausing plays a critical role in postinitiation transcriptional regulation at many metazoan genes. We showed recently that histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16Ac), mediated by the MSL complex, facilitates the release of paused Pol II. In contrast, H4 lysine 20 trimethylation (H4K20me3), mediated by SUV420H2, enforces Pol II pausing by inhibiting MSL recruitment. However, how the balance between H4K16Ac and H4K20me3 is locally regulated remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PR-SET7/SETD8, which monomethylates histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me1), controls both H4K16Ac and H4K20me3 and in doing so, regulates Pol II pausing dynamics. We find that PR-SET7-mediated H4K20me1 is necessary for the recruitment of the MSL complex, subsequent H4K16Ac, and release of Pol II into active elongation. Although dispensable for SUV420H2 recruitment, PR-SET7-mediated H4K20me1 is required for H4K20me3. Although depletion of SUV420H2 is sufficient to deplete H4K20me3 and relieve an H4K20me3-induced pause, pausing is maintained in the absence of PR-SET7 despite H4K20me3 depletion because of an inability to recruit the MSL complex in the absence of H4K20me1. These findings highlight the requirement for PR-SET7 and H4K20me1 in establishing both the H4K16Ac and H4K20me3 marks and point to a dual role in the local regulation of Pol II pausing.

Interestingly, up-regulation or down-regulation of PKD1 or PKD2 leads to polycystic kidney disease in animal models, but their interrelations are not completely understood. We show here that full-length PC1 that interacts with PC2 via a C-terminal coiled-coil domain regulates PC2 expression in vivo and in vitro by down-regulating PC2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of the pathogenic mutant R4227X, which lacks the C-terminal coiled-coil domain, failed to down-regulate PC2 expression, suggesting that PC1-PC2 interaction is necessary for PC2 regulation. The proteasome and autophagy are two pathways that control protein degradation. Proteins that are not degraded by proteasomes precipitate in the cytoplasm and are transported via histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) toward the aggresomes. We found that HDAC6 binds to PC2 and that expression of full-length PC1 accelerates the transport of the HDAC6-PC2 complex toward aggresomes, whereas expression of the R4227X mutant fails to do so. Aggresomes are engulfed by autophagosomes, which then fuse with the lysosome for degradation; this process is also known as autophagy. We have now shown that PC1 overexpression leads to increased degradation of PC2 via autophagy. Interestingly, PC1 does not activate autophagy generally.

https://openalex.org/W2039382719,"Over 3,300 unscreened agricultural water diversion pipes line the levees and riverbanks of the Sacramento River (California) watershed, where the threatened Southern Distinct Population Segment of green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris, spawn. The number of sturgeon drawn into (entrained) and killed by these pipes is greatly unknown. We examined avoidance behaviors and entrainment susceptibility of juvenile green sturgeon (35±0.6 cm mean fork length) to entrainment in a large (>500-kl) outdoor flume with a 0.46-m-diameter water-diversion pipe. Fish entrainment was generally high (range: 26-61%), likely due to a lack of avoidance behavior prior to entering inescapable inflow conditions. We estimated that up to 52% of green sturgeon could be entrained after passing within 1.5 m of an active water-diversion pipe three times. These data suggest that green sturgeon are vulnerable to unscreened water-diversion pipes, and that additional research is needed to determine the potential impacts of entrainment mortality on declining sturgeon populations. Data under various hydraulic conditions also suggest that entrainment-related mortality could be decreased by extracting water at lower diversion rates over longer periods of time, balancing agricultural needs with green sturgeon conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2143241165,"The chymotrypsin subfamily A of serine proteases consists primarily of eukaryotic proteases, including only a few proteases of bacterial origin. VesB, a newly identified serine protease that is secreted by the type II secretion system in Vibrio cholerae, belongs to this subfamily. VesB is likely produced as a zymogen because sequence alignment with trypsinogen identified a putative cleavage site for activation and a catalytic triad, His-Asp-Ser. Using synthetic peptides, VesB efficiently cleaved a trypsin substrate, but not chymotrypsin and elastase substrates. The reversible serine protease inhibitor, benzamidine, inhibited VesB and served as an immobilized ligand for VesB affinity purification, further indicating its relationship with trypsin-like enzymes. Consistent with this family of serine proteases, N-terminal sequencing implied that the propeptide is removed in the secreted form of VesB. Separate mutagenesis of the activation site and catalytic serine rendered VesB inactive, confirming the importance of these features for activity, but not for secretion. Similar to trypsin but, in contrast to thrombin and other coagulation factors, Na(+) did not stimulate the activity of VesB, despite containing the Tyr(250) signature. The crystal structure of catalytically inactive pro-VesB revealed that the protease domain is structurally similar to trypsinogen. The C-terminal domain of VesB was found to adopt an immunoglobulin (Ig)-fold that is structurally homologous to Ig-folds of other extracellular Vibrio proteins. Possible roles of the Ig-fold domain in stability, substrate specificity, cell surface association, and type II secretion of VesB, the first bacterial multidomain trypsin-like protease with known structure, are discussed."

Bacteroides ovatus GT6a represents a GT6 clade found in more than 30 Gram-negative bacteria that is similar in sequence to the catalytic domains of mammalian GT6, but has an Asn(95)-Ala-Asn(97) (NXN) sequence substituted for the DXD motif and metal-independent catalytic activity. Co-crystals of a low activity mutant of BoGT6a (E192Q) with UDP-GalNAc contained protein complexes with intact UDP-GalNAc and two forms with hydrolysis products (UDP plus GalNAc) representing an initial closed complex and later open form primed for product release. Two cationic residues near the C terminus of BoGT6a, Lys(231) and Arg(243), interact with the diphosphate moiety of UDP-GalNAc, but only Lys(231) interacts with the UDP product and may function in leaving group stabilization. The amide group of Asn(95), the first Asn of the NXN motif, interacts with the ribose moiety of the substrate. This metal-independent GT6 resembles its metal-dependent homologs in undergoing conformational changes on binding UDP-GalNAc that arise from structuring the C terminus to cover this substrate. It appears that in the GT6 family, the metal cofactor functions specifically in binding the UDP moiety in the donor substrate and transition state, actions that can be efficiently performed by components of the polypeptide chain."

As RAR is important for neuronal differentiation, it is possible that RAR signaling could be beneficial for fibroblast-neuron transdifferentiation and could enhance the conversion efficiency. To validate this hypothesis, we overexpressed RARs or used RA agonists to explore the function of RARs in the conversion of fibroblasts to neurons. Because RARs belong to the family of nuclear receptors that are important for differentiation and neurogenesis (8Jacobs S. Lie D.C. DeCicco K.L. Shi Y. DeLuca L.M. Gage F.H. Evans R.M. Retinoic acid is required early during adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3902-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), it will be of interest to uncover other nuclear receptor members that could be used to enhance neuronal conversion. Recent studies showed that one important orphan nuclear receptor, Nr5a2, can enhance the reprogramming efficiency in the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (16Heng J.C. Feng B. Han J. Jiang J. Kraus P. Ng J.H. Orlov Y.L. Huss M. Yang L. Lufkin T. Lim B. Ng H.H.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 18283-18288Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored whether the nuclear receptors of Nr5a2 together with Rarg enable efficient conversion of fibroblasts to neurons. In this study we used non-integrating adenoviruses carrying a different combination of transcription factors of ABN (Ascl1, Brn2, Ngn2), Rarg, and Nr5a2 for the direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons. Here we show that overexpression of Rarg or Nr5a2 increases the fibroblast-to-neuron conversion efficiency. The combination of Rarg and Nr5a2 could not only significantly promote the conversion efficiency but also improve the neuronal pattern formation and physiological function of induced neuron (iN) cells both in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, the chemical compound agonists to Rarg and Nr5a2 work as effectively as the transcription factors. The strategy of using an adenoviral delivery system to obtain high iN cell conversion efficiency is promising and may be used as an improved tool for the application of iN cells in regenerative medicine. We used the Invitrogen Gateway Expression System to produce the adenovirus carrying the transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2, Ngn2, Rarg, and Nr5a2. The selected genes were amplified from a mouse cDNA library and inserted into the pEntr 3C vector (Invitrogen). According to the manufacturer's instructions, the resulting plasmids were generated by homologous L/R recombination. Then, viral constructs were transduced into a 293A cell line, and high titer (108-1010 IU/ml) viral particles were obtained through two rounds of amplification. The adenoviral titer was determined using the same method as that of the lentiviral titer, which takes advantage of 293T cells, except that the virus stock was diluted first because the high titer adenovirus could cause 293T cells to die quickly. Then, we used the adenovirus to infect mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) twice for 4 h per day at multiplicities of infection (number of viral particles per cell) of 10. Twenty-four hours post infection, half of the culture medium was changed into neural medium (Neural Basal/DMEM-F-12 1:1, 1×B-27, 5 ng/ml BDNF) every day for two successive days. Next, half of the medium was changed every 2 days until the cells were ready for immunostaining and electrophysiological experiments. Chemical compounds were freshly added in neural medium when culture medium was changed. We used E13.5 C57BL/6 mouse embryos to isolate primary MEFs, as described previously (1Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Pang Z.P. Kokubu Y. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). The head, vertebral column, dorsal root ganglia, and visceral organs were removed, and then the remaining tissues were dissected into small pieces and digested for 10 min in 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen). The dissociated cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biochrom), 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 2 mm Glutamax in a 37 °C, and 5% CO2 incubator. The cells became confluent in ∼2–3 days and were passaged in a 1:4 split. MEFs were used between passages 2 and 4. Tail-tip fibroblasts (TTFs) were isolated from 6-week-old C57BL/6 mouse tail tips. The superficial dermis was peeled away, and the remaining tail tip was minced into 1-mm pieces. Two pieces were put into one gelatin-coated culture well of a 6-well plate; then, 2 ml of fibroblast culture medium was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5–7 days. Fibroblasts were collected until they migrated out of the tails and became fused; they were then passaged as MEFs. Primary human embryonic fibroblasts (HEFs) isolated from the epidermal tissue of a 15-week-old fetus were obtained from Cell Resource Center, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. HEF were cultured until the fibroblasts became fused and digested by 0.25% trypsin and passaged in a 1:3 split in fibroblast medium. We counted the conversion efficiency by using the neuronal purity as the percentage of Tuj1 cells relative to the total final population (18Meng F. Chen S. Miao Q. Zhou K. Lao Q. Zhang X. Guo W. Jiao J. Induction of fibroblasts to neurons through adenoviral gene delivery.Cell Res. 2012; 22: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We randomly selected 8–10 visual fields for each well and calculated the total cell number visualized after DAPI staining and the total iN cell number indicated by Tuj1 staining. The efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of iN cells by the number of total cells in each visual field. We also calculated the neuronal yield as the percentage of Tuj1-positive cells relative to the initial population, as described previously (19Ladewig J. Mertens J. Kesavan J. Doerr J. Poppe D. Glaue F. Herms S. Wernet P. Kögler G. Müller F.J. Koch P. Brüstle O. Small molecules enable highly efficient neuronal conversion of human fibroblasts.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). iN cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature and blocked with 5% BSA, 4% donkey serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in antibody dilution solution (ADS, PBS with 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100) in the ratios specified below, and secondary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in ADS. iN cells were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and secondary antibodies were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-fibronectin (1:100, BOSTER), rabbit anti-S100A4 (fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1)) (1:100, Proteintech), mouse anti-GFAP (1:1000, Sigma), mouse anti-Nestin (1:200, Millipore), rabbit anti-Tuj1 (1:1000, Sigma), mouse anti-Map2a (1:500, Millipore), mouse anti-NeuN (1:300, Millipore), mouse anti-synapsin (1:500, Synaptic Systems), rabbit anti-vGLUT1 (1:1000, Synaptic Systems), mouse anti-GAD67 (1:1000, Millipore), rabbit anti-TH (1:1000, Millipore), and DAPI (1:1,000, Sigma). Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. Cy2-, Cy3-, and Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. iN cells were labeled with GFP by lentivirus infection, and ∼105 cells were transplanted into the cortices of P6–10 pups (C57BL/6 background, ice anesthetized) or the brain dentate gyrus area of 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice (anesthetized with 70 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium). The mice were perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde 1–4 weeks post-transplantation. The brains were dissected out and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight followed by dehydration in 0.1 m PBS containing 30% sucrose for 2 days at 4 °C. Consecutive coronal sections (30 μm) were sliced using a Leica SM 2000R Sliding Microtome and stored in tissue-collecting solution (25% glycerin, 25% ethylene glycol in 0.1 m PBS) at −20 °C until use. MEF-derived iN cells were placed on glass coverslips for electrophysiological detection 7–12 days post infection. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in either voltage- or current-clamp mode were conducted to measure the voltage-activated sodium/potassium currents or action potentials, which were recorded using an Axopatch 200B or MultiClamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices). The electric signals were filtered at 2–10 kHz, digitized at 20–100 kHz (Digidata 1322A; Molecular Devices), and further analyzed using pClamp version 9.2 software (Molecular Devices). The intracellular fluid contained 130 mm K+-gluconate, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EGTA, 4 mm Mg2ATP, 0.3 mm Na2GTP, and 10 mm sodium phosphocreatine (at pH 7.3, 310 mosmol), and the pipette ranged from 2.0 to 4.0 megaohms. The extracellular fluid consisted of 124 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose (at pH 7.4, 310 mosmol). The transmitter receptor blockers, tetrodotoxin (100 nm), AP5 ((2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, 50 μm), and CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; 10 μm), were used in the bath solution for the detection of action potentials and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. Mouse genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed using Gene chips HOA 5.1 (Phalanx Biotech Group, Inc.). Total RNA was extracted from MEFs and ABN+Rarg+Nr5a2-infected MEFs 12 days post infection and primary neurons from a hippocampus of postnatal day 0 C57BL/6 mouse (20Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells.2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar); the total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an Amino AllylMessageAmpTM II aRNA Amplification kit (Ambion). For gene expression profiling analysis, mouse whole genome OneArray microarray v2 (MOA-002) chips were used with 26,423 mouse genome probes and 872 experimental control probes. The Rosetta Resolver® System (Rosetta Biosoftware) was used to calculate the GeneChip Robust Multichip Average and normalize the datasets for single channel experiment analyses. Hierarchical clustering analysis was applied using a Euclidean distance matrix and the complete-linkage clustering method. Linear models and empirical Bayes methods were used to choose the differentially expressed genes that showed >2-fold changes and an adjusted p value less than 0.05. iN cells and wild-type neurons were cultured in neuron medium. MEFs were cultured in DMEM +10% FBS medium. All cells were washed with serum-free medium before collection. TRIzol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Six hundred ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed and then quantified using SYBR Green (Tiangen), and β-actin was used as the reference. Primers were: NCAM1, ATCCATTGACCGGGTGGAAC (forward (F)), CGACTTCCACTCAGCCTTGT (reverse (R)); NCAM2, TCTCTTGGTTCAGGAACGGC (F), AGACATAAGAGCCCCCGTCT (R); Tubb3, GGGCGCATGTCTATGAAGGA (F), TCACACACGGCTACCTTGAC (R); microtubule-associated protein 2a, AACCAATTCGCAGAGCAGGA (F), GGGAGTTCCAGGGGTGATTG (R); doublecortin, TCAGGTAACGACCAAGACGC (F), CAGACTTCCAGGGCTTGTGG (F); NeuroD1, CAGCTCAACCCTCGGACTTT (F), GGGGACTGGTAGGAGTAGGG (R); NeuroD2, GTCCAAGATCGAGACCCTGC (F), TGCACAGAGTCTGCACGTAG (R); Zic1, GGACACACACAGGGGAGAAG (F), AAAGGTAGGGCTTGTCGCTC (R); Brn4, CAGGGAGTTCCCAGCAATGG (F), CAGTTGCAGATCTTCGCGTC (R); Myt1l, AGCCATGTCAAAAAGCCATACT (F), TATCTTTGTGCGGGCATCCA (R); NeuN, GGCATGACCCTCTACACACC (F), TGTCTGTCTGTGCTGCTTCA (R); endo Nr5a2, ATCAGCAAGCAGGCAGAAGA (F), CTAGAGCAAGCTTCCAGGGG (R); β-actin, GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG (F), CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT (R). Genomic DNAs were purified from the adenovirus-infected MEFs and uninfected MEFs at 13–15 days post infection using the TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (Tiangen). The templates were 50 ng of genomic DNA and 1 pg of vector for PCR. The following PCR protocol was set up as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, 30 repetitions of cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s or 120s, and finally 72 °C for 5 min. The forward primer was designed to recognize the pAD vector site, and the reverse primers were designed to recognize the DNA expression cassettes of Ascl1, Brn2, Ngn2, Rarg, and Nr5a2: pAD-F, TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGA; Ascl1-R, ATAGAGTTCAAGTCGTTGGAGTAGT; Brn2-R, GTTGCTGTTGCTGTTGATGCT; Ngn2-R, CTTCGTGAGCTTGGCATCCT; Rarg-R, TCAGGGCCCCTGGTCAGGTT; Nr5a2-R, TTAGGCTCTTTTGGCATGCAGC; GAPDH-F, ATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGA; GAPDH-R, TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGG. At 3 days post infection, cells of each group were dissociated into single cell suspensions for flow cytometry to analyze infection efficiency based on the ratio of GFP-positive cells. At 7 days post infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Tuj1 primary antibody and Cy5 secondary antibody to analyze neuronal conversion efficiency. Stained cells were analyzed by FACS Caliber apparatus (BD Biosciences) with FlowJo software (Tomy Digital Biology). The data were illustrated as the percentage of total analyzed cells, which is the number of cells in each bin divided by the number of cells in the bin that contains the largest number of cells. Statistical analysis was evaluated by two-tailed Student's t tests. Values were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***). Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. or ± S.E. in different experiments, and all were described in the figure legends. MEFs were separated from E13.5 embryos and cultured as initial cells for neuronal conversion. MEFs showed classical fibroblasts morphology and were positive for fibroblast markers including fibronectin and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1, also called S100A4). No preexisting neurons, astrocytes, or neural progenitor cells were detected in the culture of the MEFs, as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry with specific markers such as Tuj1, NeuN, GFAP, and Nestin (data not shown). The mouse cDNAs of Ascl1, Brn2, Ngn2, Rarg, and Nr5a2 were carried by a modified commercial adenoviral vector (Invitrogen, pAd/CMV/V5-DEST) under the cytomegalovirus promoter. The MEFs were infected once a day for two consecutive days (Fig. 1A) with several groups of adenoviruses carrying the genes for GFP, ABN, ABN+Rarg, ABN+Nr5a2, and ABN+Rarg+Nr5a2 (Fig. 1, B–G). We counted the conversion efficiency by calculating the neuronal purity as the percentage of Tuj1 cells relative to the final population 7 days post infection. We also calculated the neuronal yield as the percentage of Tuj1-positive cells relative to the initial population, as described under “Experimental Procedures” and previously used by another laboratory (1Vierbuchen T. Ostermeier A. Pang Z.P. Kokubu Y. Südhof T.C. Wernig M. Direct conversion of fibroblasts to functional neurons by defined factors.Nature. 2010; 463: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Because RA signaling through the RA receptor is necessary for neurogenesis and neural development, we applied Rarg into the three-factor combination of ABN. Three days post infection, the infected MEFs appeared to show neuronal morphology with thin processes due to the addition of Rarg into ABN. Seven days later, more mature neuronal cells with Tuj1-positive staining were clearly detected, and the neuronal purity ratio became 10.83 ± 2.67% (Fig. 1, B and C). Considering the important role of RA signaling, we subsequently studied whether RA could enhance the conversion. The results showed RA could intensively promote iN cell conversion when it was added to the culture medium, and we found that all-trans-RA at a concentration of 0.5 μm had the highest effect. Thus, neural medium used in the afterward experiments was all supplemented with all-trans-RA. Recently, microRNAs were shown to be involved in the conversion of fibroblasts to neurons (21Yoo A.S. Sun A.X. Li L. Shcheglovitov A. Portmann T. Li Y. Lee-Messer C. Dolmetsch R.E. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R.

Ding S. Direct reprogramming of adult human fibroblasts to functional neurons under defined conditions.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 113-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Other nuclear receptors, such as Nr5a2, also participate in cell reprogramming (16Heng J.C. Feng B. Han J. Jiang J. Kraus P. Ng J.H. Orlov Y.L. Huss M. Yang L. Lufkin T. Lim B. Ng H.H.

Yang J. Liu H. Lu D. Chen X. Zenonos Z. Campos L.S. Rad R. Guo G. Zhang S. Bradley A. Liu P. Rapid and efficient reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells by retinoic acid receptor γ and liver receptor homolog 1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 18283-18288Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed studies to investigate whether these factors enhance the conversion in our system. After extensive screening, Nr5a2 was identified to be a good candidate to significantly enhance the conversion efficiency. The synergistic addition of Rarg and Nr5a2 with ABN greatly boosted the neuronal purity efficiency to 44.33 ± 4.25% and increased the neuronal yields to 131.48 ± 16.38% (Fig. 1H), showing a >10-fold enhancement compared with ABN alone (Fig. 1, D and E). The synergistic contribution of Rarg and Nr5a2 suggests that they could activate different signaling pathways to enhance the direct conversion of fibroblasts to neurons. To check whether adenoviral integration occurred in the genome in this experiment, PCR analysis was performed using genomic DNA from uninfected MEFs, MEFs infected with control-GFP, and MEFs infected with the ABN+Rarg+Nr5a2 combination. No predicted PCR-amplified band was observed in any of the samples except in the positive control lane. GAPDH was simultaneously amplified as an internal control (data not shown). We observed that the ABN+Rarg+Nr5a2 iN cells showed extremely abundant nerve neurites and synaptic connections at a very early stage (3–4 days post infection). To further analyze the fast and efficient effect of Rarg and Nr5a2, we stained cells with a marker for relatively mature neurons, Map2a, to trace the appearance of neuronal cells over time. ABN+Rarg+Nr5a2 only required 3 days to obtain Map2a-positive neuronal cells, and this conversion period was shortened 2-fold relative to ABN alone (Fig. 1I). Chemical approaches to manipulate biological systems have been proven to be powerful tools for studying reprogramming (23Li W. Jiang K. Wei W. Shi Y. Ding S. Chemical approaches to studying stem cell biology.Cell Res. 2013; 23: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is advantageous to identify chemical compounds to replace transcription factors for converting fibroblasts to neurons. In this study, CD437 (6-[3–1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid), a specific Rarg agonist (24Gianni M. Zanotta S. Terao M. Garattini S. Garattini E. Effects of synthetic retinoids and retinoic acid isomers on the expression of alkaline phosphatase in F9 teratocarcinoma cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and DLPC (1,2-dilauroylglycero-3-phosphocholine), an Nr5a2 agonist (25Lee J.M. Lee Y.K. Mamrosh J.L. Busby S.A. Griffin P.R. Pathak M.C. Ortlund E.A. Moore D.D. A nuclear-receptor-dependent phosphatidylcholine pathway with antidiabetic effects.Nature. 2011; 474: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), were chosen to investigate whether these small molecules could substitute or partially substitute the corresponding transcription factors. We not only found that MEF expressed Nr5a2 but also detected DLPC increased endogenous Nr5a2 expression in our transdifferentiation system (data not shown). Applying the specific RA agonist CD437 to Rarg could enhance the conversion from MEFs and had a consistent effect as that of Rarg. Moreover, the combination of the DLPC and CD437 increased the conversion efficiency by ∼2-fold (Fig. 1, F and G). The conversion efficiency was also greatly enhanced when both the Rarg agonist CD437 and the Nr5a2 agonist DLPC were applied to the culture medium, and the result was quite favorable (Fig. 1, F and G). The effect of the agonists was dose-dependent on an effective concentration of CD437 at 0.1 μm and DLPC at 2 μm. The two chemical compound agonists synergistically functioned together to drive the neuronal purity efficiency to 37.83 ± 4.17 and the neuronal yields to 127.82 ± 21.64%; these values did not significantly differ from those for the transcription factors (Fig. 1, F and H). To analyze the infection efficiency and conversion efficiency more accurately, we used flow cytometry to analyze the efficiencies. At 3 days post infection, the GFP-positive cell ratio of the three groups of ABN, ABN+CD437+DLPC, and ABN+Rarg+Nr5a2 was similar, which was among the range of 77.9–85.1%. At 7 days post infection, the ratio of Tuj1-positive cells in relative to total cells was calculated as conversion efficiency. The efficiencies were 1.94% for ABN, 40.8% for ABN+CD437+DLPC, and 46.2% for ABN+Rarg+Nr5a2 (data not shown). The iN cell conversion from MEFs by the chemical compound agonists was consistent with that by the transcription factor"

The aim of our study was to investigate whether the routinely administered ALL chemotherapeutic agents would be able to bind and inhibit the key deregulated cell cycle proteins such as - Cyclins E1, D1, D3, A1 and Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDK) 2 and 6. We used Schrödinger Glide docking protocol to dock the chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxorubicin and Daunorubicin and others which are not very common including Clofarabine, Nelarabine and Flavopiridol, to the crystal structures of these proteins. We observed that the drugs were able to bind and interact with cyclins E1 and A1 and CDKs 2 and 6 while their docking to cyclins D1 and D3 were not successful. This binding proved favorable to interact with the G1/S cell cycle phase proteins that were examined in this study and may lead to the interruption of the growth of leukemic cells. Our observations therefore suggest that these drugs could be explored for use as inhibitors for these cell cycle proteins. Further, we have also highlighted residues which could be important in the designing of pharmacophores against these cell cycle proteins. This is the first report in understanding the mechanism of action of the drugs targeting these cell cycle proteins in leukemia through the visualization of drug-target binding and molecular docking using computational methods."

Fut7 expression is not detected in normal non-malignant epithelial or mesenchymal cells or tissues. The restricted expression of Fut7 to cell types that express glycan ligands for one or more selectins and the absence in Fut7 null mice of any phenotypes unrelated to defects in selectin ligand expression strongly suggests that this enzyme is specialized for selectin ligand formation. Despite the critical importance of FucT-VII, little is known regarding transcriptional regulation of Fut7. In murine CD4+ T cells, T-bet expression is essential for maximal, IL-12-driven expression of Fut7 (22Underhill G.H. Zisoulis D.G. Kolli K.P. Ellies L.G. Marth J.D. Kansas G.S. A crucial role for T-bet in selectin ligand expression in T helper 1 (Th1) cells.Blood. 2005; 106: 3867-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Experiments in Jurkat T cells indicated that Fut7 promoter activity is positively regulated by a complex of T-bet, Sp1, and p300 (23Chen G.Y. Osada H. Santamaria-Babi L.F. Kannagi R. Interaction of GATA-3/T-bet transcription factors regulates expression of sialyl Lewis X homing receptors on Th1/Th2 lymphocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16894-16899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fut7 is also transcriptionally induced by the HTLV-1 tax protein (24Hiraiwa N. Hiraiwa M. Kannagi R. Human T cell leukemia virus-1 encoded tax protein transactivates α1,3-fucosyltransferase FucT-VII, which synthesizes sialyl Lewis X, a selectin ligand expressed on adult T cell leukemia cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 231: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) via a mechanism involving CREB (cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding protein)/ATF proteins, possibly CREB1 and/or CREMα, binding with tax and CBP (CREB-binding protein) to a CRE element, which is close to the T-bet and Sp1 binding sites (23Chen G.Y.

Transactivation of the fucosyltransferase VII gene by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax through a variant cAMP-responsive element.Blood. 2003; 101: 3615-3621Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gata3, whose expression is driven by IL-4, repressed Fut7 promoter activity via recruitment of HDACs and interference with T-bet binding (23Chen G.Y. Osada H. Santamaria-Babi L.F. Kannagi R. Interaction of GATA-3/T-bet transcription factors regulates expression of sialyl Lewis X homing receptors on Th1/Th2 lymphocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16894-16899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which may account for the ability of IL-4 to inhibit Fut7 expression (26Wagers A.J. Waters C.M. Stoolman L.M. Kansas G.S. IL-12 and IL-4 control T cell adhesion to endothelial selectins through opposite effects on FucT-VII gene expression.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2225-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the activities of these transcription factors cannot fully explain the pattern of expression of Fut7 even in T cells, and no transcription factors that control Fut7 expression in myeloid cells or in HEC have been identified. Moreover, no cis-acting genetic elements that govern Fut7 expression, apart from the promoter, have been characterized. A detailed understanding of transcriptional mechanisms that govern Fut7 expression requires, among other things, comprehensive identification of cis-acting elements that are responsible for expression or repression of Fut7 in different cell types. The most stringent and definitive test to determine if all essential cis-acting regulatory regions of a gene are contained within a given sequence of genomic DNA is the ability of that DNA, in the form of a transgene (Tg), to restore physiologically accurate expression and appropriate function in mice which harbor homozygous null mutations in the endogenous gene of interest. Therefore, a transgenic, gain-of-function, genetic complementation approach in mice was used to define the functional boundaries of the murine Fut7 locus. The results show that a remarkably small contiguous genomic interval contains all genetic information essential for the correct physiologic pattern of expression of Fut7. C57BL6/J WT mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and maintained and bred in a barrier facility at Northwestern University according to standard protocols. Mice with homozygous null mutations in Fut7 (16Malý P. Thall A. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X.

Tg mice were produced using standard approaches by microinjecting SN1 Tg DNA (described below) into Fut7 null fertilized eggs. This approach maintains the isogenic strain background and obviated any need for intercrossing SN1 Tg+ mice with Fut7 null mice. Founder pups were identified by PCR using three different primer pairs. The first pair (fut7 Ben primers) is contained completely within the single large exon encoding the catalytic domain (see Fig. 1), which is largely absent in the fut7 null allele (16Malý P. Thall A. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B.

The second primer pair (SN1 primers) is unique to the Tg as a result of non-genomic plasmid sequence contained within the sense primer, with the antisense primer within the Fut7 locus; this primer pair gives a band of 434 bp only from Tg+ mice but not WT or Fut7 null mice. The third primer pair (neo primers) is completely within the neo cassette originally used to disrupt the Fut7 locus to produce Fut7 null mice (16Malý P. Thall A. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L.

All primer sequences for this entire study are given in Table 1, and their locations (for those that amplify Fut7 sequences) are depicted in Fig. 1. Tg+ founders, which by definition are homozygous for the endogenous Fut7 null allele (because they were produced with fut7 null eggs), were mated with (non-Tg) Fut7 null mice, and Tg+ pups were identified as above. Mice derived from two independently derived founders, designated SN1.1 and SN1.2, were produced and analyzed in this study.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used in this studyNumberaNumbers are used in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab The BAC clone RP23–273F21, which contains ∼197 kb of genomic DNA from mouse chromosome 2 with the Fut7 locus approximately centered, was obtained from Invitrogen. A ∼12.7-kb SpeI/NotI fragment (see Fig. 1) containing virtually all genomic sequence between the nearest upstream (Npdc1) and downstream (Abca2) loci was subcloned into the SpeI/NotI sites of pBS/SK (Promega, Madison, WI). The insert, designated SN1, was excised with ClaI and SacII, gel-purified, and used for microinjection into Fut7 null fertilized eggs. Expression of E- and P-selectin ligands was quantitated using supernatants of COS cells transfected with expression plasmids expressing E-selectin/IgM and P-selectin/IgM fusion proteins (16Malý P.

FITC- or phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-Gr1 or CD4 were obtained from eBioscience. Data were gathered on a FACSCalibur or FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by FloJo software. Approximately 50 μl of blood was collected from the tail vein in EDTA-coated tubes and analyzed on a Hemavet 950 (Drew Scientific, Oxford, CT) complete blood counter. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 4% thioglycollate in PBS. After 4 h, mice were sacrificed, and cells were collected from the peritoneum by thorough lavage after injection of ∼10 ml of PBS/EDTA and counted. In all cases, recovered cells consisted of ∼90% neutrophils, as assessed by flow cytometry. DNA from tail snips for four mice of each genotype was analyzed by SYBR Green qPCR according to the manufacturer's instructions using a Bio-Rad iQ5 thermal cycler and two different oligonucleotide pairs within the catalytic domain of Fut7. Oligonucleotides for pgk2 were used as the normalization controls. Gene copy number was calculated by the standard 2−ΔΔCt method. Results were normalized by first standardizing the quantified PCR product from fut7-specific primers to that of the pgk2 gene for each individual mouse, deriving a mean ± S.D. for each genotype and primer and then normalizing the mean of each group for each primer pair to WT mice = 2. Results are reported as means ± S.D. for each primer set and each genotype. Total RNA was isolated from various cells and tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 ºC, precipitated, and reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen). Equal volumes of cDNA were then amplified using SYBR Green qPCR as above for genomic DNA. Oligonucleotides for Hprt were used to assess RNA and cDNA integrity and as normalization controls. Normalized fold values were calculated as above and were expressed relative to the mean for WT (for neutrophils) or WT without IL-12 or TGFβ1 (for activated CD4 cells). RNA and cDNA from various tissues were prepared as above, and conventional end point PCR was carried out using standard conditions and primers for Fut7 and Hprt and cycle numbers that gave robust bands for the positive controls. The entire PCR reaction was run on standard 1% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleens of mice by positive selection using CD4 magnetic beads and columns (Miltenyi). T cells were activated by plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 (eBioscience) for ∼40 h either with no added cytokine or with 10 ng/ml IL-12 (Peprotech) or 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 (R&D) and subsequently cultured with 20 ng/ml IL-2 (BIOSOURCE) either alone or with IL-12 or TGFβ1 as described previously by us (19White S.J.

Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at the indicated time points. Mice were infected with the ME49 strain of Toxoplasma gondii, and brain lysates were prepared 3 weeks later as described (27Zhu J.

Med. 2007; 204: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Brain lysates containing ∼20 T. gondii cysts were injected intraperitoneally, and mice were sacrificed 7 days later. Splenic CD4+ T cells were analyzed for expression of CD44 and E- and P-selectin ligands, and the fraction of activated (CD44-hi) cells that expressed E- and P-selectin ligands was determined. Total peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were harvested and counted and analyzed by FACS for CD4, and the total number of CD4 cells harvested from the peritoneum was calculated. Spleen cells were isolated from WT mice, labeled with 1 μm CMFDA, and washed, and 2 × 107 cells were injected intravenously into recipients. After 1 h, spleens and inguinal, brachial, and axillary LNs were harvested, and single cell suspensions were prepared and analyzed by flow cytometry. For all LNs, the entire cell sample of individual LNs was analyzed. Results are expressed as % of total cells, which are CMFDA+. Brachial lymph nodes were frozen in OCT (Tissue-Tek), and 10-μm sections were cut in a Leica cryostat. The sections on SuperFrost Plus slides (Thermo Fisher) were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold acetone, air-dried for 1 h, and incubated with Block (3% BSA in Dulbecco's CMF-PBS with 5% normal goat serum (Sigma)) for 10 min. The Block was removed, and either 5 μg/ml recombinant mouse L-selectin/human IgG chimera (R&D Systems) ± 10 mm EDTA in Block or 1 μg/ml of MECA-79 (BioLegend) or rat IgM isotype control (eBioscience) in Block was applied to the sections for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in CMF, 1.5 μg/ml Cy3-conjugated goat anti-human IgG or 2 μg/ml biotinylated goat anti-rat IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in Block was added and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The sections stained with the biotinylated secondary were washed in CMF, and 1.7 μg/ml Cy2-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in Block was added for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, all sections were washed in CMF, lightly counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma), and coverslipped with Fluoro-Gel (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Pictures were obtained with a Zeiss Axiocam attached to a Nikon Optiphot using a Fluor 20× objective. The exposure time for bright field was 3 ms, for Cy2 was 800 ms, and for Cy3 was 5000 ms. Analysis of evolutionary conservation of Fut7 and surrounding loci were performed using the Vista Browser (available at genome.lbl.gov). All statistical analyses were carried out using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test within the Prizm program. p values for pairwise comparisons are given in the figure legends. A 12.7-kb contiguous genomic segment flanked by locally unique SpeI and NotI restriction sites, encompassing nucleotides 25,271,404–25,284,140 (from the Vista Browser, mouse July 2007 build) on mouse chromosome 2, was subcloned into pBS from the BAC clone RP23-273F21. This DNA segment, which we have designated SN1, encompasses the entire transcriptional unit, including the major transcriptional start site, transcriptional termination site, and polyadenylation site along with ∼7.4 kb of upstream sequence and ∼2 kb of downstream sequence (Fig. 1) and represents essentially all of the sequence between the immediate upstream (Npdc1) and downstream (Abca2) genes. This genomic segment also contains a number of conserved noncoding sequences both upstream and downstream of the transcriptional unit (Fig. 1), suggesting their possible involvement in gene regulation. The SN1 DNA was used as a Tg for pronuclear injection into fertilized eggs from Fut7 null mice. One founder was identified among pups born from each of two independent microinjections, and these two founder lines were designated SN1.1 and SN1.2. For both lines, ∼50% of both male and female progeny were Tg+, indicating normal Mendelian inheritance. Analysis of Tg copy number using qPCR with two independent primer sets within the single large exon, which encodes the glycosyltransferase domain, revealed that SN1.1 mice harbored ∼3-fold higher"
