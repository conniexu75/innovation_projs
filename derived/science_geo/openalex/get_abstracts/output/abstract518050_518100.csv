https://openalex.org/W2058487877,"More reliable and faster prediction methods are needed to interpret enormous amounts of data generated by sequencing and genome projects. We have developed a new computational tool, PON-P2, for classification of amino acid substitutions in human proteins. The method is a machine learning-based classifier and groups the variants into pathogenic, neutral and unknown classes, on the basis of random forest probability score. PON-P2 is trained using pathogenic and neutral variants obtained from VariBench, a database for benchmark variation datasets. PON-P2 utilizes information about evolutionary conservation of sequences, physical and biochemical properties of amino acids, GO annotations and if available, functional annotations of variation sites. Extensive feature selection was performed to identify 8 informative features among altogether 622 features. PON-P2 consistently showed superior performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art tools. In 10-fold cross-validation test, its accuracy and MCC are 0.90 and 0.80, respectively, and in the independent test, they are 0.86 and 0.71, respectively. The coverage of PON-P2 is 61.7% in the 10-fold cross-validation and 62.1% in the test dataset. PON-P2 is a powerful tool for screening harmful variants and for ranking and prioritizing experimental characterization. It is very fast making it capable of analyzing large variant datasets. PON-P2 is freely available at http://structure.bmc.lu.se/PON-P2/."
https://openalex.org/W2032234683,"Studies have identified high rates and severe consequences of Internet Addiction/Pathological Internet Use (IA/PIU) in university students. However, most research concerning IA/PIU in U.S. university students has been conducted within a quantitative research paradigm, and frequently fails to contextualize the problem of IA/PIU. To address this gap, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study using the focus group approach and examined 27 U.S. university students who self-identified as intensive Internet users, spent more than 25 hours/week on the Internet for non-school or non-work-related activities and who reported Internet-associated health and/or psychosocial problems. Students completed two IA/PIU measures (Young’s Diagnostic Questionnaire and the Compulsive Internet Use Scale) and participated in focus groups exploring the natural history of their Internet use; preferred online activities; emotional, interpersonal, and situational triggers for intensive Internet use; and health and/or psychosocial consequences of their Internet overuse. Students’ self-reports of Internet overuse problems were consistent with results of standardized measures. Students first accessed the Internet at an average age of 9 (SD = 2.7), and first had a problem with Internet overuse at an average age of 16 (SD = 4.3). Sadness and depression, boredom, and stress were common triggers of intensive Internet use. Social media use was nearly universal and pervasive in participants’ lives. Sleep deprivation, academic under-achievement, failure to exercise and to engage in face-to-face social activities, negative affective states, and decreased ability to concentrate were frequently reported consequences of intensive Internet use/Internet overuse. IA/PIU may be an underappreciated problem among U.S. university students and warrants additional research."
https://openalex.org/W1995675654,"The aging process is perceived as resulting from a combination of intrinsic factors such as changes in intracellular signaling and extrinsic factors, most notably environmental stressors. In skin, the relationship between intrinsic changes and keratinocyte function is not clearly understood. Previously, we found that increasing the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) suppressed senescence in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-treated human primary keratinocytes, a model of oxidative stress-induced cellular aging. Using this model in the present study, we observed that resveratrol, an agent that increases the activities of both AMPK and sirtuins, ameliorated two age-associated phenotypes: cellular senescence and proliferative dysfunction. In addition, we found that treatment of keratinocytes with Ex527, a specific inhibitor of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), attenuated the ability of resveratrol to suppress senescence. In keeping with the latter observation, we noted that compared to non-senescent keratinocytes, senescent cells lacked SIRT1. In addition to these effects on H2O2-induced senescence, resveratrol also prevented the H2O2-induced decrease in proliferation (as indicated by 3H-thymidine incorporation) in the presence of insulin. This effect was abrogated by inhibition of AMPK but not SIRT1. Compared to endothelium, we found that human keratinocytes expressed relatively high levels of Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), a downstream target of both AMPK and SIRT1. Treatment of keratinocytes with resveratrol transactivated FOXO3 and increased the expression of its target genes including catalase. Resveratrol’s effects on both senescence and proliferation disappeared when FOXO3 was knocked down. Finally, we performed an exploratory study which showed that skin from humans over 50 years old had lower AMPK activity than skin from individuals under age 20. Collectively, these findings suggest that the effects of resveratrol on keratinocyte senescence and proliferation are regulated by the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway and in some situations, but not all, by SIRT1."
https://openalex.org/W2097420715,"Air temperatures in the tropical Andes have risen at an accelerated rate relative to the global average over recent decades. However, the effects of climate change on Andean lakes, which are vital to sustaining regional biodiversity and serve as an important water resource to local populations, remain largely unknown. Here, we show that recent climate changes have forced alpine lakes of the equatorial Andes towards new ecological and physical states, in close synchrony to the rapid shrinkage of glaciers regionally. Using dated sediment cores from three lakes in the southern Sierra of Ecuador, we record abrupt increases in the planktonic thalassiosiroid diatom Discostella stelligera from trace abundances to dominance within the phytoplankton. This unprecedented shift occurs against the backdrop of rising temperatures, changing atmospheric pressure fields, and declining wind speeds. Ecological restructuring in these lakes is linked to warming and/or enhanced water column stratification. In contrast to seasonally ice-covered Arctic and temperate alpine counterparts, aquatic production has not increased universally with warming, and has even declined in some lakes, possibly because enhanced thermal stability impedes the re-circulation of hypolimnetic nutrients to surface waters. Our results demonstrate that these lakes have already passed important ecological thresholds, with potentially far-reaching consequences for Andean water resources."
https://openalex.org/W2020410797,"A new and inexpensive lignocellulose/montmorillonite (LNC/MMT) nanocomposite was prepared by a chemical intercalation of LNC into MMT and was subsequently investigated as an adsorbent in batch systems for the adsorption-desorption of Ni(II) ions in an aqueous solution. The optimum conditions for the Ni(II) ion adsorption capacity of the LNC/MMT nanocomposite were studied in detail by varying parameters such as the initial Ni(II) concentration, the solution pH value, the adsorption temperature and time. The results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity of Ni(II) reached 94.86 mg/g at an initial Ni(II) concentration of 0.0032 mol/L, a solution pH of 6.8, an adsorption temperature of 70°C, and adsorption time of 40 min. The represented adsorption kinetics model exhibited good agreement between the experimental data and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Langmuir isotherm equation best fit the experimental data. The structure of the LNC/MMT nanocomposite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), whereas the adsorption mechanism was discussed in combination with the results obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses (FTIR). The desorption capacity of the LNC/MMT nanocomposite depended on parameters such as HNO3 concentration, desorption temperature, and desorption time. The satisfactory desorption capacity of 81.34 mg/g was obtained at a HNO3 concentration, desorption temperature, and desorption time of 0.2 mol/L, 60 ºC, and 30 min, respectively. The regeneration studies showed that the adsorption capacity of the LNC/MMT nanocomposite was consistent for five cycles without any appreciable loss in the batch process and confirmed that the LNC/MMT nanocomposite was reusable. The overall study revealed that the LNC/MMT nanocomposite functioned as an effective adsorbent in the detoxification of Ni(II)-contaminated wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W2062767398,"Expressions of ABA biosynthesis genes and catabolism genes are generally co-regulated in plant development and responses to environmental stress. Up-regulation of OsNCED3 gene, a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, has been suggested as a way to enhance plant drought resistance but little is known for the role of ABA catabolic genes during drought stress. In this study, we found that OsABA8ox3 was the most highly expressed gene of the OsABA8ox family in rice leaves. Expression of OsABA8ox3 was promptly induced by rehydration after PEG-mimic dehydration, a tendency opposite to the changes of ABA level. We therefore constructed rice OsABA8ox3 silencing (RNA interference, RNAi) and overexpression plants. There were no obvious phenotype differences between the transgenic seedlings and wild type under normal condition. However, OsABA8ox3 RNAi lines showed significant improvement in drought stress tolerance while the overexpression seedlings were hypersensitive to drought stress when compared with wild type in terms of plant survival rates after 10 days of unwatering. Enzyme activity analysis indicated that OsABA8ox3 RNAi plants had higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities and less malondialdehyde (MDA) content than those of wild type when the plants were exposed to dehydration treatment, indicating a better anti-oxidative stress capability and less membrane damage. DNA microarray and real-time PCR analysis under dehydration treatment revealed that expressions of a group of stress/drought-related genes, i.e. LEA genes, were enhanced with higher transcript levels in OsABA8ox3 RNAi transgenic seedlings. We therefore conclude that that OsABA8ox3 gene plays an important role in controlling ABA level and drought stress resistance in rice."
https://openalex.org/W1971560980,"Objective Elevated dynamic plantar foot pressures significantly increase the risk of foot ulceration in diabetes mellitus. The aim was to determine which factors predict plantar pressures in a population of diabetic patients who are at high-risk of foot ulceration. Methods Patients with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy and a history of ulceration were eligible for inclusion in this cross sectional study. Demographic data, foot structure and function, and disease-related factors were recorded and used as potential predictor variables in the analyses. Barefoot peak pressures during walking were calculated for the heel, midfoot, forefoot, lesser toes, and hallux regions. Potential predictors were investigated using multivariate linear regression analyses. 167 participants with mean age of 63 years contributed 329 feet to the analyses. Results The regression models were able to predict between 6% (heel) and 41% (midfoot) of the variation in peak plantar pressures. The largest contributing factor in the heel model was glycosylated haemoglobin concentration, in the midfoot Charcot deformity, in the forefoot prominent metatarsal heads, in the lesser toes hammer toe deformity and in the hallux previous ulceration. Variables with local effects (e.g. foot deformity) were stronger predictors of plantar pressure than global features (e.g. body mass, age, gender, or diabetes duration). Conclusion The presence of local deformity was the largest contributing factor to barefoot dynamic plantar pressure in high-risk diabetic patients and should therefore be adequately managed to reduce plantar pressure and ulcer risk. However, a significant amount of variance is unexplained by the models, which advocates the quantitative measurement of plantar pressures in the clinical risk assessment of the patient."

Volatile compound screening of a fungal endophyte collection revealed a number of isolates in the family Xylariaceae, producing a series of terpene molecules, including 1,8-cineole. This compound is a commercially important component of eucalyptus oil used in pharmaceutical applications and has been explored as a potential biofuel additive. The genes that produce terpene molecules, such as 1,8-cineole, have been little explored in fungi, providing an opportunity to explore the biosynthetic origin of these compounds. Through genome sequencing of cineole-producing isolate E7406B, we were able to identify 11 new terpene synthase genes. Expressing a subset of these genes in Escherichia coli allowed identification of the hyp3 gene, responsible for 1,8-cineole biosynthesis, the first monoterpene synthase discovered in fungi. In a striking example of convergent evolution, mutational analysis of this terpene synthase revealed an active site asparagine critical for water capture and specificity during cineole synthesis, the same mechanism used in an unrelated plant homologue. These studies have provided insight into the evolutionary relationship of fungal terpene synthases to those in plants and bacteria and further established fungi as a relatively untapped source of this important and diverse class of compounds.

https://openalex.org/W2055677394,"Drug abuse is a major comorbidity of HIV infection and cognitive disorders are often more severe in the drug abusing HIV infected population. CD14+CD16+ monocytes, a mature subpopulation of peripheral blood monocytes, are key mediators of HIV neuropathogenesis. Infected CD14+CD16+ monocyte transmigration across the blood brain barrier mediates HIV entry into the brain and establishes a viral reservoir within the CNS. Despite successful antiretroviral therapy, continued influx of CD14+CD16+ monocytes, both infected and uninfected, contributes to chronic neuroinflammation and the development of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Drug abuse increases extracellular dopamine in the CNS. Once in the brain, CD14+CD16+ monocytes can be exposed to extracellular dopamine due to drug abuse. The direct effects of dopamine on CD14+CD16+ monocytes and their contribution to HIV neuropathogenesis are not known. In this study, we showed that CD14+CD16+ monocytes express mRNA for all five dopamine receptors by qRT-PCR and D1R, D5R and D4R surface protein by flow cytometry. Dopamine and the D1-like dopamine receptor agonist, SKF38393, increased CD14+CD16+ monocyte migration that was characterized as chemokinesis. To determine whether dopamine affected cell motility and adhesion, live cell imaging was used to monitor the accumulation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes on the surface of a tissue culture dish. Dopamine increased the number and the rate at which CD14+CD16+ monocytes in suspension settled to the dish surface. In a spreading assay, dopamine increased the area of CD14+CD16+ monocytes during the early stages of cell adhesion. In addition, adhesion assays showed that the overall total number of adherent CD14+CD16+ monocytes increased in the presence of dopamine. These data suggest that elevated extracellular dopamine in the CNS of HIV infected drug abusers contributes to HIV neuropathogenesis by increasing the accumulation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes in dopamine rich brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2040430208,"Increased serum ferritin associated with mild hepatic iron accumulation, despite preserved upregulation of the iron hormone hepcidin, is frequently observed in patients with dysmetabolic overload syndrome (DIOS). Genetic factors and Western diet represent predisposing conditions, but the mechanisms favoring iron accumulation in DIOS are still unclear. Aims of this study were to assess the effect a high-fat diet (HFD) on hepatic iron metabolism in an experimental model in rats, to further characterize the effect of free fatty acids on iron metabolism in HepG2 hepatocytes in vitro, and to assess the translational relevance in patients with fatty liver with and without iron accumulation. Despite decreased uptake of dietary iron, rats fed HFD accumulated more hepatic iron than those fed regular diet, which was associated with steatosis development. Hepatic iron accumulation was paralleled by induction of ferritin, in the presence of preserved upregulation of hepcidin, recapitulating the features of DIOS. HFD was associated with increased expression of the major iron uptake protein Transferrin receptor-1 (TfR-1), consistently with upregulation of the intracellular iron sensor Iron regulated protein-1 (IRP1). Supplementation with fatty acids induced TfR-1 and IRP1 in HepG2 hepatocytes, favoring intracellular iron accumulation following exposure to iron salts. IRP1 silencing completely abrogated TfR-1 induction and the facilitation of intracellular iron accumulation induced by fatty acids. Hepatic TfR-1 mRNA levels were upregulated in patients with fatty liver and DIOS, whereas they were not associated with liver fat nor with inflammation. In conclusion, increased exposure to fatty acids subverts hepatic iron metabolism, favoring the induction of an iron uptake program despite hepatocellular iron accumulation."

We previously demonstrated that the expression of both urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and the uPA receptor are elevated in FL-fibroblasts from the lungs of patients with IPF. FL-fibroblasts isolated from human IPF lungs and from mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis showed an increased rate of proliferation compared with normal lung fibroblasts (NL-fibroblasts) derived from histologically “normal” lung. Basal expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in human and murine FL-fibroblasts was reduced, whereas collagen-I and α-smooth muscle actin were markedly elevated. Conversely, alveolar type II epithelial cells surrounding the fibrotic foci in situ, as well as those isolated from IPF lungs, showed increased activation of caspase-3 and PAI-1 with a parallel reduction in uPA expression. Transduction of an adenovirus PAI-1 cDNA construct (Ad-PAI-1) suppressed expression of uPA and collagen-I and attenuated proliferation in FL-fibroblasts. On the contrary, inhibition of basal PAI-1 in NL-fibroblasts increased collagen-I and α-smooth muscle actin. Fibroblasts isolated from PAI-1-deficient mice without lung injury also showed increased collagen-I and uPA.

Present estimates of the disease incidence are 40–50 per 100,000 in the United States. The majority of patients present with advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, and the long term survival outcome of patients with IPF is dismal, with a median 5-year survival of only 20% (1.Selman M. Pardo A. Richeldi L. Cerri S. Emerging drugs for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Expert Opin. Emerg. Drugs. 2011; 16: 341-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).

However, in the lungs of patients with IPF or other fibrotic disorders, FL-fibroblasts resist apoptosis and exhibit unrestricted proliferation with ultimate compromise of the normal alveolar architecture.

In this study, we therefore sought to assess the role of PAI-1 in pulmonary fibrosis using FL-fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of human IPF patients and from mice with BLM-induced lung fibrosis. Our findings indicate that unlike ATII cells in the lungs of IPF patients or mice with BLM-induced lung injury, baseline PAI-1 levels are significantly suppressed in hFL-fibroblasts or mFL-fibroblasts, although expressions of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), collagen-I (Col-I), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) are elevated. These changes are reversed by restoration of PAI-1 expression in FL-fibroblasts. The process involves parallel inhibition of Akt/PTEN cell proliferation/survival signaling, which is otherwise increased in FL-fibroblasts. All studies that involve specimens derived from de-identified human lung tissues from surgical biopsies or harvested at the time of lung transplantation or autopsy of patients with IPF or control donors without known lung disease were approved by the ethics committees of all institutions involved, including University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler. Lung tissues from The Mayo Clinic were used for isolation of ATII cells. Lung sections were obtained from the tissue archives of the Department of Pathology, University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler, or were provided by the Lung Tissue Research Consortium. The clinical diagnoses of patients with IPF were established by history, physical examination, high resolution CT, pulmonary function tests, and diagnostic lung biopsy by clinicians with expertise in the area. In all IPF cases from which cells were used in this study, the pathological diagnosis was usual interstitial pneumonia based on the presence of restrictive lung disease in association with a compatible clinical presentation and lung pathology. Lung tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis to assess changes in PAI-1 and Ki-67 antigen levels. For co-localization studies, lung sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized using xylene, followed by rehydration and antigen retrieval. These sections were later incubated overnight with SP-C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas), PAI-1, and cleaved caspase-3 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) antibodies. Rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. The sections were then incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody. The stained sections were then examined with a confocal microscope (LSM510 META; Zeiss), and co-localization analysis was performed by software ZEN. Total protein content in the homogenates from resected lung tissues of patients with IPF and control (“normal”) subjects was determined using BCA reagents and known amounts of bovine serum albumin as standards. Total proteins from the lung homogenates were analyzed for PAI-1, Col-I, and uPA expression by Western blotting. Total RNA isolated from control and IPF lung tissues were analyzed by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for PAI-1, Col-I, and uPA mRNA. ATII cells were isolated from control and IPF lungs as we described elsewhere (21.Marudamuthu A.S. Bhandary Y.P. Shetty S.K. Fu J. Sathish V. Prakash Y. Shetty S.

Isolated lung fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and used within 4–7 passages of the initial isolation. Fibroblasts were switched to overnight serum deprivation before testing for changes in Col-I, uPA, and PAI-1 protein and mRNA by Western blotting and RT-qPCR, respectively. hNL- and hFL-fibroblasts were transduced with an adenovirus vector (Ad-vector) expressing chimeric PAI-1 5′promoter sequence (Ad-5′Pro)- or 3′UTR sequence (Ad-3′UTR)-luciferase reporter constructs. The fibroblasts exposed to Ad-vector incorporating a scrambled promoter sequence (Ad-scPro) and luciferase reporter constructs or empty Ad-vector (Ad-EV) or naive hNL- and hFL-fibroblasts were used as controls.

Twenty one days after inception of BLM-induced lung injury, stable pulmonary fibrosis was confirmed by small animal CT scanning and assessment of pulmonary function tests using a Flexivent system under anesthesia. In brief, anesthetized mice were intubated after swabbing with lidocaine; the vocal cords were visualized, and a 20GX1″ cannula was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. Mice were connected to the ventilator tubing and secured to the bed of the CT scanner. Prior to CT scanning, pulmonary function testing was done. CT images were obtained during a breath-hold. Lungs were later extracted from euthanized mice and subjected to total hydroxyproline content and IHC analysis. Fibroblasts were also isolated from the lungs of mice with established pulmonary fibrosis or from uninjured control mouse lungs as described previously (22.Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A.R. Pueblitz S.

FL-fibroblasts from the lungs of patients with IPF or mice with established pulmonary fibrosis as well as NL-fibroblasts were exposed to Ad-PAI-1. FL-fibroblasts treated with empty Ad-vector (Ad-EV) and adenoviral vector expressing recombinant β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) were used as controls. Seventy two hours after transduction, cells were analyzed for changes in Col-I, α-SMA, PAI-1, and uPA. hNL- and FL-fibroblasts cultured in culture dishes were treated with PAI-1 shRNA (1 × 106) for 72 h to suppress baseline PAI-1 expression. NL- and FL-fibroblasts exposed to nonspecific control shRNA were used as controls. Difference between two groups was analyzed by Student's t test and for multiple groups by one-way analysis of variance tests. Fibrotic foci with increased deposits of Col-I, vimentin, and other ECM proteins due to increased localization of hFL-fibroblasts typify lung sections of patients with IPF. However, IHC analysis using an anti-PAI-1 antibody showed relatively little PAI-1 staining in the fibrotic foci of IPF lung sections (Fig. 1A), although overall staining for PAI-1 antigen was markedly elevated throughout IPF lungs compared with NL tissues. In addition, intense staining for Ki-67 antigen within the fibrotic foci (Fig. 1B) suggests increased proliferation of hFL-fibroblasts in the IPF lungs. IHC analysis for PAI-1 and SP-C indicated that 93.4% of PAI-1-positive cells are SP-C positive, and 54.7% SP-C positive cells are positive for PAI-1 in IPF lung sections (Fig. 1C). Moreover, 70.8% of PAI-1-positive cells are also positive for active caspase-3, and 54.3% of caspase-3 positive cells are PAI-1 positive (Fig. 1D). This indicates increased PAI-1 expression in ATII cells bordering fibrotic foci, with the majority of these cells undergoing apoptosis. Fibrotic foci showed minimal staining for PAI-1, although PAI-1 has generally been reported to be increased in the lungs in evolving pulmonary fibrosis (12.Bhandary Y.P. Shetty S.K. Marudamuthu A.S.

https://openalex.org/W2050908055,"The purpose of this work was to investigate the synthetic phospholipid dependence of permeability measured by parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) method. Three phospholipids with hydrophobic groups of different lengths and phosphorylcholine as the hydrophilic group were concisely synthesized. Ten model drug molecules were selected because of their distinct human fraction absorbed (%FA) values and various pKa characteristics. In vitro drug permeation experiments were designed to determine the effect of the incubation time (4-20 h), pH gradient (4.6-9.32) and carbon chain length (8, 10, 12) on the drug permeability through the synthetic phospholipid membrane in the PAMPA system. The results showed that intensive and significant synthetic phospholipids dependence of permeability influenced by the length of lipid's hydrophobic carbon chain. The effective permeability constant (Pe) of each drug increased rapidly with time, then decreased slightly after reaching the maximum; the pH gradient changed the drug permeability according to the pH-partition hypothesis for drugs with diverse pKa values; and longer hydrophobic chains in the synthetic phospholipid membrane improved the drug permeability, as observed for all test drugs at almost all incubation time points. This newly proposed PAMPA model considered the synthetic phospholipid membrane and showed good Pe-%FA correlation for the passive transport of drugs, making it a helpful supplementary method for PAMPA systems."
https://openalex.org/W2164944003,"There is an intimate relationship between muscle and bone throughout life. However, how alterations in muscle functions in disease impact bone homeostasis is poorly understood. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive muscle atrophy. In this study we analyzed the effects of ALS on bone using the well established G93A transgenic mouse model, which harbors an ALS-causing mutation in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1. We found that 4-month-old G93A mice with severe muscle atrophy had dramatically reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass compared with their sex-matched wild type (WT) control littermates. Mechanically, we found that multiple osteoblast properties, such as the formation of osteoprogenitors, activation of Akt and Erk1/2 pathways, and osteoblast differentiation capacity, were severely impaired in primary cultures and bones from G93A relative to WT mice; this could contribute to reduced bone formation in the mutant mice. Conversely, osteoclast formation and bone resorption were strikingly enhanced in primary bone marrow cultures and bones of G93A mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, sclerostin and RANKL expression in osteocytes embedded in the bone matrix were greatly up-regulated, and β-catenin was down-regulated in osteoblasts from G93A mice when compared with those of WT mice. Interestingly, calvarial bone that does not load and long bones from 2-month-old G93A mice without muscle atrophy displayed no detectable changes in parameters for osteoblast and osteoclast functions. Thus, for the first time to our knowledge, we have demonstrated that ALS causes abnormal bone remodeling and defined the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms.

ALS is epidemiologically classified into two forms, sporadic and familial ALS. Ninety percent of cases of ALS are sporadic ALS with the remaining 10% being familial ALS (1.Pasinelli P. Brown R.H. Molecular biology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: insights from genetics.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 710-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Both sporadic and familial ALS manifest similar pathological and clinical phenotypes, suggesting that different initiating causes lead to a mechanistically similar neurodegenerative pathway. Mutations in the gene that encodes the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are linked to ALS (1.Pasinelli P. Brown R.H. Molecular biology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: insights from genetics.Nat. Rev.

Mouse models expressing ALS-linked SOD1 mutations effectively recapitulate many features of the human disease and have been extensively used to investigate pathogenic mechanisms of ALS (4.McGoldrick P.

The initial clinical symptoms of ALS may be subtle. However, as ALS progresses, muscle weakness and atrophy become severe and lead to death from respiratory failure usually within 3–5 years from the onset of symptoms. There is currently no cure for ALS.

Collectively, these observations suggest that muscle atrophy in disease may impair bone integrity. The aim of this study was to determine whether, and how, bone homeostasis is impaired in a G93A ALS mouse model during the progression of muscle atrophy. Tissue culture media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Thermo Scientific HyClone (Logan, UT). Alizarin red, cetylpyridinium chloride, l-ascorbic acid, and β-glycerophosphate were purchased from Sigma, recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor and RANKL were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and the BrdU immunostaining kit was from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. G93A transgenic mice expressing a G93A mutant form of human SOD1 in a C57B6XSJL background have been previously described (39.Zhou J. Yi J. Fu R. Liu E.

Two-month-old (without muscle atrophy) and 4-month-old (with severe muscle atrophy) G93A female mice and their sex-matched littermate controls (hereinafter referred to as WT) were used in this study. All animals were bred and housed in the same facility at Rush University Medical Center. Mice were fed standard rodent chow and water ad libitum in sterile cages with a 12-h light/dark cycle. We used only female mice in this study; male G93A mice were saved for breeding to maintain the G93A colony because female G93A mice are infertile. All research protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rush University Medical Center, where this study was conducted. After sacrifice, mouse femurs were isolated and fixed in 70% ethanol for 2 days. Non-demineralized femurs from each group were scanned and measured by μCT (μCT35, SCANCO Medical AG, Wayne, PA) with an isotropic resolution of 7.0 μm following the standards of techniques and terminology recommended by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (41.Bouxsein M.L. Boyd S.K. Christiansen B.A. Guldberg R.E. Jepsen K.J. Müller R. Guidelines for assessment of bone microstructure in rodents using micro-computed tomography.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 1468-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). For trabecular bone parameters, transverse slices were obtained in the region of interest in the axial direction from the trabecular bone 0.1 mm below the growth plate (bottom of the primary spongiosa). Contours were defined and drawn close to the cortical bone. The trabecular bone was then removed and analyzed separately. A three-dimensional analysis was performed on 250 trabecular bone slices. A 1.75-mm section was used to obtain mid-femoral cortical bone thickness. The analysis of the specimens involved the following bone measurements: bone volume fraction/total tissue volume (BV/TV, %), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp), and cortical thickness (Cort.Th). After euthanasia, WT and G93A mice tibiae were fixed in 10% formalin at 4 °C for 2 days, decalcified in 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) for 3 weeks, and embedded in paraffin. 5-μm bone sections were stained with toluidine blue. Osteoblast surface/bone surface and osteoblast numbers/bone perimeter of trabecular bones were measured using Image Pro Plus 7.0 software (Rockville, MD). For IHC, 5-μm sections of tibiae were stained with antibodies against Runx2 (ab102711; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), osterix (Osx) (ab22552; Abcam), osteocalcin (Ocn) (sc-30044; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), β-catenin (9562S; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), RANKL (sc-9073; Santa Cruz), or control IgG using the EnVision+ System-HRP (Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, CA) as previously described (42.Yu S.

MAR, MS/BS, and BFR were measured after the guidelines recommended by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (44.Dempster D.W. Compston J.E. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A.

Res. 2013; 28: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were injected intraperitoneally with calcein (20 mg/kg) at days 6 and 2 before sacrifice. After μCT analyses, non-demineralized femurs were embedded using an Osteo-Bed Bone Embedding kit (EM0200; Sigma) and sectioned at 5 μm. Calcein labeling was visualized using EVOS fl microscopy (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Metaphyseal trabecular bones protruding into the bone marrow area and diaphyseal cortical bones were evaluated, and the distance between the double-labeled bands was measured using Image Pro Plus 7.0 software (Rockville, MD). The MAR was calculated as the mean distance between the double labels divided by the number of the days between the calcein injections. The MS/BS was calculated as the percentage of bone surface exhibiting mineralizing activity. MS/BS = (dLS + sLS/2)/BS, where dLS is the number of double-labeled surfaces, and sLS is the number of single-labeled surfaces. The bone formation rate per bone surface (BFR/BS or BFR) is the volume of mineralized bone formed per unit time and per unit bone surface. BFR/BS is calculated as BFR/BS = MAR × (MS/BS). The long bones of the mice were isolated, and bone marrow cells were flushed with α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 20% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin into a 100-mm dish. The cell suspension was aspirated to break up clusters of bone marrow cells and then cultured in the same medi"

Recent studies have revealed a strong association of prostatic inflammation with LUTS. We developed an animal model of bacterial induced, isolated prostatic inflammation and examined the effect of prostatic inflammation on voiding behavior in adult C57BL/6J mice. Prostatic inflammation was induced by transurethral inoculation of uropathogenic E. coli—1677. Bacterial cystitis was prevented by continuous administration of nitrofurantoin. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and bacterial culture were preformed to validate our animal model. Voiding behavior was examined by metabolic cage testing on post-instillation day 1 (PID 1), PID 4, PID 7 and PID 14 and both voiding frequency and volume per void were determined. Mice with prostatic inflammation showed significantly increased voiding frequency at PID 1, 7 and 14, and decreased volume per void at all time points, as compared to mice instilled with saline and receiving nitrofurantoin (NTF). Linked analysis of voiding frequency and voided volumes revealed an overwhelming preponderance of high frequency, low volume voiding in mice with prostatic inflammation. These observations suggest that prostatic inflammation may be causal for symptoms of urinary frequency and nocturia."

The objective response rate (ORR) of the operation on the selected patients is very high (94.4%), including 4 cases (22.2%) of partial response (PR) and 13 cases (72.2%) of stable disease (SD). After preoperative sorafenib treatment, the average tumor size of the 18 patients decreased from 7.8 cm (ranging from 3.6 to 19.2 cm) to 6.2 cm (ranging from 2.4 to 16.8 cm), and the median value of average tumor CT value decreased from 61HU to 52 HU. Among the 5 patients who had IVC tumor thrombi, the grades of tumor thrombi in 2 patients who were grade II before sorafenib treatment became grade I and grade 0 respectively, 2 patients of grade III both became grade II.Preoperative neoadjuvant therapy with sorafenib for high risk RCC patients can significantly decrease primary tumor volume as well as tumor thrombus, which could help the nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) or radical nephrectomy to be done successfully."
https://openalex.org/W2016262559,"The inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is synthesized by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in neurons and in pancreatic β-cells in islets of Langerhans where it functions as a paracrine and autocrine signaling molecule regulating the function of islet endocrine cells. The localization of the two non-allelic isoforms GAD65 and GAD67 to vesicular membranes is important for rapid delivery and accumulation of GABA for regulated secretion. While the membrane anchoring and trafficking of GAD65 are mediated by intrinsic hydrophobic modifications, GAD67 remains hydrophilic, and yet is targeted to vesicular membrane pathways and synaptic clusters in neurons by both a GAD65-dependent and a distinct GAD65-independent mechanism. Herein we have investigated the membrane association and targeting of GAD67 and GAD65 in monolayer cultures of primary rat, human, and mouse islets and in insulinoma cells. GAD65 is primarily detected in Golgi membranes and in peripheral vesicles distinct from insulin vesicles in β-cells. In the absence of GAD65, GAD67 is in contrast primarily cytosolic in β-cells; its co-expression with GAD65 is necessary for targeting to Golgi membranes and vesicular compartments. Thus, the GAD65-independent mechanism for targeting of GAD67 to synaptic vesicles in neurons is not functional in islet β-cells. Therefore, only GAD65:GAD65 homodimers and GAD67:GAD65 heterodimers, but not the GAD67:GAD67 homodimer gain access to vesicular compartments in β-cells to facilitate rapid accumulation of newly synthesized GABA for regulated secretion and fine tuning of GABA-signaling in islets of Langerhans."
https://openalex.org/W2031432178,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is one of the most common glomerular diseases leading to end-stage renal failure. Elevation of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 is a key feature of it. The expression of the specific molecular chaperone of core1ß1, 3galactosyl transferase (Cosmc) is known to be reduced in IgAN. We aimed to investigate whether the methylation of CpG islands of Cosmc gene promoter region could act as a possible mechanism responsible for down-regulation of Cosmc and related higher secretion of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1in lymphocytes from children with IgA nephropathy. Three groups were included: IgAN children (n = 26), other renal diseases (n = 11) and healthy children (n = 13). B-lymphocytes were isolated and cultured, treated or not with IL-4 or 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (AZA). The levels of DNA methylation of Cosmc promotor region were not significantly different between the lymphocytes of the three children populations (P = 0.113), but there were significant differences between IgAN lymphocytes and lymphocytes of the other two children populations after IL-4 (P<0.0001) or AZA (P<0.0001). Cosmc mRNA expression was low in IgAN lymphocytes compared to the other two groups (P<0.0001). The level of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 was markedly higher in IgAN group compared to the other groups (P<0.0001). After treatment with IL-4, the levels of Cosmc DNA methylation and aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 in IgAN lymphocytes were remarkably higher than the other two groups (P<0.0001) with more markedly decreased Cosmc mRNA content (P<0.0001). After treatment with AZA, the levels in IgAN lymphocytes were decreased, but was still remarkably higher than the other two groups (P<0.0001), while Cosmc mRNA content in IgAN lymphocytes were more markedly increased than the other two groups (P<0.0001). The alteration of DNA methylation by IL-4 or AZA specifically correlates in IgAN lymphocytes with alterations in Cosmc mRNA expression and with the level of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 (r = −0.948, r = 0. 707). Our results suggested that hypermethylation of Cosmc promoter region could be a key mechanism for the reduction of Cosmc mRNA expression in IgAN lymphocytes with associated increase in aberrantly glycosylated IgA1."
https://openalex.org/W2066052510,"XopDXcc8004, a type III effector of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) 8004, is considered a shorter version of the XopD, which lacks the N-terminal domain. To understand the functions of XopDXcc8004, in planta, a transgenic approach combined with inducible promoter to analyze the effects of XopDXcc8004 in Arabidopsis was done. Here, the expression of XopDXcc8004, in Arabidopsis elicited the accumulation of host defense-response genes. These molecular changes were dependent on salicylic acid and correlated with lesion-mimic phenotypes observed in XVE::XopDXcc8004 transgenic plants. Moreover, XopDXcc8004 was able to desumoylate HFR1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in photomorphogenesis, through SUMO protease activity. Interestingly, the hfr1-201 mutant increased the expression of host defense-response genes and displayed a resistance phenotype to Xcc8004. These data suggest that HFR1 is involved in plant innate immunity and is potentially regulated by XopDXcc8004."

The recombinant protein showed a specific N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfatase activity that removes 4-O-sulfate from both disaccharides and polysaccharides of chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate (DS), suggesting that this sulfatase represents a novel endosulfatase. The novel endosulfatase exhibited maximal reaction rate in a phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 30 °C and effectively removed 17–65% of 4-O-sulfates from various CS and DS and thus significantly inhibited the interactions of CS and DS with a positively supercharged fluorescent protein. Moreover, this endosulfatase significantly promoted the digestion of CS by HCLase, suggesting that it enhances the digestion of CS/DS by the bacterium. Therefore, this endosulfatase is a potential tool for use in CS/DS-related studies and applications. Sulfatases are potentially useful tools for structure-function studies of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). To date, various GAG exosulfatases have been identified in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, endosulfatases that act on GAGs have rarely been reported. Recently, a novel HA and CS lyase (HCLase) was identified for the first time from a marine bacterium (Han, W., Wang, W., Zhao, M., Sugahara, K., and Li, F. (2014) J. Biol. Chem. 289, 27886–27898).

https://openalex.org/W2062622171,"Saudi Arabia annually reports a relatively higher proportion (28-32%) of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) cases in comparison to other global regions. However, there were few studies conducted so far to determine the sociodemographic factors and clinical manifestations associated with EPTB at a nationwide level.A retrospective analysis on culture positive EPTB isolates collected from all the provinces of the country were conducted for a period of 12 months to determine the spectrum of diversity in EPTB infection sites and the confounding factors. A detailed clinical and demographical data analysis was carried out along with first line drug susceptibility testing.Intra-thoracic and extra-thoracic lymph nodes (44.6%) were the most common sites of infection followed by gastrointestinal (17.3%) and central nervous systems (11.8%). Male patients were mostly infected (58.8%), in contrary to the global trend. Any drug resistance was observed in 23.1% isolates with a 2.1% of multi-drug resistance. HIV reactivity was found only in 2.2% cases. A higher proportion of Saudi nationals (58.8%) were infected compared to the immigrants, descending mostly from South Asia (34.4%) and South East Asia (31.2%). The Saudi population predominated with all forms of EPTB while immigrants showed no significant variations.Saudi Arabia faces a serious threat from EPTB, particularly to the central nervous system and gastrointestinal systems. More effective diagnostic strategies and control measures must be implemented to reduce the high rate of EPTB in the country. In addition, these findings warrant further detailed research to explore all related comorbid conditions of EPTB development, particularly the host-related factors."

https://openalex.org/W1979901635,"Scaly-sided Merganser is a globally endangered species restricted to eastern Asia. Estimating its population is difficult and considerable gap exists between populations at its breeding grounds and wintering sites. In this study, we built a species distribution model (SDM) using Maxent with presence-only data to predict the potential wintering habitat for Scaly-sided Merganser in China. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) method suggests high predictive power of the model (training and testing AUC were 0.97 and 0.96 respectively). The most significant environmental variables included annual mean temperature, mean temperature of coldest quarter, minimum temperature of coldest month and precipitation of driest quarter. Suitable conditions for Scaly-sided Merganser are predicted in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, especially in Jiangxi, Hunan and Hubei Provinces. The predicted suitable habitat embraces 6,984 km of river. Based on survey results from three consecutive winters (2010–2012) and previous studies, we estimated that the entire wintering population of Scaly-sided Merganser in China to be 3,561 ± 478 individuals, which is consistent with estimate in its breeding ground."
https://openalex.org/W2080110292,"Foragers must often travel from a central place to exploit aggregations of prey. These patches can be identified behaviorally when a forager shifts from travel to area restricted search, identified by a decrease in speed and an increase in sinuosity of movement. Faster, more directed movement is associated with travel. Differentiating foraging behavior at patches from travel to patches is important for a variety of research questions and has now been made easier by the advent of small, GPS devices that can track forager movement with high resolution. In the summer and fall of 2012, movement data were collected from GPS devices placed on foraging trips originating in the artisanal fishing village of Desa Ikan (pseudonym), on the east coast of the Caribbean island nation of the Commonwealth Dominica. Moored FADs are human-made structures anchored to the ocean floor with fish attraction material on or near the surface designed to effectively create a resource patch. The ultimate goal of the research is to understand how property rights are emerging after the introduction of fish aggregating device (FAD) technology at the site in 1999. This paper reports on research to identify area-restricted search foraging behavior at FAD patches. For 22 foraging trips simultaneous behavioral observations were made to ground-truth the GPS movement data. Using a cumulative sum method, area restricted search was identified as negative deviations from the mean travel speed and the method was able to correctly identify FAD patches in every case."
https://openalex.org/W2082853617,"The study was designed to investigate the probable mechanisms of anti-hyperglycemic activity of B. Vulgaris.Aqueous fraction of B. Vulgaris extract was the only active fraction (50mg/kg). Plasma insulin level was found to be the highest at 30 mins after B. Vulgaris administration at a dose of 200mg/kg. B. Vulgaris treated mice were also assayed for plasma Acetylcholine, Glucagon Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), Gastric Inhibitory Peptide (GIP), Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Peptide (PACAP), Insulin Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1), Pancreatic Polypeptides (PP), and Somatostatin, along with the corresponding insulin levels. Plasma Acetylcholine and GLP-1 significantly increased in B. Vulgaris treated animals and were further studied. Pharmacological enhancers, inhibitors, and antagonists of Acetylcholine and GLP-1 were also administered to the test animals, and corresponding insulin levels were measured. These studies confirmed the role of acetylcholine and GLP-1 in enhanced insulin secretion (p<0.05). Principal signaling molecules were quantified in isolated mice islets for the respective pathways to elucidate their activities. Elevated concentrations of Acetylcholine and GLP-1 in B. Vulgaris treated mice were found to be sufficient to activate the respective pathways for insulin secretion (p<0.05). The amount of membrane bound GLUT1 and GLUT4 transporters were quantified and the subsequent glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis were assayed. We showed that levels of membrane bound GLUT4 transporters, glucose-6-phosphate in skeletal myocytes, activity of glycogen synthase, and level of glycogen deposited in the skeletal muscles all increased (p<0.05).Findings of the present study clearly prove the role of Acetylcholine and GLP-1 in the Insulin secreting activity of B. Vulgaris. Increased glucose uptake in the skeletal muscles and subsequent glycogen synthesis may also play a part in the anti-hyperglycemic activity of B. Vulgaris."

The mussels were exposed to Cd (4.21, 8.43, 16.86, 33.72 and 67.45 mg L-1) for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, respectively. After Cd treatment, the gills, mantle, foot, visceral mass and digestive gland tissues were collected for analysis. We found that, in the controls, Cd distributed in all tissues in the concentration order of gills>mantle>foot>visceral mass>digestive gland. Upon Cd treatment, Cd concentration significantly increased in all tissues. The highest Cd accumulation was found in the digestive gland, which was 0.142 mg g-1 (P<0.05). MT levels in the gills and mantle of the mussels increased significantly (P<0.05), which were in positive correlation with Cd accumulation in the tissues (P<0.05). In conclusion, our results demonstrated a correlation between Cd accumulation and MT up-regulation in gills and mantle of the mussels after Cd treatment. It is suggested that the protein level of MT in gills and mantle of Anodonta woodiana is a good biomarker for Cd contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2004562353,"Despite successful treatment and CD4+ T-cell recovery, HIV-infected individuals often experience a profound immune dysregulation characterized by a persistently low CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio. This residual immune dysregulation is reminiscent of the Immune Risk Phenotype (IRP) previously associated with morbidity and mortality in the uninfected elderly (>85 years). The IRP consists of laboratory markers that include: a low CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio, an expansion of CD8+CD28- T-cells and cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity. Despite the significant overlap in immunological phenotypes between normal aging and HIV infection, the IRP has never been evaluated in HIV-infected individuals. In this pilot study we characterized immune changes associated with the IRP in a sample of successfully treated HIV-infected subjects.18 virologically suppressed HIV-infected subjects were categorized into 2 groups based on their IRP status; HIV+IRP+, (n = 8) and HIV+IRP-, (n = 10) and compared to 15 age-matched HIV uninfected IRP negative controls. All individuals were assessed for functional and phenotypic immune characteristics including: pro-inflammatory cytokine production, antigen-specific proliferation capacity, replicative senescence, T-cell differentiation and lymphocyte telomere length.Compared to HIV-infected subjects without an IRP, HIV+IRP+ subjects exhibited a higher frequency of TNF-α-producing CD8+ T-cells (p = 0.05) and a reduced proportion of CD8+ naïve T-cells (p = 0.007). The IRP status was also associated with a marked up-regulation of the replicative senescence markers CD57 and KLGR1, on the surface of CD8+T-cells (p = 0.004). Finally, HIV+IRP+ individuals had a significantly shorter mean lymphocyte telomere length than their non-IRP counterparts (p = 0.03).Our findings suggest that, despite similar levels of treatment-mediated viral suppression, the phenotypic and functional immune characteristics of HIV+IRP+ individuals are distinct from those observed in non-IRP individuals. The IRP appears to identify a subset of treated HIV-infected individuals with a higher degree of immune senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2008181674,"A computer model of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in skeletal muscle is used to compare state 3, intermediate state and state 4 in mitochondria with rest and work in skeletal muscle. ‘Idealized’ state 4 and 3 in relation to various ‘experimental’ states 4 and 3 are defined. Theoretical simulations show, in accordance with experimental data, that oxygen consumption (V’O2), ADP and Pi are higher, while ATP/ADP and Δp are lower in rest than in state 4, because of the presence of basal ATP consuming reactions in the former. It is postulated that moderate and intensive work in skeletal muscle is very different from state 3 in isolated mitochondria. V’O2, ATP/ADP, Δp and the control of ATP usage over V’O2 are much higher, while ADP and Pi are much lower in the former. The slope of the phenomenological V’O2-ADP relationship is much steeper during the rest-work transition than during the state 4-state 3 transition. The work state in intact muscle is much more similar to intermediate state than to state 3 in isolated mitochondria in terms of ADP, ATP/ADP, Δp and metabolic control pattern, but not in terms of V’O2. The huge differences between intact muscle and isolated mitochondria are proposed to be caused by the presence of the each-step activation (ESA) mechanism of the regulation of OXPHOS in intact skeletal muscle. Generally, the present study suggests that isolated mitochondria (at least in the absence of Ca2+) cannot serve as a good model of OXPHOS regulation in intact skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2059264829,"Cytokines impair the function and decrease the viability of insulin-producing β-cells by a pathway that requires the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and generation of high levels of nitric oxide. In addition to nitric oxide, excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, has been shown to cause β-cell damage. Although the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide results in the formation of peroxynitrite, we have shown that β-cells do not have the capacity to produce this powerful oxidant in response to cytokines. When β-cells are forced to generate peroxynitrite using nitric oxide donors and superoxide-generating redox cycling agents, superoxide scavenges nitric oxide and prevents the inhibitory and destructive actions of nitric oxide on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and β-cell viability. In this study, we show that the β-cell response to nitric oxide is regulated by the location of superoxide generation. Nitric oxide freely diffuses through cell membranes, and it reacts with superoxide produced within cells and in the extracellular space, generating peroxynitrite. However, only when it is produced within cells does superoxide attenuate nitric oxide-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, gene expression, and toxicity. These findings suggest that the location of radical generation and the site of radical reactions are key determinants in the functional response of β-cells to reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. Although nitric oxide is freely diffusible, its biological function can be controlled by the local generation of superoxide, such that when this reaction occurs within β-cells, superoxide protects β-cells by scavenging nitric oxide.

Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the selective destruction of insulin-producing β-cells.

The differential expression of various antioxidant genes suggests that β-cells may be acutely sensitive to some oxidants but resistant to others depending on the chemical nature of the specific reactive species. Here, we examined the sensitivity of pancreatic β-cells to various forms of ROS and RNS and show, surprisingly, that β-cells are resistant to peroxynitrite-induced damage. ROS and RNS modify β-cell function and viability, and both forms of reactive species are capable of differentially activating signaling cascades; however, the fate of the β-cell is controlled by the location in which ROS or RNS are generated. We report here that the extracellular production of superoxide does not modify the response of β-cells to nitric oxide. In contrast, when produced within β-cells, superoxide functions to scavenge nitric oxide and thereby attenuates nitric oxide-dependent responses of β-cells. RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium was purchased from Gibco, and FBS was from HyClone (Logan, UT). DPTA/NO and SIN-1 were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. INS832/13 cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). Cells were maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For real-time monitoring of peroxynitrite, β-cells were washed to remove the tissue culture media and then cultured in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing glucose (5.5 mm) and pyruvate (0.33 mm). Insulinoma cells were exposed to reactive species in complete RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium. The nitric oxide donor DPTA/NO has a half-life of 3 h under cell culture conditions (37 °C, pH 7.4) and liberates two molecules of nitric oxide per molecule of parent compound. Administration of 500 μm DPTA/NO results in the flux of nitric oxide of ∼3.8 μm/min. SIN-1 generates equimolar amounts of superoxide and nitric oxide that rapidly react to form peroxynitrite. The calculated maximal flux of peroxynitrite is ∼1.8 μm/min for 250 μm SIN-1 under the cell culture conditions used in this study. Menadione is a quinone that produces superoxide by intracellular redox cycling using the cytosolic enzymes NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (25.Brunmark A. Cadenas E. Redox and addition chemistry of quinoid compounds and its biological implications.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 435-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that the addition of menadione results in intracellular superoxide generation in pancreatic β-cells (26.Broniowska K.A. Mathews C.E. Corbett J.A.

After the treatment, the medium was replaced with complete culture medium containing 40 μg/ml neutral red, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The medium was then removed, and cells were fixed with formaldehyde (1%, (v/v) in 1% CaCl2). Neutral red was extracted from the cells in 100 μl of 50% ethanol containing 1% acetic acid (v/v). The absorbance was read at 540 nm, and viability was calculated based on the uptake of neutral red by untreated cells. HPLC was used to quantify the cellular levels of ATP and NAD+ as reported previously (29.Broniowska K.A. Diers A.R. Corbett J.A. Hogg N.

HPLC analysis of nucleotides was performed on a Kinetex C18 column (2.6 μm, 100 × 4.6-mm internal diameter) following previously published methods (29.Broniowska K.A. Diers A.R. Corbett J.A. Hogg N.

ATP and NAD+ peaks were measured for each sample and expressed in nanomoles per milligram of protein. RNA was isolated from whole cell lysates using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Subsequent first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo(dT)12–18 primers and the reverse transcriptase SuperScript preamplification system (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SsoFast EvaGreen supermix with the CFX96 real-time system (Bio-Rad). Values were normalized to GAPDH, and -fold changes were calculated by the ΔΔCt method. The following primer sequences were used: GADD45α, 5′-GTGTGCTGGTGACGAACCCACAT-3′ (forward), 5′-CCGTTCGGGGAATCACCGTCCG-3′ (reverse); PUMA, 5′-CAGGGGCAGGCAAGGGAAGC-3′ (forward), 5′-GAAGCCGCACTGGGGACACC-3′ (reverse); and GAPDH 5′-TCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGCCG-3′ (forward), 5′TGAAGGGGTCGTTGATGGCAACA-3′ (reverse). Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Mitochondrial aconitase activity in INS832/13 cells was determined using a coupled assay with isocitrate dehydrogenase as described previously (33.Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Corbett J.A.

Equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected using primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution: phospho-AMPK (Thr-172), phospho-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (phospho-ACC), phospho-eIF2α, phospho-GSK3β (Cell Signaling), phospho-ERK (anti-active MAPK polyclonal antibody), phospho-p38 (Promega, Madison, WI), PAR (Trevigen), γH2AX (Millipore), and GAPDH (Ambion), and detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (34.Khan P.

The formation of peroxynitrite was monitored in real time using the selective fluorescent probe, coumarin-7-boronate (10 μm). Immediately after the addition of the probe, the formation of peroxynitrite was monitored by fluorescence (excitation, 332 nm; emission, 450 nm) for up to 4 h at 37 °C as described previously (35.Zielonka J. Zielonka M. Sikora A. Adamus J. Joseph J. Hardy M. Ouari O. Dranka B.P. Kalyanaraman B.

Statistical comparisons were made between groups using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc test. The minimum level of significance was set at p < 0.05. The effects of ROS (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) and RNS (nitric oxide and peroxynitrite), on INS832/13 cell viability was examined following a 4-h incubation in the presence of the indicated concentrations of donors of each reactive species or redox cycling agent (Fig. 1). In a concentration-dependent fashion, the nitric oxide donor DPTA/NO decreases INS832/13 cell viability with half-maximal death observed at ∼200 μm (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the peroxynitrite donor SIN-1 does not impact β-cell viability when added at concentrations up to 1 mm (Fig. 1B). Superoxide formation in response to treatment with the redox cycling agent menadione does not modify cell viability at concentrations up to 20 μm; however, a sharp decrease in viability (70%) was induced in INS832/13 cells at 30 μm (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained with superoxide generated by a second redox cycling agent 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (data not shown). As reported previously (26.Broniowska K.A. Mathews C.E. Corbett J.A. Do β-cells generate peroxynitrite in response to cytokine treatment?.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 36567-36578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), hydrogen peroxide is highly toxic to β-cells at concentrations above 100 μm (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that β-cells are acutely sensitive to nitric oxide, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide, but are not sensitive to peroxynitrite. Because β-cells display differential sensitivity to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, the signaling cascades activated in response to these oxidants were examined. INS832/13 cells were exposed to the nitric oxide donor DPTA/NO, peroxynitrite donor SIN-1, superoxide donor menadione, and hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, and the activation of signaling pathways that are known to be involved in the response of β-cells to cytokines was evaluated (Fig. 2). Nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide activate AMPK as evidenced by enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK and its substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. At higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (400 μm), the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is diminished as compared with the levels observed at 100 μm. This effect is most likely due to the high level of cell death observed at this concentration of hydrogen peroxide (>80%, Fig. 1D). Consistent with previous studies (36.Meares G.P. Fontanilla D. Broniowska K.A. Andreone T. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Corbett J.A. Differential responses of pancreatic β-cells to ROS and RNS.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 304: E614-E622Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), AMPK activation in response to hydrogen peroxide is associated with the activation of PARP-1 as demonstrated by the accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) (37.Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Poly(ADP-ribose): novel functions for an old molecule.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Also, hydrogen peroxide induces the rapid formation of γH2AX (the phosphorylated form of H2AX) indicative of DNA double-strand breaks and activation of the DNA damage response (38.Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite donors do not stimulate PAR accumulation or γH2AX formation within 30 min of treatment, indicating that AMPK activation in response to nitric oxide is triggered by mechanisms that differ from the processes induced by hydrogen peroxide. Exposure of β-cells to a high concentration of menadione (40 μm) also results in PAR formation. Consistent with many studies (39.Chambers K.T. Unverferth J.A. Weber S.M. Wek R.C. Urano F.

GSK3 is the only cellular target, among those tested, that is phosphorylated in response to nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and superoxide. Although GSK3 can be phosphorylated during unfolded protein response activation (42.Huang S. Zhu M. Wu W. Rashid A. Liang Y. Hou L. Ning Q. Luo X.

MAPK are differentially activated by ROS and RNS. Nitric oxide stimulates p38 and ERK phosphorylation, and this activation is concentration-related as phosphorylation of these MAPK only occurs at higher concentrations of DPTA/NO (400 μm). Superoxide also stimulates ERK phosphorylation at high concentrations, but it does not stimulate p38 phosphorylation. These findings indicate that the activation of signaling pathways is dependent on the type and concentration of reactive species. Nitric oxide stimulates the unfolded protein response, MAPK, and AMPK activation, whereas hydrogen peroxide only activates AMPK, and this is due to the induction of DNA double-strand breaks (γH2AX formation) and the overactivation of PARP (PAR formation), leading to ATP depletion (47.David K.K.

Superoxide can dismutate to hydrogen peroxide spontaneously or in a reaction catalyzed by superoxide dismutase; however, we show that pathways activated by menadione (superoxide treatment) are selective and do not overlap with those activated by hydrogen peroxide.

Study Design This study was a cross-sectional survey. Students from 8 metropolitan cities in China were studied in November and December, 2005. There were 20,803 elementary-school Chinese children (49.6% boys, mean age, 9.19 years) enrolled. Questions from the standard questionnaire of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children were completed to enable us to examine the pattern of current AR. The potential confounders and pre-and postnatal risk factors were analyzed using logistic regression. Results The overall prevalence of AR was found in this study to be 9.8%. After adjusting for several likely confounders, there was a higher likelihood of AR in school-aged children who were not exclusively breastfed in the first 4 months of their lives (odds ratio [OR]: 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16–1.41), children who were born post-term (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.12–1.60), children delivered by cesarean section (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.00–1.19), or children born to mothers who experienced depressive symptoms during the pre- and postnatal periods (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.15–1.42). Conclusions AR in school-aged children was found to be associated with pre- and postnatal events. These findings indicate that strategies to reduce exposure to risk factors during pre- and postnatal periods for childhood allergies might be warranted."

Ma (CD), whose extract is orally used in traditional Chinese medicine. Although previous pharmacological studies have reported that PhGs exert many activities, their intestinal transport profiles have not been clarified. In this study, we investigated the intestinal permeability of a PhG-rich extract (PRE) from CD as an integrated system in the Caco-2 cell monolayer model using a bioassay system. The results showed that PRE is primarily transported via poorly absorbed passive diffusion down a concentration gradient without efflux, which provides the pharmacokinetic basis for the clinical application of PhGs in CD. We also determined the intestinal permeability of three major PhGs [acteoside (AC), isoacteoside (IS) and echinacoside (EC)] by HLPC. Furthermore, we developed a novel HPLC-fluorescence detection method to accurately determine the flux amount of AC and IS. As expected, the transport characteristics of the three PhGs are consistent with those of PRE, indicating that the present bioassay system is appropriate and reliable for the evaluation of the transport characteristics of active ingredient groups (AIG) in PRE. Moreover, this system may also be suitable for other plant extracts given appropriate bioactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1994512514,"Introduction Previous studies have assessed the diagnostic ability of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (pfADA) in detecting tuberculous pleural effusions, with good specificity and sensitivity reported. However, in North Western Europe pfADA is not routinely used in the investigation of a patient with an undiagnosed pleural effusion, mainly due to a lack of evidence as to its utility in populations with low mycobacterium tuberculosis (mTB) incidence. Methods Patients presenting with an undiagnosed pleural effusion to a tertiary pleural centre in South-West England over a 3 year period, were prospectively recruited to a pleural biomarker study. Pleural fluid from consecutive patients with robust 12-month follow up data and confirmed diagnosis were sent for pfADA analysis. Results Of 338 patients enrolled, 7 had confirmed tuberculous pleural effusion (2%). All mTB effusions were lymphocyte predominant with a median pfADA of 72.0 IU/L (range- 26.7 to 91.5) compared to a population median of 12.0 IU/L (range- 0.3 to 568.4). The optimal pfADA cut off was 35 IU/L, which had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.7% (95% CI; 98.2-99.9%) for the exclusion of mTB, and sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI; 42.2-97.6%) with an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% CI; 0.732–1.000). Discussion This is the first study examining the diagnostic utility of pfADA in a low mTB incidence area. The chance of an effusion with a pfADA under 35 IU/L being of tuberculous aetiology was negligible. A pfADA of over 35 IU/L in lymphocyte-predominant pleural fluid gives a strong suspicion of mTB."
https://openalex.org/W1975248870,"Nitrate uptake by heterotrophic bacteria plays an important role in marine N cycling. However, few studies have investigated the diversity of environmental nitrate assimilating bacteria (NAB). In this study, the diversity and biogeographical distribution of NAB in several global oceans and particularly in the western Pacific marginal seas were investigated using both cultivation and culture-independent molecular approaches. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and nasA (encoding the large subunit of the assimilatory nitrate reductase) gene sequences indicated that the cultivable NAB in South China Sea belonged to the α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria and CFB (Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides) bacterial groups. In all the environmental samples of the present study, α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were found to be the dominant nasA-harboring bacteria. Almost all of the α-Proteobacteria OTUs were classified into three Roseobacter-like groups (I to III). Clone library analysis revealed previously underestimated nasA diversity; e.g. the nasA gene sequences affiliated with β-Proteobacteria, ε-Proteobacteria and Lentisphaerae were observed in the field investigation for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. The geographical and vertical distributions of seawater nasA-harboring bacteria indicated that NAB were highly diverse and ubiquitously distributed in the studied marginal seas and world oceans. Niche adaptation and separation and/or limited dispersal might mediate the NAB composition and community structure in different water bodies. In the shallow-water Kueishantao hydrothermal vent environment, chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria were the primary NAB, indicating a unique nitrate-assimilating community in this extreme environment. In the coastal water of the East China Sea, the relative abundance of Alteromonas and Roseobacter-like nasA gene sequences responded closely to algal blooms, indicating that NAB may be active participants contributing to the bloom dynamics. Our statistical results suggested that salinity, temperature and nitrate may be some of the key environmental factors controlling the composition and dynamics of the marine NAB communities."
https://openalex.org/W2026960834,"Neuroplasticity in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is critical for behavioral adaptations associated with opioid reward and addiction. These processes may be influenced by cholinergic transmission arising from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), a main source of acetylcholine to mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons. To examine this possibility we asked if chronic systemic morphine administration affects expression of genes in ventral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray at the level of the LDTg using rtPCR. Specifically, we examined gene expression changes in the area of interest using Neurotransmitters and Receptors PCR array between chronic morphine and saline control groups. Analysis suggested that chronic morphine administration led to changes in expression of genes associated, in part, with cholinergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, using a quantitative immunofluorescent technique, we found that chronic morphine treatment produced a significant increase in immunolabeling of the cholinergic marker (vesicular acetylcholine transporter) in neurons of the LDTg. Finally, systemic administration of the nonselective and noncompetitive neuronal nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (0.5 or 2 mg/kg) dose-dependently blocked the expression, and to a lesser extent the development, of locomotor sensitization. The same treatment had no effect on acute morphine antinociception, antinociceptive tolerance or dependence to chronic morphine. Taken together, the results suggest that endogenous nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission selectively contributes to behavioral sensitization to morphine and this process may, in part, involve cholinergic neurons within the LDTg."

An episode of tSAH was confirmed in patients based on a CT scan or a lumbar puncture, and a follow-up examination was conducted at least six weeks after the brain trauma. A follow-up MRI examination was performed, using enhanced gradient echo T2 star-weighted angiography (ESWAN) to detect hemosiderin deposition on the cortical surface. The extent to which hemosiderin deposition was associated with several clinical factors was investigated. Various degrees of hemosiderin deposition were detected in 31 of 32 (96.9%) single-episode tSAH patients. Analysis of contingency tables revealed an association between the regions of subarachnoid bleeding based on CT images and the regions of hemosiderin deposition based on ESWAN images (χ2 = 17.73, P<0.05). SS-CNS was determined to be a common consequence after a single episode of tSAH. The extent of hemosiderin deposition is closely correlated with the initial bleeding sites and bleeding volume."

In the Sorbs, a Slavic population resident in Germany, the strongest effect on body mass index (BMI) was found for a variant in the third intron of FTO (rs17818902). Since this may indicate population specific effects of FTO variants, we initiated studies testing FTO for signatures of selection in vertebrate species and human populations.First, we analyzed the coding region of 35 vertebrate FTO orthologs with Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML, ω = dN/dS) to screen for signatures of selection among species. Second, we investigated human population (Europeans/CEU, Yoruba/YRI, Chinese/CHB, Japanese/JPT, Sorbs) SNP data for footprints of selection using DnaSP version 4.5 and the Haplotter/PhaseII. Finally, using ConSite we compared transcription factor (TF) binding sites at sequences harbouring FTO SNPs in intron three.PAML analyses revealed strong conservation in coding region of FTO (ω<1). Sliding-window results from population genetic analyses provided highly significant (p<0.001) signatures for balancing selection specifically in the third intron (e.g. Tajima's D in Sorbs = 2.77). We observed several alterations in TF binding sites, e.g. TCF3 binding site introduced by the rs17818902 minor allele.Population genetic analysis revealed signatures of balancing selection at the FTO locus with a prominent signal in intron three, a genomic region with strong association with BMI in the Sorbs.

https://openalex.org/W2084390179,"The proto-oncogene c-Myc plays critical roles in human malignancies including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), suggesting that the discovery of specific agents targeting c-Myc would be extremely valuable for CML treatment. Nitidine Chloride (NC), a natural bioactive alkaloid, is suggested to possess anti-tumor effects. However, the function of NC in leukemia and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been established. In this study, we found that NC induced erythroid differentiation, accompanied by increased expression of erythroid differentiation markers, e. g. α-, ε-, γ-globin, CD235a, CD71 and α-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) in CML cells. We also observed that NC induced apoptosis and upregulated cleaved caspase-3 and Parp-1 in K562 cells. These effects were associated with concomitant attenuation of c-Myc. Our study showed that NC treatment in CML cells enhanced phosphorylation of Thr58 residue and subsequently accelerated degradation of c-Myc. A specific group of miRNAs, which had been reported to be activated by c-Myc, mediated biological functions of c-Myc. We found that most of these miRNAs, especially miR-17 and miR-20a showed strong decrement after NC treatment or c-Myc interference. Furthermore, overexpression of c-Myc or miR-17/20a alleviated NC induced differentiation and apoptosis in K562 cells. More importantly, NC enhanced the effects of imatinib in K562 and primary CML cells. We further found that even imatinib resistant CML cell line (K562/G01) and CML primary cells exhibited high sensitivity to NC, which showed potential possibility to overcome imatinib resistance. Taken together, our results clearly suggested that NC promoted erythroid differentiation and apoptosis through c-Myc-miRNAs regulatory axis, providing potential possibility to overcome imatinib resistance."

A total of 120 patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis were treated with entecavir for 48 weeks. Serum HBV markers, total HBV DNA, and HBV cccDNA levels were measured at baseline and week 48. Biopsies from 20 patients were available for both intrahepatic total HBV DNA and cccDNA testing at these timepoints. HBV cccDNA levels were decreased from a median level of 5.1×106 copies/mL at baseline to a median level of 2.4×103 copies/mL at week 48. Reduction magnitudes of HBV cccDNA in patients with normalized alanine aminotransferase levels and those undergoing HBeAg seroconversion were significantly greater than those in alanine aminotransferase-abnormal and HBeAg positive patients. Intrahepatic HBV cccDNA was decreased significantly after 48 weeks of treatment, but could not be eradicated. In conclusion, treatment of HBeAg-positive hepatitis B patients with entecavir for 48 weeks decreased serum and intrahepatic HBV cccDNA significantly, and the magnitude of HBV cccDNA reduction was related to total HBV DNA decrease, alanine aminotransferase normalization, and HBeAg seroconversion."
https://openalex.org/W2034611773,"Pollen is a clinically important airborne allergen and one of the major causes of allergic conjunctivitis. A subpopulation of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are also known to have exacerbated skin eruptions on the face, especially around the eyelids, after contact with pollen. This pollen-induced skin reaction is now known as pollen dermatitis. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pluripotent cytokine that plays an essential role in allergic inflammation. Recent findings suggest that MIF is involved in several allergic disorders, including AD. In this study, MIF knockout (KO), MIF transgenic (Tg) and WT littermate mice were immunized with ragweed (RW) pollen or Japanese cedar (JC) pollen and challenged via eye drops. We observed that the numbers of conjunctiva- and eyelid-infiltrating eosinophils were significantly increased in RW and JC pollen-sensitized MIF Tg compared with WT mice or MIF KO mice. The mRNA expression levels of eotaxin, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 were increased in pollen-sensitized eyelid skin sites of MIF Tg mice. An in vitro analysis revealed that high eotaxin expression was induced in dermal fibroblasts by MIF combined with stimulation of IL-4 or IL-13. This eotaxin expression was inhibited by the treatment with CD74 siRNA in fibroblasts. These findings indicate that MIF can induce eosinophil accumulation in the conjunctiva and eyelid dermis exposed to pollen. Therefore, targeted inhibition of MIF might result as a new option to control pollen-induced allergic conjunctivitis and pollen dermatitis."

This transversion in exon 3 of ornithine transcarbamylase leads to normal levels of mRNA with low levels of mature protein and is homologous to a mutation that has also been described in a single patient affected with late-onset OTCD. With higher residual enzyme activity, spf-J were found to have normal plasma ammonia and orotate. Baseline plasma amino acid profiles were consistent with mild OTCD: elevated glutamine, and lower citrulline and arginine. In contrast to WT, spf-J displayed baseline elevations in cerebral amino acids with depletion following immune challenge with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. Our results indicate that the mild spf-J mutation constitutes a new mouse model that is suitable for mechanistic studies of mild OTCD and the exploration of cerebral pathophysiology during acute decompensation that characterizes proximal urea cycle dysfunction in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2081985482,"Although many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified to be associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), there was only a slight improvement in the ability to predict future MetS by the simply addition of SNPs to clinical risk markers. To improve the ability to predict future MetS, combinational effects, such as SNP—SNP interaction, SNP—environment interaction, and SNP—clinical parameter (SNP × CP) interaction should be also considered. We performed a case-control study to explore novel SNP × CP interactions as risk markers for MetS based on health check-up data of Japanese male employees. We selected 99 SNPs that were previously reported to be associated with MetS and components of MetS; subsequently, we genotyped these SNPs from 360 cases and 1983 control subjects. First, we performed logistic regression analyses to assess the association of each SNP with MetS. Of these SNPs, five SNPs were significantly associated with MetS (P < 0.05): LRP2 rs2544390, rs1800592 between UCP1 and TBC1D9, APOA5 rs662799, VWF rs7965413, and rs1411766 between MYO16 and IRS2. Furthermore, we performed multiple logistic regression analyses, including an SNP term, a CP term, and an SNP × CP interaction term for each CP and SNP that was significantly associated with MetS. We identified a novel SNP × CP interaction between rs7965413 and platelet count that was significantly associated with MetS [SNP term: odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, P = 0.004; SNP × CP interaction term: OR = 1.33, P = 0.001]. This association of the SNP × CP interaction with MetS remained nominally significant in multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustment for either the number of MetS components or MetS components excluding obesity. Our results reveal new insight into platelet count as a risk marker for MetS."

DNA replication is fundamental to the proliferation of all cells and, as such, has been the subject of intense scrutiny over many years. Although this work has demonstrated many unifying similarities among all eukaryotes with regard to DNA replication, it has also become obvious that there are a number of differences in the details regarding these systems. Significantly, one of the main model organisms for eukaryotic DNA replication, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has a closed mitosis that requires replication proteins to cross the nuclear envelope in a manner not required in other eukaryotes (1.Byers B. Goetsch L. Behavior of spindles and spindle plaques in cell-cycle and conjugation of Saccharomyces-cerevisiae.J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 511-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 7The abbreviations used are: MCMminichromosome maintenancehMCMhuman MCM. proteins are a good example of such proteins, and S. cerevisiae MCM proteins possess insertions to cater to this requirement (Table 1). The models used to study replication in Xenopus and Drosophila are egg-based and contain unusually high levels of (likely preassembled) replication complexes not normally seen in post-embryonic systems (2.Kim J.H.

Data from human tissue culture studies are based mainly on transformed cells, which probably do not accurately reflect the cell cycle controls in primary explants (3.Munkley J. Copeland N.A.

Thus, the use of recombinant components, which may more accurately reconstitute robust DNA helicase activity biochemically, is of significant interest in understanding human DNA replication processes.TABLE 1Comparison of S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens MCM amino acid insertionsMCMS. cerevisiae (aa)H. sapiens (aa)aa difference (S. cerevisiae − H. sapiens)Insertion locations2868904−36 (−4%)C3971808163 (20%)N, C493386370 (8%)N577573441 (6%)N61017821196 (24%)N, C7845719126 (18%)N Open table in a new tab minichromosome maintenance human MCM. The MCM complex is essential for DNA replication in eukaryotes and archaea, where it is believed to act as the replicative DNA helicase (reviewed in Ref. 4.Tye B.K. MCM proteins in DNA replication.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Homohexameric archaeal MCM complexes have provided useful models for studying DNA helicase activity (5.Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B.

The production of a number of crystal structures has facilitated mapping of key enzyme residues and provided insight into the molecular mechanisms utilized in DNA unwinding and translocation (7.Fletcher R.J.

In addition to its essential role in DNA replication, the heterohexameric eukaryotic MCM2–7 complex has been implicated in DNA damage responses, checkpoint signaling, transcription, and chromatin remodeling (9.Stead B.E.

Isolation of intact functional MCM heterohexamers has proved challenging. Functional MCM complexes purified from Xenopus egg extracts using a replication licensing factor assay demonstrated an additional requirement for Cdt1 in MCM chromatin loading (13.Chong J.P.

A Cdc45-MCM-GINS complex with DNA helicase activity has been isolated from Drosophila egg extracts (15.Moyer S.E. Lewis P.W. Botchan M.R. Isolation of the Cdc45/Mcm2–7/GINS (CMG) complex, a candidate for the eukaryotic DNA replication fork helicase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10236-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). MCM function is post-translationally modulated in vivo by phosphorylation, although this is not essential for replication elongation (16.Poh W.T. Chadha G.S. Gillespie P.J. Kaldis P. Blow J.J. Xenopus Cdc7 executes its essential function early in S phase and is counteracted by checkpoint-regulated protein phosphatase 1.Open Biol. 2014; 4: 130138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The presence of inhibitory phosphorylations might explain why some purified MCM complexes produced in eukaryotic expression systems do not demonstrate significant helicase activity. Current methods for MCM2–7 complex analysis rely on purification from yeast or insect cells, potentially complicating the interpretation of results, as the purified MCM2–7 complexes may have been post-translationally modified prior to purification. We report the development of a bacterial expression protocol that allows the production of a recombinant human MCM2–7 (hMCM) complex in Escherichia coli. Our hMCM complex exhibits DNA unwinding and ATP hydrolysis with a different salt sensitivity from that reported for the yeast complex (17.Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The MCM2–7 complex has in vitro helicase activity.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Structures of the protein obtained by EM methods show that hMCM forms an asymmetric hexameric complex that undergoes a conformational change in the presence of a forked DNA substrate that it is also capable of unwinding. The generation of recombinant hMCM represents the development of an important tool for understanding the mechanisms governing human DNA replication. This may ultimately improve our ability to manipulate cell proliferation and therefore design useful and specific cancer treatments. PCR-amplified MCM2–7 cDNAs (see primers in Table 2) were cloned into Ek/LIC Duet vectors (Novagen). pET32-MCM2/7, pRSF-MCM3/5, and pCDF-MCM4/6 were transformed into E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) cells (Novagen) and grown in a 75-liter fermenter. The hMCM complex was bound to HIS-Select cobalt affinity gel (Sigma) and passed over Superdex 200 gel filtration and Mono Q columns. Fractions containing MCM2–7 were pooled; dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 200 mm sodium glutamate, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF; flash-frozen in small aliquots; and stored at −80 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis of pET32-MCM2/7, pRSF-MCM3/5, and pCDF-MCM4/6 produced inactive point mutations in the Walker A motif for each hMCM subunit (MCM2(K529E), MCM3(K351E), MCM4(K516E), MCM5(K387E), MCM6(K402E), and MCM7(K387E)).

Reaction products were separated on Tris borate/EDTA-11% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (2 h, 80 V). Gels were dried, imaged, and quantified using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software. No-salt annealing buffer (200 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 5 mm EDTA) was added to 1 μm HF150 (150 bp) and 1 μm HR80 (80 bp) (Table 2). DNA was annealed at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by cooling at 0.02 °C/s to 23 °C. The temperature was kept at 23 °C for 1 min. hMCM (8 μg) was incubated with 60 nm duplex DNA in annealing buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 4 mm ATP) for 60 min at 37 °C to bind hMCM and duplex DNA. Samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. hMCM samples were applied to continuous carbon grids and stained with freshly made methylamine tungstate (pH 7). Data were collected on an FEI T12 microscope at a magnification of ×67,000 and an accelerating voltage of 120 kV, recorded on Kodak SO-163 films, and digitized using a Zeiss Photoscan densitometer (14-μm scanning step, corresponding to 2.5 Å/pixel) before analysis. Particle picking was carried out automatically using Boxer (EMAN suite (19.Tang G. Peng L. Baldwin P.R. Mann D.S. Jiang W. Rees I. Ludtke S.J.

Image analysis was performed with IMAGIC-5 (20.van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. A new generation of the IMAGIC image processing system.J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Images were normalized to the same S.D. and bandpass-filtered. The low-resolution cutoff was ∼100 Å to remove uneven background in particle images, and the high-resolution cutoff was ∼7 Å. Images were subjected to an alignment procedure, followed by statistical analysis. Alignment and classification of images were performed as described previously (20.van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. A new generation of the IMAGIC image processing system.J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar) and yielded classes representing characteristic views of the molecule. Primary structural analysis of hMCM and hMCM plus DNA complexes was performed using an ab initio approach in which the orientations of the best 10–15 image classes were determined by angular reconstitution using C1 startup. Three-dimensional maps were calculated using the exact filtered backprojection algorithm (20.van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. A new generation of the IMAGIC image processing system.J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Structural analysis was performed using several starting models with several different sets of image classes for ab initio reconstructions. The first reconstructions were used for the following rounds of alignment and classification of images. The structures of the complexes were refined by an iterative procedure with the number of classes gradually increased. The final reconstruction for hMCM alone was calculated from the best 100 classes containing ∼11 images each. For hMCM plus DNA, the final reconstruction was calculated from the best 155 classes containing ∼10 images each. Resolution of the map was assessed using the 0.5 threshold of Fourier shell correlation (21.van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Single-particle electron cryo-microscopy: towards atomic resolution.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), which corresponds to 23 Å. Domain fitting into the three-dimensional map of hMCM and hMCM plus DNA complexes was performed manually with UCSF Chimera (22.Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Ferrin T.E. Visualizing density maps with UCSF Chimera.J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Illustrations were generated using UCSF Chimera. Surface representations (unless stated otherwise) are displayed at a threshold level of 3σ (S.D. of densities within EM maps), which corresponds to ∼100% of the expected mass at a specific protein density of 0.84 kDa/Å3. To avoid potential activity-inhibiting phosphorylation by kinases present in eukaryotic expression systems, we coexpressed the hMCM2–7 proteins as a stable soluble complex in E. coli (Fig. 1A). The complex was purified according to the scheme outlined in Fig. 1B. The gel filtration elution profile for hMCM shows that the peak purified is at ∼600 kDa (Fig. 1C). The presence of all six hMCM subunits in the purified complex was demonstrated by Western blotting using specific antibodies (Fig. 1D). Consistent with our Western blot results, visualization of the complex using Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel revealed the presence of some degradation products (confirmed by MS analysis) in addition to all six full-length hMCM subunits (Fig. 1E). The MCM6 band is more intense than the bands of the other subunits in the Coomassie Blue gel (Fig. 1E), which could be due to differential staining based on protein composition or a slight excess of uncomplexed MCM6 being present in the soluble fraction after expression in E. coli. Typically, we produce 82.5 μg of hMCM/liter of E. coli culture. A complex harboring inactivating point mutations in the Walker A motifs of each hMCM subunit (MCM2(K529E), Mcm3(K351E), MCM4(K516E), MCM5(K387E), MCM6(K402E), and MCM7(K387E)) was produced in the same way. The purified WT hMCM complex and ATPase-deficient mutant complexes were tested for their ability to hydrolyze ATP in the presence and absence of a series of DNA substrates (at hMCM hexamer/DNA molar ratios ranging from 110:1 to 3.8:1) (Fig. 2A). hMCM exhibited ATP hydrolysis, which was not increased by the addition of DNA. High concentrations (46 nm) of closed circular dsDNA inhibited ATP hydrolysis by ∼50% compared with lower concentrations of dsDNA, possibly due to a substrate competition effect preventing the MCM proteins from forming a productive complex. A similar but smaller effect was observed for closed circular ssDNA. A forked DNA substrate had a negligible effect on hydrolysis activity at the concentrations tested. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis assays were carried out in the presence of 3.5 nm dsDNA. On the basis of previous reports of specific salt requirements for yeast MCM activity in vitro (17.Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The MCM2–7 complex has in vitro helicase activity.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of hMCM to hydrolyze ATP in the presence of sodium chloride, sodium glutamate, potassium chloride, and potassium glutamate (Fig. 2B). Increased sodium chloride concentrations resulted in a statistically significant decrease in ATP hydrolysis. A similar effect was observed for sodium glutamate. The addition of 50 mm potassium chloride resulted in a pronounced inhibition of ATPase activity. Strikingly, the presence of 300 mm potassium glutamate, twice the physiological salt concentration, had no effect on ATPase activity (Fig. 2B). As expected, increasing concentrations of hMCM resulted in increased ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2C). The addition of 20 mm EDTA significantly reduced ATP hydrolysis by hMCM, as did replacing the WT protein with the ATPase-deficient mutant complex (Fig. 2C), as expected from previous studies in S. cerevisiae (5.Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. A double-hexamer archaeal minichromosome maintenance protein is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Interactions between two catalytically distinct MCM subgroups are essential for coordinated ATP hydrolysis and DNA replication.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1093-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Using the optimum assay conditions identified (3.5 nm dsDNA, 300 mm potassium glutamate, and 176 nm hMCM), we measured the rate of ATP hydrolysis for WT and mutant hMCM (Fig. 2D). The maximum rate of ATP hydrolysis was 16.7 pmol of ADP released per min/pmol of WT hMCM compared with 3.9 pmol of ADP released per min/pmol of mutant hMCM. We tested our purified recombinant hMCM complexes for DNA helicase activity using a forked DNA substrate in the presence or absence of ATP. WT hMCM exhibited a protein concentration- and ATP-dependent DNA unwinding activity (Fig. 3). With WT hMCM, we observed 38 and 50% displacement by 176 m and 352 nm hMCM2–7, respectively (Fig. 3), broadly comparable with the reported 52% displacement by 110 nm yeast Mcm2–7 (17.Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The MCM2–7 complex has in vitro helicase activity.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which ATP could not be hydrolyzed, i.e. either WT hMCM in the absence of ATP or mutant hMCM in the presence of ATP, helicase activity was substantially reduced (Fig. 3B), consistent with ATP hydrolysis being required for helicase activity. The structures of the purified hMCM complex alone and bound to forked DNA were obtained by EM of negatively stained particles. Structures were obtained using a single-particle approach with C1 symmetry (Fig. 4). Our results reveal that the complex forms ring-shaped hexamers with a diameter of 145 Å and a height of 120 Å (Fig. 4C). Our asymmetric reconstructions (Fig. 4) clearly show that the complexes contain six subunits. However, the resolution does not allow us to identify the position of each subunit. When observed in the presence of forked DNA (Fig. 4C, lower row), the hMCM structure has a different conformation, with a more defined two-tiered hexameric shape and a more obviously open central cavity. The atomic model of the hexamer of Sulfolobus solfataricus MCM (Protein Data Bank ID 3F9V) fits neatly into our reconstruction (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5.The crystal structure of S. solfataricus MCM fits into our reconstructions.

This is consistent with reports of S. cerevisiae Mcm2–7, in which DNA did not stimulate ATP hydrolysis (23.Schwacha A. Bell S.P.

It is worth noting that this is in contrast to the Mcm4-Mcm6-Mcm7 subcomplex, which is stimulated by DNA (26.Biswas-Fiss E.E. Khopde S.M. Biswas S.B.

In agreement with observations from archaeal MCM proteins (5.Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. A double-hexamer archaeal minichromosome maintenance protein is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), high concentrations of dsDNA were in fact inhibitory. With respect to salt sensitivity, 50 mm potassium chloride strongly inhibited the ATPase activity of hMCM, whereas potassium glutamate, even at a concentration of 300 mm, had no such effect. These findings are consistent with results reported for the DNA helicase activity of S. cerevisiae MCM (17.Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The MCM2–7 complex has in vitro helicase activity.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Binding and hydrolysis of ATP by MCM purified from S. cerevisiae have recently been shown to be required for Cdt1 release and double-hexamer formation (28.Coster G. Frigola J. Beuron F. Morris E.P. Diffley J.F. Origin licensing requires ATP binding and hydrolysis by the MCM replicative helicase.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55: 666-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), with the ATPase sites of different MCM subunits implicated in different stages of MCM loading and activation (29.Kang S. Warner M.D. Bell S.P. Multiple functions for Mcm2–7 ATPase motifs during replication initiation.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The interface between subunits 2 and 5 of the S. cerevisiae Mcm2–7 complex is thought to function as an ATP-dependent “gate,” the opening of which enables the toroidal complex to be loaded onto topologically closed DNA (17.Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The MCM2–7 complex has in vitro helicase activity.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The recombinant hMCM complex produced here is an important tool to analyze the loading and activation of the human complex in light of this finding. Robust ATP-dependent DNA helicase activities were first demonstrated using archaeal homohexamers (5.Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. A double-hexamer archaeal minichromosome maintenance protein is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Limited DNA helicase activity was originally demonstrated for a hexameric complex purified from HeLa cells that contained hMCM subunits 4, 6, and 7, probably as a dimer of trimers (24.Ishimi Y. A DNA helicase activity is associated with an MCM4, -6, and -7 protein complex.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). This activity was inhibited by the addition of mouse MCM2 (30.Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. Biochemical function of mouse minichromosome maintenance 2 protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The salt-sensitive DNA helicase activity of a heterohexameric Mcm2–7 complex was first demonstrated using S. cerevisiae proteins purified after baculovirus expression (17.Bochman M.L. Schwacha A. The MCM2–7 complex has in vitro helicase activity.Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and DNA unwinding activity of higher eukaryotic MCM complexes has been observed with the Cdc45-MCM-GINS complex from Drosophila (15.Moyer S.E. Lewis P.W. Botchan M.R. Isolation of the Cdc45/Mcm2–7/GINS (CMG) complex, a candidate for the eukaryotic DNA replication fork helicase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10236-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Here, we described the first demonstration of helicase activity for the hMCM2–7 complex. Our results show that ATP hydrolysis is a requirement for DNA helicase activity. The negligible unwinding and ATPase activities in the mutant hMCM assays suggest that the mutant and WT protein preparations were both free from contaminating E. coli helicases/ATPases. Under ATPase null conditions (either no ATP or mutant hMCM), a large proportion of the helicase substrate migrated more slowly on native polyacrylamide gel. Similar mobility shift effects were observed previously for the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus MCM complex when samples were incubated on ice (6.Jenkinson E.R. Chong J.P. Minichromosome maintenance helicase activity is controlled by N- and C-terminal motifs and requires the ATPase domain helix-2 insert.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7613-7618Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests that the hMCM protein binds to the substrate in the absence of ATP (or ATP hydrolysis) but cannot unwind it. This is consistent with the idea that ATP hydrolysis is not required for DNA-protein interactions but is required for DNA unwinding (31.McGeoch A.T. Trakselis M.A. Laskey R.A. Bell S.D. Organization of the archaeal MCM complex on DNA and implications for the helicase mechanism.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Overall, these results indicate that the recombinant hMCM complex exhibits DNA helicase activity and that post-translational modifications to hMCM or accessory proteins such as Cdc45 and GINS are not required for the unwinding of naked DNA. The presence of Cdc45 and GINS may be required only for remodeling or unwinding DNA packaged into chromatin. The size and shape of our hMCM complex are consistent with the organization of oligomeric complexes reported for MCM from other eukaryotes (32.Costa A. Ilves I. Tamberg N. Petojevic T. Nogales E. Botchan M.R. Berger J.M. The structural basis for MCM2–7 helicase activation by GINS and Cdc45.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 33.Remus D. Beuron F. Tolun G. Griffith J.D. Morris E.P. Diffley J.F. Concerted loading of MCM2–7 double hexamers around DNA during DNA replication origin licensing.Cell. 2009; 139: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Analysis of a population of Drosophila Mcm2–7 complexes revealed that they exist in two different states: a planar notched ring and an open spiral shape (32.Costa A. Ilves I. Tamberg N. Petojevic T. Nogales E. Botchan M.R. Berger J.M. The structural basis for MCM2–7 helicase activation by GINS and Cdc45.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Reconstructions of Mcm2–7 from Encephalitozoon cuniculi suggest that this Mcm2–7 complex is naturally found in the open spiral shape (34.Lyubimov A.Y. Costa A. Bleichert F. Botchan M.R. Berger J.M. ATP-dependent conformational dynamics underlie the functional asymmetry of the replicative helicase from a minimalist eukaryote.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 11999-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our reconstruction of the human complex is more similar to the notched ring, similar to S. cerevisiae (35.Samel S.A. Fernández-Cid A. Sun J. Riera A. Tognetti S. Herrera M.C. Li H. Speck C. A unique DNA entry gate serves for regulated loading of the eukaryotic replicative helicase MCM2–7 onto DNA.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 1653-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but this does not preclude the existence of a minority of spiral-shaped complexes in our sample. Interestingly, the conformation taken by hMCM in the presence of DNA is somewhat similar to that which has been reported for S. cerevisiae Mcm2–7 in the absence of DNA (36.Evrin C. Clarke P. Zech J. Lurz R. Sun J. Uhle S. Li H. Stillman B. Speck C. A double-hexameric MCM2–7 complex is loaded onto origin DNA during licensing of eukaryotic DNA replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 20240-20245Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). One possible reason for the differences observed between the yeast and human proteins in the absence of DNA could be the differences in their primary sequences (outlined in Table 1). The prominent projection that appears on the C-terminal surface of one of the hMCM subunits in the presence of DNA (Fig. 4C, red circle) could be either the bound 45-bp double-stranded portion of the DNA substrate (as ssDNA is too small to be clearly visualized at this resolution) or a protein domain displaced by the presence of the DNA, such as a flexible C-terminal domain. Further work is required to determine which hMCM subunit binds DNA under these conditions. hMCM is an important factor in cell proliferation and therefore, by extension, cancer development. The ability to produce significant quantities of hMCM for analysis is an important step forward. Our biochemical findings show that the recombinant complex is active in vitro, and our structural studies show that its conformation is altered when bound to DNA. Our system enables the targeted manipulation of individual proteins within the hMCM complex, providing the potential to address in detail the important differences between individual subunits in the hMCM heterohexamer. It also provides the potential to develop screens for clinically relevant hMCM inhibitors. We thanks Christoph Baumann and Peter McGlynn for comments on the manuscript. cDNA clones of hMCM proteins and polyclonal antibody CS732 were gifts from J. Méndez (Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncológicas)."
https://openalex.org/W2073896734,"Background Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex disorder characterized by coexistence of several cardiometabolic (CM) factors, i.e. hyperlipidemia, obesity, high blood pressure and insulin resistance. The presence of MetS is strongly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The syndrome was originally defined as an adult disorder, but MetS has become increasingly recognized in children and adolescents. Methods Genetic variants influence biological components common to the CM factors that comprise MetS. We investigated single locus associations between six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), previously shown to modulate lipid or sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels, with MetS in a Turkish pediatric cohort (37 cases, 323 controls). Results Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between rs1799941, located in SHBG, and MetS (OR = 3.09, p-value = 0.006). The association with MetS remained after sequential adjustment for each CM factor included in the syndrome definition, indicating that the identified association is not being driven by any single trait. A relationship between rs1799941 and SHBG levels, was also discovered, but it was dependent on MetS status. In control subjects, the A allele of rs1799941 associated with a significant increase in SHBG levels (p = 0.012), while in cases there was no association between rs1799941 and SHBG levels (p = 0.963). Conclusions The significant association between rs1799941 and MetS in children is not contingent on any single CM trait. Additionally, the presence of MetS may abrogate effect of rs1799941 polymorphism on SHBG levels in children."
https://openalex.org/W2003711900,"Hainantoxin-IV (HNTX-IV) from the venom of the spider Selenocosmia hainana is a potent antagonist that specifically inhibits the tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) sodium channels. The toxin peptide consists of 35 amino acids and adopts a typical inhibitory cystine knot (ICK) motif. To obtain adequate HNTX-IV peptides for further insight into the structure-activity relationships of the toxin, a novel strategy including cloning, expression and purification was developed in an E. coli expression system. For this purpose, a seamless restriction-free (RF) cloning method was employed for the construction of an expression vector to avoid introducing unwanted sequences into the target gene. Furthermore, the solubility of recombinant HNTX-IV could be promoted efficiently by the combination of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag and a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) tag. Finally, an affinity-chromatography-free purification strategy was developed by cut-off dialysis tubing combined with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) extraction. Further HPLC purification yielded recombinant, tag-free HNTX-IV with high yield and purity. The molecular weight of recombinant HNTX-IV (rHNTX-IV) is identical to its theoretical value according to Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis. The recombinant toxin has similar activity (IC50 value of 120 nM) on the tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) sodium channels in adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to native toxins. In the report, an efficient and cost-effective strategy for producing rHNTX-IV was developed, which paved the way for the further study of structure-activity relationships of rHNTX-IV and its pharmaceutical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2050032178,"The number of animals required to represent the collective characteristics of a group remains a concern in animal movement monitoring with GPS. Monitoring a subset of animals from a group instead of all animals can reduce costs and labor; however, incomplete data may cause information losses and inaccuracy in subsequent data analyses. In cattle studies, little work has been conducted to determine the number of cattle within a group needed to be instrumented considering subsequent analyses. Two different groups of cattle (a mixed group of 24 beef cows and heifers, and another group of 8 beef cows) were monitored with GPS collars at 4 min intervals on intensively managed pastures and corn residue fields in 2011. The effects of subset group size on cattle movement characterization and spatial occupancy analysis were evaluated by comparing the results between subset groups and the entire group for a variety of summarization parameters. As expected, more animals yield better results for all parameters. Results show the average group travel speed and daily travel distances are overestimated as subset group size decreases, while the average group radius is underestimated. Accuracy of group centroid locations and group radii are improved linearly as subset group size increases. A kernel density estimation was performed to quantify the spatial occupancy by cattle via GPS location data. Results show animals among the group had high similarity of spatial occupancy. Decisions regarding choosing an appropriate subset group size for monitoring depend on the specific use of data for subsequent analysis: a small subset group may be adequate for identifying areas visited by cattle; larger subset group size (e.g. subset group containing more than 75% of animals) is recommended to achieve better accuracy of group movement characteristics and spatial occupancy for the use of correlating cattle locations with other environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W2098242790,"Aim The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of active warm-up duration on short-term maximal performance assessed during Ramadan in the afternoon. Methods Twelve healthy active men took part in the study. The experimental design consisted of four test sessions conducted at 5 p.m., before and during Ramadan, either with a 5-minute or a 15-minute warm-up. The warm-up consisted in pedaling at 50% of the power output obtained at the last stage of a submaximal multistage cycling test. During each session, the subjects performed two vertical jump tests (squat jump and counter movement jump) for measurement of vertical jump height followed by a 30-second Wingate test for measurement of peak and mean power. Oral temperature was recorded at rest and after warming-up. Moreover, ratings of perceived exertion were obtained immediately after the Wingate test. Results Oral temperature was higher before Ramadan than during Ramadan at rest, and was higher after the 15-minute warm-up than the 5-minute warm-up both before and during Ramadan. In addition, vertical jump heights were not significantly different between the two warm-up conditions before and during Ramadan, and were lower during Ramadan than before Ramadan after both warm-up conditions. Peak and mean power were not significantly different between the two warm-up durations before Ramadan, but were significantly higher after the 5-minute warm-up than the 15-minute warm-up during Ramadan. Moreover, peak and mean power were lower during Ramadan than before Ramadan after both warm-up conditions. Furthermore, ratings of perceived exertion were higher after the 15-minute warm-up than the 5-minute warm-up only during Ramadan. Conclusion The prolonged active warm-up has no effect on vertical jump height but impairs anaerobic power assessed during Ramadan in the afternoon."
https://openalex.org/W1977045700,"This study examined the separate influence and joint influences on event-based prospective memory task performance due to the valence of cues and the valence of contexts. We manipulated the valence of cues and contexts with pictures from the International Affective Picture System. The participants, undergraduate students, showed higher performance when neutral compared to valenced pictures were used for cueing prospective memory. In addition, neutral pictures were more effective as cues when they occurred in a valenced context than in the context of neutral pictures, but the effectiveness of valenced cues did not vary across contexts that differed in valence. The finding of an interaction between cue and context valence indicates that their respective influence on event-based prospective memory task performance cannot be understood in isolation from each other. Our findings are not consistent with by the prevailing view which holds that the scope of attention is broadened and narrowed, respectively, by positively and negatively valenced stimuli. Instead, our findings are more supportive of the recent proposal that the scope of attention is determined by the motivational intensity associated with valenced stimuli. Consistent with this proposal, we speculate that the motivational intensity associated with different retrieval cues determines the scope of attention, that contexts with different valence values determine participants’ task engagement, and that prospective memory task performance is determined jointly by attention scope and task engagement."
https://openalex.org/W1997183765,"CYP19A1 facilitates the bioconversion of estrogens from androgens. CYP19A1 intron single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may alter mRNA splicing, resulting in altered CYP19A1 activity, and potentially influencing disease susceptibility. Genetic studies of CYP19A1 SNPs have been well documented in populations of European ancestry; however, studies in populations of African ancestry are limited. In the present study, ten ‘candidate’ intronic SNPs in CYP19A1 from 125 African Americans (AA) and 277 European Americans (EA) were genotyped and their frequencies compared. Allele frequencies were also compared with HapMap and ASW 1000 Genomes populations. We observed significant differences in the minor allele frequencies between AA and EA in six of the ten SNPs including rs10459592 (p<0.0001), rs12908960 (p<0.0001), rs1902584 (p = 0.016), rs2470144 (p<0.0001), rs1961177 (p<0.0001), and rs6493497 (p = 0.003). While there were no significant differences in allele frequencies between EA and CEU in the HapMap population, a 1.2- to 19-fold difference in allele frequency for rs10459592 (p = 0.004), rs12908960 (p = 0.0006), rs1902584 (p<0.0001), rs2470144 (p = 0.0006), rs1961177 (p<0.0001), and rs6493497 (p = 0.0092) was observed between AA and the Yoruba (YRI) population. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and haplotype clusters that is unique to the EA population but not AA was also observed. In summary, we demonstrate that differences in the allele frequencies of CYP19A1 intron SNPs are not consistent between populations of African and European ancestry. Thus, investigations into whether CYP19A1 intron SNPs contribute to variations in cancer incidence, outcomes and pharmacological response seen in populations of different ancestry may prove beneficial."
