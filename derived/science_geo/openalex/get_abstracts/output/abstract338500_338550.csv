https://openalex.org/W2038015091,"Pulsed laser ablation of graphite targets combined with an intense, atomic nitrogen source has been used to prepare C-N thin film materials. The average nitrogen content in the films was systematically varied by controlling atomic nitrogen flux. Rutherford backscattering measurements show that up to 40 percent nitrogen can be incorporated on average into these solids under the present reaction conditions. Photoelectron spectroscopy further indicates that carbon and nitrogen form an unpolarized covalent bond in these C-N materials. Qualitative tests indicate that the C-N solids are thermally robust and hard. In addition, strong electron diffraction is observed from crystallites within the films. Notably, analysis of these diffraction data show that the only viable structure for the C-N crystallites is that of beta-C(3)N(4), a material predicted theoretically to exhibit superhardness. The experimental synthesis of this new C-N material offers exciting prospects for both basic research and engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W2008739268,"A quantitative analysis of a recent model of high-temperature superconductors based on an interlayer tunneling mechanism is presented. This model can account well for the observed magnitudes of the high transition temperatures in these materials and implies a gap that does not change sign, can be substantially anisotropic, and has the same symmetry as the crystal. The experimental consequences explored so far are consistent with the observations."
https://openalex.org/W1998115875,"The interaction in water of neutral hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surfaces, prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett deposition of surfactant monolayers, has been investigated. The attraction between these hydrophobic surfaces can be measured at separations of 70 to 90 nanometers and thus is of considerably greater range than previously found. Spontaneous cavitation occurred as soon as the fluorocarbon surfaces were brought into contact but occurred between the hydrocarbon surfaces only after separation from contact. The very long range forces measured are a consequence of the metastability of water films between macroscopic hydrophobic surfaces. Thus the hydrophobic interaction between macroscopic surfaces may not be related to water structure in the same way that the hydrophobic effect between nonpolar molecules is related to water structure."

It is one of fewer than a dozen vertebrates that are known to specialize on this widely distributed but well-defended food resource. The diet is taxonomically narrow and highly uniform geographically, includes sponges that are toxic to other vertebrates, and contains more silica than that of other vertebrates. By affecting space competition, spongivory by hawksbills may influence succession and diversity of reef communities."
https://openalex.org/W2076577280,"Fifty different mineral samples were tested as potential heterogeneous or epitaxial nucleants for four commonly crystallized proteins. It was found, by conventional protein crystallization techniques, that for each protein there was a set of mineral substrates that promoted nucleation of crystals at lower critical levels of supersaturation than required for spontaneous growth. Numerous examples, involving all four proteins, were observed of modification of crystal habit and, in some cases, unit cell properties promoted by the presence of the mineral nucleants. In at least one case, the growth of lysozyme on the mineral apophyllite, it was shown by lattice analysis and x-ray diffraction that the nucleation and growth of the protein crystal on the mineral was likely to involve a direct lattice match."
https://openalex.org/W2057688319,"Researchers have synthesized a compound, [beta]-C[sub 3]N[sub 4], whose properties correspond to those predicted from theory. The synthesis of this compound, which is carbon nitride in the [beta]-Si[sub 3]N[sub 4] structure, shows that theory can point the way toward the creation of materials with hardness comparable with or larger than that of diamond and that such a material has been correctly predicted. The theoretical approach is based upon the modern standard model of solids. One of the cornerstones of this approach is the ability to predict hardness from microscopic information. A semiempirical approach uses the formula B = N[sub c]/4 [times] (1972 - 220I)/d[sup 3.5], where B = bulk modulus, N[sub c] = coordination number, I = empirical ionicity parameter, and d = bond length in angstroms. This equation yields values of B that are in good agreement with experiment and rival costly first-principles calculations for accuracy. In synthesizing [beta]-C[sub 3]N[sub 4], the researchers examined the binding energy for C and N and determined that the C-N covalent bond is strong and similar to the C-C bond in diamond. These studies demonstrate that it is possible to use theory to design materials with predictable properties."
https://openalex.org/W2010686001,Fundamental studies of enzyme-solvent interactions can be conducted with supercritical fluids because small changes in pressure or temperature may bring about great changes in the properties of a single solvent near its critical point. Cholesterol oxidase is active in supercritical carbon dioxide and supercritical carbon dioxide-cosolvent mixtures. Variations in solvent power caused by pressure changes or by the addition of dopants affected the rate of enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol by altering the structure of cholesterol aggregates.
https://openalex.org/W2071560170,"Two large magnetic field rotations were recorded by the spacecraft Galileo 1 minute before and 2 minutes after its closest approach to the asteroid Gaspra. The timing and the geometry of the field changes suggest a connection with Gaspra, and the events can be interpreted as the result of the draping of the solar wind field around a magnetospheric obstacle. Gaspra's surface field is inferred to be within an order of magnitude of Earth's surface field, and its magnetic moment per unit mass is in the range observed for iron meteorites and highly magnetized chondrites. The location of the magnetic signatures suggests that perturbations are carried by waves in the magnetosonic-whistler mode with wavelengths between electron and ion gyro radii."
https://openalex.org/W2034570601,"An exceptionally low degree of melting of the upper mantle in the equatorial part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge is indicated by the chemical composition of mantle-derived mid-ocean ridge peridotites and basalts. These data imply that mantle temperatures below the equatorial Atlantic are at least approximately 150 degrees C cooler than those below the normal mid-Atlantic Ridge, suggesting that isotherms are depressed and the mantle is downwelling in the equatorial Atlantic. An equatorial minimum of the zero-age crustal elevation of the East Pacific Rise suggests a similar situation in the Pacific. If so, an oceanic upper mantle cold equatorial belt separates hotter mantle regimes and perhaps distinct chemical and isotopic domains in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Gravity data suggest the presence of high density material in the oceanic equatorial upper mantle, which is consistent with its inferred low temperature and undepleted composition. The equatorial distribution of cold, dense upper mantle may be ultimately an effect of the Earth's rotation."
https://openalex.org/W2035909577,"The exploration of high transition temperature copper-oxide-based superconductors has proceeded vigorously and internationally during the first year following the initial publication of the work of Bednorz and Müller. Progress in understanding the physics that underlies the phenomena has been slowed by difficulties resulting from the delicate and complex crystal chemistry of the material. Reports of superconducting behavior well above 100 kelvin have not been confirmed to date, although there is some suggestive evidence. A survey of the present state of the science and the possibilities for electronic and electrical power technologies is given."
https://openalex.org/W2013037995,"For historical archeology to be effective, research methods must be employed that ensure that both archeological and historical data be synthesized in a constructive manner. An example from Flowerdew Hundred, a Virginia plantation, illustrates such an approach. Collections from eighteen sites(1619 to 1720) were studied and dated by the inside bore diameters of pipestem fragments from clay smoking pipes. The sites grouped into three distinct categories, each with a different date. The latest group of sites (1680 to 1720) contained Colono ware, a slave produced pottery; none of the earlier sites did, although there were blacks at Flowerdew Hundred as early as 1619. On the basis of studies of probate data and other primary historical sources, it is suggested that this pattern of Colono ware occurrence is due to a change in the social and residential status of blacks during the century and that only when they lived separately from the masters did they make this type of pottery."
https://openalex.org/W2040969122,"Although magnetic data are the primary evidence for ocean floor spreading, the processes by which magnetic phases in ocean floor basalts are formed remain poorly constrained. Scanning transmission electron microscopic observations show that magnetic single-domain magnetite in sheeted dike basalts of Deep Sea Drilling Project hole 504B formed through oxidation-exsolution of ilmenite, exsolution of ulvöspinel lamellae, and recrystallization of end-member magnetite by interaction with convecting fluids. The data suggest that the sheeted dike basalts, with single-domain magnetite as an efficient and stable magnetic carrier, contribute significantly to sea-floor magnetism."
